5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} <b>aperture</b> radar (InSAR) is a radar {{technique used}} in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite synthetic <b>aperture</b> radar {{images of a}} geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic <b>Aperture</b> Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30cm <b>aperture,</b> Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is often not visible to telescopes of 40cm <b>aperture.</b>|$|E
5|$|An astronomical {{interferometer}} achieves high-resolution observations {{using the}} technique of <b>aperture</b> synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively small telescopes rather than a single very expensive monolithic telescope.|$|E
30|$|Multiple <b>apertures</b> {{located at}} {{different}} positions can provide space diversity. These multiple <b>apertures</b> {{can be either}} physical or synthetic. For airborne radar, typically for SAR, the synthetic <b>apertures</b> {{can be obtained by}} exploiting the motion of platform.|$|R
30|$|Correspondingly, {{only the}} array <b>apertures</b> that {{lie in the}} range {{direction}} are considered, and the cross-range array <b>apertures</b> are ignored. As such, both transmit and receive arrays {{are considered to be}} linear, and their <b>apertures</b> extend along the x-axis.|$|R
40|$|An energy filter for charged {{particles}} includes {{a stack of}} micro-machined wafers including plural <b>apertures</b> passing through the stack of wafers, focusing electrodes bounding charged particle paths through the <b>apertures,</b> an entrance orifice {{to each of the}} plural <b>apertures</b> and an exit orifice from each of the plural <b>apertures</b> and apparatus for biasing the focusing electrodes with an electrostatic potential corresponding to an energy pass band of the filter...|$|R
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal <b>aperture</b> (opening for the nose). Next to the <b>aperture</b> are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E

40|$|Strong {{and weak}} {{quadrupole}} <b>apertures</b> have been optimized and fabricated for relatively dense O. 12 ~im geometry’s. All of the <b>apertures</b> were optimized using PROLITH/ 2 simulation software. The <b>apertures</b> were fabricated as fused silica reticles that are inserted at the lens pupil plane. The <b>apertures</b> change the illumination profile that is {{collected by the}} condenser lens. Depth of focus (DOF) is increased using quadrupole illumination when trying to resolve specific pitch values...|$|R
40|$|Transmission through sub-wavelength <b>apertures</b> {{in perfect}} metals is {{expected}} to be strongly suppressed. However, by structural engineering of the <b>apertures,</b> we numerically demonstrate that the transmission of transverse electric waves through periodic arrays of subwavelength <b>apertures</b> in a thin metallic film can be significantly enhanced. Based on equivalent circuit theory analysis, periodic arrays of square structured subwavelength <b>apertures</b> are obtained with a 1900 -fold transmission enhancement factor when the side length a of the <b>apertures</b> is 10 times smaller than the wavelength (a/λ= 0. 1). By examining the induced surface currents and investigating the influence of the lattice constant and the incident angle to the resonant frequency, we show that the enhancement is due to the excitation of the strong localized resonant modes of the structured <b>apertures.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

5|$|Different studies {{generally}} find varying {{values for}} elemental abundances. This is often because spectrographs attached to telescopes do not collect all {{the light from}} objects being observed, instead gathering light from a slit or small <b>aperture.</b> Therefore, different observations may sample {{different parts of the}} nebula.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 a new curricular {{adjustment}} was made, {{with the}} objective to fulfill all the quality accreditation requirements. In 2001 the coverage was increased by the <b>aperture</b> of the programs each semester {{and the creation of}} nocturnal courses. The same year, the research system was implemented and the Publishing House was reopened.|$|E

30|$|Microstructural {{examinations}} {{showed that}} most cracks were open grain boundaries. In reality, a crack {{is composed of}} many segments with different <b>apertures.</b> If crack segments have a similar length, segments with small <b>apertures</b> are closed at low pressures to greatly reduce conductivity, while those with wide <b>apertures</b> are open even at high pressures. The latter must form an interconnected fluid path to maintain the electrical conduction through fluid. A power law distribution of <b>apertures</b> will cause a steep decrease in conductivity at low pressures.|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{architectural}} features incorporated throughout the castle included: corbelled battlemented wallheads on the towers; turrets set above {{first or second}} storey level; a large elongated <b>aperture</b> provided light in the first floor hall; and shot holes in the southwest tower. The fenestrations on the wing added in the late 18th century differed from those used in earlier parts of the structure, being larger and more regular in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Species {{recognition}} {{is based on}} combinations of minor structural variations in the shape, <b>aperture,</b> whorl contour, umbilical region, and color pattern. It {{appears to be the}} case that many species have a stable color pattern, while other species seem to vary tremendously. Adequate unselected field samples will enable {{a better understanding of the}} relative stability or variability of particular species in single localities.|$|E
5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida stone crab. Crabs can crush the snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they can close the <b>aperture</b> using the operculum.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} which computes transient electromagnetic {{responses of}} narrow <b>apertures</b> in complex conducting scatterers was implemented {{as an extension}} of previously developed Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) computer codes. Although these <b>apertures</b> are narrow with respect to the wavelengths contained within the power spectrum of excitation, this technique does not require significantly more computer resources to attain the increased resolution at the <b>apertures.</b> In the report, an analytical technique which utilizes Babinet's principle to model the <b>apertures</b> is developed, and an FDTD computer code which utilizes this technique is described...|$|R
50|$|Extremely wide <b>apertures</b> (such as f/1.2 or f/1.4) {{are more}} rarely used, because at these <b>apertures</b> {{the depth of}} field is very shallow, which makes {{focusing}} more difficult and slows down autofocus. The main distinction is between outdoor sports and indoor sports - in outdoor sports the distances are greater and the light brighter, while in indoor sports the distances are lesser and the light dimmer. Accordingly, outdoor sports tend to have longer focal length long focus lenses with slower <b>apertures,</b> while indoor sports tend to have shorter lenses with faster <b>apertures.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{camera on}} the , also known as an iSight camera, can take 8-megapixel photos (3,264 by 2,448pixels) and record 1080p videos at up to 30frames per second with {{upgraded}} quality (30% better clarity, 26% better white balance, color accuracy) due to an additional lens, IR filter, a wider f/2.4 <b>aperture,</b> and Image signal processor (built-in A5).|$|E
5|$|The moons of Haumea are too faint {{to detect}} with telescopes smaller than about 2 metres in <b>aperture,</b> though Haumea itself has a visual {{magnitude}} of 17.5, {{making it the}} third-brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto and Makemake, and easily observable with a large amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|The only {{physical}} {{controls on}} the lens are the AF/MF toggle switch and the two rings, controlling the zoom and focus. The lens does not have image stabilization. This is common for wide-angle photography which can be performed well using hand-held techniques. Over the range of focal lengths, the minimum and maximum <b>aperture</b> vary.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is conducted of images which are formed by aberration free optical systems with annular <b>apertures</b> {{in the whole}} range of central obstructions ratios approaching 1. 0. It was found that annular <b>apertures</b> form central and surrounding ring groups. The energy fractions in the central and surrounding ring groups do not decrease with increasing obstruction ratio, but remain constant for all obstruction ratios and for all fractional energy levels. Images formed by unobstructed <b>apertures</b> are quantitatively superior because they are smaller than those formed by annular <b>apertures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although many {{reflector}} antennas possess circular projected <b>apertures,</b> {{there are}} recent satellite and ground antenna applications {{for which it}} is desirable to employ reflectors with elliptical <b>apertures.</b> Here a modification of the Jacobi-Bessel expansion is presented for the diffraction analysis of reflectors with elliptical <b>apertures.</b> A comparative study is also performed between this modified Jacobi-Bessel algorithm and the one which uses the Jacobi-Bessel expansion over a circumscribing circular region. Numerical results are presented for offset reflectors with elliptical and circular <b>apertures</b> and the improved convergence properties of the modified algorithm are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|In prior work we {{introduced}} {{a method of}} choosing mesh parameters for a single wave-optics propagation between two effective <b>apertures.</b> Unfortunately, most systems that require wave-optics modeling, like modeling laser resonators with gain media, propagations through the atmosphere, and imaging systems with internal limiting <b>apertures,</b> have multiple <b>apertures</b> and phase screens that induce diffraction. We begin here by augmenting the single propagation theory to include diffraction from both <b>apertures</b> and phase aberrations. We then introduce a technique for analyzing complex systems of simple optics to determine the appropriate wave-optics mesh parameters...|$|R
25|$|Apertures {{are either}} a fixed <b>aperture</b> within the column, {{such as at}} the {{condenser}} lens, or are a movable <b>aperture,</b> which can be inserted or withdrawn from the beam path, or moved in the plane perpendicular to the beam path. <b>Aperture</b> assemblies are mechanical devices which allow for the selection of different <b>aperture</b> sizes, which may {{be used by the}} operator to trade off intensity and the filtering effect of the <b>aperture.</b> <b>Aperture</b> assemblies are often equipped with micrometers to move the <b>aperture,</b> required during optical calibration.|$|E
25|$|Most SLR cameras provide {{automatic}} <b>aperture</b> control, {{which allows}} viewing and metering at the lens's maximum <b>aperture,</b> but stops the lens {{down to the}} working <b>aperture</b> during exposure, and returns the lens to maximum <b>aperture</b> afterward.|$|E
25|$|Zoom lenses {{typically}} have a maximum relative <b>aperture</b> (minimum f-number) of 2.8 to 6.3 through their range. High-end lenses {{will have a}} constant <b>aperture,</b> such as 2.8 or 4, {{which means that the}} relative <b>aperture</b> will stay the same throughout the zoom range. A more typical consumer zoom will have a variable maximum relative <b>aperture</b> since it is harder and more expensive to keep the maximum relative <b>aperture</b> proportional to the focal length at long focal lengths; 3.5 to 5.6 {{is an example of a}} common variable <b>aperture</b> range in a consumer zoom lens.|$|E
