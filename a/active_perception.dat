This work extends our previous studies on sensorimotor control strategies for <b>active</b> tactile <b>perception</b> in robotics. First, we present the <b>active</b> Bayesian <b>perception</b> method to actively reposition a robot to accumulate evidence from better locations to reduce uncertainty. Second, we describe the adaptive perception method that, based on a forward model and a predicted information gain approach, allows to the robot to analyse ‘what would have happened’ if a different decision ‘would have been made’ at previous decision time. This approach permits to adapt the <b>active</b> Bayesian <b>perception</b> process to improve the performance in accuracy and reaction time of an exploration task. Our methods are validated with a contour following exploratory procedure with a touch sensor.

50|$|Active {{attention}} {{is part of}} the broader theory of ecological perception, although it is a bit older. It was developed by the gestalt psychologists in the 1930s, and refined by Gibson in the 1960s and 1970s. The theory has never died, although for the approximately 80 years that it has been around, it has somehow always been considered a niche area of psychology.

50|$|One of the {{implications}} of the efficient coding hypothesis is that the neural coding depends upon the statistics of the sensory signals. These statistics are a function of not only the environment (e.g., the statistics of the natural environment), but also the organism's behavior (e.g., how it moves within that environment). However, perception and behavior are closely intertwined in the perception-action cycle. For example, the process of vision involves various kinds of eye movements. An extension to the efficient coding hypothesis called active efficient coding (AEC) extends efficient coding to <b>active</b> <b>perception.</b> It hypothesizes that biological agents optimize not only their neural coding, but also their behavior to contribute to an efficient sensory representation of the environment. Along these lines, models for the development of active binocular vision and active visual tracking have been proposed.|$|E

40|$|In <b>active</b> <b>perception</b> tasks, {{an agent}} aims to select sensory actions that reduce its {{uncertainty}} about {{one or more}} hidden variables. For example, a mobile robot takes sensory actions to efficiently navigate in a new environment. While partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural model for such problems, reward functions that directly penalize uncertainty in the agent’s belief can remove the piecewise-linear and convex (PWLC) property of the value function required by most POMDP planners. Furthermore, {{as the number of}} sensors available to the agent grows, the computational cost of POMDP planning grows exponentially with it, making POMDP planning infeasible with traditional methods. 		 In this article, we address a twofold challenge of modeling and planning for <b>active</b> <b>perception</b> tasks. We analyze ρ POMDP and POMDP-IR, two frameworks for modeling <b>active</b> <b>perception</b> tasks, that restore the PWLC property of the value function. We show the mathematical equivalence of these two frameworks by showing that given a ρ POMDP along with a policy, they can be reduced to a POMDP-IR and an equivalent policy (and vice-versa). We prove that the value function for the given ρ POMDP (and the given policy) and the reduced POMDP-IR (and the reduced policy) is the same. To efficiently plan for <b>active</b> <b>perception</b> tasks, we identify and exploit the independence properties of POMDP-IR to reduce the computational cost of solving POMDP-IR (and ρ POMDP). We propose greedy pointbased value iteration (PBVI), a new POMDP planning method that uses greedy maximization to greatly improve scalability in the action space of an <b>active</b> <b>perception</b> POMDP. Furthermore, we show that, under certain conditions, including submodularity, the value function computed using greedy PBVI is guaranteed to have bounded error with respect to the optimal value function. We establish the conditions under which the value function of an <b>active</b> <b>perception</b> POMDP is guaranteed to be submodular. Finally, we present a detailed empirical analysis on a dataset collected from a multicamera tracking system employed in a shopping mall. Our method achieves similar performance to existing methods but {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost leading to better scalability for solving <b>active</b> <b>perception</b> tasks. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) and {{fibromyalgia syndrome}} (FMS) are common conditions with some AND AIM: similarities, but different perceptual responses to somatic and visceral stimuli. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess in a large group of IBS patients the somatic perception by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and its relation to the level of severity and presence of FMS. METHODS: In 99 patients grouped by the validated functional bowel disorder severity index (FBDSI) in mild, moderate, and severe IBS and in 33 healthy controls (HC), we studied discomfort thresholds and perception of somatic stimuli at control (hands and elbows) and active (trapezius) sites by TENS and by using a specific questionnaire. RESULTS: The use of TENS showed that IBS showed significant higher thresholds and lower perception cumulative score compared to HC. The severity of IBS is significantly associated with age and mean control site values for discomfort and borderline associated with gender in the ordinal model constructed for the ascending series protocol. The severity of IBS is also significantly associated with the <b>active</b> cumulative <b>perception</b> score in the long stimulus protocol. Due to limited sample size of IBS men with FMS, analyses of discomfort thresholds and cumulative perception score by FMS were done only for women. IBS women without FMS had significantly higher mean control site values for discomfort and significantly lower <b>active</b> cumulative <b>perception</b> score than HC. IBS women with FMS had significantly lower mean active site values for discomfort thresholds than IBS women without FMS (Dunn’s test p < 0. 05).
