5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with {{creating}} a CD-ROM add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM), and sell for about JP¥20,000 (or US$150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature hardware scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games, which required the use of a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than expected price. Because the Genesis' Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest technical challenges during development since the Genesis' <b>access</b> <b>speed</b> was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop a CD player under the CD+G standard, to develop the Sega CD.|$|E

Like flash drives, hard disks also suffer from file fragmentation, which can reduce <b>access</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

500|$|With {{the shift}} from the SNES to the next {{generation}} consoles, Final Fantasy VII became the first project in the series to use 3D computer graphics. Developers initially considered overlaying 2D sprites on 3D backgrounds, but decided to forgo pixel art entirely in favor of polygonal models. Aside from the story, Final Fantasy VI had many details undecided when development began, with many things filled out along the way. In contrast, with Final Fantasy VII, the developers knew from the outset {{it was going to be}} [...] "a real 3D game", so from the earliest planning stage detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place. The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower <b>access</b> <b>speed,</b> delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue. Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored. When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in Alone in the Dark. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles. To move to the 3D graphics development paradigm, which many among the team had never seen before, the team purchased Silicon Graphics Onyx supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, PowerAnimator, and N-World (then retailing for [...] ), for an estimated total of $21 million.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Moore's Law {{states that}} {{processor}} speeds double every 18 months. Memory density is increasing {{at a similar}} rate, but memory speeds increase at the much slower rate of about 7 % per year [1]. This means that {{the time needed to}} access memory is an increasing bottleneck. To help overcome this mismatch in speed, computer architecture designers take advantage of the fact that smaller memories placed close to the processor are signi cantly faster than main memory [2]. Small, fast memories between the processor and main memory are called caches. Caches contain a subset of the data in main memory. If a signi cant portion of the data the processor requires is found in the cache, the processor is relieved from waiting for slower main memory. Cache <b>access</b> <b>speeds</b> are about 1 ns and main memory <b>access</b> <b>speeds</b> are about 100 ns [1]. When the contents of an accessed memory location are in the cache, it is termed a hit. When the contents are not in the cache it is termed a miss. Large c...|$|R
