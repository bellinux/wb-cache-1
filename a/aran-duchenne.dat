Contemporary neurologist Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne [...] also {{claimed to have}} described the condition 1 year earlier, although the written report was never found. The condition has been called progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), <b>Aran-Duchenne</b> disease, Duchenne-Aran disease, <b>Aran-Duchenne</b> muscular atrophy, and Duchenne-Aran muscular atrophy. The name [...] "spinal muscular atrophy" [...] is ambiguous as it refers to any of various spinal muscular atrophies, including the autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene.|$|E

Bilateral and/or hereditary forms of NA have been also reported. We discuss {{the case of a}} 35 -year-old woman with ten-year-history of bilateral recurrent NA. Initially she presented shoulder pain followed by prominent weakness and wasting of shoulder girdle musculature, with asymmetric and asynchronous pattern. Some years later she developed left <b>Aran-Duchenne</b> muscular atrophy. When she came to our attention she complained pain and weakness at lower limbs. Neurophysiologic studies excluded brachial and lumbosacral plexopathy. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed pleocytosis (15 elements/mm 3) and hyperproteinorrhachia (7. 0 g/l). Neurotropic virus were negative in both serum and CSF. Spinal cord MRI showed abnormal intramedullary hyperintensity of anterior horn on T 2 -weighted at dorsal tract and contrast-enhancement of the cauda equine roots. Pain and weakness were partially relieved by steroid pulse endovenous therapy. In our patient menigomyeloradiculitis of unknown origin mimicked recurrent bilateral neuralgic amyotrophy involving both upper and lower limbs. Finally, we suggest to perform CSF examination and spinal cord MRI in all cases of NA with atypical course...|$|E
