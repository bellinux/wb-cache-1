5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} controversy of Sanford's presidency was {{his effort to}} establish the presidential library of former US President Richard Nixon at Duke. Sanford raised the subject with Nixon {{during a visit to}} the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981. Sanford continued to seek Nixon's advice on multiple issues within the months that followed. The library proposal became public in mid-August, creating considerable controversy at the university. Though Sanford enjoyed some support for his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke <b>Academic</b> <b>Council</b> of a library only a third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and site his library in the city of his birth, Yorba Linda, California, instead; it was dedicated there in 1990.|$|E

500|$|While {{most of the}} {{university}} community is against {{the actions of the}} radical movements, this has not prevented the stigmatization of the student body by the general population. This attitude has led to the belief that the guerrilla and subversive groups that operate in Colombia have clandestine operatives inside {{the university}}, a belief that has been supported by the discovery of unconventional weaponry inside the university grounds. [...] This has resulted in the targeting of student activists by criminal and paramilitary groups. [...] On October 4, 2006, a student of Technology of Prehospital Attention and representative at the <b>Academic</b> <b>Council,</b> Julian Andrés Hurtado, was killed by hitmen. [...] In his honor, the Government of Valle del Cauca and the Institute for the Development of Valle del Cauca ( [...] , INFIVALLE) established a scholarship program that bears his name. [...] Another situation that reflects the stigmatization of the student body is the unfounded arrests of students during the disturbances, such as those that occurred on April 3, 2008, when four students were captured without substantial evidence, and eventually released when it was demonstrated that they were not even near the confrontation site {{at the time of the}} disturbances.|$|E
