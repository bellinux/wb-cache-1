5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
25|$|Kilmer {{was married}} to actress Joanne Whalley from March 1988 to February 1996. The two met while working {{together}} on the film Willow. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mercedes (b. October 29, 1991), and a son, Jack (b. June 6, 1995). Warwick Davis, Kilmer's co-star from the 1988 fantasy Willow, in his audio commentary for the film said that the question he is most asked is {{what it was like}} working with Kilmer. Though Kilmer has a reputation of being difficult, Davis describes him as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> man and a hard working, dedicated actor. Kilmer reunited with Davis in the 2013 Easter special of the sitcom Life's Too Short, in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself as a mooching, arrogant eccentric.|$|E
500|$|Weird Al {{also got}} me. He made a video, did a fake {{interview}} with me, spliced it with clips from my old interviews, {{and put it}} up on the Internet. He's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> motherfucker. When something like that happens, you have to sit back and say, [...] "Oh, he got me." [...] It's something you pick up from battles: you learn to be a good sport about a lot of stuff. If you want to dish it out, you've {{got to be able to}} take it.|$|E

Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, {{said the}} episode featured strong physical comedy, political satire, romantic tension and character moments. He said he [...] "loved virtually every {{beat of the}} possum story" [...] and finds the developing Andy and April relationship funny and believable. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said [...] "The Possum" [...] was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode, and particularly praised {{the development of the}} Andy and April relationship. She said Plaza and Pratt did some of their best work to date in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Bright {{commented that}} Shields' {{performance}} was [...] "a little into silly land" [...] at first, but it [...] "eventually turned in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> performance." [...] Shields commented {{that when she}} was asked to appear on the show, she [...] "said yes basically sight unseen. I don't know where I was on the list. Maybe everybody else said no." [...] The writers had difficulty devising jokes that would be funny when Van Damme said them. In order to create [...] "Van Damme-proof" [...] jokes, one writer [...] "would say them in a really horrible French accent, putting the emphasis on the wrong word". If people laughed, Van Damme was given the joke to perform. One line created in this way was Van Damme's [...] "I can crack a walnut with my butt." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Tennis the Menace" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel listed it at number nine on his 2004 {{list of the}} show's [...] "Top 10 Sporting Episodes". Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her 2003 review that {{the plot of the}} episode [...] "allowed us to see more secondary characters than usual. It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don't get in recent seasons. Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps written all over it, the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves. Homer had some wonderful lines, too, such as, 'Take your hands off me. [...] They feel like salad tongs.' [...] Overall, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode." [...] In July 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Agassi's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show.|$|E

5000|$|Alan Sepinwall {{stated in}} his review [...] "every now and then the show will give us <b>a</b> wholly satisfying, <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode with the three groups in isolation. [...] "Earthquake" [...] {{was one of those}} episodes" [...] he also called the show [...] "simple, effective, <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> outing." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well received. The song [...] "You're Checkin' In" [...] won a 1998 Primetime Emmy Award for [...] "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics", and an Annie Award for [...] "Outstanding Music in an Animated Television Production" [...] {{in the same}} year. In honor of The Simpsons 300th episode {{milestone}} in 2003, Entertainment Weekly ranked the episode at number 13 {{on the list of}} their 25 favorite episodes, and AskMen.com ranked the episode at number seven on their top ten; in both cases it was the second-most-recent installment chosen to co-inhabit the lists. IGN named the episode the best of the ninth season, claiming [...] "this is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode that started season nine off on a strong note". Since the release of the season nine DVD box set, the episode has been highlighted by newspaper reviewers to show excellence of the season.|$|E
500|$|... "Road Trip" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{said the}} episode {{was a good}} payoff to the romance between Leslie and Ben all season, a story arc he initially had problems with. Sepinwall also called the Ron Swanson subplot [...] "simply fantastic in both concept and execution". Scott Meslow of The Atlantic called [...] "Road Trip" [...] <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode and strong pay-off to the romance between Leslie and Ben that had been building all season. Joel Keller of TV Squad said the Know Ya Boo story felt simply like an excuse to include Andy and April in the show, but that Ron's subplot with the little girl was [...] "classic Ron Swanson". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the plot felt [...] "admittedly, a little more sitcom-y than I like" [...] but was very funny and progressed the Leslie and Ben story arc without letting the show [...] "jump the shark".|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said Ice-T [...] "takes rap's art-ain't-life defense over the top" [...] on a heavy metal album which utilizes and parodies [...] "the style's whiteskin privilege". He {{wrote that the}} music is [...] "flat-out hard rock, short on soloistic intricacy and fancy structures", {{but that it is}} set apart from other metal by Ice-T, who [...] "describes racism in language metalheads can understand, kills several policemen, and cuts his mama into little pieces because she tells him to hate white people. This can be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> record." [...] Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, felt the lyrics on some songs are pathologically flawed and off-putting, but the band's take on metal styles is impressive and, [...] "on the stereotype-bashing 'There Goes the Neighborhood,' the humor, message and music coalesce brilliantly". Don Kaye of Kerrang! called Body Count a [...] "noisy, relentless musical attack".|$|E
5000|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} William Grimes {{described the}} novel as <b>an</b> [...] "improbable, <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> tale." [...] "Salazar," [...] Grimes wrote, [...] "has a sly, sardonic {{sense of humor and}} a gift for understatement." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{second season}} of The Office was {{released}} largely to critical acclaim and commercial success. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk {{wrote that the}} British version [...] "can't hold a candle to the American" [...] version during this season, due to the show coming [...] "into its own, becoming the best half-hour show on TV." [...] Furthermore, Rizzo wrote that the season was filled with [...] "fantastically real characters" [...] as well as [...] "one of the best-handled romances in TV history". Eric Goldman of IGN noted that season two transformed The Office [...] "from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> show into a truly brilliant show". Goldman praised the world-building of the season, writing that it [...] "does a wonderful job of developing {{the rest of the}} staff of Dunder-Mifflin , something the UK version could never do to this extent". He ultimately gave it a ten out of ten score. Josh Wolk, an Entertainment Weekly television critic, said that the show has [...] "perfecting workaday moments so hilariously and relatably awkward that it makes viewers both laugh and cringe".|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} the most-watched Fox program on its airdate among adults 18 to 49; 5.75 million viewers watched. In {{his review of}} the Family Guy volume 3 DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote [...] "But if any moment stands out among this run, it's the {{supermarket}} scene in [...] "Breaking Out is Hard to Do." [...] When Chris is pulled into the [...] "Take On Me" [...] video by a-ha, it's a perfect blend of what this show does best, combining nonsense, the '80s and some neat animation. The lead-in, the punchline and {{the execution of the}} whole scene is handled so well that it might be one of the show's most memorable ever." [...] In her review of the episode, Kim Voynar of TV Squad wrote [...] "This was, overall, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode. Lots of funny references—the Trix Rabbit, Karl Malden, MASH, Star Wars, [...] "Three's Company" [...] The funniest moment for me, was the bit with Stewie walking in on Brian cross-dressing. That alone was worth the price of admission." ...|$|E
500|$|Others media {{publications}} {{were more}} critical of the show. Television critic Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Stewart was more [...] "amusing than funny". He added, [...] "Many of his jokes fell flat with {{the stars in the}} Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post commented, [...] "It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by." [...] Moreover, he derided the [...] "piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past" [...] writing that it [...] "squandered the visual luster" [...] of the ceremony. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, [...] "Stewart, usually <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar." [...] He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it [...] "distracting and obnoxious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The solemn one at Tours, who {{squirted}} seltzer-water out {{of window}} at the beggars, without <b>a</b> smile, was <b>very</b> <b>funny.</b> So was the little one with grubby hands, who tottered under the big dishes, but insisted on carrying the heaviest.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{found it}} to be [...] "as {{conventional}} and corny as warmed-over [...] "Young at Heart" [...] [...] [...] <b>a</b> pleasant film, <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> at times [...] [...] [...] Patty Duke, as Natalie, supplies a wonderful performance." ...|$|R
2500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today {{said that}} [...] "underlying the carnage in Zombieland is a sweetly beating heart", and that [...] "This road movie/horror flick/dark comedy/earnest romance/action film hybrid laces a gentle drollness {{through all the}} bloody mayhem". Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum concluded, [...] "At the bone, Zombieland is <b>a</b> polished, <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> road picture shaped by wisenheimer cable-TV {{sensibilities}} and starring four likable actors, each with an influential following".|$|R
500|$|... "The Bubble" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow {{called the}} episode [...] "a {{fine example of}} Parks and Recreation at its funniest" [...] and along with [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] served as an [...] "ideal capper to a remarkably strong third season of the series". Meslow added that Ron's intervention {{on behalf of his}} co-workers demonstrates he is a [...] "much better manager than he lets on". Henry Hanks of CNN called it <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode and said scenes of Ron swiveling around his circular desk to avoid talking to members of the public were [...] "masterfully executed". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said he enjoyed Marlene's attempts to seduce Ben, and especially loved the subplot with Chris making changes to the parks department. He praised Nick Offerman's [...] "marvelously minimalist" [...] performance, especially while trying to avoid people in his swivel desk. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was hilarious and demonstrated [...] "how marvelously great this series is at creating a truly lovable ensemble". He also praised the subplot with Pamela Reed and the [...] "ridiculous filthiness" [...] of the fourth floor.|$|E
500|$|Initially titled [...] "The Clone Wars", the episode's {{title was}} later changed to [...] "Attack of Mark's Clone". Series {{developer}} David M. Stern wrote the episode with Adam Stein, and Richard Ferguson-Hull and series creator Devin Clark directed it. Stein and Mick Kelly served as staff writers. In {{an interview with}} Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO, Clark spoke of the episode and proclaimed {{that it was a}} [...] "really fun opportunity" [...] to see what Mark's clone would be like, calling him an [...] "Agro-Mark". He said that Matt Oberg, the voice of Mark, voiced the clone as a [...] "much more gruff individual". Clark elaborated, [...] "It's really funny. It's like seeing Mark, since we kind of play him so neutered most of the time, it's like seeing him as like this jerk, it's hilarious, it's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> story." [...] Executive producer Daniel Powell said that Clone Mark [...] "glove slaps everyone [...] a cigarette instead of putting it out before the office". [...] "Attack of Mark's Clone" [...] was the eighth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes and Mike O'Gorman. Comedians Kate McKinnon and Jay Oakerson guest starred in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. IGN, in an advanced {{review of the}} episode, awarded [...] "Sally" [...] an [...] "amazing" [...] 9.2 out of 10 rating and called the series [...] "The funniest show you haven't seen yet." [...] The review noted that, [...] "Flight of the Conchords deserves the buzz it is slowly building. This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> show." [...] Blogcritics reviewer Daniel J. Stasiewski noted that the series was different for HBO, writing, [...] "Flight of the Conchords isn’t Entourage or Sex in the City or even Extras. It’s different. And sometimes different is just good." [...] Stasiewski, however, did note that {{the availability of the}} band's music on video sites like YouTube meant that watching the series was not worth the cost of a cable subscription. Further more, Stasiweski noted that while [...] "the fun, quirky music videos that pop-up can make this long half-hour worth watching [...] the 10 or so minutes in between numbers aren’t groundbreaking comedy." [...] Chris Schonberger from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a largely positive review. He called the new series [...] "the funniest hour of comedy on television" [...] and noted that the performance of Rhys Darby as Murray Hewitt was excellent, calling his character [...] "scene-stealing". Finally, Schonberger positively compared the episode to the 2004 comedy film Napoleon Dynamite, writing, [...] "Indeed, the whole pilot vaguely reminded me of Napoleon {{in the way that the}} characters just sort of lurk around and pour their limited energy into absurd activities".|$|E
5000|$|Bill Kuchman of Popculturology {{praised the}} episode for {{continuing}} Barney's evolution, saying, [...] "It’s {{amazing how much}} effort HIMYM has put into that transition {{over the past few}} seasons, but they’ve really succeeded in transforming <b>a</b> one-dimensional (yet <b>very</b> <b>funny)</b> womanizer into <b>a</b> fleshed-out person." ...|$|R

500|$|... "The Fight" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{and several}} commentators noted that Ann's new part-time job {{at city hall}} provides a good explanation for why she is always spending time around the parks department despite working at the hospital. The scenes at the Snakehole Lounge were also praised as particularly funny, especially a shot where Ron Swanson dances drunkenly while wearing April's small woman's hat. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode was a good character study {{of the relationship between}} Leslie and Ann, and that the bar scenes [...] "gave the whole episode a chaotic yet welcoming feel, like it was the show's drunken greatest hits". Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she loved the episode and called the Snakehole Lounge scenes a [...] "tour-de-force" [...] that highlighted the comedic skills of the entire cast. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com enjoyed the silliness of the episode, and claimed that the characters are so well-developed and likable that watching the Snakehole Lounge scenes felt like hanging out with real-life friends at a bar. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called it a [...] "stellar" [...] episode that was [...] "loose, silly, rich with details and heart". He praised the fast pace and comedic timing of the jokes, and wrote, [...] "it felt like the director was having as much fun as possible in 'The Fight.'" [...] Scott Meslow of The Atlantic called [...] "The Fight" [...] <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode which offers a [...] "great solution" [...] to why Ann Perkins spends so much time in city hall, which he called one of the show's [...] "last nagging questions".|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{said that}} 30 Rock [...] "feels like a show that's already made The Leap midway through season one." [...] He reported that Tracy's story was [...] "largely a dud", {{but said that}} the two other plots were [...] "so funny" [...] {{that it would not}} matter much. Sepinwall said [...] "The Head and the Hair" [...] was [...] "splendid". Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards Alec Baldwin's Jack in this episode, citing that he knows [...] "how to squeeze some serious funny out of a simple gesture and a pause." [...] She added that his [...] "lingering stare" [...] at both Jenna and Liz after taking their drink order [...] "was the funniest moment in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode". Ward also enjoyed that it [...] "brought us maximum Kenneth, which is great. He's turning {{out to be one of}} the show's most endearing characters." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning wrote that the pairing of Jack and Kenneth was a [...] "great idea and gave Kenneth his best episode" [...] since [...] "Blind Date". In regards to Liz's story, he commented it was [...] "her strongest episodes to date", and said that it [...] "felt good" [...] to see her [...] "have a little luck for a change" [...] with [...] "The Head". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich disliked that NBC [...] "utterly ruined" [...] the outcome of Liz's plot in the promos, though, said that it was a [...] "very funny resolution to the relationship that was too good, and too well coiffed, to be true." [...] Mitovich said that it was [...] "fun" [...] to see Liz successfully date [...] "while it lasted".|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode an 8.7 out of 10 rating saying he liked all the mothers {{coming back and}} loved Buzz Aldrin's appearance, writing that despite Aldrin not being a great actor [...] "he had enough good lines to overcome this short fall." [...] The A.V. Clubs Todd VerDan Werff gave [...] "The Moms" [...] episode a B grade rating, noting [...] "...I just liked the episode for having all of the characters have their moms wandering around." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton gave the episode a positive review, writing that {{it was fun to}} see [...] "the resemblances between all the moms and their kids" [...] and enjoyed Will Ferrell's cameo here. At the beginning of his review, Adam Mersel of TV Guide said that this episode was not funny and was [...] "amused, a bit confused, and left wanting more." [...] After recapping the episode he said that he took his comments back, explaining that the episode [...] "did have laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix wrote this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode of the show... yet it did some nice things in trying to pull Liz {{and some of the other}} characters back into reality." [...] Sepinwall commented that Tracy and Jenna's stories with their mothers were [...] "nice grounded moments for the show's two broadest main characters, and the sort of thing 30 Rock needs to do with them a few times a season." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked this episode better than the previous episode [...] "Argus", enjoyed Elaine Stritch's return as Jack's mother, and that Tracy's story with Novella Nelson was [...] "actually well done", explaining that his situation makes sense in the TGS world. The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that [...] "The Moms" [...] was [...] "fun but lighter than air, content to string together a mild plot with a series of good jokes and callbacks."

2500|$|Negative {{responses}} {{came from}} Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Daily News calling it [...] "staggeringly bad" [...] and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle stating that [...] "It couldn't buy a laugh in a nitrous oxide factory with {{a fistful of}} clown noses."
