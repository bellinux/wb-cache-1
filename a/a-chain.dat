25|$|The {{human insulin}} protein is {{composed}} of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an <b>A-chain</b> and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in carbohydrate metabolism effects) from human insulin because of these variations. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by recombinant DNA technologies.|$|E
25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the isoelectric point from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly acidic pH and less soluble at a physiological pH. Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the <b>A-chain</b> by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic human insulin. When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not bioavailable. A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in subcutaneous tissue. As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is somewhat slower than NPH human insulin. It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E
2500|$|The PLAU gene encodes a serine {{protease}} (...) involved in {{degradation of the}} extracellular matrix and possibly tumor cell migration and proliferation. A specific polymorphism in this gene {{may be associated with}} late-onset Alzheimer disease and also with decreased affinity for fibrin-binding. The protein encoded by this gene converts plasminogen to plasmin by specific cleavage of an Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. This gene's proprotein is cleaved at a Lys-Ile bond by plasmin to form a two-chain derivative in which a single disulfide bond connects the amino-terminal <b>A-chain</b> to the catalytically active, carboxy-terminal B-chain. This two-chain derivative is also called HMW-uPA (high molecular weight uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into LMW-uPA (low molecular weight uPA) by cleavage of chain A into a short chain A (A1) and an amino-terminal fragment. LMW-uPA is proteolytically active but does not bind to the uPA receptor.|$|E
40|$|The passive {{construction}} is a late acquisition in child language. In this paper I evaluate {{the claim that}} difficulty with noncanonical semantics, rather than non-mature subject-object <b>A-chains,</b> underlie young children’s poor performance on the passive. In a series of truth-value judgment tasks, 4 - and 5 -year-old English-speaking children were tested on their comprehension of matrix passives and passives embedded under raising-to-object (RO: want, need) and object control (OC: ask, tell) verbs. RO passives (Olivia wanted/needed Scott to be kissed by Misha) entail object-subject-object <b>A-chains,</b> but allow semantic patients to surface as syntactic objects; OC passives (Olivia asked/told Scott to be kissed by Misha) and matrix passives (Scott was kissed by Misha) involve similar <b>A-chains</b> but do not result in this syntactic-semantic configuration. I found that although 4 -year-olds failed to comprehend matrix passives and passives embedded under OC verbs, they correctly interpreted passives under RO verbs. (5 -year-olds performed above chance in all tasks.) I propose a “semantic scaffolding” account of children’s comprehension of the passive that rests on the prototypicality of subjects being agents and objects being patients, arguing against the view that difficulty with passives results from an inability to form <b>A-chains...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. Alport {{syndrome}} (AS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous nephropathy. The goal of {{the present}} study is to delineate clinical characteristics and the distribution of type IV collagen chains in Chinese AS patients and to identify any a(IV) -chain expression and clinical phenotype correlation. Methods. A total of 126 biopsy-proven patients meet-ing immunofluorescence criteria for the diagnosis of AS were investigated retrospectively. Results. Microscope haematuria associated with proteinuria was observed as the initial symptom in 77. 8 % of the patients; 59. 8 % showed hearing impairment and 22. 9 % had ocular abnormalities. Renal biopsies from 118 patients revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (61. 9 %) and focal and segmental sclerosis glomerulonephritis (37. 3 %). Ten different distribution patterns for the type IV collagen <b>a-chains</b> were found in the kidney; six of these are presented here for the first time. Based on renal immunofluorescence findings, 113 patients (89. 7 %) were classified as X-linked dominant inherited AS (XLAS) and 13 (10. 3 %) as autosomal recessive AS (ARAS). The XLAS group was divided into typical and non-typical subgroups according to the expression patterns for the a 3 (IV) -chain. Clinical phenotypes were more severe in XLAS patients than in ARAS patients and the prognosis was poorer in typical XLAS patients than non-typical XLAS patients. Conclusion. In China, the incidence of XLAS is 89. 7 % and 10. 3 % for ARAS.

Thrombin cleavage of Factor XIII and fibrinogen was also studied in platelet-poor plasma to which thrombin was added. In order to measure Factor XIIIa activity, fibrin polymerization was completely inhibited by the addition of Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro. Factor XIIIa formation was measured by the incorporation of [3 H]putrescine into casein. The concentration of added thrombin required to cleave 50 % of fibrinogen and Factor XIII was 0. 65 U/ml and 0. 35 U/ml, respectively. The rate of cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin was 43 -fold greater than cleavage of Factor XIII. Lower Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro concentrations were used {{to determine the effects of}} incompletely inhibiting fibrin polymerization on cleavage of Factor XIII and fibrinogen. Thrombin cleavage of Factor XIII but not fibrinogen was dependent on the extent of fibrin polymerization. The more marked the degree of inhibition of fibrin polymerization, the slower the rate of Factor XIIIa formation. Thus, in platelet-rich plasma, thrombin cleavage of Factor XIII and fibrinogen are closely related events during spontaneous clotting. Furthermore, cleavage of Factor XIII during clotting is enhanced by fibrin polymerization in platelet-poor plasma...|$|R
