40|$|ABSTRACT] In {{brackish}} {{lakes and}} tidal rivers where a stable stratification {{with a sharp}} halocline usually exists, a characteristic aquatic environment often appears. One of serious environmental problems is an appearance of anoxic water mass in the lower layer at these water regions especially in summer because of weak vertical mixing and active dissolved oxygen consumption. In such circumstances, internal oscillations frequently occur due to tide or/and wind and bring about an active movement of an anoxic water mass in the lower layer, and affects seriously the aquatic environment there. Then I studied physical processes of the internal oscillations in Lake Nakaumi and The River Ohashi {{and found that the}} oscillations with a few <b>meter</b> <b>amplitude</b> frequently occur and propagate as internal Kelvin waves in the lake and the oscillations sometimes cause anoxic water intrusions through the Ohashi River into Lake Shinji...|$|R

The paper presents analytical expressions for the calculation of equivalent frequency and defines the requirements for the minimum size of the antenna.

40|$|Abstract During a big {{earthquake}} {{along the}} San Andreas fault in southern Cali-fornia, high excitation and low attenuation of long-period (3 to 10 sec) strong ground motions will cause wave motions to propagate fficiently {{far from the}} epicentral area. These ground motions could potentially be destructive to large-dimension structures in the Los Angeles basin. We performed calculations using the surface-wave Gaus-sian beam method for a 3 D southern California crustal structure. Displacement field {{as well as the}} associated dynamic strain field produced by large propagating ruptures along the San Andreas fault are evaluated. Results indicate that in the presence of lateral heterogeneity, focusing and multipathing interference contribute significantly to a complex pattern of the displacement field and the associated dynamic strain field. For a big event on the San Andreas fault with a seismic moment of 1. 8 x 1028 dyne-cm, long-period displacement in the Los Angeles basin could reach a maximum <b>amplitude</b> of <b>meters</b> in places. Since this calculation is fast, we have evaluated the displacement field for a dense grid of points; a differentiation gives the corresponding effective horizontal dynamic strain field. At times, the maximum effective dynamic strains may reach mid- 10 - 3 to even 10 - 2 high enough to be of engineering con-cern. This computational result probably gives the upper bound values due to the large source assumed. For events of smaller seismic moment release along less ex-tensive ruptures, these results can easily be scaled down proportionally. Different scenarios are considered in this study with different slip distributions. It is found that with a given seismic moment, a more evenly distributed fault slip over the rupture surface will result in lower peak values on both displacements and dynamic strains. Our displacement results give similar values to those obtained by Kanamori using empirical Green's functions but substantially higher than Bouchon and Aki's results...|$|R

[1995] reports on data collected in March 1987 and November/December 1990 over the shallowest part of the Mascarene Ridge (centered around 13 oS, 61. 25 oE). Internal waves were measured both east and west of this sill. The eastward propagating waves obtained peak-to-trough amplitudes of up to 90 -meter amplitude and phase speed of 3 m/s.

5000|$|If the Moon just {{revolved}} around the Earth, {{there would be no}} way to tell what fraction of the Moon's or the Earth's gravity was caused by each form of mass, since only the total can be measured. However, the orbit of the Moon is also strongly affected by the gravity of the Sun—in essence, Earth and Moon are in free fall around the Sun. If the energy portion of mass behaves differently from the conventional portion, then the Earth and the Moon will fall differently toward the Sun, and the orbit of the Moon around the Earth will be affected. For example, suppose the energy part of the mass does affect gravity, but does not affect inertia. Then:From our perspective on Earth, this would appear as a displacement, or polarization, of the lunarorbit away from the Sun with an <b>amplitude</b> of 13 <b>meters.</b> If the violation went the other way, with theself energy possessing inertial mass but not gravitational mass, the lunar orbit would appear to bepolarized toward the Sun by the same amplitude.

40|$|Although {{the idea}} that pulse in music {{may be related to}} human pulse is ancient and has {{recently}} been promoted by researchers (Parncutt, 2006; Snowdon & Teie, 2010), there has been no ordered delineation of the characteristics of music that are based on the sounds of the womb. I describe features of music that are based on sounds that are present in the womb: tempo of pulse (pulse is understood as the regular, underlying beat that defines the <b>meter),</b> <b>amplitude</b> contour of pulse, meter, musical notes, melodic frequency range, continuity, syllabic contour, melodic rhythm, melodic accents, phrase length, and phrase contour. There are a number of features of prenatal development that allow for the formation of long-term memories of the sounds of the womb in the areas of the brain that are responsible for emotions. Taken together, these features and the similarities between the sounds of the womb and the elemental building blocks of music allow for a postulation that the fetal acoustic environment may provide the bases for the fundamental musical elements that are found in the music of all cultures. This hypothesis is supported by a one-to-one matching of the universal features of music with the sounds of the womb: 1) all of the regularly heard sounds that are present in the fetal environment are represented in the music of every culture, and 2) all of the features of music that are present in the music of all cultures {{can be traced to the}} fetal environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany of the world's active volcanoes are {{situated}} {{on or near}} coastlines. During eruptions, diverse geophysical mass flows, including pyroclastic flows, debris avalanches, and lahars, can deliver large volumes of unconsolidated debris to the ocean {{in a short period}} of time and thereby generate tsunamis. Deposits of both hot and cold volcanic mass flows produced by eruptions of Aleutian arc volcanoes are exposed at many locations along the coastlines of the Bering Sea, North Pacific Ocean, and Cook Inlet, indicating that the flows entered the sea and in some cases may have initiated tsunamis. We evaluate the process of tsunami generation by cold granular subaerial volcanic mass flows using examples from Augustine Volcano in southern Cook Inlet. Augustine Volcano is the most historically active volcano in the Cook Inlet region, and future eruptions, should they lead to debris-avalanche formation and tsunami generation, could be hazardous to some coastal areas. Geological investigations at Augustine Volcano suggest that as many as 12 ? 14 debris avalanches have reached the sea in the last 2000 years, and a debris avalanche emplaced during an A. D. 1883 eruption may have initiated a tsunami that was observed about 80 km east of the volcano at the village of English Bay (Nanwalek) on the coast of the southern Kenai Peninsula. Numerical simulation of mass-flow motion, tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation for Augustine Volcano indicate only modest wave generation by volcanic mass flows and localized wave effects. However, for east-directed mass flows entering Cook Inlet, tsunamis are capable of reaching the more populated coastlines of the southwestern Kenai Peninsula, where maximum water <b>amplitudes</b> of several <b>meters</b> are possible...|$|R
40|$|Caregivers often {{engage in}} musical {{interactions}} with their infants. For example, parents across cultures sing lullabies and playsongs to their infants from birth. Behavioral {{studies indicate that}} infants not only extract beat information, but also group these beats into metrical hierarchies by as early as 6 months of age. However, {{it is not known}} how this is accomplished in the infant brain. An EEG frequency-tagging approach has been used successfully with adults to measure neural entrainment to auditory rhythms. The current study is the first to use this technique with infants in order to investigate how infants’ brains encode rhythms. Furthermore, we examine how infant and parent musical background is associated with individual differences in rhythm encoding. In Experiment 1, EEG was recorded while 7 -month-old infants listened to an ambiguous rhythmic pattern that could be perceived to be in two different meters. In Experiment 2, EEG was recorded while 15 -month-old infants listened to a rhythmic pattern with an unambiguous meter. In both age groups, information about musical background (parent music training, infant music classes, hours of music listening) was collected. Both age groups showed clear EEG responses frequency-locked to the rhythms, at frequencies corresponding to both beat and meter. For the younger infants (Experiment 1), the <b>amplitudes</b> at duple <b>meter</b> frequencies were selectively enhanced for infants enrolled in music classes compared to those who had not engaged in such classes. For the older infants (Experiment 2), amplitudes at beat and meter frequencies were larger for infants with musically-trained compared to musically-untrained parents. These results suggest that the frequency-tagging method is sensitive to individual differences in beat and meter processing in infancy and could be used to track developmental changes...|$|R
40|$|Ground-based and Cassini CIRS thermal-infrared {{data have}} {{characterized}} the {{spatial and temporal}} characteristics of an equatorial oscillation in Saturn's middle atmosphere above the 100 -mbar level. The CIRS data indicate a vertical pattern of alternating warm and cold anomalies at the equator. From the thermal wind equation this implies a concomitant reversal of zonal winds with attitude, relative to the cloud-top winds, with peak-to-peak <b>amplitude</b> approximately 200 <b>meters</b> per second. The ground-based observations do not having the altitude range or vertical resolution of the CIRS observations, but they cover several years and indicate an oscillation cycle of 1 years, roughly half of Saturn's year. Equatorial oscillations in Earth's middle atmosphere have primarily exhibited either quasi-biennial or semi-annual "periodicities," and both types have been extensively observed and modeled. They exhibit a vertical pattern of alternating warmer and cooler zonal-mean temperatures and zonal winds analogous to that described above for Saturn. Moreover, the pattern of winds and temperatures descends with time. Momentum deposition by damped vertically propagating easterly and westerly waves is thought to {{play a key role}} in forcing both types of oscillation, and it can plausibly account for the descent. Here we report the direct observation of this descent in Saturn's equatorial atmosphere from Cassini radio occultation soundings in 2005 and 2009. The retrieved temperatures are consistent with a descent of 0. 6 x the pressure scale height over this time period. The descent rate is related to the magnitude of the wave forcing, radiative damping, and induced meridional circulations. A simple calculation implies that vertical wave fluxes of zonal momentum approximately 0. 05 square meters per square second could account for the observed vertical descent on Saturn, which is comparable to the magnitude of the wave fluxes associated with the terrestrial quasi-biennial oscillation...|$|R
