5|$|Since 1887, {{the borough}} has {{included}} the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and small parts of Earley and Tilehurst. By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> of Tilehurst. A small area of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An {{attempt to take}} over a small area of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997. Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS).|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium has not {{yet been}} synthesised. Nevertheless, because it is only three {{elements}} away from the heaviest known element, oganesson (element 118), its synthesis may come in the near future; it is expected {{to be one of the}} last few reachable elements with current technology, and the limit may be anywhere between element 120 and 124. It will also likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the elements known so far up to 118, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> difficult than elements 119 and 120. The team at RIKEN in Japan has plans to attempt the synthesis of element 121 in the future after its attempts on elements 119 and 120.|$|E

25|$|Isabella was {{at first}} {{unprepared}} for the lavish style of court life in Burgundy, {{one of the most}} extravagant in Europe. The Portuguese infanta, described by the Burgundian embassy that had negotiated her marriage as appearing to their eyes as a nun when they had first met, and now dressed in loose clothing and flat over-panels to hide her pregnancy, looked particularly dowdy at her new court. More upsetting to Isabella, however, was her husband's behaviour. He had showered gifts on her when she had first arrived, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> when she had become pregnant; yet, {{he made it clear that}} he had no intention of keeping his vows of fidelity and chastity. He kept numerous women as his lovers, most living away from the court, and as many as 50 illegitimate children.|$|E
25|$|By his Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind and his Fragment on Mackintosh Mill {{acquired}} {{a position in}} the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the Scottish Enlightenment, as then represented by Thomas Reid, Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, but made a new start, due in part to David Hartley, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the Analysis is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on Franz Brentano who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology. The Fragment on Mackintosh severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir James Mackintosh's Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.|$|E

25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, <b>and,</b> <b>still</b> <b>more,</b> a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E
25|$|The School {{was kept}} clean by the labour of 'a poor boy of the said School' who was paid 4 pence {{annually}} {{by each of}} his fellows; normal repairs were {{paid for by the}} town; the town also added a further £10 to the School's annual income, but when that income had to be divided between the Headmaster and the Usher (who took the younger boys) it was naturally difficult to find <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> so to keep good masters. In 1635, for instance, the School contained only six boys. The reason for the long Headmasterships of Rev. Richard Cornes from 1677 to 1726 and of Rev. Hugh Stackhouse from 1726 to 1743 was that they were both also incumbents of St Mary's Church. Rev. Stackhouse bequeathed to the Bridgnorth his collection of theological books and his memory is preserved {{in the name of the}} Stackhouse Library, the octagonal brick building with a dome, built on the northeast side of St Leonard's Church to house the collection of books which he had begun, and by a marble tablet over the building's fireplace. After 1766 no Usher was appointed; but the emoluments could not now support even a single master unless he could attract boarders to the School. Distinguished eighteenth century alumni of the School include Bishop Thomas Percy, Bishop of Dromore and author of Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, Sir John Josiah Guest, the engineer, entrepreneur and Member of Parliament, Dr Thomas Beddoes, the physician and scientific writer, and Dr William Macmichael, physician to Kings George IV and William IV and author of The Gold-Headed Cane.|$|E

500|$|Since Constantinople {{had been}} {{recovered}} by the Byzantines in 1261, {{the seat of}} the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople had been since 1314 at Negroponte, which still remained in Latin hands. Soon after his investment, Paul stopped in Ancona on his way to Greece. He remained in the city for several weeks, fêted by the locals, and presented them with purported relics: on 4 March 1380 the head of James the Just, followed on 17 April by the foot of Saint Anne and a nail from the True Cross. As Nicol comments, [...] "one may be tempted to question the authenticity, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> the provenance, of his donation". The documents of grant, preserved in the cathedral of Ancona, are signed by Paul and a certain [...] "Alexios Palaiologos the Despot", allegedly a son of the Byzantine emperor but in reality, according to Nicol, probably [...] "another figment of Paul's fertile imagination".|$|E
500|$|After {{the opening}} Paris run and the London performances, events conspired {{to prevent further}} stagings of the ballet. Nijinsky's choreography, which Kelly {{describes}} as [...] "so striking, so outrageous, so frail as to its preservation", did not appear again until {{attempts were made to}} reconstruct it in the 1980s. On 19 September 1913 Nijinsky married Romola de Pulszky while the Ballets Russes was on tour without Diaghilev in South America. When Diaghilev found out he was distraught and furious that his lover had married, and dismissed Nijinsky. Diaghilev was then obliged to re-hire Fokine, who had resigned in 1912 because Nijinsky had been asked to choreograph Faune. Fokine made it a condition of his re-employment that none of Nijinsky's choreography would be performed. In a letter to the art critic and historian Alexandre Benois, Stravinsky wrote, [...] "he possibility has gone for some time of seeing anything valuable in the field of dance <b>and,</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> important, of again seeing this offspring of mine".|$|E
500|$|In 1940, the German {{army had}} requisitioned a former Belgian army fort at Breendonk and {{transformed}} {{it into an}} [...] or prison camp. Initially, the prison camp was used for detaining Jews, but from 1941 most of those detained at Breendonk were political prisoners or captured members of the resistance. Though it was reasonably small, the camp was infamous for its poor conditions and high death rate. It was also where summary executions of hostages as reprisals for resistance actions occurred. Unusually, Breendonk was mainly guarded by Flemish collaborators of the , rather than German soldiers. Prisoners were often tortured, or even mauled by the camp commander's dog, and forced to move tonnes of earth around the fort by hand. Many were summarily executed <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> {{died as a result}} of the conditions at the camp. Of the 3,500 people incarcerated in Breendonk between November 1942 and April 1943, around 300 people were killed in the camp itself with at least 84 dying as a result of deprivation or torture. Few inmates remained long in Breendonk itself and were sent on to larger concentration camps in Germany.|$|E

500|$|The first skeleton, {{known as}} the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was {{unearthed}} in 1861 near Langenaltheim, Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the Natural History Museum in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by Richard Owen as Archaeopteryx macrura, allowing for the possibility it {{did not belong to}} the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin described how some authors had maintained [...] "that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> recently, that strange bird, the Archaeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Pullin had a wide {{knowledge}} of the game, and remembered past events and players very clearly. His readers appreciated his expertise and frequently wrote to him with queries. A tribute in the Yorkshire Post after his death suggested that Pullin enjoyed this correspondence and felt very close to his readers. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack stated that [...] "his writings were at all times discriminative, informative and voluminous". The Manchester Guardian noted that Pullin wrote {{at a time when}} many famous cricketers played. It stated that, of these times, he [...] "wrote with a keenness of judgement, a descriptive style, and a fund of anecdote that made the games live again". E.W. Swanton described him as [...] "a thick, bearded fellow" [...] and [...] "a faithful old war-horse". The Yorkshire Post said that Pullin [...] "stood for all the best in sporting critics of the older school... He was proud, and rightly proud, of the high position which he held in sporting journalism and in the administrative circles of the games on which he wrote". The newspaper judged that he wrote about cricket and rugby players [...] "with a clarity akin to genius... There can scarcely be a football or cricket ground in England where he was not known and welcomed, and his striking appearance <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>more</b> striking personality became traditional in the Press box which he graced. To the players of the games he was generous in praise and kindly in his criticism." [...] Gerald Pawle was told when he became a journalist in 1931 that Pullin originally sent reports to his newspaper by pigeon. Pawle writes: [...] "For the vast Yorkshire cricketing public Old Ebor wrote at inordinate length, unhampered by any consideration of literary style—he was one of the severely factual school—and it amazed me how any pigeon ever struggled into the air when shackled to one of his weighty effusions." ...|$|E
