Whilst conservative liberals hoped to make temporary use of Mussolini's popularity in order to restore parliament, Gobetti recognised the tyrannical orientation of fascism. He claimed fascism represented the 'autobiography of the nation', an accretion of all the ills of Italian society. In particular, fascism continued a political tradition of compromise, absorbing political opponents rather than allowing conflict to express itself openly. Liberalism, he argued, was anti-fascist insofar as, on his account, it recognised that liberty was <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> <b>struggle</b> and conflict.|$|E

The increasingly vocal nativist movement in Hong Kong and some {{sections of the}} pro-government camp have scapegoated mainlanders as {{the root cause of}} Hong Kong's social problems such as overstretched healthcare and social services, soaring housing costs and overcrowded public transportation. While recognising these problems as severe and disproportionately affecting the poorest sections of Hong Kong society, Socialist Action argues it is the economic rule of the billionaires and their extreme neo-liberal policies (outsourcing, privatisation and deregulation) that in turn have led to housing market speculation, shortages, and a decline in public services. To counter the arguments of racist groups, Socialist Action calls for democratic control over the border, tourism, and housing policies, and public ownership of the banks and major conglomerates along with an end to privatisation and outsourcing of public services - political change that can only be <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> united <b>struggle</b> of working people of all ethnicities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{growth of}} Ukrainian {{national}} consciousness {{in the late}} 19th century led to a riff among the Ukrainian intelligentsia. The older generation approached the [...] "Ukrainian question" [...] through culture and education, limiting their demands to moderate reforms that would have abolished the national-cultural restrictions for Ukrainian within the Russian Empire. The younger generation however, were attracted to socialist ideals. They believed that national liberation could be <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> a common <b>struggle</b> with other nations against the existing social order in Russia. In the early 1890s, a new trend developed. It was started by a Mikhnovsky, a student who openly declared the state independence of the Ukrainian nation. He began to preach boldly, {{that the only way}} to gain state independence was through armed conflict and that this was the only path for the Ukrainian people.|$|R

The OLF believes the alignment of the Ethiopian government with forces resisting genuine change in Ethiopia is posing a real threat to the oppressed and subjugated peoples in the country. The organization declares that there are indications that militaristic and chauvinistic elements who are aspiring to restore the old order are demanding for the reversal of what minimum change Oromo people have <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> their <b>struggle.</b> It states that the Ethio-Eritrean conflict is going to directly affect the oppressed nations and nationalities economically and in terms of human casualty, and continuation of suppression and violation of human rights by creating pretexts connected with the war situation.

In 1966 Communist party followers split after following different communist tendencies. Some of these joined the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which the communist party supported. Because he was a communist, Bateman began being persecuted by Colombian government forces.

40|$|Regime change {{politics}} has dominated political discourse in Southern Africa in the neoliberal era. It has mainly {{been characterized by}} regime change agendas hatched and championed by neo-liberal forces and domestic actors seeking to replace southern African revolutionary nationalist governments with pro-western democratic governments. This paper is a theoretical analysis {{of the politics of}} regime change in post-colonial Zambia and Zimbabwe. The paper explores the downfall of the United National Independence Party (UNIP) regime in Zambia and the persistence of the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) regime in Zimbabwe. While acknowledging that a multiplicity of factors influenced regime change politics in both Zambia and Zimbabwe, the study argues that the demise of the UNIP regime and the survival of the ZANU PF regime are rooted in their revolutionary pasts. The former was a pure political movement that <b>achieved</b> independence <b>through</b> political <b>struggle</b> while the latter was a politico- military movement that obtained independence <b>through</b> armed <b>struggle.</b> This diference in identity and mode of attaining independence shaped and influenced {{the manner in which the}} movements responded to regime change agendas...|$|R
60|$|This {{sovereign}} knows, I have no doubt, and feels, on {{what sort}} of bottom is to be laid {{the foundation of a}} Russian throne. He knows what a rock of native granite is to form the pedestal of his statue who is to emulate Peter the Great. His renown will be in continuing with ease and safety what his predecessor was obliged to <b>achieve</b> <b>through</b> mighty <b>struggles.</b> He is sensible that his business is not to innovate, out to secure and to establish,--that reformations at this day are attempts at best of ambiguous utility. He will revere his father with the piety of a son, but in his government he will imitate the policy of his mother. His father, with many excellent qualities, had a short reign,--because, being a native Russian, he was unfortunately advised to act in the spirit of a foreigner. His mother reigned over Russia three-and-thirty years with the greatest glory,--because, with the disadvantage of being a foreigner born, she made herself a Russian. A wise prince like the present will improve his country; but it will be cautiously and progressively, upon its own native groundwork of religion, manners, habitudes, and alliances. If I prognosticate right, it is not the Emperor of Russia that ever will call for extravagant proofs of our desire to reconcile ourselves to the irreconcilable enemy of all thrones.|$|R
5000|$|Lensch {{believed}} that World War I proved {{the failure of}} capitalism. Since capitalism, the system of a free market economy based on competition, relies on socialist economic regulatory measures (Lensch believed), the superiority and victory of the socialist principle is thus proved for Lensch. The state used a grain monopoly to ensure the nutrition of the population, and Bread cards would then be introduced. This is for Lensch the indication of a principle change in the economy towards a [...] "democratic war socialism" [...] (?). This lack of basic needs during the war is for Lensch basically godsend, because it allows the actions of government planning. Here he saw the revolutionary character of the war. To Lensch the state is an institution that stands above classes. The state does not regulate any specific class, but is driven by “objective interests”. The war effort showed this and thus reflects {{the interest of the}} whole people. According to Lensch socialism is thus not <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> class <b>struggle,</b> but <b>through</b> national reconciliation. The cultural identity and the economy should be linked together - this is important for the thesis of a [...] "world war as a world revolution". The thesis removes Lensch from the classical Marxist view, although Marxist methodology is still basically applied. Large national industries, a bureaucratically regulating state and a strong work force are for Lensch, the new socialist [...] "Volksgemeinschaft" [...] (unity of a people).|$|R

40|$|Students’ {{beliefs that}} success in science depends on {{exceptional}} talent negatively impact their motivation to learn. For example, such beliefs {{have been shown}} to be a major factor steering students away from taking science and math courses in high school and college. In the present study, we tested a novel story-based instruction that models how scientists <b>achieve</b> <b>through</b> failures and <b>struggles.</b> We designed this instruction to challenge this belief, thereby improving science learning in classroom settings. A demographically diverse group of 402 9 th and 10 th grade students read 1 of 3 types of stories about eminent scientists that described how the scientists (a) struggled intellectually (e. g., made mistakes in investigating scientific problems, and overcame the mistakes <b>through</b> effort), (b) <b>struggled</b> in their personal life (e. g., suffered family poverty and lack of parental support but overcame it), or (c) made great discoveries (a control condition, similar to the instructional material that appears in many science textbooks, that did not describe any struggles). Results showed that participation in either of the struggle story conditions improved science learning postintervention, relative to that of students in the control condition. Additionally, the effect of our intervention was more pronounced for low-performing students. Moreover, far more students in either of the struggle story conditions felt connected to the stories and scientists than did students in the control condition. The use of struggle stories provides a promising and implementable instructional approach that can improve student motivation and academic performance in science and perhaps other subjects as well...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between the representation of colonial history and the elite claim of authority in Malaysia. Specifically, it investigates the claim that Malayan independence was <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> a peaceful <b>struggle.</b> In order to address this claim, it was important to examine: 1. 	The representation of the colonial period in national history 2. 	UMNO dominance in politics, economy and culture, and its claim of almost total authority for the achievement of Malaysian independence. 3. 	The extent to which the UMNO claim has hindered the development of democratic forces. The excavation of supplementary and alternative narratives of Malaysian history has been central for this research. In particular, the mainstream representation of history is challenged through autobiographical revelation. The thesis focuses on the formation of the dominant representation during the colonial era, showing how the process suppressed other perspectives. ‘Radical’ nationalism during anti-colonial struggle in the period after the Second World War, from 1945 to 1957, is explored. The perspectives and experiences of radical nationalists are used as the basis for a critique of the dominant discourse of the post-independence political elites. In particular, the emergence of autobiographical fragments has enabled exploration of mundane but abiding resistance. While some notable differences are found in the character of resistance, there remains a persistent theme of democratic aspiration in the counter-narratives of Malaysian politics and society, alongside the persisting elite structures of politics and culture extending from the colonial through to the post-colonial eras. The analysis of the autobiographical reflections of radical nationalists demonstrates levels of cultural resistance which have not been recognised until now. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, the global North has {{witnessed}} the growing prominence of immigrant rights movements. This article examines how this highly stigmatized population {{has achieved a}} certain degree of legitimacy in hostile political environments. The central claim of the article is that this kind of legitimacy is initially <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> the efforts of activists to represent undocumented immigrants in ways that resonate with the normative values of the nation. The author examines how activist networks are formed to present their cases within national political fields and the effects of this process on the political identities of immigrants and their respective citizenship regimes. The process of gaining legitimacy is contradictory. It contributes to nationalizing the political identities of foreigners and reproducing the exclusionary logic of national citizenship regimes. But in doing this, it encourages those who cannot conform to national values to embrace more radical and universal conceptions of rights. The generation of competing discourses and notions of rights (national versus universal) therefore arises <b>through</b> <b>struggles</b> to make undocumented immigrants into legitimate political subjects...|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} and analyze the essence {{and nature of the}} {{pedagogical}} thought in Bulgaria during the Bulgarian National Revival as a basis for educational reform. Objectivity requires pedagogical ideas to be considered in the context of overall socio-political and cultural life in the country on the one hand, and amid universal spiritual revival in Europe on the other. These tasks could be undertaken by a major international study, which is why we consider some of the questions highlighting this topic – the positive example of Europe on educational thought in the country presented by Bulgarian writers in the 18 th century through {{the first half of the}} 19 th century. The achievements of free European nations developing in all spheres of life were perceived by Bulgarian Renaissance writers as an incentive to overcome the age-old material and spiritual backwardness of the Bulgarians by the power of knowledge. In their activity they proceeded from a clearly motivated purpose: to contribute by educating citizens about spiritual awakening and rise of the Bulgarian nation. According to them, mass secular education in their native language was the road that would take the Bulgarians from their present slavery and provide them with material and spiritual well-being, like in other European nations. The need for secular books and secular schools to be taught in the mother tongue was one of the main ideas of Bulgarian writers during the Renaissance. Their mouthpieces were mainly clergymen, who perceived their role as national leaders and educators. Alongside the emerging secular intelligentsia, they actively contributed to the spiritual and cultural advancement of the Bulgarian nation and its integration into European civilization. An enlightened, free and independent Bulgaria was the ideal of our Renaissance leaders P. Hilendarski, G. S. Rakovski and Hr. Botev. While the revolutionary figures from the late 19 th century thought that this could be <b>achieved</b> <b>through</b> armed <b>struggle,</b> the writers from the 18 th and early 19 th centuries were convinced that the power of knowledge would transform the Bulgarian nation, which would equal or surpass other Balkan, Slavic and European nations in terms of education and incorporate them. The Bulgarian writers of the 18 th and early 19 th centuries vocalised the general aspiration for national awakening through education. Through their literary and educational activities, the Bulgarian National Revival was rooted in and approved a new educational ideal, subject to the struggle for national self-determination...|$|R
