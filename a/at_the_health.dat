25|$|Galton {{states that}} the {{measurements}} of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child’s eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on {{the usefulness of the}} collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc. The exhibit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.|$|E

[...] A Dr. Blaha, who resigned as chairman of Orthopedics at WVU, was quoted as criticizing the institute as being part of a culture <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> Sciences Center that, in his view, places too much emphasis on agreement, consensus, and getting along.
