5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked levels as many times <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|Journey is Thatgamecompany's latest game. The player {{controls}} a robed {{figure who}} {{wakes up in}} a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as their destination. While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate verbally, but may help each other or not <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b> The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
60|$|Inga {{let them}} shoot <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> while {{he stood before}} the great gates and {{examined}} them carefully.|$|R
50|$|While the Welshmen {{were doing}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> <b>they</b> {{were still in}} part acting {{according}} to their notions of law by requiring three hundred compurgators.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they each}} chose such {{of the band}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> and so went forth by {{different}} paths from the forest.|$|R
25|$|Cars may pit {{as often}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> {{at the expense}} of track position, but the free pass car is limited to taking fuel only at the first pit stop opportunity. If the free pass car is judged to have caused the caution (intentionally or not) there will be no free pass car.|$|E
25|$|The {{provisions}} of the Public Works Act 1928 and the Turangi Township Act 1964, relied on by the Crown in entering and taking the claimants' land, are inconsistent with the basic guarantee in Article II of the Treaty of Waitangi that Māori may keep their land until such time <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to sell it.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanics}} of the process are the same regardless of how many candidates the voter ranks, and how many are left unranked. In some implementations, the voter ranks as many or as few choices <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish,</b> while in other implementations the voter is required to rank either all candidates, or a prescribed number of them.|$|E

60|$|After {{looking at}} all these things <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> Mr. George and Rollo bade the woman good by, and James gave her half a guilder. The party then withdrew.|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} for the design and construction of the locomotive was awarded to Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC). Subject to the requirements above, the company was free to implement the design <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished.</b>|$|R
25|$|As a result, Spain is now {{composed}} of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities {{with varying degrees}} of autonomy thanks to its Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation. The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b>|$|E
25|$|Resident Return Visa (RRV) (subclasses 155 and 157) - allows {{current and}} former {{permanent}} residents to travel to another country and re-enter the Australian migration zone as a permanent resident. RRVs allow the holder to re-enter Australia as often <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> during {{the validity of the}} visa. RRVs may be issued with five years' or three months' validity.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{voters in}} an STV {{election}} rank candidates on a preferential ballot. STV systems {{in use in}} different countries vary both as to ballot design and {{to whether or not}} voters are obliged to provide a full list of preferences. In jurisdictions such as the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland voters are permitted to rank as many or as few candidates <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b> Consequently, voters sometimes, for example, rank only the candidates of a single party, or of their most preferred parties. A minority of voters, especially if they do not fully understand the system, might even 'bullet vote', only expressing a first preference. Allowing voters to rank only as many candidates <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> grants them greater freedom, but can also lead to some voters ranking so few candidates that their vote eventually becomes 'exhausted'; that is, at a certain point during the count it can no longer be transferred and therefore loses an opportunity to influence the result.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{piled on}} board and away swept the line of cars, on the way downtown. But it was a local train, making all the stops, so their {{progress}} was not <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the main}} Asian continent, the Mongols were {{tolerant}} of religions. People could worship <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished</b> freely and openly, though {{the formation of}} two countries, i.e. Pakistan and Bangladesh, {{has been on the}} basis of religious intolerance.|$|R
50|$|The auditions were successful, and the La Bambas {{appeared}} on {{stage for the}} first time on May 25, 1966 at the Coconut Grove inside Galle Face Hotel. It didn't go <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> however, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were booed and jeered off the stage.|$|R
25|$|Ella and Malachi romance {{one another}} magically and otherwise, and their {{respective}} mentors, the Archangel Raphael and the demon Mephistopheles, both use psychological tactics {{to get them to}} do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b> Ella and Malachi eventually have sex, as the evil side had wanted, and by fulfilling Ella's true desire (to be normal), she is made a slave to Malachi – his succubus.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{critiques of}} neo-liberal {{policies}} have maintained that market forces {{are not only}} inappropriate for sustaining the environment, but are in fact {{a major cause of}} environmental destruction. Hardin's tragedy of the commons (1968) has shown that the people cannot be left to do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> with land or environmental resources. Thus, decentralization of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance.|$|E
25|$|While a team is short-handed, {{they are}} {{permitted}} to ice the puck <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish,</b> without having the icing infraction called against them. This allows short-handed teams to relieve pressure more easily when defending with fewer skaters than their opponents. This exemption {{does not apply to}} teams whose opponents have pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker (unless the defending team is killing a penalty at the same time).|$|E
60|$|After {{lingering}} {{about the}} old ruin <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> our travellers came down the hill again <b>as</b> <b>they</b> went up, except that Rollo walked all the way. He was afraid to ride on the donkey going down, for fear that he should fall.|$|R
50|$|Sjöberg also {{competed in}} the vault event in the {{gymnastics}} with 14 other competitors, {{in which they had}} two minutes to carry out as many jumps <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> again no score or position is recorded for his efforts.|$|R
25|$|When {{the body}} of Magellan was {{recovered}} by the warriors, Humabon ordered him to return the bodies of Magellan {{and some of his}} crew who were killed, and they would be given as much merchandise <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished.</b> Lapu-Lapu refused.|$|R
25|$|Each team {{consists}} of 9 players (although teams can sign as many players <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish),</b> league matches consist of 5 ‘legs’ (each player bowling 3 balls), the winning team of each ‘leg’ gaining one point. The team scoring most ‘pins’ overall is also awarded 6 points. League matches are enhanced with team (Ken Baker Cup), 4 a side, doubles and singles cup competitions all played on Thursday evenings.|$|E
25|$|Some ballparks {{limit the}} amount of food an AYCE patron can take on each trip to the buffet. At Dodger Stadium, AYCE patrons are limited to four hot dogs per visit, but can take as many soft drinks and bottles of water <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b> At Camden Yards, patrons may take up to two of each food item on each visit. The lines move quickly, as no cash {{transactions}} are involved.|$|E
25|$|Since mid-October 2008, {{however, the}} ECB has been {{following}} a different procedure on a temporary basis, the fixed rate MRO with full allottment. In this case the ECB specifies the rate but not the amount of credit made available, and banks can request as much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> (subject as always {{to being able to}} provide sufficient collateral). This procedure was made necessary by the financial crisis of 2008 and is expected to end at some time in the future.|$|E
50|$|Each {{track of}} this EP was {{produced}} by either 'Funknslocuts' (Ryan Beehre) or 'Gimme A C!' (Paul Dodge), in collaboration with lead singer Ruth Carr. The producer had artistic freedom to do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished</b> with the songs they were given.|$|R
50|$|Another of his {{business}} practices was to charge performers to have their portrait printed on sheet music. Then he gave them the sheet music to hand out <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,</b> and made money from selling advertisements on the back cover page.|$|R
50|$|The itinerating pioneer preachers {{always found}} a {{welcome in the}} Flickinger home. There they held {{services}} and found lodging and board <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished</b> {{to remain in the}} community. Jacob Flickinger was very generous in supporting these preachers.|$|R
25|$|Galactic Civilizations II {{is powered}} by a custom 3D game engine, {{although}} most user interface elements are displayed in 2D. Planets and ships are restricted to a single plane in space, but the user may pan and zoom <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish,</b> even to view the details of individual ships. Players may zoom out to view the galactic map on a wide scale, at which point the ships, planets and anomalies are replaced by icons. It is possible to play the game in this mode.|$|E
25|$|The Godfather II {{is an open}} world action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person perspective, in which the player {{controls}} Dominic, Don of the Corleone family in New York City, and Michael Corleone's underboss. The basic gameplay and game mechanics fall into the subgenre of Grand Theft Auto clones, as the player can travel throughout the game world freely, commandeer vehicles, {{do whatever they want}} in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b>|$|E
25|$|Callisto and Alberto now appear, veiled {{in black}} {{from head to}} toe and pretending to be ghosts. Thoroughly terrified, Eutichio shoots Callisto, {{wounding}} him in the shoulder. Uproar ensues. Don Raimondo arrives with his servants. Callisto, who has not been fatally wounded, is chastised by his master and expresses his remorse. Don Raimondo and Annetta confess their love for each other and makes plans to marry. Eutichio and Sinforosa are reconciled. Don Raimondo tells Eutichio that he and Sinforosa can live in the house rent-free for as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b> All present unite to sing of their delight at the outcome.|$|E
50|$|When {{the body}} of Magellan was {{recovered}} by the warriors, Humabon ordered him to return the bodies of Magellan {{and some of his}} crew who were killed, and they would be given as much merchandise <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished.</b> Lapu-Lapu refused.|$|R
60|$|But the valiant Lord Mayor replied, {{that what}} he got he must get by force; {{for as long as}} Emmanuel, their Prince, was alive, (though he at present was not so with them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished,)</b> <b>they</b> should never consent to yield Mansoul up to another.|$|R
50|$|The Local Government Act 1972 allowed councils {{to voluntarily}} form joint {{committees}} {{to provide services}} together and the Local Government Act 1985 extended this principle by directing local authorities to form some shared arrangements whilst permitting them to form others <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>wished.</b>|$|R
