5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
25|$|The {{process was}} started before the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> {{had a chance}} to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet {{were more likely to be}} numb, and {{therefore}} the pain would not be as extreme.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{longitudinal}} <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> can {{be divided}} into medial and lateral arches.|$|R
50|$|While these medial {{and lateral}} arches may be readily {{demonstrated}} as <b>the</b> component antero-posterior <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>the</b> fundamental longitudinal arch is contributed to by both, and consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calcaneus, cuboid, third cuneiform, and third metatarsal: all <b>the</b> other bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> may be removed without destroying this arch.|$|R
5000|$|The second code {{indicates}} if {{the shoe}} has soles that protect <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> from punctures. [...] "P" [...] means it does. [...] "O" [...] means it doesn't.|$|R
25|$|Two muscles on {{the lateral}} {{side of the}} leg form the peroneal group. The peroneus longus and brevis both have their origins on the fibula and they both pass behind the lateral malleolus where their tendons pass under the peroneal retinacula. Under the foot, the longus {{stretches}} from the lateral to the medial side in a groove, thus bracing the transverse <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> The brevis is attached on the lateral side to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal. Together the two peroneals form the strongest pronators of the foot. The peroneus muscles are highly variable and several variants can occasionally be present.|$|E
25|$|The {{abductor}} hallucis stretches {{along the}} medial {{edge of the}} foot, from the calcaneus {{to the base of}} the first phalanx of the first digit and the medial sesamoid bone. It is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> Lateral to the abductor hallucis is the flexor hallucis brevis, which originates from the medial cuneiform bone and from the tendon of the tibialis posterior. The flexor hallucis has a medial and a lateral head inserted laterally to the abductor hallucis. It is an important plantar flexor which comes into prominent use in classical ballet (i.e. for pointe work).|$|E
25|$|The broken toes {{were held}} tightly against {{the sole of}} the foot while the foot was then drawn down {{straight}} with the leg and the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the {{sole of the foot}}. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.|$|E
5000|$|After {{suffering}} foot {{pain from}} frostbite as a conscript on the Russian front in World War II, Romanian born Dr. Georg Alzner self medicated his own solution, reverse engineering {{what he termed}} <b>the</b> ideal <b>foot.</b> His arch supports formed normal adult human bones into the correct positions so <b>the</b> four <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> worked properly. In 1948, he released his own line of orthotics based on this principle. [...] He also discovered how restoring the proper shape to <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> had a chain reaction effect of restoring proper balance to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> {{formed by}} <b>the</b> tarsal and {{metatarsal}} bones, strengthened by ligaments and tendons, allow <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> to support <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{body in the}} erect posture with the least weight.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} points {{through the}} body are lifted upward: <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>the</b> pelvic floor, the lower abdomen, the rib cage, cervical spine, and <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head. In this position, akin to standing [...] "smartly", <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> standing erect should do most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lifting without much special effort from the subject.|$|R
500|$|The great saphenous vein,(GSV) a {{superficial}} vein, {{is the longest}} vein in the body. It has its origin in the dorsal venous <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> {{a superficial}} vein which connects the small saphenous vein with the GSV. It travels up the leg and medial side of the thigh to reach the groin, where it drains into the common femoral vein. Along {{the length of the}} GSV, it receives [...] numerous tributaries, (from the subcutaneous layer) and drains into the deep veins via the perforator veins. When seen in a scan, the GSV and the Giacomini vein, together with the accessory saphenous vein (ASV), form an image resembling an eye which {{is referred to as the}} [...] "eye sign" [...] or [...] "eye image"[...] All veins which are between the skin and the superficial fascia are tributaries and all veins which cross the deep fascia to join the deep venous system are perforator veins.|$|E
2500|$|Some riders {{ride with}} the stirrup more [...] "home," [...] or shoved toward the heel. This is seen {{most often in}} sports such as polo and eventing, where the speed and sudden changes of {{direction}} of the former, and the great change in terrain and solid fences of the latter, make the rider {{more likely to be}} jarred loose from the saddle and increases the risk of losing a stirrup. However, this placement actually puts the stirrup on the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> in a weaker position that leads to tension in the leg, stiffness in the knee and decreases the flexibility of the ankle, and therefore the shock-absorbing ability of the rider; paradoxically increasing the risk of a fall. [...] Additionally, it increases the chance that the rider's foot will become stuck in the stirrup during a fall, a very dangerous situation. This placement is often counterproductive and should not be used if it is not an absolute necessity. [...] The [...] "home" [...] position has some value in saddle bronc riding, as a lost stirrup will almost inevitably result in the rider being thrown from the bucking horse, but because riders are thrown from the horse at a high rate even under normal circumstances, this event also has a high rate of riders being hung up in their stirrups and injured in the process.|$|E

50|$|In humans, <b>the</b> midfoot {{consists}} <b>of</b> five {{bones that}} form <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> (<b>the</b> cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiform bones) and their articulations with <b>the</b> bases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five metatarsal bones. Lisfranc injuries are caused when excessive kinetic energy is applied {{either directly or}} indirectly to the midfoot and are often seen in traffic collisions or industrial accidents.|$|R
40|$|An {{original}} electrogeniometer {{was made}} for analyzing <b>the</b> dynamic changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior and medial <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> during walking. 5 normal adult males were asked to fix all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrogoniometers and walked freely on a floor on which the MATAKE's Force Plate was fixed. <b>The</b> mean patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior and medialarches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> was obtained and analysed.

5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods <b>of</b> time, high <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a leg length inequality, and flat <b>feet.</b> <b>The</b> tendency <b>of</b> flat <b>feet</b> to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{relationship}} to the metatarsophalangeal joints, the interossei muscles also contribute to maintaining the anterior metatarsal <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and also, to a limited extent, the medial and lateral longitudinal arches of the foot.|$|E
50|$|The beatings usually aim at {{the tender}} {{longitudinal}} <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> avoiding the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are particularly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of nerve endings.|$|E
