40|$|AbstractBackground 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 -deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG), {{also known}} as 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), is an oxidatively damaged {{nucleobases}} of DNA and is excreted into urine. Therefore, its urinary level {{is used as a}} sensitive marker for oxidative stress (OS). Although it can be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), its application to clinical pediatrics remains limited. Recently, a novel <b>automatic</b> <b>analyzer</b> (model no. ICR- 001 : Techno Medica Co., Ltd., Japan) has been developed for point-of-care testing (POCT) to measure urinary 8 -oxodG. We verified the reliability of the value of urinary 8 -oxodG measured by this novel analyzer and to set the age-related reference intervals. MethodWe obtained random urine samples from 100 healthy Japanese adults and 157 healthy Japanese children aged 0 – 15 years. Urinary 8 -oxodG was determined using two methods: competitive immunochromatography using a novel <b>automatic</b> <b>analyzer</b> (ICR- 001) and another was ELISA. ResultsBoth urinary 8 -oxodG and urinary creatinine measured by ICR- 001 correlated well with those measured by ELISA (rs= 0. 945, p< 0. 0001) and an enzymatic method (rs= 0. 988, p< 0. 0001). Age-related reference for 8 -oxodG corrected by creatinine were highest in the youngest subjects and decreased until adolescence, consistent with published data by ELISA.

Nowadays, there is a pressure on high quality in laboratories. Therefore, without <b>automatic</b> <b>analyzers,</b> information systems and their communication would not be possible to meet these requirements. The higher quality of the laboratory results leads to the higher effectivity of the whole health system because of the better and faster diagnosis and setting the proper patient therapy due to the early knowledge of the precise and true laboratory results. The aim of this work is a brief mapping of the <b>automatic</b> <b>analyzers</b> and laboratory instruments supply on the market and suggest an instrumental solving for specific middle-size biochemical laboratory. There is an urgent need to take account of the space limits, claims to the number of analysed samples and methods.

The method is very {{suitable}} for urine samples although the method {{was released by}} Du Pont only for plasma samples. The results correlated well with those obtained by a method based on the Berthelot indophenol reaction and by a method based {{on the use of}} an ammonium electrode, which has an ammonium ion selective membrane. The day-to-day coefficient of variation is about 2 and 4 % at concentration levels of 100 and 50 μιηοΐ/ΐ respectively. The measured and relative ammonia concentration are linearly related. Recovery of added known amounts of ammonium is complete and no interference from glucose, urea, creatinine and uric acid could be demonstrated. Recommendations are given for handling blood and urine samples before analysis.

Based on the comparison, CardioChek PA blood analyzer was used to detect blood lipid of 1263 persons (more than 40 years old) at high-risk of stroke. Results The outcomes of TC, TG, HDL-C and LDLC between CardioChek PA blood analyzer and Siemens ADVIA 2400 <b>automatic</b> <b>analyzer</b> had significant correlations (r > 0. 975, P < 0. 05) and error allowance at different medical decision levels were all between 95 % confidence interval (CI) of predicted bias, indicating that there were comparability of TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C between two detecting systems and the outcomes were acceptable. Moreover, there were 347 cases (27. 47 %) with abnormal TC, 348 cases (27. 55 %) with abnormal TG, 62 cases (4. 91 %) with abnormal HDL-C and 441 cases (34. 92 %) with abnormal LDL-C among 1263 persons.
