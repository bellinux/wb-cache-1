5|$|By {{ordering}} {{the display of}} one part of Koppány's quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár, {{the seat of his}} maternal uncle, Gyula the Younger, Stephen asserted his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>political</b> consequences are subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|The folwark, a {{large-scale}} system of agricultural production based on serfdom, was a dominant feature on Poland's economic landscape {{beginning in the}} late 15th century and for the next 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture in central-eastern Europe diverged from {{the western part of the}} continent, where elements of capitalism and industrialization were developing to a much greater extent, with the attendant growth of a bourgeoisie class <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>political</b> influence. The 16th-century agricultural trade boom combined with free or very cheap peasant labor made the folwark economy very profitable.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{theme of}} the story is the {{conflict}} between anarchism and statism, the political and ethical dimensions of which are explored through the characters' dialogue. Though the attention the story received was limited prior to the author's death in 1982, it has since seen greater circulation in Philip K. Dick story collections, and has been reviewed and analyzed for its postmodern critique of technology <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>political</b> implications.|$|E

5|$|Jogaila was duly baptised at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 15 February 1386 {{and from}} then on {{formally}} used the name Władysław or Latin versions of it. The marriage took place three days later, and on 4 March 1386 Jogaila was crowned King Władysław by archbishop Bodzanta. He was also to be legally adopted by Jadwiga's mother, Elizabeth of Bosnia, so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga's death. The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila's court and noblemen, as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers, a beginning of the final Christianization of Lithuania. Though the ethnic Lithuanian nobility were the main converts to Catholicism—both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants—the king's conversion <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>political</b> implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The 13th century brought {{fundamental}} {{changes to the}} structure of Polish society <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>political</b> system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western Farther Pomerania broke its political ties with Poland {{in the second half of}} the 12th century and from 1231 became a fief of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the Sławno and Słupsk areas. Pomerelia or Gdańsk Pomerania became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, Bolesław II the Bald granted Lubusz Land to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the Neumark and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, Leszek the White was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the Halych area of Rus', a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{arrived in}} Ceredigion in 1073–1074, {{and from the}} early twelfth century Norman {{political}} and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's. In about the year 1106, Ithel and Madoc, who were in alliance with King Henry I, ravaged all the county of Cardigan, as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, {{with the exception of}} Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanddewi Brefi. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its sanctuary, from which several of Owain ab Madoc’s men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, scarcely a generation after Rhygyfarch was writing his Life of St David, the clas had declined in its spiritual and pastoral life, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>political</b> importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.|$|E
