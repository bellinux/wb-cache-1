5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} {{functions are}} defined by an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed above) {{are defined by}} some property that holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> by its Taylor series.|$|E

However, especially for complex <b>analytic</b> <b>functions,</b> new and interesting phenomena show up when working in 2 or more dimensions. For instance, zero sets of complex <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> in more than one variable are never discrete.|$|R

40|$|In this article, a {{class of}} <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> is {{investigated}} and their some properties are established. Several recurrence relations and various classes of bilinear and bilateral generating <b>functions</b> for these <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> are also derived.

25|$|There are {{infinitely}} many continuous {{extensions of}} the factorial to non-integers: infinitely many curves can be drawn through any set of isolated points. The gamma function is the most useful solution in practice, being analytic (except at the non-positive integers), {{and it can be}} characterized in several ways. However, {{it is not the only}} <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> which extends the factorial, as adding to it any <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> which is zero on the positive integers, such as , will give another function with that property.|$|E

In this paper, we introduce and study certain subclasses of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions.</b> Several inclusion relations of various subclasses of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions,</b> coefficient estimates, growth and distortion theorems, Hadamard Product, extreme points, integral means and inclusion properties are given.

40|$|We {{will discuss}} the {{construction}} of bases in a space of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> for a given domain and isomorphic classification of spaces of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions.</b> We will focus on results in one dimensional case. In one dimensional case, we consider the construction of bases in two different ways. Using one of them, we construct interpolational bases for the space of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> on a compactum K and in that part, results of Leja, Walsh, and Zahariuta are used. Then, isomorphic classification follows {{by the use of}} Potential Theory. Using the second way, we construct a common basis for the spaces of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> of a regular pair “compact set domain” by the Hilbert methods that was proposed by Zahariuta. GKS-duality is used for both of the cases. In multidimensional case, some results about bases and isomorphisms of spaces of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> in several variables that were proved by Zahariuta are represented (see also Aytuna). Since a multidimensional analogue of GKS-duality does not exist, interpolational bases cannot be constructed as in one dimensional case. But the bases constructed by Hilbert methods proves to be applicable for studying the isomorphism of the space of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> on D to the space of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> on the unit circle of n-dimensional complex plane.

25|$|Complex {{analysis}} is particularly {{concerned with the}} analytic functions of complex variables (or, more generally, meromorphic functions). Because the separate real and imaginary parts of any <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> must satisfy Laplace's equation, complex {{analysis is}} widely applicable to two-dimensional problems in physics.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{defining}} the exponential function for domains {{larger than the}} domain of real numbers is to first define it for the domain of real numbers {{using one of the}} above characterizations and then extend it to larger domains in a way which would work for any <b>analytic</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

25|$|The theorem {{can also}} be stated in {{abstract}} (real or complex) vector spaces. Let V and W be finite-dimensional real or complex vector spaces, with n=dimW. Let A1,...,A'n−1 be analytic functions with values in End(V) and b an <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> with values in V, defined on some neighbourhood of (0,0) in V×W. In this case, the same result holds.|$|E
25|$|The global {{form of an}} <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> is {{completely}} determined by its local behavior in the following sense: if f and g are two analytic functions defined on the same connected open set U, and if there exists an element c∈U such that fnbsp&(n)(c) = gnbsp&(n)(c) for all n ≥ 0, then f(x) = g(x) for all x ∈ U.|$|E

The nilpotency of N can be exploited when calculating f(A) where f is a complex <b>analytic</b> <b>function.</b> For example, in principle the Jordan form could give a closed-form expression for the exponential exp(A).|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{several authors}} showed some new {{criteria}} for univalency of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> (see, e.g., [1 – 7]). In this note, we shall derive certain sufficient conditions for univalency of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> with missing coefficients.|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} {{theme of}} this thesis is that random matrix valued <b>analytic</b> <b>functions,</b> generalizing both random matrices and random <b>analytic</b> <b>functions,</b> for many purposes can (and perhaps should) be effectively studied in that level of generality. We study zeros of random <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> in one complex variable. It is known {{that there is a}} one parameter family of Gaussian <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> with zero sets that are stationary {{in each of the three}} symmetric spaces, namely the plane, the sphere and the unit disk, under the corresponding group of isometries. We show a way to generate non Gaussian random <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> whose zero sets are also stationary in the same domains. There are particular cases where the exact distribution of the zero set turns out to belong to an important class of point processes known as determinantal point processes. Apart from questions regarding the exact distribution of zero sets, we also study certain asymptotic properties. We show asymptotic normality for smooth statistics applied to zeros of these random <b>analytic</b> <b>functions.</b> Lastly, we present some results on certain large deviation problems for the zeros of the planar and hyperbolic Gaussian <b>analytic</b> <b>functions.</b> Comment: Ph.

5000|$|For any {{open set}} Ω ⊆ C, the set A(Ω) of all <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> u : Ω → C is a Fréchet space {{with respect to}} the uniform {{convergence}} on compact sets. The fact that uniform limits on compact sets of <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> are <b>analytic</b> is an easy consequence of Morera's theorem. The set [...] of all bounded <b>analytic</b> <b>functions</b> with the supremum norm is a Banach space.|$|R
25|$|For {{any value}} of the slowly varying field H, the free energy (log-probability) is a local <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> of H and its gradients. The free energy F(H) is defined to be the sum over all Ising {{configurations}} which {{are consistent with the}} long wavelength field. Since H is a coarse description, there are many Ising configurations consistent with each value of H, so long as not too much exactness is required for the match.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{modular form}} is a (complex) <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> {{on the upper}} {{half-plane}} satisfying {{a certain kind of}} functional equation with respect to the group action of the modular group, and also satisfying a growth condition. The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory. Modular forms appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology, sphere packing, and string theory.|$|E
25|$|The Bring radical of {{a complex}} number a is either any of the five roots of the above {{polynomial}} (it is thus partially undefined), or a specific root, which is usually chosen in order that the Bring radical {{is a function of}} a, which is real-valued when a is real, and is an <b>analytic</b> <b>function</b> in a neighborhood of the real line. Because of the existence of four branch points, the Bring radical cannot be defined as a function that is continuous over the whole complex plane, and its domain of continuity must exclude four branch cuts.|$|E
