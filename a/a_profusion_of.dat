5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E

The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Steep {{contacts}} between the thick basal breccia of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of adjacent peaks {{suggest that the}} breccia {{is part of a}} caldera-fill succession. The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> dikes within the breccia—but not in adjacent country rock—provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E

[...] Beneditti applied the paint less thickly than de Heem.|$|R

5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces bright yellow petals that last only one day. The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> wildlife, {{and it is an}} ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises and seals can be spotted in the water.|$|E
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there was}} <b>a</b> large <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> {{constructed}} languages intended as genuine, spoken language. There were created languages which don't belong to any country and can be learned by everyone. Among these are Solresol, Volapük, and Esperanto, the most spoken constructed language nowadays. At that time, those ideas were readily accepted. With the advent of World Wars and the Cold War, these successes were buried.|$|R

Here is kept the holy relic of the skull of Saint Anne, in an urn that acts as the pedestal to the sculpted bust of Castelbuono's patron saint.|$|R
5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E
5|$|The Navajo were an Athabaskan {{people who}} {{migrated}} {{from the north}} into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin, and their territory stretched over parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado – in the original homelands of the Puebloans. In fact, the Navajo acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before {{the collapse of the}} Pueblo civilization in the 14thcentury. <b>A</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> other tribes have made a continued, lasting presence along the Colorado River. The Mohave have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen – navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch Gila trout and Colorado pikeminnow – and farmers, relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops. Ute peoples have inhabited the northern Colorado River basin, mainly in present-day Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, for at least 2,000 years, but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The Apache, Cocopah, Halchidhoma, Havasupai, Hualapai, Maricopa, Pima, and Quechan are among many other groups that live along or had territories bordering on the Colorado River and its tributaries.|$|E

40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the examination of}} 1, 006 chest x-ray films of workers from the industries devoted to shipyard welding, stone grinding, and refractory crushing in southern Okayama prefecture. Of the reviewed films, analysis was focused on subjects with <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> rate <b>of</b> 0 / 1 as well as pneumoconiotic subjects (exhibiting <b>profusion</b> rates <b>of</b> 1 / 0 or greater) in order to discover cases in the beginning stages. One-hundred-and-seventy-four films illustrated <b>a</b> <b>profusion</b> rate <b>of</b> 0 / 1 or greater, and the proportion <b>of</b> this <b>profusion</b> rate was revealed to be highest in shipyard welders. Even some workers under 40 years of age {{were found to have}} already developed pneumoconiosis. Of these 1, 006 subjects, 30 volunteers permitted us to measure their personal dust exposure concentrations. The measured concentration of the shipyard welders' dust exposure (respirable dust; 3. 3 86. 3 mg/m 3, total dust; 7. 5 - 117. 0 mg/m 3) was higher than those of the other 2 industries. Statistical differences among the industries were observed in the respirable dust concentrations. A statistically significant positive correlation was demonstrated between the working duration in dusty environments and the rate <b>of</b> <b>profusion.</b> The present findings suggest the need for taking adequate measures in Okayama in order to prevent workers from developing, or to help retard the progression of, pneumoconiosis. </p...|$|R
