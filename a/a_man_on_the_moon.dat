5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit {{the federal government to}} a program to land <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> {{by the end of the}} 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E

25|$|The United States of America (U.S.) {{acknowledged}} the immense success of Apollo 11 {{with a national}} day of celebration on Monday, July 21, 1969. All but emergency and essential employees were allowed a paid day off from work, in both government and the private sector. Coincidentally, the last time this had happened was the national day of mourning on Monday, November 25, 1963, to observe the state funeral of President John F. Kennedy, who had set the political goal to put <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> {{by the end of}} the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|With the Americans {{planning}} a space walk with their Gemini program, the Soviets decided to trump them again by performing a space {{walk on the}} second Voskhod launch. After rapidly adding an airlock, the Voskhod 2 was launched on 18 March 1965, and Alexei Leonov performed the world's first space walk. The flight very nearly ended in disaster, as Leonov was just barely able to re-enter through the airlock, and plans for further Voskhod missions were shelved. In the meantime the change of Soviet leadership {{with the fall of}} Khrushchev meant that Korolev was back in favor and given charge of beating the US to landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The C-5 was {{confirmed}} as NASA's {{choice for the}} Apollo program in early 1963, and was named the SaturnV. The C-1 became the Saturn I, and C-1B became Saturn IB. Von Braun headed a team at the Marshall Space Flight Center in building a vehicle capable of launching a manned spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon. Before they moved under NASA's jurisdiction, von Braun's team had already begun work on improving the thrust, creating a less complex operating system, and designing better mechanical systems. It was during these revisions {{that the decision to}} reject the single engine of the V-2's design came about, and the team moved to a multiple-engine design. The Saturn I and IB reflected these changes, but were not large enough to send a manned spacecraft to the Moon. These designs, however, provided a basis for which NASA could determine its best method towards landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|E

500|$|The landing was {{broadcast}} on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong {{stepped onto the}} lunar surface and described the event as [...] "one small step for [...] man, one giant leap for mankind."

500|$|It was, as he recalled, [...] "a {{tremendous}} {{punch in}} the stomach to all of us".

500|$|In {{addition}} to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> {{before the end}} of the 1960s, Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod [...] from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.|$|E
500|$|The United States often opposed Third World {{movements}} that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean {{forces in the}} Korean War of 1950–53.

500|$|The Apollo program, {{also known}} as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program {{carried out by the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which {{accomplished}} landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of [...] "landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and returning him safely to the Earth" [...] {{by the end of the}} 1960s, which he proposed in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book <b>A</b> <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|The {{experimental}} rocket-powered aircraft programs {{started by}} NACA were extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This {{was followed by}} a one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the Soviet Union, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal [...] "of landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> by the end of , and returning him safely to the Earth." [...] This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight altitude, [...]|$|E

[...] He proclaimed that if elected president, his {{administration}} would eliminate breast cancer by 2015. Once accomplished, he planned to [...] "then attack every major cancer one after the other." [...] Thompson explained that the disease had afflicted his family as well as millions of others and stated that [...] "there's no candidate in either party more prepared and more motivated to lead this effort than me." [...] He compared the announcement to President Kennedy's pledge to put <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> {{before the end of the}} 1960s. The plan consisted of increases in funding for cancer research, including a doubling of the National Institute of Health's budget and additional incentives for private medical professionals to find a cure. Furthermore, Thompson remarked that as part of the plan, he would travel the world to promote cures, improving the United States' international standing. David Miller of CBS News questioned whether the announcement was [...] "a desperate measure by a desperate candidate, or a well-thought out policy by a former Health and Human Services secretary." [...] He added, [...] "we can't say for sure, but this item is proof that it did succeed in drawing attention to the other Thompson in the race." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to the Soviet {{program of}} space exploration, US President JohnF.

[...] His pick for NASA administrator, James E. Webb, however pursued a broader program incorporating space applications such as weather and communications satellites. [...] During this time the Department of Defense pursued military space applications such as the Dyna-Soar spaceplane program and the Manned Orbiting Laboratory.
