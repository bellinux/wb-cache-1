25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, {{even though it had}} seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents knew better than to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
25|$|Brig. Gen. Thomas S. Jesup, the Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army, died on June 10, 1860. Winfield Scott was {{responsible}} for naming a replacement, but instead of one name, he offered four possibilities: Albert Sidney Johnston, Joseph E. Johnston (no relation), Robert E. Lee, and Charles F. Smith. Although Jefferson Davis, {{now a member of}} the Senate Military Affairs Committee, favored Albert Sidney Johnston, Secretary of War Floyd chose Joseph E. Johnston for the position. Johnston was promoted to brigadier general on June 28, 1860. Johnston did not enjoy the position, preferring field command to paperwork in Washington. In addition, he suffered from the pressures of the imminent sectional crisis and the ethical dilemma of administering war matériel that might prove useful to his native South; he did not yield to temptation, however, as Secretary of War Floyd was <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E
500|$|Andy Shaw of Grovel on {{the other}} hand had a more {{negative}} response, praising the artwork of Dave McKean and calling it [...] "brilliant", but criticized Morrison's story as claustrophobic and [...] "has more ponderous psychology than action and, as a result, not enough room to fit any decent action in." [...] Shaw would later add that Morrison's work [...] "doesn't stand up to his rivals," [...] and that [...] "mixing the history of the asylum – famous dumping ground for Batman's psychotic foes – with a typical Batman adventure is interesting enough, but Morrison throws too much at the hero in too small a space. This makes Batman's journey through Arkham's finest nutters appear too easy – more of a stroll through a fairground haunted house with a few old chums than a serious battle for his life. Coupled with an anti-climatic ending, there's little feeling of impending disaster – the chronicled event should probably appear in Batman's casebook of over-hyped walkovers." [...] Morrison himself admitted that the amount of symbolism made him [...] " [...] up being <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> the most pretentious Batman book ever.|$|E

500|$|The game allows {{players to}} {{participate}} in sexual activities with prostitutes, and murder them to reclaim the payment. This was met with widespread controversy. The game also received controversy for its depiction of crime, and allowing violence against police officers. Psychologist David Walsh of the National Institute on Media and the Family stated that the game [...] "glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity", and that [...] "the purpose {{of the game is}} to perpetrate crime". In response, Kotaku writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for [...] "proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so". Joanna Weiss of The Boston Globe noted the [...] "adrenaline" [...] that players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing the game's violence due to its mature classification. The National Organization for Women spoke out against the game in January 2002, asking Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it [...] "encourages violence and the degradation of women". Matt Richtel of The New York Times wrote that the activities within the game [...] "crossed the line into bad taste".|$|E
500|$|The {{belief that}} witches could cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland. In 1701 in Anstruther, Elizabeth Dick {{had been turned}} away from the local mill when begging. She cursed the mill and several {{witnesses}} testified that the grain in the mill turned red. Only when {{one of the people who}} had refused her help ran after her and gave her alms did she bless the mill and everything returned to normal. About half of accused witches had already gained a reputation for causing harm over a long period of time. The fact that only four per cent of recorded accused witches were involved in folk healing seems to indicate that healing skills were largely seen as different from witchcraft. The Aberdeenshire trials of 1596 reveal that spells could be purchased from folk magicians for success at fishing, to ensure a happy marriage, to prolong life and to affect the weather, but harmful spells were considered witchcraft. Many accusations included sexual fears. Margaret Bain, a midwife, it was claimed, could transfer the pains of childbirth to a woman's husband and Helen Gray cast a spell on a man that gave him a permanent erection. Witches and other sorts of folk magicians could also carry out divinations. These included by reading the marks on the shoulder blade of a slaughtered animal, measuring a person's sleeve or waist to see if they were suffering from a fever, or being able to find answers based on which way a sieve suspended from scissors or shears swung, as [...] Margaret Mungo was <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> before the kirk session of Dingwall in 1649.|$|E

He argued that the acts he was <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>did</b> not constitute a crime.

2500|$|During the {{war between}} Israel and Lebanon in 1982, [...] former Prime Minister Joe Clark issued a public rebuke to the CJC at its annual policy {{convention}} for its stance of unconditionally supporting the State of Israel in that war, regardless of what Israel had been <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing.</b> During the speech, Clark was interrupted with heckles from the crowd and approximately 50 people left the room in protest.

At the LAW races in Boston, shortly after Taylor had won the world championship, he accused the entire field that included Tom Cooper and Eddie Bald, among others for fouling him. Taylor complained after the event {{that he had been}} [...] "bumped, jostled, and elbowed until I was sorely tried." [...] Racing promoter William A. Brady, who was also Taylor's manager, chastised the other riders for their [...] "rough treatment" [...] of Taylor during the race.|$|E

2500|$|In 1929 the Soviet press {{claimed that}} an espionage {{organization}} serving the Polish intelligence service was uncovered in the Baptist community. It was supposedly {{headed by the}} Baptist leader Shevchuk and employed a hundred secret agents that were collecting Soviet military secrets. These claims were doubtful, however, and the accusation followed {{a decision by the}} Baptist church to allow its membership to serve in the armed forces, which thereby deprived Soviet propaganda of its ability to make accusations, as it had earlier, that the Baptists were irresponsible pacifists who parasitically enjoyed the security provided by their fellow citizens who shed their blood in that nation's defense. Other accusations of this sort were leveled against the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, students at the Leningrad Theological Institute and a number of top engineers and scientists, who were <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> espionage for foreign powers and the Vatican, or subversion; this led to trials, imprisonments and executions of numerous individuals. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was essentially shut down in 1930 through this means, and in the remainder of the decade most of its bishops were killed as well as many of its followers. A number of Protestant and Roman Catholic dignitaries were [...] "exposed" [...] as foreign spies in 1929–1930. Charges of espionage were commonly used against religious believers in order to arrest them.|$|E

6000|$|On August 26, or on September 2, Knox had an {{interview}} with the Queen, and made her weep. Randolph doubted whether this was from anger or from grief. Knox gives Mary's observations in the briefest summary; his own at great length, so that {{it is not easy to}} know how their reasoning really sped.

60|$|The {{work of the}} Commission was by {{no means}} easy, and the members were often <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> some things merely to benefit their own {{particular}} party or friends. Politicians of the old sort, who wanted everything they could lay hands on, fought civil service bitterly, and even those who might have been expected to help often held back, fearing they would lose their own popularity. Yet on the other hand, some members of Congress upheld the Commission nobly, and when President Garfield was assassinated by a half-crazy office-seeker many more came forward and clamored to put public offices on the merit system by all means.|$|E

We did not tell our hostess that poor Ethel and her grandmother had been <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> the very same thing for which she found fault with the Misses Burr.

60|$|That ballad {{was later}} than the popular belief, held by Satchells, that Gilbert Elliot {{was at the time}} (1596) laird of Stobs, which he did not acquire till after the Union (1603), and that he (the only man not a Scot, says Satchells, wrongly) rode with Buccleuch. Elliot is not <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so in Scrope's dispatches, but he may have come as far as Staneshaw bank, where half the company were left behind, says Satchells, with the horses, which were also left, says the ballad.

The announcement resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} sales of CDC's product. The Justice Department <b>accused</b> IBM <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> this intentionally because the System/360 Model 91 was not released until three years later. IBM avoided preannouncing products during the antitrust case, but after the case ended it resumed the practice. The company likely announced its PCjr in November 1983—four months before general availability in March 1984—to hurt sales of rival home computers during the important Christmas sales season. The practice was not called [...] "vaporware" [...] at the time, but publications have since used the word to refer specifically to it. Similar cases have been filed against Kodak [...] film company, AT, and Xerox.|$|R
