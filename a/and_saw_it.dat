5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure It Out. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E
5|$|Filming of Big Money Rustlas, a Western spoof, {{began in}} January 2009, and {{concluded}} on February 24, 2009. The tenth Gathering of the Juggalos {{took place at}} Hogrock in Cave-In-Rock, Illinois, from August 6 to 9. The event had the largest attendance in Gathering history with over 20,000 people. Over 120 musical artists performed at the event, including the likes of Tech N9ne, Kottonmouth Kings, Ice Cube, GWAR, Coolio, Vanilla Ice, Onyx, Scarface, The Dayton Family, Bizarre, Esham, and NATAS. At the event, the Big Money Rustlas trailer was screened twice. An infomercial for the event was released online by Psychopathic Records. After the event, a friend of Esham's handed Bruce {{a copy of his}} album I Ain't Cha Homey, which depicted a clown committing suicide with a gun on the front cover. Bruce listened to the album <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a diss towards Insane Clown Posse. While Esham claimed that the album was not a diss in his podcast, the album strained the relationship between Bruce and Esham, and the two have not spoken since its release.|$|E

5|$|Following the Walpole sale many artists, {{including}} James Barry and John Flaxman, {{had made}} renewed {{calls for the}} establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.|$|E

25|$|John Batman led an {{exploring}} {{party to}} Port Phillip District in May 1835, {{on board the}} schooner Rebecca.

Cole later collaborated with local group Bomm Sheltuh, rapping and producing while {{a member of the}} group.|$|E
25|$|Having {{returned}} to her kingdom, the queen bore a child, a girl which she named Yrsa after her dog. Yrsa was set to live as a shepherd, until she was 12 years old, when she met her father Helgi who {{fell in love with}} her, not knowing it was his daughter. Oluf kept quiet about the parentage <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as her revenge that Helgi would wed his own daughter. Helgi and Yrsa had the son Hrólfr.|$|E
25|$|John PaulII {{had good}} {{relations}} with the Church of England. He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen ElizabethII, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He preached in Canterbury Cathedral and received Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He said that he was disappointed by the Church of England's decision to ordain women <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a step away from unity between the Anglican Communion and the Catholic Church.|$|E

25|$|The {{literary}} tradition of Birmingham originally {{grew out of}} the culture of religious puritanism that developed in the town in the 16th and 17th centuries. Birmingham's location away from established centres of power, its dynamic merchant-based economy and its weak aristocracy gave it a reputation as a place where loyalty to the established power structures of church and feudal state were weak, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> emerge as a haven for free-thinkers and radicals, encouraging the birth of a vibrant culture of writing, printing and publishing.|$|E
25|$|Governor Lachlan Macquarie {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} Sydney Hospital <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> completed in 1816. Parts of the facility have been repurposed for use as Parliament House but the hospital itself still operates to this day. The city's first emergency department was established at Sydney Hospital in 1870. Demand for emergency medical care increased from 1895 with the introduction of an ambulance service. The Sydney Hospital also housed Australia's first teaching facility for nurses, the Nightingale Wing, established with the input of Florence Nightingale in 1868.|$|E
25|$|Many clubs {{disliked the}} {{competition}} <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as disruptive {{in the preparation}} for the new season. As a consequence, they did not nominate themselves for participation even if entitled. In particular, following its 1995 relaunch, clubs in England were sceptical about the competition; after initially being offered three places in the cup, all English top division teams rejected the chance to take part. Following the threat of bans of English teams from all UEFA competitions, the situation was eventually resolved with three English clubs entering weakened teams, {{and none of them}} qualified.|$|E

25|$|With {{the mass}} {{and power of}} {{locomotives}} like the Mallets, care had to be exercised in their operation. A light Mallet used as a pusher naturally connected to the train with its front coupler, {{and the strength of}} this drawhead was not infinite. While the engine could not push hard enough to break the drawhead, the engineer needed to avoid slack. On the downhill part of one run one day on the Buffalo Division from Beaver to Hoyts, the pusher engineer did not keep up with the train ahead <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> pull away from him with his drawhead hanging from the last car.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{heaviest}} fighting {{of the entire}} KDP-PUK civil war ensued starting October 13, 1997. Hundreds were killed and thousands displaced. PUK used six GRAD missiles in Suleymaniye. There were no negotiations to bring a truce. Same missiles were used against military targets in Turkey. From Turkey's perspective the KDP was trying to push PKK out of North Iraq and the KUP was getting support from the PKK which was supported by Syria and Iran. Turkey intervened {{on the side of}} the KDP <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an opportunity to attack the PKK. Turkey also warned Talabani, the leader of PUK, not to cooperate with the PKK.|$|E
25|$|Some {{orthodox}} Quakers in America {{disliked the}} move towards evangelical Christianity <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a dilution of Friends' traditional orthodox Christian belief in being inwardly {{led by the}} Holy Spirit. These Friends were led by John Wilbur who was expelled from his yearly meeting in 1842. He and his supporters formed their own Conservative Friends Yearly Meeting. In the UK in 1868 some Friends broke away from London Yearly Meeting for the same reason. They formed a separate body of Friends called Fritchley General Meeting, which remained distinct and separate from London Yearly Meeting until 1968. Similar Christian splits took place in Canada. The Yearly Meetings that supported John Wilbur's religious beliefs were known as Conservative Friends.|$|E

60|$|Now Jonas {{approved}} it very much, but {{told him that}} he had better smooth it a little more with his knife before <b>sawing</b> <b>it</b> off. Rollo did so; and then he carried it back to the horse, <b>and</b> <b>sawed</b> <b>it</b> off at the right distance, and it made an excellent wedge. The edges, {{at the head of the}} wedge, were left somewhat rough by the saw. These, however, he trimmed off with his knife, and then carried the wedge to Jonas.|$|R

25|$|Early in the {{investigation}} of Taunja Bennett's murder, Laverne Pavlinac read the news reports surrounding Taunja Bennett's death <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an opportunity to force an end to the long-term abusive relationship she had been in with her live-in boyfriend, John Sosnovske. She set up a meeting with the investigating detectives and gave a false confession, using the details she had read in reports to give a detailed story of how Sosnovske forced her to help him rape, murder, and dispose of Bennett's body. Pavlinac and Sosnovske were convicted of the murder in February 1991. To avoid the possibility of facing the death penalty, Sosnovske pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison, while Pavlinac was sentenced to no less than 10 years, much more than she had anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Wellesley {{landed with}} a British army at Figueira da Foz {{near the end}} of July and pressed south. On 21 August 1808, Junot {{attacked}} Wellesley's numerically superior army in the Battle of Vimeiro. Loison's division included three battalions of Jean-Baptiste Solignac's brigade and two battalions of Hugues Charlot's brigade, a total of 4,140 bayonets. The French commander planned to hurl Loison's division and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières' brigade of Henri François Delaborde's division at Vimeiro village while sending Delaborde's second brigade under Antoine François Brenier to envelop the British left flank. After reconsidering, Junot detached Solignac's men from Loison and also sent them against the British left, without bothering to inform Brenier. The French attacks were defeated one after another. Junot even committed his grenadier reserve <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> repulsed as well. In the subsequent Convention of Sintra, the French agreed to evacuate Portugal if the British transported them back to France.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} Suzuki spent {{a short time}} in the {{hospital}} with tuberculosis, but soon recovered. In 1927 an important chapter in Suzuki's life was turned. He went to visit a teacher in England he had at Komazawa named Miss Nona Ransom, a woman who had taught English to such people as the last emperor of China, Pu-yi, and more so his wife, the last empress of China, Jigoro Kano (the Founder of Judo), the children of Chinese president Li Yuanhong, and some members of the Japanese royal family. She hired him that day to be a translator and to help with errands. Through this period he realized she was very ignorant of Japanese culture and the religion of Buddhism. She respected it very little <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as idol worship. But one day, when there were no chores to be done, the two had a conversation on Buddhism that changed her mind. She even let Suzuki teach her zazen meditation. This experience is significant in that Suzuki realized that Western ignorance of Buddhism could be transformed.|$|E
