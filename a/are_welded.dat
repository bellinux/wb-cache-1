5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

30|$|The {{next step}} of the {{research}} study <b>is</b> the <b>welding</b> performance tests. Welding tests indicated that generally both steels {{can be used for}} Arctic service. The E 500 steel <b>was</b> <b>welded</b> by MMA, FCAW, and SAW, whereas F 500 W 35 -mm steel <b>was</b> <b>welded</b> by MIG/MAG and SAW.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{required to}} forge <b>weld</b> <b>is</b> typically 50 to 90 {{percent of the}} melting temperature. Iron can <b>be</b> <b>welded</b> when it surpasses the critical temperature (the A4 temperature) where its allotrope changes from gamma iron (face-centered cubic) to delta iron (body-centered cubic). Since the critical temperatures are affected by alloying agents like carbon, steel welds at a lower temperature-range than iron. As the carbon content in the steel increases, the welding temperature-range decreases in a linear fashion. Iron, different steels, and even cast-iron can <b>be</b> <b>welded</b> to each other, provided that their carbon content is close enough that the welding ranges overlap. Pure iron can <b>be</b> <b>welded</b> when nearly white hot; between 2500 F and 2700 F. Steel with a carbon content of 2.0% can <b>be</b> <b>welded</b> when orangish-yellow, between 1700 F and 2000 F. Common steel, between 0.2 and 0.8% carbon, <b>is</b> typically <b>welded</b> at a bright yellow heat.|$|R
50|$|The weldability, {{also known}} as joinability, of a {{material}} refers to its ability to <b>be</b> <b>welded.</b> Many metals and thermoplastics can <b>be</b> <b>welded,</b> but some <b>are</b> easier to <b>weld</b> than others (see Rheological weldability). A material's weldability is {{used to determine the}} welding process and to compare the final weld quality to other materials.|$|R
25|$|Butted tubing has {{increased}} thickness near the joints for strength while keeping weight low with thinner material elsewhere. For example, triple butted means the tube, usually of an aluminum alloy, has three different thicknesses, with the thicker sections {{at the end}} where they <b>are</b> <b>welded.</b> The same material {{can be used in}} handlebars.|$|E
25|$|Spiral Flow/Cross Flow: One fluid is in spiral {{flow and}} the other in a cross flow. Spiral flow {{passages}} <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> at each side for this type of spiral heat exchanger. This type of flow is suitable for handling low density gas, which passes through the cross flow, avoiding pressure loss. It can be used for liquid-liquid applications if one liquid has a considerably greater flow rate than the other.|$|E
25|$|Hess' sculptures {{are in the}} American modernist tradition. They {{ranged from}} uniquely stylized drummers and other figures to {{abstract}} works with intertwining forms and interesting surface textures. Hess was always seeking new shapes and unique structural designs to incorporate into his sculptures. His creations are fanciful and exuberant. He often used bronze or steel for his sculptures. Some of his metal works <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> while other works are cast.|$|E
50|$|Manual metal arc <b>welding</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} slow, as {{much time}} is spent stopping to fit new electrodes and to clean slag before restarting. Firecracker welding allows a weld {{the entire length of}} an electrode to <b>be</b> <b>welded</b> in one pass, without pausing. Extra-long electrodes may be used to increase the length that may <b>be</b> <b>welded</b> in one pass, up to 72 inches (1.8 meters).|$|R

25|$|The {{distance}} between the sheets in the spiral channels is maintained by using spacer studs that were welded prior to rolling. Once the main spiral pack has been rolled, alternate top and bottom edges <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> and each end closed by a gasketed flat or conical cover bolted to the body. This ensures no mixing of the two fluids occurs. Any leakage is from the periphery cover to the atmosphere, or to a passage that contains the same fluid.|$|E

The ship was sponsored by Birgit Smith, the widow of United States Army Sergeant 1st Class Paul Ray Smith, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

25|$|The {{plant has}} three process lines {{and is based}} on the French AVM procedure. Principal item is an inductively heated melting furnace, in which the {{calcined}} waste is merged with glass frit (glass beads of 1 to 2mm in diameter). The melt is placed into waste containers, which <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> shut, their outsides decontaminated and then brought into air-cooled storage facilities. This storage consists of 800 vertical storage tubes, each capable of storing ten containers. The total storage capacity is 8000 containers, and 5000 containers have been stored to 2010.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{railways}} use continuous {{welded rail}} (CWR), {{sometimes referred to as}} ribbon rails. In this form of track, the rails <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> together by utilising flash butt welding to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs. The first welded track was used in Germany in 1924 and the US in 1930 and has become common on main lines since the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Knife blades can be {{manufactured}} {{from a variety}} of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Carbon steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, possibly nickel, and molybdenum, with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminate blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Pattern-welding is similar to laminate construction. Layers of different steel types <b>are</b> <b>welded</b> together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.|$|E
