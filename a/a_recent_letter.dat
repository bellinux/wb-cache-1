6000|$|Mr. Wilson's {{messages}} to the American people {{and to the world}} have proclaimed a new international order, a League of Democracies. And in <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>letter</b> to New Jersey Democrats we find him warning his party, or more properly the nation, of the domestic social changes necessarily flowing from his international program. While rightly resolved to prosecute the war on the battle lines to the utmost limit of American resources, he points out that the true significance of the conflict lies in [...] "revolutionary change." [...] "Economic and social forces," [...] he says, [...] "are being released upon the world, whose effect no political seer dare to conjecture." [...] And we [...] "must search our hearts through and through and make them ready for the birth of a new day--a day we hope and believe of greater opportunity and greater prosperity for the average mass of struggling men and women." [...] He recognizes that the next great step in the development of democracy which the war must bring about--is the emancipation of labour; to use his own phrase, the redemption of masses of men and women from [...] "economic serfdom." [...] "The old party slogans," [...] he declares, [...] "will mean nothing to the future." ...|$|E
60|$|At this stage, {{the leader}} of the popular party claims attention. As is usual, he is out of office. After the Chitral {{expedition}} of 1895, Umra Khan was expelled from his territories, and escaped to Cabul. There he has remained. The Amir is under an obligation to the British Government to prevent his raising trouble in Bajaur. If the Amir desired war he would send Umra Khan back. This would create a strong faction throughout the whole country--but particularly in the Jandol, Salarzai and Mamund Valleys--hostile to the British and the friendly khans. The Amir hinted at this in <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>letter</b> to the Government of India; and such a step would probably precede his declaration of war, or follow ours. The Afghan sovereign is, however, well aware that he has at present nothing to gain, and many things to lose, by provoking a war with the great power which gave him his throne and has since increased his revenue by subsidies. In the meanwhile, anxious to preserve his influence with the border tribes, and to impress the Indian Government {{with the fact that he}} could be a powerful foe, he keeps Umra Khan as a trump card, to be played when the occasion arises. That he may maintain his authority in Bajaur, the exiled khan is well supplied with funds, with which to arm and pay his retainers.|$|E

6000|$|In <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>letter</b> to General Greene, Washington had {{expressed}} himself strongly {{on the subject}} of retaliation. [...] "Of all laws it is the most difficult to execute, where you have not the transgressor himself in your possession. Humanity will ever interfere, and plead strongly against the sacrifice of an innocent person for the guilt of another." [...] His judgment and feelings were soon put to the proof in this respect. A New York refugee, by the name of Philip White, had been captured by the Jersey people, and killed in attempting to escape. His partisans in New York determined on a signal revenge. Captain Joseph Huddy, who had been captured when bravely defending a blockhouse in Monmouth County, was now drawn forth from prison, conducted into the Jerseys by a party of refugees, headed by a Captain Lippencott, and hanged on the heights of Middletown. The neighboring country cried out for retaliation. Washington submitted the matter to a board of general and field-officers. It was unanimously determined that the offender should be demanded for execution, and, if not given up, that retaliation should be exercised on a British prisoner of equal rank. Washington accordingly sent proofs to Sir Henry Clinton of what he stigmatized as a murder, and demanded that the officer who commanded the execution of Captain Huddy should be given up. Sir Henry declined a compliance, but stated that he had ordered a strict inquiry into the circumstances of Captain Huddy's death, and would bring the perpetrators of it to immediate trial.|$|E

5000|$|Hug High's first principal, Bud Garfinkle, {{opened the}} school for the 1968-69 {{academic}} year with only sophomores and juniors; the first senior class graduated in 1970. Hug was a three year high school until the 1972-73 academic year when freshmen were admitted as all Washoe County High Schools transitioned to four year schools. As Hug was founded in the late 1960s when the U.S. was undergoing intense social change and political turmoil (especially in relation to guaranteeing equal rights to all of its citizens and fighting an increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam), the events of this period contributed to the idealism of the school's first years. In <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>letter,</b> Garfinkle reiterates these sentiments: [...] "I feel as if I {{gave birth to a}} child...
