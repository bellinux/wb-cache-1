5000|$|Tameca Jones is a {{soul and}} R&B singer {{residing}} in Austin, Texas. She grew her fan base though a residency {{at one of}} the Continental Club Gallery, which reached capacity every time she played. [...] Tameca spent years breathing new life into the music of others and made a name for herself as the “Queen of Austin Soul." [...] Tameca received major <b>accolates</b> from Billboard Magazine for her performance at the 2015 Austin Music Awards where she paid tribute to late beloved musician Ian McLagan alongside legends like Steven Van Zandt, Charlie Sexton, Alejandro Escovedo, and Patty Griffin. Billboard said she “raised the roof,” [...] while the Austin Chronicle called her performance “showstopping.” [...] In 2015, Gary Clark Jr. enlisted Tameca to sing on a track for his second studio album. Tameca also partnered with some very respected Texas musicians for her debut EP of originals that came out in October 2015. The EP’s first single, “Hot and Bothered,” a Motown inspired cut Tameca wrote about a crush. The album is a patchwork of all of her influences from her career tricking out covers.|$|R

50|$|The {{surgical}} implantation methods that have reduced capsular contracture include submuscular breast implant placement, using either textured or polyurethane-coated implants, limited {{handling of the}} implants, minimal contact with the chest wall skin before their insertions, and irrigating the surgical sites with triple-antibiotic solutions. The correction of capsular contracture might require the surgical removal (release) of the capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant, itself. Closed capsulotomy (disrupting the capsule via external manipulation), a once-common maneuver for treating hard capsules, was discontinued because it might rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical methods of treating capsules include massage, external ultrasound, treatment with leukotriene pathway inhibitors (e.g. <b>Accolate,</b> Singulair), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy.|$|E

The first single was [...] "Electricidad" [...] (Eng: Electricity) which reached the peak position in 10 {{countries and the}} top 5 in the USA. In the same year she received five awards for Best Singer for her work Con mi Sentimiento. In 1992, she was selected as Queen of Viña del Mar Festival in the Viña del Mar International Song Festival. She returned to the ranchera genre with the album Lucero de México, once again produced by Rubén Fuentes. The promotion of the album was big, since her first ranchero album had not been well promoted. Sales achieved the gold status in Central America and Chile. In Mexico, they reached the double platinum, {{becoming one of the}} best selling albums of ranchera music. She was a recipient of the special <b>accolate</b> in the TVyNovelas Awards as Best Legs in the Mexican Media. During the year she was designated the singer with most international projection by the critics. In 1993, Lucero received a nomination for the Lo Nuestro Awards for Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year.|$|E
40|$|Capsular {{contracture}} is {{a highly}} distressing, difficult complication after breast augmentation for both {{the patient and the}} surgeon. Although capsular contracture is a multifactorial process, one common denominator in the successful treatment of this complication {{is believed to be the}} abatement of inflammation. Leukotriene antagonists have recently emerged as effective prophylactic agents in reactive airway diseases. Anecdotal reports have indicated that zafirlukast (<b>Accolate,</b> AstraZeneca) effectively reverses capsular contracture. A prospective study of capsular contracture in 120 female patients in whom a total of 216 prostheses were implanted was performed. The hardness of capsular contracture was assessed by means of the mammary compliance method (Anton Paar Mammacompliance system). The patients were divided into two groups: patients in group A received zatirlukast for a 6 -month period, while those in group B received vitamin E. The results show a significant decrease of the values of breast compliance after 6 months in group A but not in group B and that the variation in compliance after 6 months in group A compared to group B is statistically significant. In zafirlukast-treated patients, we observed a reduction in mammary compliance of 7. 69 % after 1 month, 16. 78 % after 3 months and 24. 01 % after 6 months. The present study suggests that zafirlukast may be effective in reducing pain and breast capsule distortion in patients with longstanding contracture who are either not surgical candidates or who do not wish to undergo surgery...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundCapsular {{contracture}} is {{the most}} troublesome complication in breast implant surgery. Although capsule formation {{can be seen as}} a normal reaction to a foreign body, it can induce pain, hardness, deformity, and other pathologic problems. Surgical intervention is required in severe cases, but even surgery cannot guarantee a successful outcome without recurrence. This experimental study confirms that single topical administration of leukotriene antagonist zafirlukast (<b>Accolate,</b> Astrazeneca) reduces peri-implant capsule formation and prevents capsular contracture. MethodsTwelve smooth-surfaced cohesive gel implants were implanted in New Zealand White rabbits. These miniature implants were designed to be identical to currently used products for breast augmentation. The rabbits were divided into 2 groups. In the experimental group (n= 6), the implant and normal saline with zafirlukast were inserted in the submuscular pocket. In the control group (n= 6), the implant and normal saline alone were used. Two months later, the implants with peri-implant capsule were excised. We evaluated capsule thickness and collagen pattern and performed immunohistochemical staining of myofibroblasts, transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, 2. ResultsThe thickness of the capsules in the experimental group was reduced in both dorsal and ventral directions. The collagen pattern showed parallel alignment with low density, and the number of myofibroblasts as well as the amounts of TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 2 were reduced in the experimental group. ConclusionsWe suggest that single topical administration of leukotriene antagonist zafirlukast can be helpful in reducing capsule formation and preventing capsular contracture via myofibroblast suppression, modulation of fibroblastic cytokines, and anti-inflammatory effect...|$|E
