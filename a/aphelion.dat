5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its <b>aphelion,</b> the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the planet is currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the planet {{is more likely to be}} closer to its <b>aphelion</b> at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their <b>aphelion,</b> in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an <b>aphelion</b> in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next <b>aphelion</b> came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|The earth {{being very}} near <b>aphelion</b> (furthest {{away from the}} sun in its {{elliptical}} orbit, making its angular diameter nearly as small as possible).|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} orbit, it is {{even farther}} from the Sun than at present, with its <b>aphelion</b> {{estimated}} at 937AU (31 times Neptune's distance), {{making it one of}} the most distant-known objects in the Solar System other than long-period comets.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its <b>aphelion</b> around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to <b>aphelion.</b> Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aphelion,</b> or {{farthest}} {{point from}} the Sun, {{would be in}} the general direction of the constellation of Taurus, whereas the perihelion, the nearest point to the Sun, {{would be in the}} general direction of the southerly areas of Serpens (Caput), Ophiuchus, and Libra.|$|E
5|$|Arabic astronomical {{contributions}} include Albatenius' {{discovery that}} {{the direction of}} the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing. (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the <b>aphelion</b> of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an <b>aphelion</b> far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|George Forbes was {{the first}} to {{postulate}} the existence of trans-Neptunian planets in 1880, and his work is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories. In Forbes's model the planet had a semi-major axis of ∼300 AU (roughly three hundred times the distance from Earth to the Sun); locations were based on clustering of the <b>aphelion</b> distances of periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at <b>aphelion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sedna's highly {{elliptical}} orbit means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, which suggests that, unless its discovery was a fluke, another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3AU, an <b>aphelion</b> of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years. It may {{have been affected by}} the same processes as Sedna.|$|E
5|$|The {{search in}} {{databases}} of stellar objects performed by Batygin and Brown has already excluded {{much of the}} sky the predicted planet could be in, save the direction of its <b>aphelion,</b> or in the difficult to spot backgrounds where the orbit crosses {{the plane of the}} Milky Way, where most stars lie. This search included the archival data from the Catalina Sky Survey to magnitude c. 19, Pan-STARRS to magnitude 21.5, and infrared data from WISE.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near <b>aphelion</b> with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E
5|$|Eris (68AU average) is {{the largest}} known {{scattered}} disc object, and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet, because it is 25% more massive than Pluto and about the same diameter. It is the most massive of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an <b>aphelion</b> of 97.6 AU, and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane.|$|E
5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed <b>aphelion</b> in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit {{over the course of a}} billion years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean {{distance to the}} Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, {{greater than that of}} Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to the Sun at perihelion than Vesta and further out at <b>aphelion</b> than Ceres. Juno had the most eccentric orbit of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more eccentric orbit.|$|E
5|$|The 4:1 orbital {{resonance}} with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06AU, can {{be considered}} the inner boundary of the asteroid belt. Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits. Most bodies formed inside the radius of this gap were swept up by Mars (which has an <b>aphelion</b> at 1.67AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in {{the early history of}} the Solar System. The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance, but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.|$|E
5|$|The average {{distance}} between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68km/s, it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about years), to finish one revolution around the Sun. The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48° {{relative to the}} orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and <b>aphelion</b> distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957AU, on average. The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).|$|E
5|$|The dwarf planet Pluto (39AU average) is {{the largest}} known object in the Kuiper belt. When {{discovered}} in 1930, it {{was considered to be}} the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5AU at <b>aphelion.</b> Pluto has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its <b>aphelion,</b> and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E
5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, {{the two are}} not the same. The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one seventh {{the distance to the}} <b>aphelion</b> of Sedna, and it has not yet entered the Oort cloud, the source region of long-period comets, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its <b>aphelion</b> (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (<b>aphelion)</b> will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the <b>aphelion.</b> Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose {{barycenter}} with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (<b>aphelion).</b>|$|E
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its <b>aphelion.</b> The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is by far}} the {{brightest}} object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of −26.74. This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of −1.46. The mean distance of the Sun's center to Earth's center is approximately , though the distance varies as Earth moves from perihelion in January to <b>aphelion</b> in July. At this average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 19 seconds, while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life on Earth by photosynthesis, and drives Earth's climate and weather.|$|E
5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's <b>aphelion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tracing {{back the}} comet's orbital motion {{revealed}} {{that it had}} been orbiting Jupiter for some time. It is likely that it was captured from a solar orbit in the early 1970s, although the capture may have occurred as early as the mid-1960s. Several other observers found images of the comet in precovery images obtained before March 24, including Kin Endate from a photograph exposed on March 15, S. Otomo on March 17, and a team led by Eleanor Helin from images on March 19. No precovery images dating back to earlier than March 1993 have been found. Before the comet was captured by Jupiter, it was probably a short-period comet with an <b>aphelion</b> just inside Jupiter's orbit, and a perihelion interior to the asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis {{is defined as the}} line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long axis of the planet Mercury is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and <b>aphelion.</b> Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally {{no more than a few}} degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown and {{his team}} favored the {{hypothesis}} that Sedna was lifted into its current orbit by a star from the Sun's birth cluster, arguing that Sedna's <b>aphelion</b> of about 1,000AU, which is relatively close compared to those of long-period comets, is not distant enough {{to be affected by}} passing stars at their current distances from the Sun. They propose that Sedna's orbit is best explained by the Sun having formed in an open cluster of several stars that gradually disassociated over time. That hypothesis has also been advanced by both Alessandro Morbidelli and Scott Jay Kenyon. Computer simulations by Julio A. Fernandez and Adrian Brunini suggest that multiple close passes by young stars in such a cluster would pull many objects into Sedna-like orbits. A study by Morbidelli and Levison suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna's orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (approximately 800AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or so of the Solar System's existence.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its <b>aphelion</b> remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its <b>aphelion,</b> or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E
25|$|Dust storms {{are most}} common during perihelion, when the planet {{receives}} 40 percent more sunlight than during <b>aphelion.</b> During <b>aphelion</b> water ice clouds {{form in the}} atmosphere, interacting with the dust particles and affecting {{the temperature of the}} planet.|$|E
