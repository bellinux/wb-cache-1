5|$|Not every {{scene was}} {{performed}} live; {{because of the}} increased budget — £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly double the amount spent on The Quatermass Experiment — Cartier was able to include {{a larger proportion of}} pre-filmed inserts on 35mm film, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shell</b> Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.|$|E

25|$|Around 1952, Shell was {{the first}} company to {{purchase}} and use a computer in the Netherlands.

50|$|When MWCNTs {{are loaded}} in tension it is {{difficult}} to grasp their inner shells. Tensile tests of MWCNTs attached to atomic force microscope (AFM) tips at both ends show that fracture occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>shell</b> in a way such that majority loading occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>shell</b> and little load transfer occurs to <b>the</b> inner <b>shells.</b> This causes <b>the</b> stiffness and strength of MWCNTs to be lower than they would be if <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> were loaded equally.|$|R

25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell)</b> or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|E
500|$|The storm brought {{strong winds}} to Texas, with gusts up to [...] {{reported}} at the cooling towers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shell</b> Oil Refinery in Deer Park and the Humble Oil Refinery in Baytown. Four towers were destroyed at the latter, while other damage there reduced production of toluene, which is a precursor to TNT. Some towers were also toppled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shell</b> Oil Refinery in Deer Park. As these were the primary refineries producing aviation fuel for World War II, {{it was decided that}} news about this loss of production should be censored. A number of other oil derricks were destroyed throughout Chambers and Jefferson counties. At Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base near Houston, strong winds blew off the top of a hangar, destroyed five planes, and injured at least 22cadets. Thousands in the Houston were left without telephone and electrical service, which caused all three radio stations in the area to go off air. The nearby Houston Yacht Club also suffered heavy damage. At Point Bolivar, located on the Bolivar Peninsula, nearly all homes were destroyed by the high winds. The high school's physical education building in La Porte, which was originally a three story building, was reduced to only one floor after windows shattered and the support beams toppled, causing the roof to collapse. At nearby Morgan's Point, a water tower was knocked over. On Galveston Island, a number of brick businesses, buildings, and churches collapsed.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>shell</b> growth {{takes place}} during the snail’s {{development}} through the addition of material from <b>the</b> mantle collar <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell’s</b> opening. During this process, the mantle collar movements and also its state of turgidity, determines <b>the</b> <b>shell’s</b> shape and ornamentation variations. Therefore, the variation in <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> formation process, in terms of systematic and regular changes, results in polymorphisms observed in adult individuals (Raup 1961; Patel 2009). In this sense, <b>the</b> study of <b>shell</b> ontogeny allow us to describe the sequence of changes in shell shape, observed during the snail’s development and, as a result, {{it is possible to}} understand the structural mechanisms that create the diversity of shapes in different species, as well as the polymorphisms found in one species.|$|R
