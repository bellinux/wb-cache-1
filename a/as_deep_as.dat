5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, {{in part because the}} producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E
5|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that albatrosses were predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents, predators, or death. The deployment of capillary depth recorders, which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird, has shown that while some species, like the wandering albatross, do not dive deeper than a metre, some species, like the light-mantled albatross, have a mean diving depth of almost 5m and can dive <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> 12.5m. In addition to surface feeding and diving, they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with early}} April 1944, Stavka ordered the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts {{to mount a}} major {{offensive}} with strategic implications in western Romania. Stavkas strategic intentions were to break German and Romanian strategic defenses in northern Romania, capture the key cities of Iași and Chișinău, and afterwards project forces deep into Romanian territory, if possible <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> Ploiești and Bucharest. By 5 April, Konev's front had crossed {{the upper reaches of}} Dniester and Prut Rivers, captured Khotyn and Dorohoi, and approached Târgu Frumos and Botoșani regions—– northwest of Iași—facing only light Romanian resistance. On 8 April 1944, Konev ordered the 27th and 40th Armies to conduct a coordinated offensive southward along the Târgu Frumos axis, in close cooperation with Semyon Bogdanov's 2nd Tank Army. While Konev's shock group was advancing towards Târgu Frumos, Konstantin Koroteev's 52nd Army and elements of Andrei Gravchenko's 6th Tank Army, which were operating north of Iași, were conducting operations alongside the Iași axis in order to support Konev's main effort.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} soil {{associations}} in Juniata County. One {{of these is}} the Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association. It is a deep and fairly well-drained soil that is found in 24% of the county. It is mostly found in the county's forested areas. The Berks-Weikert-Bedington Association is also found in the county. It is found in 33% of the county's area and is not <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> the Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association, but is well-drained. The soil is mostly found in agricultural lands and some forested areas. Another soil association in the county is the Edon-Opequon-Weikert Association, which is a well-drained soil that occupies 17% of the county. The Elliber-Kreamer-Mertz Association is a deep and well-drained soil that makes up 12% of the county. The Chenango-Pope-Holly Association and the Morrison-Hazelton-Clymer Association make up 7% and 6% of the county, respectively. They are both deep and occur on gentle slopes. However, the former is poorly drained, while the latter is well-drained. The Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association is well-drained and makes up 1% of the county's area.|$|E

25|$|The Uranian moon Miranda, the {{innermost}} {{of the five}} large moons, was discovered {{to be one of}} the strangest bodies yet seen in the Solar System. Detailed images from Voyager 2s flyby of Miranda showed huge canyons made from geological faults <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> , terraced layers, and a mixture of old and young surfaces. One hypothesis suggests that Miranda might consist of a reaggregation of material following an earlier event when Miranda was shattered into pieces by a violent impact.|$|E
25|$|Medical ultrasonography, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and OCT are differently suited to morphological tissue imaging: while the first two have whole body but low resolution imaging capability (typically {{a fraction of a}} millimeter), the third one can provide images with resolutions well below 1 micrometer (i.e. sub-cellular), between 0 and 100 micrometers in depth, and the fourth can probe <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> 500 micrometers, but with a lower (i.e. architectural) resolution (around 10 micrometers in lateral and a few micrometers in depth in ophthalmology, for instance, and 20 micrometers in lateral in endoscopy).|$|E

25|$|Fully {{developed}} baby H. pomatia snails hatch about 3 to 4 {{weeks after}} the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> , and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This {{is a response to}} both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} protagonists, Mihai {{is the most}} level-headed, experienced, and least anti-heroic of the group. Despite his old age and being human, Mihai has skills that equate or even exceed most of the cast. However, Mihai has a terrible sense of {{direction}} and has a constant run of bad luck. He and Badou share a close bond along with Kiri and Mimi, and also shares concern for Heine and Naoto. So far, his link to the underground is not <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> the others, but Richter Berthein seems to {{know a great deal}} about the assassin.|$|E
25|$|Willy DeVille's Backstreets of Desire stands tall as his {{masterpiece}} as both {{a singer}} and a songwriter. DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him up to make this disc... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a tapestry of roots rock and Crescent City second line, traces of 1950s doo-wop, and elegant sweeping vistas of Spanish soul balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying {{to get off the}} street. The sound of the album balances Creole soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille sounds like a man resurrected, digging <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> the cavernous recesses of the human heart.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory located a previously unknown active seismic zone running from Stamford, Connecticut, to the Hudson Valley town of Peekskill, New York—the {{intersection of the}} Stamford-Peekskill line with the well-known Ramapo Fault—which passes {{less than a mile}} north of the Indian Point nuclear power plant. The Ramapo Fault is the longest fault in the Northeast, but scientists dispute how active this roughly 200-million-year-old fault really is. Many earthquakes in the state’s surprisingly varied seismic history are believed to have occurred on or near it. Visible at ground level, the fault line likely extends <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> nine miles below the surface.|$|E
25|$|A demi-pointe shoe, {{which is}} also {{variously}} called a break-down, pre-pointe, or a soft-block shoe, shares many characteristics with pointe shoes. For example, its outer appearance resembles that of a pointe shoe {{and it has a}} toe box, although the box is softer and the wings (sides of the toe box) are typically not <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> those found on pointe shoes. Demi-pointe shoes are secured to the feet with ribbons and elastic band in identical fashion to pointe shoes. Unlike pointe shoes, however, demi-pointe shoes have no shank and, as a result, they do not provide the support necessary for proper pointe work.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{concentration}} of saliva and presumably toxin in the granulomatous reaction around the tick mouth parts. It is thought by some experimenters that the residual toxin located in this granuloma is at least partially responsible for the increasing paralysis which occurs after the tick is removed. By comparison, the North American paralysis tick Dermacentor andersoni (found in the Rocky Mtns) does not produce a granuloma {{at the site of}} attachment, and in this case the paralysis rapidly regresses after the tick is removed. Unlike Dermacentor andersoni, Ixodes holocyclus is a deep feeder with a long hypostome (which may penetrate <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> <b>as</b> 1689um).|$|E
