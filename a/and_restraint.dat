During the voyage he wrote a series of {{articles}} which resulted in his book Liberty, Equality, Fraternity (1873–1874)--a protest against John Stuart Mill's neo-utilitarianism.

25|$|Antislavery, {{like many}} other reform {{movements}} of the period, {{was influenced by the}} legacy of the Second Great Awakening, a period of religious revival in the new country stressing the reform of individuals which was still relatively fresh in the American memory. Thus, while the reform spirit of the period was expressed by a variety of movements with often-conflicting political goals, most reform movements shared a common feature in their emphasis on the Great Awakening principle of transforming the human personality through discipline, order, <b>and</b> <b>restraint.</b>|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{demand has}} been held down by the {{combination}} of the price shock {{at the start of the}} stabilization program, steeply falling real wages, reduced government deficits, and much tighter restraint of credit. All these were deliberate measures to stop inflation, accepting the likely costs of higher unemployment <b>and</b> <b>restraint</b> of production as necessary to that end. In 1990 GNP fell 3.9 percent, aggravating the plunge of 19 percent between 1988 and 1990. In 1991 production turned up slightly, with a gain of 2.9 percent in GNP. That situation left output per capita essentially unchanged from 1990 and at 29 percent below its level a decade earlier.|$|E

25|$|During {{the weeks}} after the sinking, the issue was hotly debated within the administration. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan urged {{compromise}} <b>and</b> <b>restraint.</b> The US, he believed, should try to persuade the British to abandon their interdiction of foodstuffs and limit their mine-laying operations {{at the same time}} as the Germans were persuaded to curtail their submarine campaign. He also suggested that the US government issue an explicit warning against US citizens travelling on any belligerent ships. Despite being sympathetic to Bryan's antiwar feelings, Wilson insisted that the German government must apologise for the sinking, compensate US victims, and promise to avoid any similar occurrence in the future.|$|E
25|$|This Society was {{incorporated}} {{for the purpose}} of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety <b>and</b> <b>restraint,</b> or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.|$|E
25|$|Six and Out - If {{you hit it}} {{over the}} fence you're out {{and you have to}} get the ball. The 6 runs are usually not awarded to the batsman unless agreed to by both teams. This rule is {{especially}} popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to any ball that lands over the fence - not just 6's), and encourages the batsman to exercise control <b>and</b> <b>restraint</b> by aiming for 4's instead of 6's. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.|$|E

25|$|His {{personal}} style, {{characterized by}} superior proportions, balance, symmetry, <b>and</b> <b>restraint,</b> became the New York local style. Many apprentices and journeymen exposed to this distinctive style by serving {{a stint in}} the Phyfe shop or by copying the master cabinetmaker's designs helped to create and sustain this local school of cabinetmaking. Demand for Phyfe's work reached its peak between 1805 and 1820, although he remained a dominant figure in the trade until 1847, when he retired at the age of seventy-seven. Within the short span of a single generation, however, the work of the master was all but forgotten until the revival in the 1920s, when different furniture companies replicated his designs for several decades.|$|E
25|$|Seen in its wider social context, Greek Revival {{architecture}} {{sounded a}} new note of sobriety <b>and</b> <b>restraint</b> in public buildings in Britain around 1800 as an assertion of nationalism attendant on the Act of Union, the Napoleonic Wars, and the clamour for political reform. It {{was to be}} William Wilkins's winning design for the public competition for Downing College, Cambridge that announced the Greek style {{was to be a}} dominant idiom in architecture, especially for public buildings of this sort. Wilkins and Robert Smirke went on to build {{some of the most important}} buildings of the era, including the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (1808–09), the General Post Office (1824–29) and the British Museum (1823–48), the Wilkins Building of University College London (1826–30) and the National Gallery (1832–38).|$|E
25|$|Freedom from abuse, neglect, and {{violations}} of a person's rights {{are also important}} goals of the disability rights movement.

For he had already learned that there were such restrictions. Hunger he had known; and when he could not appease his hunger he had felt restriction. The hard obstruction of the cave-wall, the sharp nudge of his mother's nose, the smashing stroke of her paw, the hunger unappeased of several famines, had borne in upon him that all was not freedom in the world, that to life there was limitations <b>and</b> <b>restraints.</b> These limitations <b>and</b> <b>restraints</b> were laws. To be obedient to them was to escape hurt and make for happiness.|$|R
