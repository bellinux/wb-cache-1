60|$|From {{the bed of}} {{the river}} we rise into cloudy regions, and finally come out into the clear in a meadow, where Wotan, the god of gods, and his consort Fricka lie sleeping. Wotan, you will observe, has lost one eye; and you will {{presently}} learn that he plucked it out voluntarily as the price to be paid for his alliance with Fricka, who in return has brought to him as her dowry all the powers of Law. The meadow is {{on the brink of a}} ravine, beyond which, towering on distant heights, stands Godhome, a mighty castle, newly built as a house of state for the one-eyed god and his all-ruling wife. Wotan has not yet seen this castle except in his dreams: two giants have just built it for him whilst he slept; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> before him for the first time when Fricka wakes him. In that majestic burg he is to rule with her and through her over the humble giants, who have eyes to gape at the glorious castles their own hands have built from his design, but no brains to design castles for themselves, or to comprehend divinity. As a god, he is to be great, secure, and mighty; but he is also to be passionless, affectionless, wholly impartial; for Godhead, if it is to live with Law, must have no weaknesses, no respect for persons. All such sweet littlenesses must be left to the humble stupid giants to make their toil sweet to them; and the god must, after all, pay for Olympian power the same price the dwarf has paid for Plutonic power.|$|E

5000|$|Pathet (Javanese spelling; also patet) is an {{organizing}} {{concept in}} Central Javanese gamelan music.

Pathet is [...] "a limitation on the player's choice of variation, so that while in one pathet a certain note may be prominent, in another it must be avoided, or used only for special effect. Awareness of such limitations, and exploration of variation within them reflects a basic philosophical aim of gamelan music, and indeed all art in central Java, namely, the restraint and refinement of one's own behaviour." [...] Javanese often give poetic explanations of pathet, such as [...] "Pathet is the couch or bed of a melody." [...] In essence, a pathet indicates which notes are stressed in the melody, especially {{at the end of}} phrases (seleh), as well as determines which elaborations (cengkok and sekaran) are appropriate.

It has a duration of three minutes and thirty seconds (3:30). The song is a midtempo sentimental pop ballad that incorporates synthesizers, piano and drums in its instrumentation. The song begins with synths and piano [...] "fluttering" [...] in the background, emphasizing Kelly's vocals, before building to a more bombastic production style with the inclusion of the drum and hand-clap percussion. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing Company Inc., the song is written in the key of D minor, with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. Kelly's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of a G5 belt and an A5 in head voice. Lyrically, the song describes a hollow life becoming filled with love, which Kelly attributes to her faith, describing [...] "Hollow" [...] as her [...] "love song to God." [...] Kelly described the song as [...] ""honest," [...] "vulnerable" [...] and [...] "epic."

The dialect was watching the working class growing up in Lahore. A lot of the mannerisms were things I observed in young girls begging on the street. So yes there was some character research involved at my end but everything else was thanks to the genius, Ahson Talish. He crafted the crassness of Rani beautifully, he created her. [...] Alongside Shah, actress Sana Nawaz {{was approached}} by Mahesh Waswani for the role of Nigar Begum. The series was her second Hum TV project where she portrayed a challenging role, speaking about her character Nawaz comments I play a character called Nigar, I really liked this role because it was very challenging and quite different from what I have done up till now ...
