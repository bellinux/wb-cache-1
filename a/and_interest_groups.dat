5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race {{that they would not}} accept {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> On January 23, 2012, both candidates signed the agreement, or People's Pledge. While no outside groups were obligated by the agreement, both candidates agreed to donate a sum equal to 50% of an advertisement run by any groups to a charity of the other candidate's choice. The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of Americans for Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign agreed to make donations of $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{its history}} the National Register has been {{administered}} by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated {{in terms of the}} four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria {{has been the subject of}} criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.|$|E

25|$|Baán {{has faced}} {{criticism}} before from both other institutions <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> having radically transformed his museum from 2004 onward {{from one of}} relative obscurity to being an extensive contributor of loans to major international exhibits. While his process of fast modernization and innovation {{was supported by the}} government, it went against the typical standard of slow (or even non-existent) change in non–contemporary, eastern European museums.|$|E
25|$|This {{evidence}} of warfare, conflict, and cannibalism is hotly debated by some scholars <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> Suggested alternatives include: a community suffering {{the pressure of}} starvation or extreme social stress, dismemberment and cannibalism as religious ritual or in response to religious conflict, the influx of outsiders seeking to drive out a settled agricultural community via calculated atrocity, or an invasion of a settled region by nomadic raiders who practiced cannibalism. Such peoples have existed in other times and places, e.g. the Androphagi of Russia according to Herodotus.|$|E

25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{efforts have}} also faced resistance in another form. The priority placed on vaccination by national authorities has {{turned it into}} a bargaining chip, with communities <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> resisting vaccination, not due to direct opposition, but to leverage other concessions from governmental authorities. In Nigeria this has taken the form of 'block rejection' of vaccination, which is only resolved when state officials agree to repair or improve schools and health-care facilities, pave roads or install electricity. There have been several instances of threatened boycotts by health workers in Pakistan over payment disputes.|$|E
25|$|Right-wing critics Morton and Knopff {{have raised}} several {{concerns}} about the Charter, notably by alleging {{that the federal government}} has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> In their book The Charter Revolution & the Court Party, Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Trudeau and Chrétien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the Court Challenges Program to support minority language educational rights claims. Morton and Knopff also assert that crown counsel has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights, particularly gay rights and women's rights.|$|E
