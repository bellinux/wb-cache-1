5|$|The Old Court – New Court {{controversy}} was a 19th-century political {{controversy in}} the U.S. state of Kentucky in which the Kentucky General Assembly abolished the Kentucky Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>and</b> {{replaced it with a}} new court. The justices of the old court refused to recognize the action as valid, and for a time, two separate courts operated as the court of last resort for the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} sections are the amendments. For reasons unknown, this constitution {{has never}} been directly updated since its adoption. The amendments are enumerated in this Article. Essentially, {{this section of the}} article records the development of the constitution through amendments. Such amendments include the abolishment of the New Jersey Court of Errors and <b>Appeals</b> <b>and</b> Chancery, transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts, such as the New Jersey Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>and</b> replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>and</b> replace it with a more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of <b>Appeals,</b> <b>and</b> 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{accounted}} for roughly 90 {{percent of the}} Manhattan Project's total cost. The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal <b>appeals,</b> <b>and</b> congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>and</b> affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Following these decisions, the General Assembly {{attempted}} {{to remove all}} three justices from their positions, but lacked the two-thirds majority required for impeachment. The Assembly then {{attempted to}} abolish the Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>and</b> create a new one, beginning the Old Court-New Court controversy. The members of the existing court – Owsley, John Boyle, and Benjamin Mills – continued functioning in that role, while a new court of four pro-relief justices was organized by the legislature. For a time, both courts {{claimed to be the}} court of last resort in Kentucky, but by 1826, supporters of the Old Court won control of the legislature and abolished the New Court.|$|E
