25|$|In June 1974 it was {{necessary}} to unobstruct the tower, consolidate the masonry walls and reinforce the vaulted ceilings. The principal tower and cistern were cleared and renovated during this time, but further work on the walls was needed in the intervening years, that included the consolidation of various points with schist masonry and clay cement and sand. At this time, there was an effort to raise the battlements along the southern and eastern walls. This was followed in 1977 by conservation of the walls and battlements, including consolidation of the <b>access</b> <b>stairs</b> to the castle. The battlements along various points (eastern, near the cistern and southeast) were carried out to prevent landslides. Excess vegetation was cleared from within the walls, opening up the spaces for future observation.|$|E

Spare relief work decorates the panels, and an <b>access</b> <b>stair</b> and handrail, braced by decorative cast brackets, accentuates the profile.|$|R

It stands on a raised terrace approached by a wide monumental staircase. The structure has four identical faces. On each face an Ionic screen of six columns, behind which are tall banks of windows, and is surmounted by symbolic standing figures designed by Henry Hering: Courage, Memory, Peace, Victory, Liberty, and Patriotism. The sculptures are repeated on each façade. On the south side, standing on a pink granite base {{in the center of}} the grand <b>access</b> <b>stairs,</b> is Hering's colossal exultant male nude bronze Pro Patria (1929); it is [...] high, weighs seven tons, and was the largest cast bronze sculpture in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major event}} that enabled Finland to display its modernist {{architecture}} credentials was the Helsinki Olympic Games. Key among the buildings was the Olympic Stadium by architects Yrjö Lindegren and Toivo Jäntti, {{the first version}} of which was the result of an architectural competition in 1938, intended for the games due to be held in 1940 (cancelled due to the war), but eventually held in an enlarged stadium in 1952. The importance of the Olympic Games for architecture was that it coupled the modern, white Functionalist architecture with modernisation of the nation, giving it public endorsement; indeed the general public could contribute to the funding of the stadium's construction by purchasing various souvenir trinkets. Other channels by which Functionalist architecture developed was by means of various state architecture offices, such as the military, industry, and to a small extent tourism. A strong [...] "white Functionalism" [...] characterised the mature architecture of Erkki Huttunen, head of the building department of the retail cooperative Suomen Osuuskauppojen Keskuskunta (SOK), as evident in their production works, warehouses, offices and even shops built throughout the country; the first of these was a combined office and warehouse in Rauma (1931), with white-rendered walls, roof terrace with [...] "ship railing" [...] balustrade, large street-level windows and curved <b>access</b> <b>stairs.</b> The Ministry of Defence had its own building-architecture department, and during the 1930s many of the military's buildings were designed in the [...] "white Functionalism" [...] style. Two examples were the Viipuri military hospital and Tilkka military hospital in Helsinki (1936), both designed by Olavi Sortta. Following independence there was a growing tourism industry with an emphasis on experiencing the wilderness of Lapland: the fashionable white Functionalist architecture of the Hotel Pohjanhovi in Rovaniemi by Pauli E. Blomstedt (1936, destroyed in the Lapland War in 1944) catered to the growing middle-class Finnish tourists as well as foreign tourists to Lapland, though at the same time more modest hostels designed in a vernacular rustic style were also being built.|$|E

50|$|Major {{works of}} {{restoration}} began in 1912 {{under the auspices}} of the state. Fragments of stone which had fallen from the portal were returned to place, the whole north wall of the choir was rebuilt and both the cross-vaulting of the aisles and the coffering of the nave were done away with. The walls of the crypt and its <b>access</b> <b>stair</b> were also rebuilt. In a later restoration the pavements of the nave and crypt were raised and remade using slabs of local stone.

5000|$|The {{architecture}} of the Mansion House, {{and the process of}} designing the home, reflected the communal values prized by the Oneida Community. The ideas for the 1862 house were discussed in evening meetings, with the group eventually settling on a plan for an Italianate Villa-style structure. The first floor housed an office, reception room for visitors, library, and guest bedroom. Individual sleeping rooms were arrayed around communal siting rooms on the first, second and third floors. A five-story Italianate tower was located at the northeast corner of the House, overlooking the site and designed with its own <b>access</b> <b>stair</b> and entry ...|$|R
