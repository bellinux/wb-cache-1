So the focus is to use non-toxic medicinal compound to inhibit the corrosion of zinc. Corrosion of Zinc was inhibited using several inhibitor-like guaifenesin [23], ketosulfone [24], floctafenine [25], atenolol [26], N-arylpyrroles [27], <b>anisidines</b> [28], erythromycin [29], and hexamine [2]. The use of pharmaceutical compounds offers interesting possibilities for corrosion inhibition due to the presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen in their structure and is of particular interest because of their safe use, high solubility in water and high molecular size [30].|$|R
30|$|Many {{researchers}} also reported decreased peroxide values but increased <b>anisidine</b> values as bleaching temperature was increased. This conforms to expectation because the <b>anisidine</b> test is diagnostic for shorter chain aldehydes (including alkenals and dienals), which are secondary oxidation products of peroxide decomposition. Based on the discussions thus far, {{it might be}} concluded that higher bleaching temperatures are desirable because increased pigment removal and peroxide decomposition could be achieved with the lesser amounts of bleaching adsorbents. The problem, of course, is the increased levels of <b>anisidine</b> generated by higher bleach temperatures. It is clear that bleaching with activated carbons A 1 and A 2 has been conducted at 20  °C; {{that is why the}} <b>anisidine</b> number is increased less compared to A 3 and A 4. Moreover, in American trading rules, the maximum red colour of bleached sunflower oil is 2.5 and the maximum yellow colour is 25.

This work focused {{on the development of}} two Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy methods for the measurement of peroxide value (PV) and <b>anisidine</b> value (AV), representing the primary and secondary oxidation products of edible oils.

In this study sunflower, soybean and red palm oils were selected and the change in physico-chemical constants i. e. Color, Refractive Index, Free Fatty Acid, Peroxide Value, Iodine Value, <b>Anisidine</b> Value and β-Carotene were determined. The influencing factor was gamma radiation.

The non-radiated oils samples were used as a control. The free fatty acids, peroxide and <b>anisidine</b> values increase and iodine values decrease with the high doses of radiation. The red palm oil was found to contain 533 ppm of β-Carotene and thus show maximum stability. The level of β-Carotene in the sunflower and soybean was lesser and consequently show little radiolytic stability.

40|$|Whole {{grain and}} bran samples of two Malawian sorghums, Phatafuli, (a brown-coloured {{condensed}} tannin variety) and Shabalala, (a white-coloured condensed tannin-free variety) were analysed for their content of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activities. The effect of oxidizing conditions during extraction, and the storage stability of a freeze-dried crude phenolic extract (CPE) from the condensed tannin sorghum bran as influenced by packaging, storage temperature {{and length of}} storage, in relation to its content of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activity was also investigated. Antioxidant activity of the CPE, in comparison with tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), was then evaluated in sunflower oil at concentrations of 1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm in the absence or presence of ferric ions at 2. 2 and 4. 4 ppm in the dark at 65 oC. Progression of oxidation was monitored by measurement of peroxide values (PV) and <b>anisidine</b> values (AV) during a 14 -day storage period. Phatafuli contained higher content of total phenols and antioxidant activity than Shabalala both in the whole grain and the bran, {{probably due to the}} presence of condensed tannins in Phatafuli sorghum, which were not detected in Shabalala sorghum. For both sorghum varieties, the bran contained higher levels of total phenols and antioxidant activity than the whole grain, confirming that phenolic compounds in sorghum are largely concentrated in the bran. Antioxidant activities of the sorghum varieties correlated highly with their total phenol and condensed tannin contents, suggesting that the phenolic compounds were largely responsible for the antioxidant activities of the sorghum grains. Bubbling of oxygen into the liquid crude phenolic extract did not have any significant effect on the parameters tested. Similarly, vacuum-packed samples did not differ significantly in the parameters tested from the samples that were not vacuum-packed. CPE samples stored at – 20 oC had significantly higher levels of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activity than those stored at 25 oC during some days of storage. Storage time was however the major factor influencing the levels of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activity of the CPE from Phatafuli sorghum during storage, which suggested that CPE from condensed tannin sorghum bran might need to be used shortly after extraction to ensure optimum antioxidant activity. There was an insignificant correlation between the antioxidant activities of the CPE and their phenolic contents during storage, which could have been due to the formation of new compounds with a lower antioxidant capacity. The CPE inhibited oxidation of sunflower oil as shown by lower peroxide values and <b>anisidine</b> values compared to control samples. The CPE was however less effective in reducing peroxide values compared to TBHQ, but was similar to TBHQ in reducing <b>anisidine</b> values. In the presence of ferric ions, the CPE appeared to be less effective in reducing peroxide values compared to TBHQ, but appeared to be more effective than TBHQ in reducing <b>anisidine</b> values. The results showed that the tannin sorghum bran CPE appeared to act as both lipid radical scavengers and metal chelators. The CPE however imparted colour to the sunflower oil, which could limit its application as a natural antioxidant in edible oils.

In the case of <b>anisidine</b> (8 d), higher oligomers containing three or four azetidine residues, e. g. 10 a, were also formed. With more nucleophilic aliphatic amines, only 1 : 1 adducts of type 7 were obtained. The reaction course can be rationalized by the formation of intermediate zwitterions (11) via addition of the N-nucleophiles onto DCFM. The {{results show that the}} nucleophilicity of 1 a toward DCFM is lower than that of aliphatic amines but exceeds that of aromatic amines...|$|E
40|$|Polyanisidine nanofibers gas sensor {{based on}} a ZnO/ 36 ° YX LiTaO 3 surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) transducer was developed and tested at different concentrations of hydrogen gas in synthetic air. Nanofibrous mats of polyanisidine were synthesized {{without the need for}} templates or functional dopants by simply introducing an initiator into the reaction mixture of a rapidly mixed reaction between the monomer (<b>anisidine)</b> and the oxidant. The polyanisidine nanofibers are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-vis). Polyanisidine nanofibers were deposited onto the SAW transducer and exposed to different concentrations of hydrogen gas. The frequency shift due to the sensor response was 294 kHz towards 1 % of H 2. All tests were conducted at room temperature and the sensor performance was assessed for a two day period {{with a high degree of}} reproducibility obtained...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{proposes to}} {{examine the effect of}} {{temperature}} on the oxidation behavior of biodiesel. Soybean biodiesel was oxidized at different temperatures (room temperature, 60, and 110 °C), and the increase in primary and secondary oxidation products was determined based on the peroxide and <b>anisidine</b> values, respec-tively, during the induction period (IP). The results indicated that the evolution of hydroperoxides followed zero-order reaction kinetics during the IP at all temperatures, and their rate of formation was exponentially affected by temperature. It was also deduced that temperature influenced the ratio between primary and second-ary oxidation products formation, which decreased as the temperature increased. Additionally, it was possible to predict the oxidation behavior of the soybean biodiesel at room temperature by an exponential model fitted to the IP values at different temperatures (70, 80, 90, 100, and 110 °C) using the Rancimat apparatus...|$|E
40|$|Several {{structurally}} related <b>anisidine</b> and dibenzanthracene isomers {{were evaluated}} for genotoxic {{effects in the}} somatic w/w + assay of Drosophila melanogaster employing insecticide-susceptible (IS) and insecticide-resistant (IR) tester strains. In addition, {{and in order to}} find whether or not at the genetic level a regulatory effect is found, crosses between IS x IR strains and IR x IS strains were done. Chemicals tested were the aromatic amines (AAs) ortho-anisidine (o-AN), meta-anisidine (m-AN), and para-anisidine (p-AN) and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 1, 2; 3, 4 -dibenzanthracene (1, 2; 3, 4 -DBA) and 1, 2; 5, 6 -dibenzanthracene (1, 2; 5, 6 -DBA). As positive control N-nitrosodimethylamine (DMN) was used. Our results show that the genotoxic activity of DMN was higher in the IR than in the IS strain. There seems to be a tendency for slightly lower values as measured by clone induction in crosses between IS x IR and IR x IS. o-AN was positive in the IS strain and in crosses between IS x IR and IR x IS but negative in the IR strain. in-AN, p-AN and 1, 2; 3, 4 -DBA proved to be not recombinogenic in all strains and crosses while 1, 2; 5, 6 -DBA was positive at the highest concentration tested in all the crosses assayed. These findings show that the recombinogenic activity of the <b>anisidine</b> isomers depends on the position of the chemical group relative to one another and that the position of the benzene ring seems to be structurally relevant for genotoxicity of DBA isomers. With respect to IR and IS strains it remains to be determined to what extent the spectrum of metabolizing capacity really differs between the strains of the test assay. Thus more information is needed about the regulation and expression of the cytochrome-P 450 genes and action at the molecular level taking place in the eye imaginal disc as well as between insecticide susceptible and resistant strains after exposure to genotoxic chemicals.

40|$|Three {{types of}} fats, {{red palm oil}} (RPO), {{sunflower}} oil (SFO) and vegetable ghee (VC) were used for repeated deep fat frying of potato fillets (French fries) for 5 consecutive days @ 20 minutes per day at 190 - 200 oC and then allowed to cool for 18 hours. This practice was repeated for 10 times. The test oils were evaluated for physical and chemical deterioration. The quality indices i. e. peroxide value (POV), free fatty acid (FFA), <b>anisidine</b> value (A V), iodine value (IV) and colour (OD at 420 nm) of the samples were measured. It was found that all the quality parameters significantly (p< 0. 05) increased as frying time was advanced, while a reverse trend regarding IV was observed in each test oil. However, colour was negatively correlated with PO V, FFA and A V but positively with IV in case of RPO...|$|E
