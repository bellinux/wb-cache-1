5|$|Voight's {{successful}} {{prediction that}} an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a lateral eruption, an eruption from the volcano's flank {{rather than its}} summit, {{attracted the attention of}} the government of Montserrat in March 1996. Worried about an expanding lava dome at the Soufrière Hills volcano, the island's government asked Voight to assess its potential for an avalanche that could generate an eruption. Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse, but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of Plymouth in approximately three minutes. The city and a village on the mountain were evacuated, and within three years, pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites. Following these eruptions, Voight served {{as a member of the}} Risk <b>Assessment</b> <b>Panel</b> that advised Montserrat's government, and he co-established the Caribbean Andesite Lava Island Precision Seismo-geodetic Observatory (CALIPSO) with a team of international scientists. He continued research at the island with Steven Sparks, a geoscientist at the University of Bristol, establishing the SEA-CALIPSO system to analyze Soufrière Hills by using seismic waves and explosions in the ocean. Among other findings, this effort detected a major fault trending north-to-west under Montserrat's western side. Voight still oversees hazard assessments at the volcano, providing his input during eruptive periods in 2006 and 2010.|$|E

40|$|<b>Assessment</b> <b>panels</b> need to {{communicate}} scientific uncertainty, and often face choices {{about how to}} simplify or synthesize it. One important distinction is between uncertainty that has been modeled, and that which derives from disagreement among experts. From an economic decision-making perspective the two are in many ways logically equivalent, yet from psychological and social perspectives they are quite different. An experiment on the communication of climate change uncertainty suggests that the two framings of uncertainty differentially influence people's estimates of likelihood and their motivation to take responsive action. It is recommended that <b>assessment</b> <b>panels</b> {{pay close attention to}} the social features of uncertainty, such as conflict between experts...|$|R

40|$|Scientific <b>assessment</b> <b>panels</b> {{are playing}} {{increasingly}} influential roles in {{national and international}} policy formation. Although they typically appeal to the standard of journal peer review as their quality control criterion, {{there seems to be}} confusion about what peer review actually does. It is, at best, a necessary condition of reliability, but not a sufficient condition. There is also the problem that <b>assessment</b> <b>panels</b> may be biased in favor of one side or another when evaluating areas in which the science is unclear. In this paper I argue that additional checks and balances are needed on the information going into scientific assessment reports when it will be used to justify major policy investments. I propose two new mechanisms to bias-proof the outcome: an Audit Panel and a Counterweight Panel. The need for such mechanisms is discussed with reference to the "hockey stick" debate in climate change. " Copyright 2005 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society. ...|$|R
