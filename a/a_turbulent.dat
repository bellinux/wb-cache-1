5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to <b>a</b> <b>turbulent</b> flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E

40|$|An {{effect of}} {{rotation}} on <b>a</b> developed <b>turbulent</b> stratified convection is studied. Dependencies of the hydrodynamic helicity, the alpha-tensor and the effective drift {{velocity of the}} mean magnetic field on the rate of rotation and <b>an</b> anisotropy of <b>turbulent</b> convection are found. It is shown that in <b>an</b> anisotropic <b>turbulent</b> convection the alpha-effect can change its sign depending on the rate of rotation. Different properties of the effective drift velocity of the mean magnetic field in <b>a</b> rotating <b>turbulent</b> convection are found, e. g., {{there is a difference}} in the effective drift velocities for the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields; a toroidal effective drift velocity can play a role of an additional differential rotation. These effects and an effect of a nonzero divergence of the effective drift velocity of the toroidal magnetic field on a magnetic dynamo are studied. Astrophysical applications of the obtained results are discussed. Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures, REVTEX 4, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

5|$|Fauré's major sets of piano {{works are}} {{thirteen}} nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices.

His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Thème et variations in C major, and Huit pièces brèves. For piano duet, Fauré composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.|$|E

40|$|A new mean-field {{theory of}} {{turbulent}} convection is developed. This theory predicts the convective wind instability in <b>a</b> shear-free <b>turbulent</b> convection which causes formation of large-scale semi-organized fluid motions {{in the form}} of cells or rolls. Spatial characteristics of these motions, such as the minimum size of the growing perturbations and the size of perturbations with the maximum growth rate, are determined. This study predicts also the existence of the convective shear instability in <b>a</b> sheared <b>turbulent</b> convection which results in generation of convective shear waves with a nonzero hydrodynamic helicity. Increase of shear promotes excitation of the convective shear instability. Applications of the obtained results to the atmospheric turbulent convection and the laboratory experiments on turbulent convection are discussed. This theory can be applied also for the describing <b>a</b> mesogranular <b>turbulent</b> convection in astrophysics.

40|$|We {{present results}} from direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) of oscillatory pipe flow at several dimensionless frequencies Wo ∈ 6. 5, 13, 26 and one fixed shear Reynolds number Ret = 1440. Starting from <b>a</b> fully-developed <b>turbulent</b> velocity field at that Ret, the oscillatory flow either relaminarises or reaches <b>a</b> conditionally <b>turbulent</b> or strongly asymmetric state depending on Wo. The numerical method is validated by demonstrating excellent agreement of our DNS results with experimental data and analytical predictions from literature for the limiting cases of non-oscillating but turbulent and oscillating but laminar pipe flow. For <b>an</b> oscillating <b>turbulent</b> pipe flow we further found {{a very good}} agreement between qualitative descriptions of the characteristic flow features observed in experiments and our DNS.
