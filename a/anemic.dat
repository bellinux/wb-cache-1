5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful in operations against the Austro-Hungarians. After the war, the <b>anemic</b> Italian economy could not support significant naval construction programs. Additionally, Italy had received several modern light cruisers from the defeated Germans and Austro-Hungarians, and these ships formed {{the backbone of}} the Italian cruiser force.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were <b>anemic</b> in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E
5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an <b>anemic</b> rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line of scrimmage, which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line of scrimmage, but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{significant}} easing of the closure policy in 2010, {{the economy of}} Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from <b>anemic</b> levels {{during the height of}} the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.|$|E
5|$|The furnace {{continued}} in <b>anemic</b> health until the Panic of 1907. As {{a result of}} that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore, and went out of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate them could be found. Leftover pig iron and furnace slag from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912–1913. The furnace and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the furnace demolished. The furnace site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{develops}} {{the ability to}} speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now <b>anemic</b> and {{not knowing what to}} feed the plant, Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track. When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop to get some cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next day when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop.|$|E
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the <b>anemic</b> Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
5|$|The PTC's {{response}} to the strike was <b>anemic</b> and was interpreted by some contemporary observers and later historians as tacitly supporting the strike. Arthur Mitten, chairman of the company's Industrial Relations Division, stopped by the Luzerne carbarn and asked the workers to return to work. Subsequently, he suggested that WMC temporarily suspend the non-discrimination order, and even brought a pile of freshly printed fliers with a suspension announcement to the WMC offices. However, the WMC officials refused to approve suspension of the FEPC order and Mitten's suspension fliers were not distributed. On the morning of August 1, PTC officials immediately shut down the high-speed lines, even before the strike had spread, and instructed the company supervisors to stop selling tickets. The PTC left its carbarns open, which allowed the strikers to use the carbarns as rallying points and coordinating centers for their activities. The company also cancelled the regularly scheduled meeting of its executive committee, where the {{response to}} the strike could have been discussed, and refused to join the TWU in a radio broadcast urging the strikers to return to work.|$|E

25|$|Monozygotic twins {{who share}} a {{placenta}} can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This condition means that blood from one twin is being diverted into the other twin. One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and <b>anemic,</b> the other, the 'recipient' twin, is large and polycythemic. The lives of both twins are endangered by this condition.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{overload}} {{can develop}} in MDS {{as a result}} of the RBC transfusions which are a major part of the supportive care for <b>anemic</b> MDS patients. Although the specific therapies patients receive may alleviate the RBC transfusion need in some cases, many MDS patients may not respond to these treatments, thus may develop iron overload from repeated RBC transfusions.|$|E
25|$|A {{deficiency}} in folate may produce anemia {{similar to the}} anemia resulting from B12 deficiency. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B12 deficiency may mask <b>anemic</b> symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still {{be at risk for}} neurological deficits associated with B12 deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.|$|E
25|$|A {{month that}} {{was marked by}} <b>anemic</b> {{offensive}} performances ended with a goal-scoring explosion as United returned home to RFK Stadium to take on FC Dallas, {{and the emergence of}} new factor in the attack as Maicon Santos scored twice and added an assist in a 4-1 thrashing of the visitors. Nick DeLeon had his second goal of the campaign and he added an assist on a goal by Danny Cruz.|$|E
25|$|Jon Gruden's era in Tampa Bay {{began at}} home against new {{division}} rival, the New Orleans Saints, a team they'd soundly beaten the year before. Though heralded for his offensive expertise, the Buccaneers offense sputtered and was <b>anemic</b> {{for the first three}} quarters. The Saints held a 20–10 lead late in the fourth quarter, while Tampa Bay's offense had only 161 yards through three periods, and quarterback Brad Johnson was sacked three times, on a hot, humid 90° afternoon.|$|E
25|$|AMD {{ended its}} long-time {{handicap}} with floating point x87 performance by designing a super-pipelined, out-of-order, triple-issue floating point unit. Each of its three units was tailored {{to be able}} to calculate an optimal type of instructions with some redundancy. By having separate units, it was possible to operate on more than one floating point instruction at once. This FPU was a huge step forward for AMD. While the K6 FPU had looked <b>anemic</b> compared to the Intel P6 FPU, with Athlon this was no longer the case.|$|E
25|$|Supportive {{care must}} be {{provided}} to animals that have clinical signs. Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids are given to dehydrated animals, and severely <b>anemic</b> dogs may require a blood transfusion. Treatment for ehrlichiosis {{involves the use of}} antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline for a period of at least six to eight weeks; response to the drugs may take one month. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin and azithromycin is being studied. In addition, steroids may be indicated in severe cases in which the level of platelets is so low that the condition is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{has been}} a {{persistent}} problem in Bangladesh, with the World Bank ranking the country first {{in the number of}} malnourished children worldwide. Twenty-six percent of the population (two-thirds of {{children under the age of}} five) are undernourished, and 46 percent of children are moderately or severely underweight. Forty-three to 60 percent of children under five are smaller than normal; one in five preschool children are vitamin-A deficient, and one in two are <b>anemic.</b> More than 45 percent of rural families and 76 percent of urban families were below the acceptable caloric-intake level.|$|E
25|$|Man Ray {{directed}} {{a number of}} influential avant-garde short films, known as Cinéma Pur. He directed Le Retour à la Raison (2 mins, 1923); Emak-Bakia (16 mins, 1926); L'Étoile de Mer (15 mins, 1928); and Les Mystères du Château de Dé (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film <b>Anemic</b> Cinema (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on Fernand Léger's Ballet Mécanique (1924). In René Clair's film Entr'acte (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing chess with Duchamp.|$|E
25|$|Although Duchamp was {{no longer}} {{considered}} to be an active artist, he continued to consult with artists, art dealers and collectors. From 1925 he often traveled between France and the United States, and made New York's Greenwich Village his home in 1942. He also occasionally worked on artistic projects such as the short film <b>Anemic</b> Cinema (1926), Box in a Valise (1935–41), Self Portrait in Profile (1958) and the larger work Étant Donnés (1946–66). In 1943, he participated with Maya Deren in her unfinished film The Witch's Cradle, filmed in Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery.|$|E
25|$|Needing {{only one}} win to clinch a playoff spot, D.C. United's five-game MLS winless streak {{stretched}} to six games when the Montreal Impact's new star addition, Didier Drogba scored twice {{early in the}} first half, and United's <b>anemic</b> attack failed to answer. The loss left United only 3 points ahead of the Impact, who still held the final playoff slot, but also having played two fewer games than D.C. Toronto FC held the 5th slot, 2 points behind D.C. Orlando City SC remained outside of the playoff seedings, in seventh place, 7 points behind D.C., with 3 games remaining for both teams.|$|E
25|$|After the MLS and the MLS Players Union {{managed to}} sign a new CBA, the team {{successfully}} opened the 2015 MLS season with a 1–0 win at home against the Montreal Impact. Fabian Espindola, Eddie Johnson and Luis Silva were all unable {{to play in the}} match, heavily draining DC's offense. The newly added Jairo Arrieta started at forward alongside a healthy Chris Pontius and scored the first goal of the season for the team. Following a bye week, DC United traveled to New Jersey to fight the rival New York Red Bulls. Unfortunately, an <b>anemic</b> offense and poor marking by the DC backline led to a dispiriting 2-0 defeat.|$|E
25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} is {{the cause}} of pernicious anemia, an <b>anemic</b> disease that was usually fatal and had unknown etiology when it was first described in medicine. The cure, and B12, were discovered by accident. George Whipple had been doing experiments in which he induced anemia in dogs by bleeding them, and then fed them various foods to observe which diets allowed them fastest recovery from the anemia produced. In the process, he discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to most rapidly cure the anemia of blood loss. Thus, he hypothesized that liver ingestion might treat pernicious anemia. He tried this and reported some signs of success in 1920.|$|E
25|$|GDP and GNP grew 3.9 and 4.0 {{per cent}} {{annually}} between 1950–51 and 1964–65. It was a radical {{break from the}} British colonial period. But, in comparison to other industrial powers in Europe and East Asia, the growth rates were considered <b>anemic</b> at best. India lagged behind the miracle economies (Japan, West Germany, France, and Italy). State planning, controls, and regulations were argued to have impaired economic growth. While India's economy grew faster than both the United Kingdom and the United States – low initial income and rapid population increase – meant that growth was inadequate for any sort of catch-up with rich income nations.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the care}} of her adoptive family, Saya Otonashi had been living {{the life of an}} <b>anemic</b> amnesiac, but {{otherwise}} ordinary schoolgirl. However, her happy life is shattered when she is attacked by a Chiropteran, a hematophagous bat-like creature that lives by feeding on human blood. Saya learns that she {{is the only one who}} can defeat them, as her blood causes their bodies to crystallize and shatter. Armed with her special katana, Saya embarks on a journey with her family, allies, and her chevalier Haji, to rid the world of the Chiropteran threat and recover her identity. The course of the journey reveals the background history of the Chiropterans and Saya's past, which extends into the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|During the Clinton {{administration}} the Committee for the Preservation of the White House {{and then}} Curator of the White House Betty Monkman began initial assessment for the refurbishment of the room. While {{most of the}} furniture and artwork {{in the room was}} found to be of similar related periods, and much was associated with the presidency of Lincoln, the room's carpeting, mantel and <b>anemic</b> painted walls were not of the period. Initial decisions were made to replace the existing Neoclassical mantel with a mid-19th-century style mantel design, and to use more pattern as would have been used in Lincoln's day for the wallpaper and carpet. Two etchings and a drawing consistently showed a diamond patterned wallpaper and a Renaissance Revival style gas chandelier. A small oil painting showed a color representation of the same diamond patterned wall paper in dark green, mustard and teal.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to San Diego {{for a series}} with the division-leading Padres. In the opener, Andre Ethier's two-run pinch hit single gave the Dodgers a 2–0 victory. The Dodgers offense continued to sputter the next day as they fell 6–1 to the Padres. In an effort to bolster the sagging offensive production, the Dodgers on July 28 acquired outfielder Scott Podsednik from the Kansas City Royals for two minor leaguers. However, the new addition went 0 for 3 in his debut and the Padres won a pitching duel 3–2 on a walk-off hit by Scott Hairston {{in the bottom of}} the ninth. The loss dropped the Dodgers seven games behind the Padres in the NL West. The Dodgers {{traveled to}} San Francisco for a series against the Giants. Despite a three-run rally in the ninth inning, the Dodgers lost the opener 6–5. In the second game, Chad Billingsley was again superb, pitching 6 scoreless innings, extending his scoreless innings streak to 21. However, the Dodger offense was again <b>anemic</b> and Jonathan Broxton suffered his fourth blown save of the season, allowing a two-run homer to Pat Burrell as the Dodgers lost 2–1.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002, {{a man was}} {{attacked}} by a Siberian tiger on a remote mountain road near Hunchun in Jilin Province, China, near the borders of Russia and North Korea. He suffered compound fractures but managed to survive. When he sought medical attention, his story raised suspicions as Siberian tigers seldom attack humans. An investigation of the attack scene revealed that raw venison carried by the man was left untouched by the tiger. Officials suspected the man to be a poacher who provoked the attack. The following morning, tiger sightings were reported by locals along the same road, and a local TV station did an on-site coverage. The group found tiger tracks and blood spoor in the snow at the attack scene and followed them for approximately 2,500 meters, hoping {{to catch a glimpse}} of the animal. Soon, the tiger was seen ambling slowly ahead of them. As the team tried to get closer for a better camera view, the tiger suddenly turned and charged, causing the four to flee in panic. About an hour after that encounter, the tiger attacked and killed a 26-year-old woman on the same road. Authorities retrieved the body with the help of a bulldozer. By then, the tiger was found lying 20 meters away, weak and barely alive. It was successfully tranquilized and taken for examination, which revealed that the tiger was <b>anemic</b> and gravely injured by a poacher’s snare around its neck, with the steel wire cutting deeply down to the vertebrae, severing both trachea and esophagus. Despite extensive surgery by a team of veterinarians, the tiger died of wound infection. Subsequent investigation of the first attack revealed that the first victim was a poacher who set multiple snares that caught both the tiger and a deer. The man was later charged for poaching and harming endangered species. He served two years in prison. After being released from prison, he worked in clearing the forest of old snares.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Harold's sister, Hester, {{comes to}} Walford {{to visit and}} tells him that her son, David Samuels (Christopher Reich), is {{interested}} in joining him in Britain. As David is a doctor in Israel, Harold thinks {{it is a great}} idea and in April that year, David joins him in Walford and is made a partner in the practice. Harold even moves back to Walford and he and David live in the flat above the surgery. Despite being extremely fond of each other, the new partners argue about almost everything. David wants to modernize the surgery and bring in computers but Harold is set in his ways and is opposed to any obvious changes. Harold also disagrees with David's friendship with their secretary, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), particularly when the two get drunk at a Christmas party, leave together and share the same bed. David awakes the next day not remembering a thing, but is reassured when Michelle informs him that he had been too drunk to do anything untoward anyway. Harold is not convinced however and berates David for the degradation he brought upon himself and the surgery. Later, David and Harold fall out over Harold's treatment of patients when he discovers that Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), is showing early symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. He decides not to tell Colin as worrying about his condition could bring on another attack although Colin may not have another attack for 20 years or so, choosing instead to tell Colin that he is overworked and <b>anemic.</b> This highly unethical move appalls David but despite this, Harold continues to refuse to tell Colin about his illness. However, in January 1989, he finally tells Colin the truth. Colin is furious that Harold had kept this information from him and refuses to listen when he tries to explain his reasons. He threatens to report Dr Legg to the authorities and is mortified at how unethical he has been. Although Dr Legg is sorry, he stands by his decision to lie, feeling that Colin benefited from not knowing - when in fact, the opposite is true.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote {{he recognizes}} the show is trying to define itself, and {{compared}} Peter's newfound leadership to The X-Files Fox Mulder, praised Acevedo's performance as [...] "evil Charlie," [...] but found some of Walter's mannerisms to be [...] "cheesy". SFScope writer Sarah Stegall lauded the premise of multiple universes, and called the episode's horror elements the reason she is now [...] "a devoted fan of this show". Stegall also praised Kirk Acevedo's performance {{as well as the}} parallels between Andrea Hughes and Walter; she concluded [...] "This may have been the best episode of this entire series, second perhaps to last season's finale, and certainly better than anything the <b>anemic</b> Grey's Anatomy or the aging CSI can offer".|$|E
500|$|Ann Powers of Spin also commended the album's concept, {{as well as}} the band's songwriting, saying: [...] "Until now, Manson's ideas carried {{more weight}} than his music, but Antichrist Superstars sound matches the garish grandiosity of his arguments. Its 16 songs rock like '70s Sabbath-style metal, but harder; the {{arrangements}} echo Queen in operatic scope but are more intense; the mood owes its vampiric chill to Bauhaus, but [...] actually bites the vein." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the album would be considered the band's definitive statement, but was critical of Reznor's production, saying: [...] "Though the sonic details make [...] an intriguing listen, it's not as extreme as it could have been—in particular, the guitars are surprisingly <b>anemic,</b> sounding like buzzing vacuums instead of unwieldy chainsaws." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears’ <b>anemic</b> performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E

[...] For the second episode, Steranko said that it was [...] "too unfocused to be satisfying," [...] but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as [...] "an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be." [...] In contrast, Steranko's opinion of some later episodes in the first season were more positive, congratulating the writer and director of [...] "The End of the Beginning" [...] for [...] "finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life", and saying of the next episode [...] "I was concerned that last week's bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup's new image-and-edit policy was in play." [...] Overall, however, he found season one to be [...] "22 episodes of 'sanctified' plot and character crumbs being salted with terminally-sluggish velocity (into <b>anemic</b> 'standalone' stories)".|$|E
500|$|Chabon's {{forays into}} genre fiction {{have met with}} mixed {{critical}} reaction. One science fiction short story by Chabon, [...] "The Martian Agent," [...] was described by a reviewer as [...] "enough to send readers back into the cold but reliable arms of The New Yorker." [...] Another critic wrote of the same story that it was [...] "richly plotted, action-packed," [...] and that [...] "Chabon skilfully elaborates his world and draws {{not just on the}} steampunk worlds of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and Michael Moorcock, but on alternate histories by brilliant science fiction mavericks such as Avram Davidson and Howard Waldrop. The imperial politics are craftily resonant and the story keeps us hanging on." [...] While The Village Voice called The Final Solution [...] "an ingenious, fully imagined work, an expert piece of literary ventriloquism, and a mash note to the beloved boys' tales of Chabon's youth," [...] The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "he genre of the comic book is an <b>anemic</b> vein for novelists to mine, lest they squander their brilliance." [...] The New York Times states that the detective story, [...] "a genre that is by its nature so constrained, so untransgressive, seems unlikely to appeal to the real writer," [...] but adds that [...] "... Chabon makes good on his claim: a successful detective story need not be lacking in literary merit." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{invited to}} 1997 spring {{training}} Pérez {{did not make}} the 25-man roster and once again returned to the Sky Sox {{for the first half of}} the season, where he batted [...]363 with a [...]975 fielding percentage. In mid-June the Rockies summoned him in place of Jason Bates, this time for good. Pérez batted [...]291 on the year and gradually replaced Walt Weiss as the starting shortstop. Pérez remained Colorado's primary shortstop for the next three seasons (1998–2000), appearing in all but five games. His batting average hovered around [...]280 (.274, [...]280, [...]287) and he averaged thirty doubles a year. His fielding percentage never dropped below [...]975 and he won a Gold Glove for the 2000 season. Despite his later reputation for <b>anemic</b> hitting, Pérez managed several offensive feats with the Rockies. On July 25, 1998, he hit for the cycle against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1999 he tied Bobby Abreu and José Offerman for the most triples in Major League Baseball with 11. Pérez got off to a strong start in 2001 but there was doubt over his future with Colorado. The Rockies had offered him a 4-year, $17 million contract which he had rejected; accepting a 1-year $3.55 million deal via arbitration. In the end the Rockies dealt Pérez to the Kansas City Royals as part of a three-way deal in which the Royals sent Jermaine Dye to the Oakland Athletics who then sent Mario Encarnación, José Ortiz and Todd Belitz to Colorado. Denver Post sportswriter Woody Paige criticized the move, calling Pérez [...] "the best shortstop in the National League" [...] who was [...] "an extraordinary defensive player, a capable offensive player and a classy team player." ...|$|E
