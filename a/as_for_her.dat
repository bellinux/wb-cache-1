5|$|Rix Nicholas {{continued}} to experience success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press, such <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{show in the}} Queen Victoria Markets in September 1920. Nevertheless, Pigot has argued that {{her place in the}} Australian art world at the time was complex, and her style was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being resisted by local critics. Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all those close to her, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects. This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long-term trajectory of her career. Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection.|$|E

While she received the 4-inch armour belt and the double 4-inch gun mounts like her sisters, she retained the rotating catapult and after superstructure, with an additional fire-control position mounted on a distinctive lattice structure aft. Her anti-aircraft armaments were improved <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> sisters, but the multiple 2-pounders and their directors were carried aft, by the lattice structure.|$|E

She was a fashion icon, and her famous ensemble of pink Chanel suit and matching pillbox hat has become a symbol of her husband's assassination.

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> birthplace, Saigon and British Hong Kong {{appear to}} be most {{credible}} versions, but places like Singapore, Switzerland or even Transylvania have also been rumoured as the singer's birthplace by different sources. She {{was an only child}} to her parents who later divorced. Most sources, including Lear's 1965 wedding certificate, confirm that her father was a French army officer, possibly of British origin. Her mother appears to have had a Russo-Asiatic background. In a 1976 interview with Carmen Thomas for a German television show, Lear confirmed that her father was British and mother was Russian, and that they had already both died. However, she would later claim her mother had a French background.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{unlikely}} that Behn went to Surinam with her husband, although {{she may have}} met and married in Surinam or on the journey back to England. A socially creditable single woman in good standing would not have gone unaccompanied to Surinam. Therefore, it is most likely that Behn and her family went to the colony {{in the company of}} a lady. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> purpose in going, Janet Todd presents a strong case for its being spying. At the time of the events of the novel, the deputy governor Byam had taken absolute control of the settlement and was being opposed not only by the formerly republican Colonel George Marten, but also by royalists within the settlement. Byam's abilities were suspect, and it is possible that either Lord Willoughby or Charles II would be interested in an investigation of the administration there.|$|E

500|$|Several remixes of [...] "Hollywood", done by DJs such as Jacques Lu Cont, The Micronauts, Paul Oakenfold, Deepsky and Victor Calderone, were {{included}} on physical releases {{of the single}} around the world. In August 2003, the song was remixed with [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and performed with Missy Elliott under the title [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove" [...] {{as part of a}} promotional campaign for clothing retailer, GAP. Copies of the promotional CD were given to customers and were not available for individual purchase. An extended version, [...] "The Passengerz Mix", was also included on the remix album Remixed & Revisited (2003). A promotional video for the remix was also shot. Rob Walker of Slate considered the video [...] "interesting because Madonna has always been praised as much for her ability to market herself <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> actual talent as a singer and performer". However, he noted that [...] " [...] can't even get an actual commercial right. Maybe Madonna really is over." [...] A parody of the commercial which satirized at Madonna's age was featured on the ninth season of MADtv.|$|E

500|$|While Wilde {{had long}} been famous for {{dialogue}} and his use of language, Raby (1988) argues that he achieved a unity and mastery in Earnest that was unmatched in his other plays, except perhaps Salomé. While his earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious, Earnest achieves a pitch-perfect style that allows these to dissolve. There are three different registers detectable in the play. The dandyish insouciance of Jack and Algernon—established early with Algernon's exchange with his manservant—betrays an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes. The formidable pronouncements of Lady Bracknell are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> disconcerting opinions. In contrast, the speech of Dr. Chasuble and Miss Prism is distinguished by [...] "pedantic precept" [...] and [...] "idiosyncratic diversion". Furthermore, the play is full of epigrams and paradoxes. Max Beerbohm described it as littered with [...] "chiselled apophthegms—witticisms unrelated to action or character", of which he found half a dozen {{to be of the}} highest order.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, {{but there was something about}} the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> name, Kubo stated that, because Kuchiki [...] "looks like a shinigami", {{he wanted}} her name to sound like {{something}} a shinigami would have as a name. When deciding upon her family name he considered using [...] because {{it sounded like a}} name a shinigami would have, and then decided to use [...] He adds that he once heard something that sounded like [...] "Kuchiki Rukia" [...] on Japanese television, and liked it enough {{to use it as a}} name. Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it. After designing Rukia's zanpakutō, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made it to be the most beautiful one from the series.|$|E
