60|$|These, {{with the}} {{epilogue}} to 'The Distrest Mother' [5] <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> of Goldsmith's [6], and a prologue of old Colman's to Beaumont and Fletcher's 'Philaster' [7], {{are the best}} things of the kind we have.|$|E
60|$|I {{am glad to}} {{have your}} reasons for giving up the chair; they are partly pleasant, and partly honourable to you. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> may say that every man who {{publicly}} declines a plurality of offices, makes it perceptibly {{more difficult for the}} next man to accept them.|$|E
60|$|The moral {{in this is}} {{perfectly}} clear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there's <b>one</b> in they next memory I'm {{going to tell you}} about.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{always seemed}} to me, my dear, that an {{arrangement}} of that kind is a little rough on the man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this <b>one</b> is too good to spoil," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} we can see, John. It is too cold for walking about talking here; <b>and,</b> besides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> {{can look at}} a matter in all lights much better sitting down than one can walking about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{was hanging}} about me all day, and night too, when I was {{stretched}} on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,' said Sikes. 'We was poor too, all the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> way or other, it's worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long {{has made her}} restless--eh?' ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{very short}} time, the raft was lifted {{to the side of}} the vessel and pushed overboard. It was bound to come right side up. And as soon as it was afloat, the men began to drop down on it. The captain had hold of a line that was {{fastened}} to it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the mates had another line.|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{may make}} your laws, Judge,” be cried, “but who will you find {{to watch the}} {{mountains}} through the long summer days, or the lakes at night? Game is game, and be who finds may kill; {{that has been the}} law in these mountains for forty years to my sartain knowledge; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> old law is worth two new ones. None but a green one would wish to kill a doe with a fa’n by its side, unless his moccasins were getting old, or his leggins ragged, for the flesh is lean and coarse. But a rifle rings among the rocks along the lake shore, sometimes, as if fifty pieces were fired at once—it would be hard to tell where the man stood who pulled the trigger.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure we {{all think}} that," [...] added Roger. [...] "Since he went to Oak Hall {{he has made a}} host of real friends, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of them will desert him." ...|$|R
500|$|... "My {{mother was}} a teacher, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>one</b> reason that, amidst my deal-making skills, I {{have a very strong}} {{pedagogical}} bent", he says. [...] "I really enjoy teaching, and believe {{it is one of the}} most important professions in our society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some, sir, that is {{scarcely}} fit to slush a mast with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> {{of the most}} atrocious cheeses, sir, it was ever my bad fortune to meet with. I do not wonder the Africans left the wreck." ...|$|R
60|$|This English {{custom of}} lodgings, {{of which we}} had some {{experience}} at Rhyl last year, has its advantages; but is rather uncomfortable for strangers, who, in first settling themselves down, find that they must undertake all the responsibility of housekeeping at an instant's warming, and cannot get even {{a cup of tea}} till they have made arrangements with the grocer. Soon, however, there comes a sense of being at home, and by our exclusive selves, which never can be attained at hotels nor boarding-houses. Our house is well situated and respectably furnished, with the dinginess, however, which is inseparable from lodging-houses,--as if others had used these things before and would use them again after we had gone,--a well-enough adaptation, but a lack of peculiar appropriateness; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> puts off real enjoyment from a sense of not being truly fitted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a {{great deal}} more afraid of tigers than of ghosts," [...] Stanley said; [...] "a deserted place like this is just the sort of spot they would be likely to be in. At any rate, if these caves do not go any further into the hill--and there are no signs of their doing so--it may be hoped that the tigers have their superstitions about it, too. At any rate, it will be a good thing to pile a great {{quantity}} of firewood at the entrance; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of you had better stay here, with the boys. They and the horses would be {{a great deal}} safer here, with a fire burning; than they would be in the woods, where a tiger might pounce upon them, at any moment. As to this folly about spirits, it is only old women's chatter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here {{we have a}} labouring people, {{a people}} labouring for life; but by all their labour, you see, they cannot ease themselves; their burden still remains upon them; they yet are heavy laden. The load here is, doubtless, guilt of sin, such as David had when he said by reason thereof, {{he was not able}} to look up (Psa 38:3-5). Hence, therefore, you have an {{experiment}} set before you of those that are trying what they can do for life; but behold, the more they stir, the more they sink under the weight of the burden that lies upon them.[12] And the conclusion--to wit, Christ's call to them to come to him for rest--declares that, in his judgment, rest was not to be had elsewhere. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> may with as much safety adhere to Christ's judgment as to any man's alive; wherefore, 'men must be justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.' ...|$|E

60|$|Yes, {{he kissed}} the {{trembling}} horror of that wrinkled head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was <b>one</b> of the greatest, bravest acts ever done by man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Zacharias," [...] said he, nudging his snoring spouse, [...] "I {{wish you}} would get up <b>and</b> look about. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the {{children}} must have fallen into the fire." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{students}} {{had set up}} a Facebook group titled [...] "Every One Hates Billy Wolfe" [...] calling on them to attack him at school.

50|$|Hristić's work {{includes}} {{solo and}} chamber works, vocal and instrumental works, ballets, radiophonic works, music for theater, film and television. His compositions {{have been performed}} by prominent national and international performers."I have never accepted {{that it is important}} to write music just for oneself <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> is deceived by the artist who says he does not care about communication and influence. Art means to influence".|$|E
50|$|Veras poetry blends English and Spanish. As he explains:I {{love the}} English {{language}}. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> {{of the things}} that I love about the English language is the permeability of English to not only accept but also struggle with the incorporation of other languages like Spanish. So when I write, Im constantly going back and forth between these two possible ways of articulating the world around me.|$|E
2500|$|About {{the picture}} and its legacy, Lorrie Stirm Kitching once noted, [...] "We have this very nice picture of a very happy moment, but every time I look at it, I {{remember}} the families that weren't reunited, {{and the ones that}} aren't being reunited today— many, many families— <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> I'm <b>one</b> of the lucky ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not wilful," [...] he said; [...] "it came {{of honest}} truth-seeking. <b>And,</b> Rachel, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>one</b> thing is now gone that kept that honesty from finding its way." ...|$|R
2500|$|On March 24, 2015, {{during an}} {{interview}} in Paraguay, Foster The People announced that {{they were working on}} a third album. When describing their upcoming record, they said that [...] "the first record was more, kind of, electro-pop, the second record was more of a rock record, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this <b>one</b> {{is going to be a}} little more hip hop".|$|R
5000|$|... "This is as naked a rock {{record as}} you're going to hear", Mellencamp told Billboard Magazine's Jim Bessman in an April 23, 1994 story. [...] "All the vocals are {{first or second}} takes, and half the songs don't even have bass parts. Others have just one guitar, bass, and drums, which I haven't done since American Fool. 'Hurts So Good' had one guitar, bass, and drums, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> tambourine." ...|$|E
5000|$|It is very {{difficult}} to put it in a phrase, but it has been put in this way: that there must be aberration or weakness of mind; that there must be some form of mental unsoundness; that there must be a state of mind which is bordering on, though not amounting to, insanity; that there must be a mind so affected that responsibility is diminished from full responsibility to partial responsibility. In other words, the prisoner in question must be only partially accountable for his actions. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> can see running through the cases that there is implied ... that there must be some form of mental disease.|$|E
5000|$|Alternative Press {{gave the}} album four stars {{out of five}} and said it [...] "feels every bit as massive as the world it sets up. It's not just the {{heaviest}} record in Coheed's arsenal; it's {{also one of the}} strongest." [...] The Boston Globe gave it a favorable review and stated that [...] "The record is further evidence of the quartet's easy chemistry. The band is both bold and geeky, creating a signature sound that typically triggers strong reaction; one man's progressive is another's pretentious." [...] Melodic.net similarly gave the album four stars out of five and said, [...] "Coheed and Cambria always find new ways to bring in their audience and give them all that they have (no pun intended). This is a great album <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of their best to date." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 18 January 2007, Manchester City {{teammate}} Micah Richards said:“Ever since I’ve come to {{this club}} Richard has just been quality. I play with him week in, week out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he’s <b>one</b> {{of the best players}} I’ve played with. I’ve played with John Terry and Rio Ferdinand in the England squad but Richard is right up there with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> any <b>one</b> would!" [...] said I. [...] "He has his faults {{like other}} folk; {{but he is}} brave and staunch and kind, God bless him! That will be a strange day when I forget Alan." [...] And the thought of him, {{and that it was}} within my choice to speak with him that night, had almost {{overcome}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{understand}} what <b>I</b> mean; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's <b>one</b> of the great charms of a husband, that you're not forced to express yourself to him. A husband," [...] continued Isabel, sententiously, poising a bit of meringue between her thumb and finger,--for they had reached that point in the repast, [...] "a husband is {{almost as good as}} another woman!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Was given word {{to pack up}} {{and move}} at 3 oclock. In rear echelon. Saw the most unusual sight yet. 16 torpedo planes shot down by 28 ships that were in the harbor. Big planes being shot down by Grummans and {{anti-aircraft}} fire. Really beautiful.They flew in low, about 50 feet over the water. I remember we had 30 or 40 or 50 ships sitting in the harbor there, and tall grass covered dunes which you could get on and pretty much have a panoramic view of the whole bay. I remember seeing a big air raid come in and black anti-aircraft fire was coming crazy from all the ships in the harbor -- all kind of puffs of smoke hit the sky. In fact there were 16 torpedo bombers come over and I dont think they hit a thing; they were all being shot down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> or two got past the fleet. Our planes were after them too. And way out there on the horizon, we saw the last one go down -- all of them were shot down -- we could see the fire and the smoke. These were big two motor bombers: Japanese bombers burn real good." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "When I {{first started}} working on the series, it was just Mads Mikkelsen and I sitting across from each other, in a psychiatrist-patient relationship, and her cadence is born from that," [...] Anderson said. [...] "It's born from a need to remain on a {{particular}} level because she can't... reveal anything to him about what she's thinking. She's quite bold, but she's very self-aware and aware of how she's adjusted herself to fit him. That, ultimately, is where the cadence comes from. I do think {{that she is the}} smartest person in the room, and I do think that she's potentially one step ahead of him at times. So, she's always on her toes, but she also pushes his boundaries, and she pushes her own boundaries with him." [...] Anderson added, [...] "I think that it's wonderful that she's inscrutable to the audience, and I think that's really important... we're told too much these days about what to think and how to feel and know too much before we see it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the things that intrigues me about some of the characters that I choose to play is that they're enigmatic, and I like to keep them enigmatic." ...|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the authors}} {{who seem to have}} helped to {{crystallise}} Harris's opinions, even when he disagreed with them, were Locke, John Law, Newton, Cantillon and Hume.
