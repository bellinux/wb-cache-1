Our study aimed to assess changes in soil-N cycling rates with conversion of forest to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations. In Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, we selected two soil landscapes - loam and clay <b>Acrisol</b> soils - each with four land-use types: lowland forest and forest with regenerating rubber (hereafter, "jungle rubber") as reference land uses, and rubber and oil palm as converted land uses. Gross soil-N cycling rates were measured using the 15 N pool dilution technique with in-situ incubation of soil cores. In the loam <b>Acrisol</b> soil, where fertility was low, microbial biomass, gross N mineralization and NH 4 + immobilization were also low and no significant changes were detected with land-use conversion. The clay <b>Acrisol</b> soil which had higher initial fertility based on the reference land uses (i. e. higher pH, organic C, total N, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) and base saturation) (P≤ 0. 05 - 0. 09) had larger microbial biomass and NH 4 + transformation rates (P≤ 0. 05) compared to the loam <b>Acrisol</b> soil. Conversion of forest and jungle rubber to rubber and oil palm in the clay <b>Acrisol</b> soil decreased soil fertility which, in turn, reduced microbial biomass and consequently decreased NH 4 + transformation rates (P≤ 0. 05 - 0. 09). This was further attested by the correlation of gross N mineralization and microbial biomass N with ECEC, organic C, total N (R= 0. 51 - 0. 76; P≤ 0. 05) and C:N ratio (R=- 0. 71 - - 0. 75, P≤ 0. 05). Our findings suggest that the larger the initial soil fertility and N availability, the larger the reductions upon land-use conversion.

The texture of the mounds was sandy clay in contrast to the sandy clay loam of the surface soils. Translocation of fine to medium sized soil materials influenced the relatively higher bulk density (> 1. 60 Mg/m 3 ) and contents of organic carbon, nitrogen and exchangeable bases in the mounds. Kaolinite was the dominant clay mineral with pH values generally below 5. 3 in all the soils reflecting the weathered tropical soil environment. Dispersion ratio values, which were 0. 5 for the surface soils, indicated greater stability of the mound due to aggregate cementing action by the termites. Estimated mound density was about 120 mounds per ha, which tied in with known groundwater reserves at the study sites. Majority of the mounds exhibited a cone-shaped morphology with heights varying between 3. 05 - 4. 00 m in the Rhodic <b>Acrisol</b> and 2. 05 - 4. 20 m in the Haplic <b>Acrisol</b> with corresponding estimated total mass of 96, 361 kg and 54, 910 kg per 1000 m 2 land area.

Experiments were carried out in peri-urban vegetable and/or rice-dominated farming systems of Hanoi, Ha Tay, Vinh Phuc and Nam Dinh cities. Batch studies were performed {{in order to measure}} metal solubility in soil solution, and multi-surface models including the soil sorption surfaces, i. e. iron hydroxides (DLM), organic matter (SHM and NICA-Donnan model), and phyllosilicate clay (Gaines-Thomas) were tested for describing metal binding. A multi-surface model was used to run various scenarios including (i) changing metal loading (Cd, Cu, Zn) up to the present Vietnamese maximum acceptable soil concentration (MAC), and (ii) varying soil organic matter (SOM) content and (iii) soil pH within the ranges found in the national soil inventory of <b>Acrisols</b> and Fluvisols, respectively. These soil types represent 73 % of agricultural soils in Vietnam. Field balance calculations revealed macronutrient and trace metal (Cu, Zn) accumulation in intensive peri-urban vegetable systems in Hanoi City. The N surplus ranged from 85 - 882 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, while P and K surpluses were 109 - 196 and 20 - 306 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively. For Cu and Zn surpluses varied from 0. 2 - 2. 7 and 0. 6 - 7. 7 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively, wastewater and biosolids being the major sources accounting for 75 - 98 and 62 - 94 % of the total Cu and Zn input. Application of biosolids significantly increased the ‘total’ (reverse aqua regia-extractable) soil Zn concentration, whereas concentrations of Cd and Pb were not significantly different from the control. However, there were positive relationships between EDTA-extractable Cd, Cu and Zn and biosolids application rates. For total dissolved Cd, Cu and Zn the multi-surface models provided very good model fits for all soils and thus these can be used to describe their binding and solubility in tropical Fluvisols and <b>Acrisols.</b> Scenario simulations identified the potential risk of metal losses to the environment (i. e. Cd and Zn), as influenced by loading up to MAC, soil acidification and decreasing soil organic matter content, especially for <b>Acrisols.</b> Assuming the same metal input rate as at present, it was roughly estimated to take 20 - 325 and 40 - 450 years to reach the MAC for Cu and Zn, respectively. It was concluded that wastewater and biosolids can be major nutrient sources in peri-urban agricultural production systems. However, they can also contribute to substantial trace metal inputs and represent a potential threat to soil quality, water environment and human health. Soil organic matter is a major sorbent for Cd, Cu, and Zn in tropical <b>Acrisols</b> and Fluvisols, and pH is the main factor controlling the solubility of metals in these soils.

Aggregates from 4. 76 to 8. 00 mm diameters were studied using the traditional method proposed by Kemper & Chepil (1965), with wet sieving, while aggregates from 1. 00 to 2. 00 mm were studied using a CILAS® laser diffractometer that distinguishes particles ranging from 0. 04 to 2, 500. 00 &# 956;m.

The results indicate that <b>Acrisol</b> had a stronger adsorption capacity for DPAA than Phaeozem. Soil DPAA adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process and the amount of DPAA adsorbed was affected significantly by variation in soil pH and phosphate. In contrast, soil organic matter and ionic strength had no significant effect on adsorption. This suggests that DPAA adsorption may be due to specific adsorption on soil mineral surfaces. Therefore, monitoring the fate of DPAA in soils is recommended in areas contaminated by leakage from chemical weapons...|$|E

Studies of pedogenesis associated with altitudinal variation, vegetation type and soil carbon content on the same type of parent rock are very limited in inter-tropical mountain areas. Therefore the altitudinal variation of soil pedogenesis through 9 selected profiles from the altitude of 1340 m to 3143 mast, the summit of the Fan Si Pan Mountain, in the north of Vietnam was examined. Fan Si Pan Mountain is composed of a homogenous alkaline granite rock and is the highest point of the Inter-tropical Continental Asia. The Soil Organic Matter properties (C, N, delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 contents) of the different grain-size fractions of the topsoil of 4 selected profiles corresponding to different ecosystems were also examined. Three zones of different soil forming processes were present: <b>Acrisols</b> and Alisols at lower altitudes in sub montane forest, Podzols formed in montane and upper montane forest while Umbrisols formed at high altitude where the forest vegetation had given way to a shrubby vegetation or a steppe composed of dwarfed bamboo. With altitude, soils become sandier, have higher concentration of SiO 2 and are lower in Al 2 O 3. The selective Fe and Al oxalate (Fe-o and Al-o) and pyrophosphate (Few and Alp) extracts show a clear discrepancy between <b>Acrisols</b> or Umbrisols with no clear variation with soil depth and Podzols with high enrichment in their Bs horizon. The SOM status is highly dependent of the organic matter input by the vegetation. In <b>Acrisols,</b> the SOC is linked to the fine fraction within the soil profile with rapid turnover and low C/N values. Podzols are formed by the accumulation on soil surface of OM enriched in the coarse fraction with depleted delta N- 15 and high C/N values. The organic matter input is exogenic and probably seasonal from leaves forming the surface litter while in <b>Acrisols</b> or Umbrisols the SOC is mainly linked to the fine fraction, and with constant delta N- 15 values at depth. In Umbrisols, the SOC origin seems to be linked with endogenic inputs deep in the soil profile mostly produced by the decay of bamboo roots. In this tropical mountainous soil catena, the soil carbon mineralization depends not only on temperature and organo-metallic complexes that stabilize the non labile carbon pool but also is controlled by the pedogenetic process, which is linked with the vegetal ecosystem change with altitude...|$|R

The efficiency of extracellular enzymes {{depends on their}} interaction with soil organo-mineral surfaces and their resistance to degradation and inactivation. Little {{is known about the}} factors that control the time dependence of enzyme activity in soil. We have monitored catalytic {{activity of}} native and added phosphatase incubated for up to one month in moist soil. Two fungal phosphatases and three tropical soils (two <b>acrisols</b> with contrasting organic matter content and a vertisol) were compared and the effect of soil sterilisation measured. The enzymes had different stabilities in solution. Activity of Hebeloma cylindrosporum phosphatase was protected in <b>acrisols,</b> but not in contact with the vertisol. In contrast, the decline of activity of Suillus collinitus phosphatase followed the same trend in solution and in the presence of each of the soils. Sterilisation decreased native phosphatase activity. The rate of decline of added phosphatase activity was identical in sterile and non-sterile soils. We discuss the effects of degradation of the enzyme in soil and changing relative activity in the adsorbed state. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Field and laboratory observations with the soils from five pedons, one each at crest, lower slope and valley floor, and two from middle slope positions, revealed {{that they were}} deep (> 150 cm), brown (7. 5 YR 5 / 3) to very pale brown (10 YR 7 / 3) and sandy loam to sandy clay loam in the upper horizon underlain by yellowish red (5 RY 4 / 8) to brownish yellow (10 YR 6 / 8) and gravely sand clay to clay horizons, with moderately well-developed sub-angular blocky structure and friable to very friable consistence. The soils were strongly to moderately acidic (pH. 5. 1 - 5. 9 in H 2 O, 3. 8 - 5. 3 in CaCl 2), low in exchangeable bases (1. 04 – 1. 40 cmol (+) kg- 1 as well as exchange acidity (0. 54 - 1. 90 cmol (+) kg – 1) with cation exchange capacity ranging between 4. 4 and 27. 6 cmol (+) kg- 1 soil. The dominant pedogenic processes influencing the rate of soil development {{were found to be}} clay lessivation, colluvial-fluvial deposition and neoformation of minerals in the lower horizons as a result of downward leaching of the bases and likely better moisture condition at depth.

The experimental design was a randomized completed block design with three replications and six treatments: T 0 (0 FTd, 0 NPK and 0 Urea); T 1 (0 FTd, 150 kg 20 - 10 - 10 and 150 kg of Urea/ha); T 2 (0 FTd, 75 kg 20 - 10 - 10 and 75 kg of Urea/ha); T 3 (2. 5 t/ha FTd, 0 NPK and 0 Urea); T 4 (5 t/ha FTd, 0 NPK and 0 Urea); T 5 (2. 5 t/ha FTd, 75 kg 20 - 10 - 10 and 75 kg of Urea). Soil and Tithonia samples were collected and analyzed for nutrients contents. Tithonia leaves (FTd) were incorporated into the soil two weeks before maize sowing. Physico-chemical laboratory analyses were carried out on soil samples and Tithonia leaves. Highly significant differences (p= 0. 006 and pT 1 >T 3 >T 2 >T 0. No significant difference was observed for all the soil properties tested. However, in the general trend, most soil properties tended to increase {{at the end of}} the experiment, excepted sand content, pH and available phosphorus. With the acceptability index (IA) of more than 2 in T 4 (2. 65) and T 5 (2. 53), the study has shown that Tithonia diversifolia has a potential for improving plant nutrient availability in these soils for the cultivation of maize without chemical fertilizers...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{management}} alters {{physical and}} chemical soil properties, which directly affects microbial life strategies and community composition. The microbial community drives important nutrient cycling processes that can influence soil quality, cropping productivity and environmental sustainability. In this research, a long-term agricultural experiment in a subtropical <b>Acrisol</b> was studied in south Brazil. The plots at this site represent two tillage systems, two nitrogen fertilization regimes and three crop rotation systems. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, the archaeal and bacterial composition was determined from phylum to species level in the different plot treatments. The relative abundance of these taxes was correlated with measured soil properties. The P, Mg, total organic carbon, total N and mineral N were significantly higher in the no-tillage system. The microbial diversity was higher in the no-tillage system at order, family, genus and species level. In addition, overall microbial composition changed significantly between conventional tillage and no-tillage systems. Anaerobic bacteria, such as clostridia, dominate in no-tilled soil as well as anaerobic methanogenic archaea, which were detected only in the no-tillage system. Microbial diversity was higher in plots in which only cereals (oat and maize) were grown.

Fluoride toxicities in the environment are known to not be related to the disease. To investigate if, instead, CDR is caused by a nutrient deficiency in the environment, subsistence farms in an endemic CDR area near Kaduna, northern Nigeria, were investigated for bedrock, slope forms, soil types, and soil characteristics. The natural environment was investigated according to the World Reference Base, soil texture was analysed by pipette and sieving, and plant-available macronutrients were determined using barium-chloride or Ca-acetate-lactate extraction. The analyses showed that granite and slope deposits were the dominant parent materials. The typical slope forms and soil types were Lixisols and <b>Acrisols</b> on pediments, Fluvisols in river valleys, and Plinthosols and <b>Acrisols</b> on plains. Compared with West African background values, all of the soils had normal soil textures but were low in macronutrients. Comparisons to critical limits, however, showed that only the P concentrations were critically low, which are typical for savanna soils. A link between nutrient deficiency in soils and CDR in the Kaduna area was therefore considered unlikely. Vereinigung der Freunde und F¨orderer of the University of FrankfurtDAADBMB...|$|R
