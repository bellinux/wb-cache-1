[...] The original cover painting by Alberto Vargas {{was one of}} his last works, created at the age of 84. According to The New York Daily News, Peters [...] "persuaded him to do one last 'Vargas Girls' portrait... She just went to his California retreat, asked him to do one more, he looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You ARE a Vargas girl!'" [...] She kept the original painting. [...] The original title planned for the album was Decades. Rolling Stone wrote of her debut album: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Bellisario, CBS chief {{executive}} Leslie Moonves [...] "took one look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> Wow!" [...] Co-executive producer Charles Floyd Johnson commented, [...] "When you get actors who really listen and respond organically {{in the moment}} to what they're hearing, sometimes magic happens. They really seemed to get that immediately, and that doesn't always happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adele and Tedder {{arranged}} a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later {{to write and}} record [...] "Rumour Has It." [...] In an interview, Tedder recalled his astonishment at the singer's musicality and vocal prowess after she completed the main vocals to the song in 10minutes: [...] "She sang it once top to bottom, pitch perfect, she didn't miss a note. I looked at the engineer then <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Adele I don't {{know what to tell}} you but I have never had anyone do that in ten years'." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{compliment}} {{was evidently}} pleasing, {{for the small}} woman looked up kindly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> guests, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in a friendly tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Mainwaring glanced quickly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> sotto voce, [...] "Do {{you think}} they'll care to come NOW? They {{probably}} have heard all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The stern {{features}} of Miss Huckins relaxed a bit. She {{glanced at the}} girl, then <b>at</b> <b>her</b> work, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> more pleasantly than she had before spoken: ...|$|R
2500|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel brought her {{in to talk}} about a role in the 1978 film Goin' South, then asked her for cocaine and grilled her about whether her orgasms in Behind the Green Door were real; she was angered to the point where she stormed out of the interview. She was going to be cast in the film Hardcore, {{opposite}} George C. Scott, but the casting director took one look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> she was too wholesome to be cast as a porn queen. [...] "The Hardcore people wanted a woman with orange hair who chews gum, swings a big purse, and wears stiletto heels. That's such a cliche," [...] Chambers said years later. Season Hubley was cast instead.|$|E
2500|$|Tedder had {{expressed}} interest in collaborating with Adele after they met at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony in February. He arrived four hours early to their first studio session, buying time to better familiarise himself with some of her previous work. In 2010, Tedder was featured on Far East Movement's 2010 hit single [...] "Rocketeer". Although unaware of Adele's personal predicament, he composed the opening piano sequence and first few lines to what became the lovelorn ballad [...] "Turning Tables". Adele and Tedder arranged a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later to write and record [...] "Rumour Has It". In an interview, Tedder recalled his astonishment at the singer's musicality and vocal prowess after she completed the main vocals to the song in 10 minutes: [...] "She sang it once top to bottom, pitch perfect, she didn't miss a note. I looked at the engineer then <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Adele, I don't {{know what to tell}} you but I have never had anyone do that in ten years'."

2500|$|On January 16, 2009, {{the league}} fined Cuban $25,000 for yelling at Denver Nuggets player J. R. Smith {{at the end}} of the first half on a Mavericks-at-Nuggets game played on January 13. Cuban was {{apparently}} incensed that Smith had thrown an elbow that barely missed Mavericks forward Antoine Wright. Cuban offered to match the fine with a donation to a charity of Smith's choosing. Cuban stated that if he doesn't hear from Smith then he will donate the money to the NHL Players' Association Goals and Dreams Fund in the names of Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore. In May 2009, Cuban made a reference to the Denver Nuggets being [...] "thugs" [...] after a loss to the Nuggets in game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals. The statement was geared towards the Nuggets and their fans. As he passed Kenyon Martin's mother, who was seated near Cuban as he left the arena, he pointed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "that includes your son". This controversial comment revisited media attention on Cuban yet again. Cuban issued an apology the next day referencing the poor treatment of away fans in arenas around the league. The league issued a statement stating that they would not fine him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; is it not?" [...] said Mirah, looking doubtfully at Mrs. Meyrick, who in {{her turn}} looked up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> son, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "What do you think, Hans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He smiled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> quietly, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I {{suppose it}} is because he treats us {{as if he were}} our brother. But he loves not to have the {{difference}} of birth dwelt upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|Meg {{lifted her}} eyebrows, but Jo scowled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> defiantly <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> once, [...] "Of course you may. We {{should have asked}} you before, only we thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this." ...|$|R

6000|$|When Louis bade {{his aunt}} farewell, {{he threw his}} arm round her neck, looked fondly <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Dear aunt, you won't let them tease you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Her aunt followed. When Thomasin {{was going}} up the little walk from {{the door to the}} wicket-gate, Mrs. Yeobright looked reluctantly <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It is a shame to let you go alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fixedly, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> slowly: [...] "You thought that? Well, {{listen to}} me. I saw NO ONE! I {{knew nothing of}} this! I {{suspected}} nothing! I returned before I had reached the wood--because--because--I had changed my mind!" ...|$|R
60|$|The critic looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> smiled' deferentially, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> no more. Like {{everyone}} else, he {{knew their}} history.|$|R
6000|$|After all, she slept; {{and when}} she waked in the morning light, she looked up fixedly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>and</b> <b>said</b> tenderly, [...] "Ah, poor mamma! You have been sitting up with me. Don't be unhappy. I shall live. I shall be better." ...|$|R
6000|$|On her part, Miss Macroyd had doubtless {{already noted}} that the girl was, with no show of expensiveness, authoritatively well gowned and {{personally}} hatted. She stared <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "What a very hunted and escaping effect." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Dedlock {{looked at}} me, and I looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> I was indeed. All at once she turned from {{me with a}} hasty air, almost {{expressive}} of displeasure or dislike, and spoke to him over her shoulder again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Either I want to shout," [...] said Mr. Manning, [...] "when I see {{beautiful}} things, or else I want to weep." [...] He {{paused and}} looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with a sudden drop into a confidential undertone, [...] "Or else I want to pray." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Rosamond had {{finished}} reading the letter she sat quite still, {{with her hands}} folded before her, restraining any show of <b>her</b> keen disappointment, <b>and</b> intrenching herself in quiet passivity under her husband's wrath. Lydgate paused in his movements, looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with biting severity-- ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{all laughed}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> audacity, <b>and</b> Lemuel <b>said,</b> Yes, he would; <b>and</b> she <b>said,</b> [...] "We'll {{give you a}} piece of real Willoughby Centre Mince-pie, if you will." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Ethel {{was drawn}} into her sister's bosom. Presently she drew back, gazed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sister inquiringly, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in an odd, {{doubtful}} voice, [...] "Then you are glad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Monsieur Profond, smiling {{with his}} eyes, said: [...] "That's a nice small dress!" [...] Her mother, very {{handsome}} in black, sat looking <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing. It remained {{for her father}} to apply the test of common sense. [...] "What did you put on that thing for? You're not going to dance." ...|$|E
6000|$|On Sunday some strangers {{were coming}} to the King's palace, so Kari begged to have leave to carry up the water for the Prince's bath, but the others laughed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'What do you want there? Do you think the Prince will ever look at such a fright as you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{considerable}} time Charlie walked beside Sally without uttering a word, and Sally, seeing {{that there was}} something on his mind, kept silence. At last Charlie lifted his eyes from the ground, and with the same innocent gaze with which, as an infant, he had been wont to look up to his guardian, he now looked down <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Sally." ...|$|E
6000|$|The peculiar-looking clergyman {{might have}} seemed more likely to ask such a {{question}} than the beautiful girl, but he looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> anxiously <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Don't nourish morbid dislike and contempt, my dear Lena, {{it is not a}} safeguard. There are such things as perilous reactions. Try to weigh justly, and be grateful for kindness, and to like what is likeable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I am so cold--so cold!" [...] Her {{teeth were}} chattering. I was pained <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sad condition, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> despairingly, for I {{was at my}} wits' end {{to know what to}} do: ...|$|R
6000|$|One day, {{when these}} years of {{abeyance}} had numbered seven, they had strolled as usual {{as far as the}} waterfall, whose faint roar formed a sort of calling voice sufficient in the circumstances to direct their listlessness. Pausing there, he looked up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Why should we not try again, Christine? We are legally at liberty to do so now. Nothing venture nothing have.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She made a {{sensation}} in the drawing-room. Winifred thought it [...] "Most amusing." [...] Imogen was enraptured. Jack Cardigan called it [...] "stunning," [...] "ripping," [...] "topping," [...] and [...] "corking." [...] Monsieur Profond, smiling with his eyes, said: [...] "That's a nice small dress!" [...] Her mother, very handsome in black, sat looking <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing. It remained {{for her father}} to apply the test of common sense. [...] "What did you put on that thing for? You're not going to dance." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} evening, the prince {{returned}} to the palace for the third ball. And the princess went too, and this time she had changed her bear's skin into a dress woven out of the starlight, studded all over with gems, and she looked so dazzling and so beautiful, that everyone wondered <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that no one so beautiful had ever been seen before. And the prince danced with her, and, though he could not induce her to speak, he succeeded in slipping a ring on her finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{the woman}} was making this speech, a little gentleman in black {{came in from the}} next room, {{treading}} as if on velvet. The woman got up, and made him a low curtsey, and folding her arms on her great broad chest, repeated the speech she had made before. Mrs. T. did not get up from her chair, but only made a sort of a bow; which, to be sure, I thought was ill manners, as this gentleman was evidently the apothecary. He looked hard <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, my good woman, and are you come about the place too?' ...|$|E
60|$|When the {{procession}} came opposite to Alice, they all stopped <b>and</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> the Queen <b>said</b> severely 'Who is this?' She {{said it to}} the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.|$|R
6000|$|Marianne looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> steadily, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You know, Elinor, {{that this}} is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to have your {{assertion}} contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> curiously, <b>and</b> then <b>said</b> quietly--the Squire {{was always}} quiet in any matter of real emergency--"Indeed, my dear! That {{is a serious}} matter. However, {{speaking}} off-hand, I think that notwithstanding the disparity of age, Quaritch----" ...|$|R
