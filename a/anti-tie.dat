50|$|Their {{adoption}} by Noël Coward in the 1920s turned polo necks into a brief middle-class fashion trend, and feminists {{made them}} into a unisex item. In the 1950s the black polo neck became a distinctive mark of existentialists. Absorbed into mainstream American fashion by the mid 20th century, the polo neck came {{to be viewed as}} an <b>anti-tie,</b> a smart form of dress for those who rejected formal wear. Senator Ted Kennedy, pianist/conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy, conductor Seiji Ozawa, philosopher Michel Foucault, singer Barry Manilow, scientist Carl Sagan, Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs were among those often seen in polo necks.|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{multiple}} myeloma (MM) have increased bone marrow (BM) angiogen-esis; however, the proangiogenic proper-ties of myeloma cells and the mecha-nisms of MM-induced angiogenesis {{are not completely}} clarified. The angiopoietin system {{has been identified as}} critical in the regulation of vessel formation. In this study we have demonstrated that my-eloma cells express several proangio-genic factors, and, in particular, we found that angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1), but not its antagonist Ang- 2, was expressed by sev-eral human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) at the mRNA and the protein levels. In a transwell coculture system, we observed that myeloma cells up-regulated the Ang- 1 receptor Tie 2 in human BM endothelial cells. Moreover, in an experimental model of angiogenesis, the conditioned medium of HMCLs significantly stimulated vessel formation compared with control or vas-cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment. The presence of <b>anti-Tie</b> 2 blocking antibody completely blunted the proangiogenic effect of XG- 6. Finally, our in vitro results were supported by the in vivo finding of Ang- 1, but not Ang- 2, mRNA and protein expression in purified MM cells obtained from approximately 47 % of patients and by high BM angiogen-esis in patients with MM positive for Ang- 1, suggesting that the angiopoietin system could be involved, at least in part, in MM-induced angiogenesis.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} the Tie 2 /Tek tyrosine kinase receptor in tumor blood vessels, we examined Tie 2 lacZ+/RAG 1 − mice. There was considerable heterogeneity (Tie 2 -negative, Tie 2 -positive, or Tie 2 -composite blood vessels) in subcutaneous xenografts of human colorectal carcinoma (HCT 116; 97. 5 % Tie 2 -positive vessels) versus human melanoma (WM 115; 75. 9 % Tie 2 -positive vessels). Similar patterns of Tie 2 expression occurred in abdominal metastases derived from the same cell lines. Immunostaining for endothelial markers and Tie 2 revealed that endogenous protein levels corresponded with transgene activity. Endothelial cells were confirmed to be of mouse origin through triple immunofluorescence staining with mouse antiserum to human nuclei, isolectin GS-IB 4, and <b>anti-Tie</b> 2. Similar Tie 2 heterogeneity was observed in clinical specimens from a variety of human cancers, including malignant melanoma and colorectal carcinoma. We also examined the effect of Tek-Delta Fc anti-angiogenic therapy on tumor growth and Tie 2 expression patterns in HCT 116 and WM 115 subcutaneous xenografts. Tek-Delta induced extensive tumor regression in HCT 116 tumors and concomitant reductions in Tie 2 -expressing blood vessels. However, no significant responses were seen in Tek-Delta-treated WM 115 tumors. Thus, vascular heterogeneity of Tie 2 expression is cancer-type specific, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment and/or direct cancer cell interactions influence Tie 2 endothelial expression...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is a {{critical}} early event in inflammatory arthritis, facilitating leukocyte migration into the synovium resulting in invasion and destruction of articular cartilage and bone. This study investigates the effect of TLR 2 on angiogenesis, EC adhesion and invasion using microvascular endothelial cells and RA whole tissue synovial explants ex-vivo. METHODS: Microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and RA synovial explants ex vivo were cultured with the TLR 2 ligand, Pam 3 CSK 4 (1 µg/ml). Angiopoietin 2 (Ang 2), Tie 2 and TLR 2 expression in RA synovial tissue was assessed by immunohistology. HMVEC tube formation was assessed using Matrigel matrix assays. Ang 2 was measured by ELISA. ICAM- 1 cell surface expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Cell migration was assessed by wound repair scratch assays. ECM invasion, MMP- 2 and - 9 expression were assessed using transwell invasion chambers and zymography. To examine if the angiopoietin/Tie 2 signalling pathway mediates TLR 2 induced EC tube formation, invasion and migration assays were performed {{in the presence of}} a specific neutralising <b>anti-Tie</b> 2 mAb (10 ug/ml) and matched IgG isotype control Ab (10 ug/ml). RESULTS: Ang 2 and Tie 2 were localised to RA synovial blood vessels, and TLR 2 was localised to RA synovial blood vessels, sub-lining infiltrates and the lining layer. Pam 3 CSK 4 significantly increased angiogenic tube formation (p< 0. 05), and upregulated Ang 2 production in HMVEC (p< 0. 05) and RA synovial explants (p< 0. 05). Pam 3 CSK 4 induced cell surface expression of ICAM- 1, from basal level of 149 ± 54 (MFI) to 617 ± 103 (p< 0. 01). TLR- 2 activation induced an 8. 8 ± 2. 8 fold increase in cell invasion compared to control (p< 0. 05). Pam 3 CSK 4 also induced HMVEC cell migration and induced MMP- 2 and - 9 from RA synovial explants. Neutralisation of the Ang 2 receptor, Tie 2 significantly inhibited Pam 3 CSK 4 -induced EC tube formation and invasion (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: TLR 2 activation promotes angiogenesis, cell adhesion and invasion, effects that are in part mediated through the Tie 2 signalling pathway, key mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of RA...|$|E
