50|$|Clayton {{has been}} the county seat since 1834, {{two years after the}} {{creation}} of Barbour County. Clayton is located geographically {{in the center of the}} county. The town was located at the headwaters of the Pea and Choctawhatchee rivers on the historic road from Hobdy's Bridge over the Pea River to Eufaula on the Chattahoochee River. By 1818, there were a few settlers in the area around Clayton, but settlement began in earnest around 1823. The town was named for <b>Augustine</b> <b>S.</b> Clayton, a Georgia jurist and congressman. Clayton became the county seat of Barbour County in 1833 and was laid out on a central courthouse square plan. The first Circuit Court was held in Clayton on September 23, 1833. The Clayton post office was established in September 1835 with John F. Keener as postmaster. Clayton, with a population of 200, was incorporated on December 21, 1841, by the Alabama Legislature. Its first mayor, after incorporation, was John Jackson.|$|E
50|$|The next Pastor was Rev. John W Osadnik led {{the parish}} {{beginning}} on February 7, 1920. His forte was {{being responsible for}} so many souls and he concerned himself at all times with making them conscious of daily progress in Christian virtue. Bernice Klug became the first parish organist in 1920. Rev Osadnik decided soon after he became pastor that the Church School building was inadequate as a church and school. Therefore, a parish meeting was held in 1923 to discuss the renovation of the original building for a school and the erection of a new church. The official laying and dedication of the cornerstone for the new church took place on July 29, 1923. Due to lack of funds, the work began but proceeded slowly. This was but {{another example of the}} continued struggle of the parishioners spurred on by a fervent pastor. The new church, considered the largest and most beautiful in the Diocese was completed in spring of 1926 at a cost of $23,000 and was blessed by Bishop John F. Noll. Rev. Aloysius Jarka and Rev. John Biernacki served as assistants at that time. In May 1931, a temporary parish hall was erected because the depression caused deep financial stress. The Parish celebrated its Silver Jubilee on Sunday, October 20, 1935. Now a Monsignor, Rev. Osadnik retired on January 23, 1940. He was followed by Rev. Aloysius Jarka appointed by Bishop Noll. Due to illness Rev. Jarka’s pastorship was short and he passed on September 20, 1943. Another memorable event took place during this era as Rev. Louis Ratajczak became the first parishioner to be ordained on May 26, 1923 by Bishop Aldering. Other assistants serving the growing congregation included Rev. Anthony Nadolny, Rev. Michael A. Petzold, Rev. <b>Augustine</b> <b>S.</b> Kondziela, Rev. Wenceslaus A. Karp, Rev. Michael Urbanski, Rev. Leon Pisula, Rev. John Moskal and Rev. Joseph Zielinski. New ordinations of parishioners continued in 1931 with Rev. Clement Ewald, Rev. Casimir Moskwinski and Rev. Louis Jeziorski being ordained priests.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a general overview of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> insights into passions {{as well as}} his approach to the therapy of emotions and their sanctification. Attending to various phases of his writings, this work explores the systematic structure of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> tenets on passions and on the freedom from passions in the context of his philosophical and theological convictions on the issue of amor sui and amor Dei. The analysis begins by examining <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> language of passions and the doctrinal connections between Augustine and his predecessors. I provide a survey of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> usage of emotional terms and criticise the position that Augustine suggested a dichotomy between passio and affectus as well as the claim that none of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> Latin terms can be justifiably translated by the modern term emotion. On the basis of terminological and doctrinal observations, I clarify the general features of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> psychology of passions in Chapter 2. In addressing the issue of how Augustine transformed his predecessors therapy of passions and their ideal of freedom from emotion into his theological framework in Chapter 3, I examine a series of related concepts, such as propatheia, metriopatheia, apatheia and eupatheia, to determine how he understood them in various stages of his philosophical and theological thinking. On this basis, I draw an outline of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> interpretation of emotions in his theological anthropology. During his early period, Augustine adopted the Stoic and Platonic therapy of passions and the Stoic ideal of freedom from emotion (apatheia), but he changed his position later, re-evaluating the received terminologies and values of emotions (love, will, justice, virtue, etc.) {{from the perspective of the}} doctrines of sin and grace. He developed a theological vision and evaluation of the human condition of emotions and he expressed a pessimistic attitude towards the human condition without the help of supernatural grace. Chapter 4 addresses <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> position on the criticism and renewal of passions in social life: the household, city, and the world. In Chapter 5, I argue that <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> ideal of freedom from passions was participation in the inner Trinitarian spiritual life by the bond of the Holy Spirit as a hallmark of deification. This is wholly dependent on the divine kenosis and the transaction in the person of Christ. By virtue of the gift of grace (the salvific real presence of the Holy Spirit in faith), the pilgrimaging citizens of the City of God will be elevated to the divine realm and become transformed into a better substance in the union with God in Heaven. Contrary to arguments by some Orthodox theologians, <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> theory of deification is not simply a matter of fulfilment of humanity without a genuine transformation. While grace improves the control of sinful impulses in the emotional life of believers who suffer the consequences of the damage of the soul through original sin, Augustine maintained that the new life in Heaven denotes freedom from this emotional condition as well as the non-apathetic peaceful love and joy of resurrected persons in their participation in the divine spiritual nature...|$|E

Kamins Drilling Program - Gordon A. MacdonaldPhase I of the Hawaii Geothermal Project (HGP) {{consisted}} of a two-year study on the potential of geothermal energy for the Big Island of Hawaii. It was primarily a geological and geophysical survey program, with supporting activity on the engineering, economic, environmental, legal, and regulatory aspects of geothermal development. One conclusion from Phase I was that an experimental drilling program was essential to verify predictions regarding subsurface conditions. Preliminary results looked sufficiently encouraging to warrant the expenditure of funds (Federal, State, private) to drill the first experimental geothermal well in the Puna area of the Big Island, and Phase II got underway. HGP Well No. 1 was dedicated in the Hawaiian tradition on November 22, 1975. In the remarks presented at the ceremony by Dr. John M. Teem, who {{at that time was}} the top administrator for geothermal energy in ERDA [...] the Energy Research and Development Administration, he commented favorably on the breadth of participation in the HGP by the University, the utility company, and State, County, and Federal authorities; and was optimistic of the spinoff in technology from this project to the national geothermal effort. Dr. Teem cautioned that " [...] the outcome of this project cannot be predicted with confidence;" but that in any case " [...] . we see this project as filling an important void in our geothermal planning matrix.

One approach called a Flexible Path option included possible human missions to near-Earth asteroids. This paper presents an overview of possible asteroid missions with emphasis on the habitation options and vehicle configurations conceived for the crew excursion vehicles. One launch vehicle concept investigated for the Flexible Path option was to use a dual launch architecture that could serve a wide variety of exploration goals. The dual launch concept used two medium sized heavy lift launch vehicles for lunar missions as opposed to the single Saturn V architecture used for the Apollo Program, or the one-and-a-half vehicle Ares I / Ares V architecture proposed for the Constellation Program. This dual launch approach was studied as a Flexible Path option for lunar missions and for possible excursions to other destinations like geosynchronous earth orbiting satellites, Lagrange points, and as presented in this paper, asteroid rendezvous. New habitation and exploration systems for the crew are presented that permit crew sizes from 2 to 4, and mission durations from 100 to 360 days. Vehicle configurations are presented that include habitation systems and tools derived from International Space Station (ISS) experience and new extra-vehicular activity tools for asteroid exploration, Figure 1. Findings from these studies and as presented in this paper indicate that missions to near-Earth asteroids appear feasible in the near future using the dual launch architecture, the technologies under development from the Constellation Program, and systems derived from the current ISS Program.

40|$|Operational {{surprise}} {{attacks are}} large-scale, theater-level intrawar attacks, which {{result from a}} country misestimating the capabilities and intentions of its enemies. This thesis analyzes how these massive surprise attacks occur during war when countries should be especially wary of their enemies and vigilant for any evidence of attack. Three hypotheses may explain the frequency and success of operational surprise attacks including operational secrecy, strategic deception, and intelligence failure. Using the Battle of the Bulge in World War II and the Chinese counteroffensive in the Korean War as case studies, this analysis illustrates these three elements and evaluates their relative causal weight in these attacks. This study concludes that each hypothesis is a contributing element to the surprise attack, but that a failure of intelligence is the critical factor. Moreover, this failure stems from a "victory disease" - a belief held by military leaders and their intelligence staff when victory appears near that one's enemy is too weak or has allowed the opportunity to mount a successful counterattack pass.
