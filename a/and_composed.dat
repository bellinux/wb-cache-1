30|$|Our {{implementation}} offers (de)compositions into 2, 4, 8, or 16 parts. These {{are provided}} by particular procedures named Decompose 2, Decompose 4, Decompose 8, and Decompose 16 (<b>and</b> analogously <b>Compose</b> 2, etc.). The Decompose 2 <b>and</b> <b>Compose</b> 2 procedures conduct Equations (5) and (6), respectively. The Decompose 4 <b>and</b> <b>Compose</b> 4 may either recursively call the Decompose 2 <b>and</b> <b>Compose</b> 2, respectively, or they may directly split the data into four parts and reconstruct back from the four parts, respectively. We have opted for the latter solution since it requires smaller number of operations per voxel. Refer to Appendix B for more details.|$|R

5|$|Catch a Fire is a 1973 album by Bob Marley and the Wailers. It {{was their}} first album {{released}} by Island Records. After touring and recording in the United Kingdom with Johnny Nash, Nash's departure to the United States left the band without enough money to return home; they approached producer Chris Blackwell, who agreed to advance the Wailers money for an album and paid their fares back to Jamaica, where they recorded Catch a Fire. The album features nine songs, two of which were written <b>and</b> <b>composed</b> by Peter Tosh and the remaining seven of which were written <b>and</b> <b>composed</b> by Bob Marley. After Marley's return to London to present the tapes to Blackwell, the producer reworked the tracks with contributions by Muscle Shoals session musician Wayne Perkins, who played guitar on two overdubbed tracks.|$|E
