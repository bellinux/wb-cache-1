5|$|With its short stipe <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> cap, S.quiescens {{is similar}} to S.brevipes. It may be {{distinguished}} from the latter species {{by the color of}} the young (light-brown) cap, the glandular dots at the top of stipes in mature specimens, and the yellowish color {{at the top of the}} stipe.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can be {{distinguished}} from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems, and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum are golden yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has markedly pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may {{be distinguished}} by its rough <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> leaves.|$|E
5|$|The species Pholiota squarrosoides has {{a similar}} outward appearance, {{but it may be}} {{distinguished}} by its brown spores <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> cap surface underneath the scales. In the hedgehog pholiota (Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus), the overall size is smaller—cap diameter —and the spores are cinnamon-brown. Some species in the genus Cystoderma also appear similar, but can be distinguished by microscopic features, like the presence of spherical (rather than club-shaped) cells in the cuticle of the cap, and also their habitat—Cystoderma usually grows on soil, rather than wood.|$|E
40|$|Magnesium {{aluminum}} hydroxides (MAH) of nitrate and carbonate {{forms were}} prepared by co-precipitation, dried at different temperatures, and employed as an adsorbent for pitch <b>and</b> <b>stickies</b> in papermaking. Results indicated that MAH {{that had been}} heat-treated had higher adsorption capacity to model pitch <b>and</b> <b>stickies</b> at neutral pH. Low-temperature-dried magnesium aluminum hydroxides of nitrate form (MAH-NO 3) had higher adsorption capacity to model pitch <b>and</b> model <b>stickies</b> {{than those of the}} carbonate form (MAH-CO 3). Increasing the drying temperature of MAH reduced the difference of adsorption capacity between MAH-NO 3 and MAH-CO 3. Higher-temperature-dried magnesium aluminum hydroxides also showed higher adsorption capacity to model pitch <b>and</b> <b>stickies</b> when the drying temperature was lower than 550 oC. MAH displayed higher adsorption capacity while a lower initial adsorption rate of model stickies than of model pitch. The model pitch <b>and</b> <b>stickies</b> were adsorbed on MAH significantly by charge neutralization and distributed mainly {{on the surface of the}} platelets of magnesium aluminum hydroxides. The experimental isothermal adsorption data of model pitch <b>and</b> <b>stickies</b> on MAH dried at 500 oC fit well to the Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm equations...|$|R

5|$|In 1996, Madonna {{played the}} {{starring}} role in the film, Evita, for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. Madonna's seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998), became {{one of her most}} critically acclaimed releases, and won her a number of Grammy Awards, while being nominated for the Album of the Year. It also won her the VMA for Video of the Year for the title track. From 2001 to 2008, Madonna embarked on four worldwide concert tours—Drowned World (2001), Re-Invention (2004), Confessions (2006) <b>and</b> <b>Sticky</b> & Sweet (2008)—which received a total of eight nominations at the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, but won only one award for the Confessions Tour in 2006, in the category of Most Creative Stage Production. The Brit Awards have nominated Madonna in 12 categories, and in 2006 she won the International Female Solo Artist award, for her 10th studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor. In 2007, Madonna won another Grammy Award in the Best Long Form Music Video category, for the live release of the Confessions Tour.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of termite soldiers secrete a rubberlike <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> chemical concoction that serves to entangle enemies, called a Fontanellar gun, {{and it is}} usually coupled with specialized mandibles. In nasute species of termites (contained within the subfamily Nasutitermitinae), the mandibles have receded. This makes way for an elongated, syringic nasus capable of squirting liquid glue. When this substance is released from the frontal gland reservoir and dries, it becomes sticky and is capable of immobilizing attackers. It is highly effective against other arthropods, including spiders, ants, and centipedes.|$|E

25|$|Vietnamese people {{celebrate}} the Lunar New Year annually, {{which is based}} on a lunisolar calendar (calculating both the earth's movement around the sun and the moon around the earth). Tết is generally celebrated on the same day as Chinese New Year, except when the one-hour time difference between Vietnam and China results in new moon occurring on different days. It takes place from {{the first day of the}} first month of the Vietnamese calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day. Many Vietnamese prepare for Tết by cooking special holiday food and cleaning the house. These foods include bánh chưng, bánh dày, dried young bamboo soup (canh măng), giò, <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> rice. Many customs are practices during Tết, such as visiting a person's house on the first day of the new year (xông nhà), ancestor worship, wishing New Year's greetings, giving lucky money to children and elderly people, and opening a shop.|$|E
25|$|St Kilda has {{a vibrant}} local music scene that has {{produced}} many Australian live music acts. One of the more famous of these is legendary rock band Hunters & Collectors and its front-man Mark Seymour. Members of The Birthday Party lived here in the late 1970s, when they were known under their previous name of The Boys Next Door. Paul Kelly, Tex Perkins, Fred Negro, Rowland S. Howard {{and dozens of other}} independent musicians have also called St Kilda home at some point. For all things related to the seedier and funnier sides of St Kilda music scene see Fred Negro's 'Pub Strip'. Prominent local music venues include the Palais Theatre for larger concerts, the Esplanade Hotel, the Prince of Wales Hotel for larger gigs and DJ's (and backpackers), The George Public Bar on Saturday afternoons, the St Kilda Bowls Club, and The Greyhound – which picked up the local crowd, local bands, local bar staff <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> carpet when The Esplanade Hotel (The Espy) kicked them out after 'suburbification' in the early noughties. The Greyhound has been undergoing a multimillion-dollar redevelopment since 2008 which has seen live music make way for a predominantly Gay & Lesbian clientele, building upon the successful Saturday night drag shows that have been running at the venue for over 15 years.

40|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} has started applying new, ecologically sound technology (biotechnology) in its manufacturing processes. Many interesting enzymatic applications have been proposed. Implemented technologies tend to change the existing industrial process as little as possible. Enzymes have great potentials in solving many problems {{associated with the use of}} recycled fiber, especially related to deinking, drainability, hornification, refining, <b>and</b> <b>stickies.</b> Based on the promising results of mill-scale trials, several mills in the world have started using enzymes for deinking. The potentials of cellulase enzymes have also been demonstrated for reducing the energy requirement in pulp refining, improving the machine runnability <b>and</b> <b>stickies</b> control when using recycled fiber. They have the important benefits in that they can be considered a “green” product. They are natural occurring compounds with little adverse impact on the environment. This paper deals with the importance of recycling of paper, problems associated with the recycling, and potentials of enzymes in solving these problems.

Carl tried to bring her coolness. He ate only poached eggs on toast or soup and salad for dinner, that he might not be torpid. He gave her moss-roses with drops of water like dew on the stems. They sat out on the box-stoop--the unfriendly New York street adopting for a time the frank neighborliness of a village--and exclaimed over every breeze. They talked about the charm of forty degrees below zero. That is, sometimes. Their favorite topic was themselves.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} main types of {{soil in the}} {{watershed}} of Little Nescopeck Creek. Two of them are the Arnot Series and the Alluvial land. The Arnot Series soil is shallow and drained well. It ranges between close to flat and steep. The Alluvial land ranges between close to flat and moderately sloping. It contains gravel and stones and is found along flood plains within the watershed. A large number {{of other types of}} soils are found in very small amounts in the creek's watershed. One type of soil that is also found in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed is the Basher Series. Along the creek near Sybertsville, this type of soil is reddish-brown <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> to a depth of six there inches (15 centimeters). From 6 to 18 inches (15 to 45 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with some areas of yellowish-red.

25|$|Since {{at least}} 1908, Windsor Terrace {{has had its}} own movie theater since the Marathon Theatre opened at present-day 188 Prospect Park W in 1908. The 500-seat Marathon Theatre had a Wurlitzer organ {{installed}} in 1927, shortly before its 1928 demolition. In August of that year, the 1,516-seat, Art Deco Sanders Theatre was opened {{on the site of}} the former Marathon Theatre, where it operated for half a century before its closure in 1976. The building stood vacant for twenty years after that, and investors bought the building in 1993 in hopes of reopening the theatre. The Pavilion Theatre, a 3-screen movie theater within the defunct Sanders Theatre building, opened in 1996 to positive reception from the surrounding communities, which had experienced a cultural decline in prior years. The theater, which expanded to 9 screens in October 2004, suffered from complaints about broken toilets, poorly maintained seats, <b>and</b> <b>sticky</b> floors, as well as a rumor of bedbug-infested upholstery and malfunctions in the theater's heating system. In October 2016, the building was closed in preparation for conversion to a 7-screen, 650-seat theatre. Operated by Nitehawk Cinemas, the refurbished Pavilion Theatre, where patrons would be able to dine and watch movies simultaneously, would be Nitehawk's second movie theater within Brooklyn. As part of the one-year-long, $10 million renovations, the theater would remain largely unchanged except for the addition of a new marquee and an enlargement of the theater's windows. The original plans for the building were to build a 24-condominium building next to the theater, and for the theater's floor space to be shrunk.|$|E
