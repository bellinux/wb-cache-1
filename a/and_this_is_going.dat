The focus of the article is a survey of undergraduates, examining areas that were key to their first experience of studying for a degree, such as entry qualifications, course choice, career prospects, difficult aspects of the course and aspects they felt well-prepared for. These data were supplemented with teacher and lecturer interviews and a university staff questionnaire. The findings demonstrate that student perceptions of undergraduate music study are sometimes at odds {{with those of the}} university staff. In the light of the changing nature, interests and needs of these students, it is timely to rethink both what it is intended to achieve <b>and</b> how <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> assessed...|$|R
