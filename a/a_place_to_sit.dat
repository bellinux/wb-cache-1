25|$|Apremont Triangle Park is a triangular, pocket park {{in front}} of Springfield's {{historic}} Kimball Towers in Metro Center. Named for Springfield's 104th Infantry Regiment, which following the World War I Battle of Apremont, became the first U.S. military unit awarded for heroism by a foreign power, receiving France's highest military honor: the croix de guerre for bravery in combat. The same Springfield unit received the same honor again in World War II. Apremont Triangle Park, steps from both the bohemian Kimball Towers and upper-class Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District offers <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> amidst the restaurants on the northern fringe of the Club Quarter.|$|E
25|$|Carpets {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), reducing sound from walking (particularly in apartment buildings) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2000s, major renovations {{were made}} to the Mahane Yehuda Market, {{including}} infrastructure work, repaving roads and covering some open areas. [...] The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people. Changes driven by the Board included renovations to the streets and alleyways, but also included efforts to draw in cafes and boutiques that would entice more middle-class customers who might become frequent shoppers. According to Eli Mizrachi, chairman of the Mahane Yehuda Merchants Association, whereas shoppers used to come to buy produce, the [...] "new generation" [...] wants a place with entertainment, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and have a cup of coffee, and a place to shop for gifts.|$|E
2500|$|The Army {{issued an}} updated {{breastfeeding}} policy {{which states that}} soldiers must be given space to pump breastmilk, and the space must be [...] "a private space, other than a restroom, with locking capabilities for a soldier to breastfeed or express milk", and must have <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit,</b> a flat surface other than the floor to place the pump, an electrical outlet and access to a [...] "safe water source" [...] near the pumping area. The updated policy also states that although breastfeeding soldiers will still be required {{to take part in}} field training or deployment, commanders must give them time and space to pump and, if needed, discard breastmilk just as they would in garrison. It also instructs commanders to give soldiers [...] "adequate time" [...] to express milk, while further clarifying that time requirements may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the age of the baby. This updated policy supersedes a rule from September 29, 2015; prior to that September rule, the Army was the only service without an established, service-wide standard governing female soldiers and breastfeeding.|$|E
2500|$|Homer and Bart {{participate}} at an [...] "Ugliest Dog" [...] {{contest in}} Springfield" [...] contest, entering Santa's Little Helper. At the contest, Moe feels neglected because {{nobody wants to}} let him sit next to them (Agnes Skinner even sets {{the chair next to}} her on fire). Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much to the delight of the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit.</b> During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) was the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of jurors of American Idol, since that several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled.|$|E

60|$|She first {{looked around}} for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down, and finally {{discovered}} a little grassy mound, which is called a tuffet in the country, and seated herself upon it. Then she tasted the curds and whey and found them very good.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said she; [...] "only I {{think now}} I have walked full {{as far as}} I should ever have to go at home, when making calls, {{before coming to the}} first house.

60|$|Rollo {{soon had}} {{occasion}} to be glad that he had acceded so readily to his father's wishes {{to continue in the}} path; for he soon came to something that amused him very much. It was a man sitting in the top of one of the willow trees that overhung the path, fishing. The willow leaned very much, and this made it easy to climb the stem of it. It had been headed down, too, so that there was <b>a</b> pretty good <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the top of it. It was on the very brink of the stream, and indeed the leaning of the stem carried the top of the willow somewhat over the water, and thus it made quite <b>a</b> good <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and fish.|$|R
60|$|Hannah {{said that}} she should stop, at any rate; so she sat down upon a log by the way-side. Her mother {{said that she}} should go on and leave her. So her mother walked on, looking back now and then, and calling Hannah to come.

Where shall I find you <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down? Pug and her tail have taken up all the room,' whispered Aubrey, as by {{the chief of the}} glittering tables in the hall, he saw Mrs. Pugh, drinking tea, surrounded by her attendant gentlemen, and with her aunt and Ella Ward, like satellites, a little way from her.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked about}} for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down in, and Philip made room for her beside him. She looked {{wonderful}} {{in the night}} lit by wood fires. She was like some rural goddess, and you thought of those fresh, strong girls whom old Herrick had praised in exquisite numbers. The supper was simple, bread and butter, crisp bacon, tea for the children, and beer for Mr. and Mrs. Athelny and Philip. Athelny, eating hungrily, praised loudly all he ate. He flung words of scorn at Lucullus and piled invectives upon Brillat-Savarin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] {{said the}} old man, with a smile, {{and a few minutes}} later a couple of policemen were sitting on the door-step of the agent's house. It was <b>a</b> sunny <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit,</b> and they enjoyed being there very much. One of them {{understood}} English, and the other was well able to tell an angry word when he heard it spoken.|$|R
50|$|To {{the rear}} of the back bar area was yet another, smaller room that was usually closed off on nights when the club wasn't sold out. This was known as the VIP room, and {{regularly}} played host to artists like Jimmy Page, U2 and Aerosmith when they were in town and wanted <b>a</b> private <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> with friends and have a few drinks.|$|R

They had capital, but the poor wife was worn out and ill, and after taking them in for a night, Fulbert liked them. Field was an educated man and a gentleman, and Ful offered them to stay there in partnership. So they stayed, and by and by this child was born, and the poor mother died. The two great bearded men came galloping over to Albertstown from Carrigaboola, with this new born baby, smaller than even Theodore was, and I had the care of her from the very first, and Field used to ride over and see the little thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{nearly three}} years Will and Marjory {{continued}} on these terms, seeing each other {{once or twice a}} week without any word of love between them; and for all that time I believe Will was nearly as happy as a man can be. He rather stinted himself the pleasure of seeing her; and he would often walk half-way over to the parsonage, and then back again, as if to whet his appetite. Indeed there was one corner of the road, whence he could see the church-spire wedged into a crevice of the valley between sloping firwoods, with a triangular snatch of plain by way of background, which he greatly affected as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and moralise in before returning homewards; and the peasants got so much into the habit of finding him there in the twilight that they gave it the name of 'Will o' the Mill's Corner.' ...|$|E
60|$|But I'm a {{high-grade}} feeb. Dr. Dalrymple says I'm {{too smart}} {{to be in the}} Home, but I never let on. It's a pretty good place. And I don't throw fits like lots of the feebs. You see that house up there through the trees. The high-grade epilecs all live in it by themselves. They're stuck up because they ain't just ordinary feebs. They call it the club house, and they say they're just as good as anybody outside, only they're sick. I don't like them much. They laugh at me, when they ain't busy throwing fits. But I don't care. I never have to be scared about falling down and busting my head. Sometimes they run around in circles trying to find <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down quick, only they don't. Low-grade epilecs are disgusting, and high-grade epilecs put on airs. I'm glad I ain't an epilec. There ain't anything to them. They just talk big, that's all.|$|E
50|$|The Burdett-Coutts {{fountain}} (named after Angela Burdett-Coutts the Victorian philanthropist) had {{a partial}} restoration of its intricate granite carvings and sculptures. In {{recent years the}} fountain had been fenced off due to graffiti and vandalism, but along with the restoration the fences were removed, and four symmetrical mirror pools were placed around the fountain along with decorative flower beds. The area is now a public space, with many benches offering <b>an</b> attractive <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{front of}} the church complex is the Plaza Allende, popularly known as Jardin Principal or Main Garden, but most often {{referred}} to simply as el jardin. It was designed in French style, with wrought iron benches and filled with laurel trees. It is <b>a</b> popular <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and relax and bands often play in the kiosk on weekends. In addition to the parish, other important structures, such as the Ignacio Allende House, the Canal House and the municipal palace overlook the garden.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{building}} {{of the church is}} situated in the front, behind it a large Social Hall and Kitchen. The hall features a stage and a large amount of room for tables, formerly used by the school's students as a cafeteria. After the morning Sunday Masses, doughnuts are sold in the social hall, making it <b>a</b> popular <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and chat with others. In between the two old school buildings there is a small garden with the Stations of the Cross, dedicated to victims of abortion.|$|R
6000|$|The back road had {{apparently}} been fatiguing to Mrs. Gereth; she rose there rather white and wan with her walk. A certain sharp thinness was in her ejaculation of [...] "Oh!"--after which she glanced about her for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. The movement was a criticism {{of the order of}} events that offered such a piece of news to a lady coming in tired; but Fleda could see that in turning over the possibilities this particular peril was the one that during the last hour her friend had turned up oftenest. At the end of the short, gray day, which had been moist and mild, the sun was out; the terrace looked to the south, and a bench, formed as to legs and arms of iron representing knotted boughs, stood against the warmest wall of the house. The mistress of Ricks sank upon it and presented to her companion the handsome face she had composed to hear everything. Strangely enough, it was just this fine vessel of her attention that made the girl most nervous about what she must drop in. [...] "Quite a 'demand,' dear, is it?" [...] asked Mrs. Gereth, drawing in her cloak.|$|E
60|$|I crossed one {{swell of}} living turf after another, looking for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and draw. Do not, for heaven's sake, imagine I {{was going to}} sketch from Nature. I was going to draw devils and seraphim, and blind old gods that men worshipped before the dawn of right, and saints in robes of angry crimson, and seas of strange green, and all the sacred or monstrous symbols that look so well in bright colours on brown paper. They are much better worth drawing than Nature; also they are much easier to draw. When a cow came slouching by in the field next to me, a mere artist might have drawn it; but I always get wrong in the hind legs of quadrupeds. So I drew {{the soul of the}} cow; which I saw there plainly walking before me in the sunlight; and the soul was all purple and silver, and had seven horns and the mystery that belongs to all the beasts. But though I could not with a crayon get the best out of the {{landscape}}, it does not follow that the landscape was not getting the best out of me. And this, I think, is the mistake that people make about the old poets who lived before Wordsworth, and were supposed not to care very much about Nature because they did not describe it much.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the middle}} of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather {{made the most of}} it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had already bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins' shanty was {{considered}} an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within, the window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt being raised five feet all around {{as if it were a}} compost heap. The roof was the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun. Doorsill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were [...] "good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window"--of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit,</b> an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents tonight, he to vacate at five tomorrow morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large bundle held their all--bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens--all but the cat; she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "pit" [...] or [...] "box" [...] {{itself is}} simply a {{container}} for storing the sand {{so that it does}} not spread outward across lawns or other surrounding surfaces. Boxes of various shapes are often constructed from planks, logs, or other large wooden frames that allow children easy access to the sand and also provide <b>a</b> convenient <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit.</b> Small sandpits are also available commercially. These are usually made from plastic and are often shaped like an animal or other familiar objects.|$|R
50|$|Nell's came {{onto the}} scene when some clubgoers were tiring of the {{cavernous}} discothèques (e.g., Studio 54) popular in the 1970s and early 1980s. Decorated as a slightly shabby 19th-century English men's club, Nell's afforded its upscale patrons <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> eat, <b>sit,</b> socialize, and listen to live music. Other exclusive supper clubs like M.K. and Au Bar soon followed. On June 4, 1987, artist Robert Mapplethorpe and actress Susan Sarandon hosted a dinner for AIDS charity amfAR at Nell's.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{arrangement}} to {{go fishing}} was made at the little golf club of our summer town on the veranda where we sit in the evening. Oh, it's just <b>a</b> little <b>place,</b> nothing pretentious: the links are not much good for golf; in fact we don't play much golf there, so far as golf goes, and of course, we don't serve meals at the club, it's not like that--and no, we've nothing to drink there because of prohibition. But we go and sit there. It is <b>a</b> good <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit,</b> and, after all, {{what else can you}} do in the present state of the law? ...|$|R
