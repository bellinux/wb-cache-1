5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual <b>acuity</b> in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual <b>acuity.</b> Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E

40|$|Pur po se: To {{analyze the}} visual {{functions}} {{of patients who}} had cataract operation and accommodative intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Ma te ri al and Met hod: Simultaneous bilateral phacoemulsification and Crystalens HD accommodative IOL implantation were performed to 30 eyes of 15 patients {{who had come to}} our clinic with bilateral cataracts. Dominant eyes were planned to be emmetropic and non-dominant eyes were planned to be 0. 75 diopters (D) myopic. Postoperative early examinations and 3 month-interval routine eye and refractive examinations were performed. Mean follow-up time was 23. 1 ± 2. 6 months. Uncorrected and far corrected, monocular and binocular far and near visual <b>acuities</b> were analyzed. Re sults: At the first postoperative month, mean spherical and cylinder refractions were 0. 00 ± 1. 03 D and - 0. 82 ± 0. 47 D, respectively. Mean uncorrected and corrected monocular near visual <b>acuities</b> were 0. 05 ± 0. 92 and 0. 13 ± 0. 92 logMAR (logarithm of minimum angle of resolution), respectively. Mean uncorrected and corrected binocular near visual <b>acuities</b> were 0. 03 ± 1. 00 and 0. 10 ± 1. 00 logMAR, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed between the uncorrected and corrected, monocular and binocular near visual <b>acuities</b> (p= 0. 004, p= 0. 005, respectively).

5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory <b>acuity</b> since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E
5|$|Underwater {{vision is}} {{affected}} by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual <b>acuity</b> is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic <b>acuity,</b> the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.|$|E

Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual <b>acuity,</b> while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E

40|$|M. Phil. Despite {{many years}} of research, {{diabetic}} retinopathy (DR), and diabetic macular edema (DME) remain difficult to diagnose, prevent, and treat. The complicated nature of the disease, the limited information on DR and DME and the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in South Africa, provided motivation for this study. To {{the best of my}} knowledge, this is the first study in our country to identify demographic, medical and visual aspects of DR and DME collectively. A further incentive was the availability in optometry of recently developed computer software based upon multivariate statistics, which provided a unique opportunity to analyze, for example, tri-variate contrast sensitivity <b>acuities</b> using stereo-pair scatter plots. All refractive status measurements were also analyzed and compared with the same method. Together, the results from this study provide a broader clinical and research perceptive on DR and DME. In this cross-sectional study, 202 diabetic patients at the Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg were recruited. Demographic variables included age, gender, race, age of diagnosis, duration of DM, and social habits. Medical variables included systemic conditions present, blood pressures, body mass index (BMI), lipid profiles, glycerated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and other available biochemical data (for example cholestrol, urea and creatinine levels). Visual variables included, distance, pinhole and near visual <b>acuities,</b> contrast sensitivity <b>acuities,</b> refractive status measured with autorefraction, colour vision, Amsler grid, intra ocular pressures (IOP), and fundus photography. Administration of the Impact of Visual Impairment (IVI) questionnaire provided new information concerning the restrictions in daily living participation caused by DR or DME. The predominant characteristics of the study population consisted of Type 1 DM among female Coloured subjects. Approximately 66 % of all subjects had also been diagnosed with hypertension. The mean age of the subjects was 52 (± 14) years, age of diagnosis 41 (± 13) years, and duration of DM 10. 8 (± 9. 7) years. Mean blood pressures (136 / 81 ± 20. 5 / 11 mmHg) and glycerated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c, 9. 9 ± 3. 4 %) values were slightly higher than the recommended control levels (BP= 120 / 80 mmHg and HbA 1 c = 6 to 7 %). However, mean total cholesterol and all other biochemical tests results were within recommended control ranges. Visually, mean refractive states were near emmetropia. Both distance visual <b>acuities</b> and pinhole <b>acuities</b> displayed mild visual loss, between 6 / 9 and 6 / 12. Mean contrast sensitivity <b>acuities</b> decreased from 6 / 12 to 6 / 24 to 6 / 60, as contrast levels were reduced from 100 % to 10 % and 2. 5 % respectively. A high percentage (75 %) of tritan colour defect was found overall. Mean intra ocular pressures in the right and left eyes were approximately 17 (± 4. 8) mmHg, and 21 % of subjects demonstrated Amsler grid defects.

5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis.

Once again, this suggests lower visual <b>acuity</b> in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina.

5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual <b>acuity</b> and reduced response times.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} {{spatial resolution}} in the parafovea for targets designed to isolate either the long-wavelength (L) or the middle-wavelength (M) cones. Landolt C optotypes were presented for 100 ms on a calibrated monitor at an eccentricity of 5 ° {{to the left or}} right of fixation. There were large individual differences in the ratio of the resolution obtained with L targets to that obtained with M targets, and we suggest that these differences reflect variations in the relative sampling densities of L and M cones in the parafovea. In Experiment 1, we measured contrast thresholds for targets of varying size. Among 10 unselected observers, there was a threefold variation in the ratio of the contrast thresholds for the smallest targets. In Experiments 2 and 3, we held contrast constant and we varied size, in order to establish the minimal target that could be discriminated for each of the two classes of cone. In Experiment 2, two groups of observers, {{selected on the basis of}} their settings on a flicker-photometric test, showed a highly significant difference in the ratio of the M and L <b>acuities</b> on the spatial task.

5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual <b>acuity</b> is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual <b>acuity</b> and chemical or tactile <b>acuity,</b> such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—In {{the past}} 5  years {{there has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase in the use of radiotherapy to treat subfoveal neovascular membranes (NVMs) in both Europe and the USA despite the high cost. An alternative, more cost effective method of delivery using x ray simulation and bite block head fixation is described.  METHOD— 15 patients were recruited with classic subfoveal NVMs. Head fixation was achieved with a customised Perspex mask for eight patients and a bite block for seven. An x ray simulator was used to check the field of irradiation. No computerised tomography (CT) was performed. All patients received a total dose of 13. 3  Gy ionising radiation. Visual <b>acuities</b> were charted before and after treatment over a 24  month period.  RESULTS—After 24  months, 5 / 8 (67 %) in the mask group showed stable visual <b>acuities</b> (less than two line change on Snellen chart) compared with 3 / 7 (43 %) in the bite block group. This difference may be attributed to a variation in the pretreatment visual <b>acuities</b> in the two groups. From several studies {{it has been estimated that}} 24  months after diagnosis 28 % untreated individuals would have stable vision compared with 53 % patients in this study.  CONCLUSIONS—These results compare favourably with other studies and show that teletherapy can be a safe and effective form of treatment for subfoveal NVMs. The authors have described an alternative method of head fixation and shown that CT scanning is not essential. This method of delivery is considerably less costly than that traditionally used and may allow greater numbers of patients to benefit from radiotherapy treatment.    Keywords: radiotherapy; age related macular degeneratio...|$|R
