50|$|Non-{{pressure}} refuel systems operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a shut-off valve. When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for <b>automatic</b> nozzle <b>shut-off,</b> thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Omsk at 0:30 and was refueled with 38 tons of jet fuel. 5 hours after landing, the four engine propfan lifted off the runway {{on its way}} to Yakutsk for cold weather testing. Within seconds of becoming airborne one of the Progress D-27 engines with Contra-rotating propellers reached an over-speed condition and automatically shut down. The forward propeller stopped rotating but {{due to the nature of}} the failure the aft propeller kept turning, producing negative thrust. At this point the flight crew increased power to the remaining three engines but a problem with the RPM sensors on one of them led to <b>automatic</b> engine <b>shut-off.</b> Thus, the An-70 ended up flying at low speed with only two properly functioning engines, with the third engine generating over 11,000 pounds of negative thrust and disrupting airflow across the wing.|$|R

40|$|Motorcycles {{are major}} {{vehicles}} used for mobility especially in Southeast Asia, with their number doubling {{in the last}} decade. Motorcycles are also {{a major reason for}} air and noise pollution especially in the cities. In this study the hydrogen fuel cell powered motorcycle prototype was designed, fabricated and tested. The design criteria included futuristic style, ergonomic, low noise, zero exhaust emission and high tank-to-wheel fuel efficiency. Other criteria are handling flexibility, dynamic stability, good acceleration under any road and weather conditions. A triple hybrid power train was developed consisting of a 7 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell, Lithium polymer batteries and super-capacitor connected to an electric drive with two permanent magnet motors. The fuel system consists of two light weight carbon fibre-aluminium cylinders with total capacity of 52 litres storing 1. 25 kilogram hydrogen at 350 bar. To ensure its safety against hydrogen leakage, hydrogen leak detectors connected to an <b>automatic</b> hydrogen supply <b>shut-off</b> function was installed. A water cooling system was also designed, fabricated and tested and used to remove the heat produced by the fuel cell stack and power electronics. It keeps the fuel cell stack temperature below 75 ?. Hollow stressed members of the fuel cell mounting and vehicle frame were used which allowed the flow of cooling water and process media to the fuel cell. An on board data acquisition system was developed to acquire real time data such as speed, distance travelled, hydrogen consumption, power produced and other information. Laboratory test on the analysis and performance of the triple hybrid drive train system used a water brake dynamometers which was customized to collect the required data especially the acceleration response and efficiency of the power train under Worldwide Harmonized Motorcycle Test Cycle 1 and 2 (WMTC). Different hybridization configurations were compared. The main road test was conducted during the successful participation in the technology class, of the 4, 000 kilometre South African Solar Challenge 2008. During the real time test, the motorcycle was subjected to different road conditions including steep terrain, flat road, variable weather conditions and endurance. A mobile hydrogen refuelling system was designed to refuel the motorcycle safely and efficient. Results from the endurance test showed that the motorcycle performed according to the design criteria. The maximum speed achieved was 82 km/h slightly lower than the designed 100 km/h due to the road conditions, a trade off from hill climb capability with 30 % slope, to maximum speed have been made. The maximum tank-to-wheel fuel efficiency achieved was 42. 9 % using WMTC 2. The best fuel consumption measured was 68. 9 km for one litre petrol equivalent. The hydrogen fuel cell motorcycle showed good driving behaviour without fatal breakdown under robust road and weather conditions. Also the triple hybrid drive train was found to increase the peak power by 57 % compare to a non-hybrid drive train thereby reducing the fuel cell load cycles by 35 %. Finally, the result of the study can be used to predict the range, traveling time and efficiency of the motorcycle or any vehicle using triple hybrid drive trai...|$|R

50|$|In modern designs, {{once the}} water has reached boiling point, the kettle {{automatically}} deactivates, preventing the water from boiling away and damaging the heating element. A bimetallic strip thermostat is commonly used as the <b>automatic</b> <b>shut-off</b> mechanism.

This allows the thermostat to be coarsely calibrated, which in turn allows the kettle to function normally at a wide range of altitudes. A consequence of this design is that the kettle may fail to deactivate if the lid is left open, due to an insufficient amount of steam being ducted onto the bimetallic strip.|$|E

50|$|In April 2010, a Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 {{million project}} to {{rehabilitate}} and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting {{the first four}} of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to 16 ft in height, lengthened by 37 ft and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, <b>automatic</b> <b>shut-off</b> and bypass valves were installed for Plant 2. The shut-off valves will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the bypass valves will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved landscaping were implemented. Renovations on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013. The new 6.5 MW Francis turbine generator in Plant 1 and the entire project was finished in mid-2014.

50|$|A basic halogen oven {{features}} a heating chamber {{consisting of a}} clear glass bowl with a removable glass lid to which the heating assembly is secured. Inside the heating chamber, multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the heating assembly are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an <b>automatic</b> <b>shut-off</b> timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the heating assembly has a handle to allow users to safely lift the lid off the unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an extension ring. This raises the heating assembly to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing {{the volume of the}} oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A safety shut-off switch turns off the lamp when the lid is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.|$|E
40|$|Managing heat {{produced}} by computer processors {{is an important}} issue today, especially when the size of processors is decreasing rapidly while the number of transistors in the processor is increasing rapidly. This poster describes a preliminary study of the process of adding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to a standard silicon paste covering a CPU. Measurements were made in two rounds of tests to compare the rate of cool-down with and without CNTs present. The silicon paste acts as an interface between the CPU and the heat sink, increasing the heat transfer rate away from the CPU. To the silicon paste was added 0. 05 % by weight of CNTs. These were not aligned. A series of K-type thermocouples was used to measure the temperature as a function of time {{in the vicinity of the}} CPU, following its shut-off.

40|$|Diesel {{fuel oil}} (DFO) spills at fueling {{platforms}} increase railroad operating costs by decreasing the locomotive miles traveled per gallon of DFO dispensed {{and increasing the}} cost of recovering and treating spilled DFO. Pressure fluctuations in the fuel system can trigger inadvertent dispensing nozzle shut off before a locomotive fuel tank is full. Fuel tanks occasionally overflow after the <b>automatic</b> <b>shut-off</b> mechanism on a nozzle is disabled to prevent subsequent inadvertent nozzle shut off. A hydraulic pressure surge analysis of two fueling yards suggests a correlation between the magnitude of these pressure fluctuations {{and the amount of}} DFO lost from fuel tank overflows. For example, at a fueling yard with a history of high DFO spillage, system pressure fluctuations are predicted to be large enough to trigger inadvertent shut off and potential fuel tank overflow following closure of one nozzle. In contrast, at a fueling yard with a history of low DFO spillage, pressure fluctuations insufficient to cause inadvertent shut off and potential overflow are predicted following the simultaneous closure of up to four (4) nozzles. Appropriately sized, pressurized bladder surge tanks installed on fueling platforms prevent inadvertent nozzle shut off, eliminating the need to monitor the filling process and reducing fuel tank overflows and the subsequent loss of DFO.

40|$|In {{developing}} {{training for}} new technologies, designers encounter many options {{in an effort}} to increase system knowledge and produce effective system usage. Technological advancements do, however, provide the opportunity for more dynamic and interactive training methods. Moreover, technology may require the acquisition of time-sensitive skills. Many technologies have <b>automatic</b> <b>shut-off</b> or low-power functions, like the shutting off the backlight of a cell phone after 30 seconds. These system functions may lead to errors for novice users or for infrequent tasks. To develop effective training for time-sensitive tasks, the learner needs instruction on how to accurately perform the task at a particular pace. One potentially fruitful avenue of exploration is to provide the learning goal during training through the pace of the training materials. This presentation pace is the rate at which training tasks are presented to the learner during training; this pace may be fixed or self-regulated. The goal of the current {{study was to examine the}} role of presentation in learning a complex technology using four types of pacing for younger adults (Experiment 1) and older adults (Experiment 2). The results of this study show there seems to be a benefit of self-paced training for younger adults and older adults. These findings provide insight into future studies investigating the underlying mechanisms related to the benefits of self-paced training.

40|$|Executive Summary: Many {{pathways}} {{exist for}} transportation agencies {{and other public}} and private agencies to become responsible for sites contaminated by hazardous wastes. As a reult, agencies frequently face a multitude of lega, regulatory, financial, technical, and health risk problems. When transportation agencies {{become involved in the}} remediation of hazardous waste sites, the common practice is to hire consultants and contractors for the clean up process. Because the field of hazardous waste site remediation is changing so rapidly, agency personnel evaluating the consultant 2 Ì† 7 s recommendations need to ahve access to the most recent regulatory and remediation information. Early stages of the remediation process typically involve site assessment, and the identification of feasible technologies for treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a user friendly computerized methodology for screening out the most inappropirate treatment technologies for a specific waste at a specific site. The STEP model was developed for this purpose using knowledge-base expert system techniques. Object oriented programming was used to interface multiple rule-bases, databases, and a simulation model. The STEP model was applied to a case study involving the spillage of 27, 000 gallons of JP- 4 jet fuel, due to the failure of an <b>automatic</b> <b>shut-off</b> vlave, at an air facility. The recommendation produced by the model agreed with the acutal remedial action taken at the site. SPET is a prototype model that, if developed to its potential, could be used to promote nation-wide consistency, provide the framework for building a shared base of knowledge about successful and unsuccessful solution techniques, allow non-experts to do preliminary screening of appropirate technologies, and provide a training tool for in-house personnel...|$|E
40|$|The loss of {{nutrients}} to the aquatic environment caused by the irrigation of farm dairy effluent (FDE) is a prominent and contentious feature of dairy farming in New Zealand. This thesis investigates management practices and technologies with potential to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in drainage water from mole and pipe drained dairy pasture soils irrigated with FDE. Farm dairy effluent management was both monitored, using remote sensing technologies, and modelled on a case study farm. During the winter and spring of 2008, an estimated 7, 890 m 3 of FDE was applied {{in excess of the}} soil water deficit (SWD). System constraints were the cause of about two-thirds (5, 070 m 3) of this over-applied FDE volume. It was estimated that as much as 502 kg TN and 83 kg TP could have been lost to surface waters due to inadequate infrastructure. The two main system constraints were the farmâ€™s insufficient FDE storage capacity (2, 000 m 3) and the inability of the farmâ€™s irrigator to apply small application depths (< 8 mm). Furthermore, this study highlighted the significant loss {{of nutrients}} that can occur under FDE irrigation and reinforced the need for tools to assist farmers with FDE management. A number of tools were developed to help farmers manage FDE irrigation. The use of a soil water balance, incorporating actual farm daily rainfall, is an effective method for informing the scheduling of FDE irrigations. Also, the risk of over-application of FDE to soils caused by travelling irrigator breakdowns or stoppages was substantially reduced by the use of a breakdown alert and <b>automatic</b> <b>shut-off</b> system developed and evaluated in this study. Given the elevated risk of P losses from soils treated with FDE, a method of capturing P from drainage waters was investigated. A field experiment was conducted to quantify the ability of Papakai tephra, installed into mole and pipe drainage systems, to remove P from drainage waters. This drainage system reduced TP losses in drainage by about 50 % (c. 0. 14 kg P/ha) over a drainage season, which equated to a 2. 8 kg P reduction for a 20 -hectare effluent block. As farmers frequently crop effluent block soils, the effect of summer forage cropping on nutrient losses was quantified. The practice of spring cultivating long-term dairy pasture, summer forage cropping and autumn regrassing increased the quantity of TN measured in drainage water, over three drainage seasons (2006 to 2008), by 84 % (21 kg N/ha), compared to long-term pasture. If this study had commenced in spring with a more typical pattern of rainfall and drainage, this increase is estimated to have only been about 23. 7 % (5. 9 kg N/ha). Based on these results, summer forage cropping is estimated to increase whole-farm drainage water N losses by about 5 %, when 10 % of a farmâ€™s area is cultivated each year. Of the management practices and technologies studied, the greatest opportunity to reduce the losses of N and P to surface water from the case study farmâ€™s effluent block, is through investment in FDE system infrastructure, particularly adequate storage capacity, and the use of decision support and fail-safe tools to assist the implementation of deficit irrigation of FDE...|$|E
