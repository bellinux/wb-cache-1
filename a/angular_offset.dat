In Experiment 1 participants learned and were tested on statue locations in a virtual environment while their field-of-view (FOV) was restricted to 40 °, 20 °, 10 °, or 0 ° (diam). As FOV decreased, overall placement errors, estimated distances, and <b>angular</b> <b>offsets</b> increased. Experiment 2 showed large compressions but no effect of FOV for perceptual estimates of statue locations. Experiment 3 showed an association between FOV size and proprioception influence.

40|$|An index-guiding {{photonic}} crystal fiber (PCF) {{with an array}} of air holes surrounding the silica core region has special characteristics compared to conventional single-mode fibers (SMFs). Using the effective index method and the Gaussian beam propagation theory, the macro-bending and splice losses for PCFs are investigated. The wavelength dependence of the cladding index of the PCF has been taken properly into account. We obtain the effective spot size for different configurations of PCFs, which is used for computing the splice losses. The Gaussian approximation for the fundamental modal field leads to simple closed-form expressions for the splice losses produced by transverse, longitudinal and <b>angular</b> <b>offsets.</b> Calculations of macro-bending losses are based on antenna theory for bend standard fibers.

40|$|We {{test whether}} the spiral {{patterns}} apparent in many large disk galaxies should {{be thought of}} as dynamical features that are stationary in a co-rotating frame for > t_dyn, as implied by the density wave approach for explaining spiral arms. If such spiral arms have enhanced star formation (SF), observational tracers for different stages of the SF sequence should show a spatial ordering, from up-stream to downstream in the corotating frame: dense HI, CO, tracing molecular hydrogen gas, 24 micron emission tracing enshrouded SF and UV emission tracing unobscured young stars. We argue that such a spatial ordering should be reflected in the angular cross-correlation (CC, in polar coordinates) using all azimuthal positions among pairs of these tracers; the peak of the CC should be offset from zero, in different directions inside and outside the corotation radius. Recent spiral SF simulations by Dobbs & Pringle, show explicitly that for the case of a stationary spiral arm potential such <b>angular</b> <b>offsets</b> between gas and young stars of differing ages should be observable as cross-correlation offsets. We calculate the angular cross-correlations for different observational SF sequence tracers in 12 nearby spiral galaxies, drawing on a data set with high quality maps of the neutral gas HI, THINGS), molecular gas (CO, HERACLES) along with 24 micron emission (Spitzer, SINGS); we include FUV images (GALEX) and 3. 6 μm emission (Spitzer, IRAC) for some galaxies, tracing aging stars and longer timescales. In none of the resulting tracer cross-correlations for this sample do we find systematic <b>angular</b> <b>offsets,</b> which would be expected for a stationary dynamical spiral pattern of well-defined pattern speed. This result indicates that spiral density waves in their simplest form are not an important aspect of explaining spirals in large disk galaxies. Comment: 13 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

Given a non-degenerate calibration dataset and considering the stochastic {{models of the}} sensors, the task is formulated as a maximum likelihood problem. In order to facilitate the derivation of consistent measurement equations, the trajectory of the robot and other auxiliary variables are included into the optimization problem. This formulation can {{be transformed into a}} nonlinear least squares problem which can be readily solved. Applied to our legged robot StarlETH, the framework estimates kinematic parameters (segment lengths, body dimensions, <b>angular</b> <b>offsets),</b> accelerometer and gyroscope biases, as well as full inter-sensor calibrations. The generic structure easily allows the inclusion of additional sensor modalities. Based on datasets obtained on the real robot the consistency and performance of the presented approach are successfully evaluated. I...|$|R

Search and weather radars have a circular display (Plan Position Indicator, PPI) that covers a round screen, but this is not technically a raster.

50|$|Wobble blade or wobble dado or {{adjustable}} dado {{consists of}} a circular blade mounted on an adjustable multi-piece hub, that varies {{the angle of the}} blade to the arbor shaft. The width of the dado cut increases as the angle gets farther from the radial normal (90°) to the arbor. While it is possible to adjust the thickness of the cut while the saw is mounted on the arbor, accurate adjustment is usually difficult because tightening the arbor nut often changes the adjustment. Also, because of their inherent geometry wobble blades can only produce a flat-bottomed dado at one width setting, which may be a disadvantage in certain joinery operations. Another disadvantage of a wobble dado over stacked dado is undesirable vibrations. The magnitude of these vibrations varies with the blade's <b>angular</b> <b>offset.</b> In other words, the wider the dado, the stronger the vibrations.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of the wide-field ^ 12 CO (1 [...] 0) {{observations}} of the nearby barred galaxy M 83 carried out with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA). The interferometric data are combined with the data obtained with the Nobeyama 45 -m telescope to recover the total-flux. The target fields of the observations cover the molecular bar and part of the spiral arms, with a spatial resolution of 110 pc x 260 pc. By exploiting the resolution and sensitivity to extended CO emission, the impact of the galactic structures on the molecular gas content is investigated in terms of the gas kinematics and the star formation. By inspecting the gas kinematics, the pattern speed of the bar is estimated to be 57. 4 ± 2. 8 km s^- 1 kpc^- 1, which places the corotation radius to be about 1. 7 times the semi-major radius of the bar. Within the observed field, HII regions brighter than 10 ^ 37. 6 erg s^- 1 in Hα luminosity are found to be preferentially located downstream of the CO emitting regions. Azimuthal <b>angular</b> <b>offsets</b> between molecular gas and star forming (SF) calculated with the angular cross-correlation method confirm the trend. By comparing with a cloud orbit model based on the derived pattern speed, the <b>angular</b> <b>offsets</b> are found to be in accordance with a time delay of about 10 Myr. Finally, to test whether the arm/bar promote star formation efficiency (SFE ≡ Star Formation Rate (SFR) /H_ 2 mass), SFR is derived with the diffuse-background-subtracted Halpha and 24 μm images. The arm-to-interarm ratio of the SFE is found to lie in the range of 2 to 5, while it is 1 if no background-removal is performed. The CO-SF offsets and the enhancement of the SFE in the arm/bar found in the inner region of M 83 are in agreement with the predictions of the classical galactic shock model.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{estimating}} the corotation radius in tightly wound spiral galaxies, through {{analysis of the}} radial variation of the offset between arms traced by the potential (P-arms) and those traced by dust (D-arms). We have verified the predictions of semi-analytical theory through hydrodynamical simulations and have examined {{the uniqueness of the}} galactic parameters that can be deduced by this method. We find that if the range of <b>angular</b> <b>offsets</b> measured at different radii in a galaxy is greater than around pi/ 4, it is possible to locate the radius of corotation to within ~ 25 %. We argue that the relative location of the P- and D-arms provides more robust constraints on the galactic parameters than can be inferred from regions of enhanced star formation (SF-arms), since interpretation of the latter involves uncertainties due to reddening and the assumed star formation law. We thus stress the importance of K-band studies of spiral galaxies. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 15 pages, 23 figure...|$|R

40|$|Equations {{of motion}} for a coupled rotor-body system were derived {{for the purpose}} of {{studying}} air and ground resonance characteristics of helicopters that have bearingless main rotors. For the fuselage, only four rigid body degrees of freedom are considered; longitudinal and lateral translations, pitch, and roll. The rotor is assumed to consist of three or more rigid blades. Each blade is joined to the hub by means of a flexible beam segment (flexbeam or strap). Pitch change is accomplished by twisting the flexbeam with the pitch-control system, the characteristics of which are variable. Thus, the analysis is capable of implicitly treating aeroelastic couplings generated by the flexbeam elastic deflections, the pitch-control system, and the <b>angular</b> <b>offsets</b> of the blade and flexbeam. The linearized equations are written in the nonrotating system retaining only the cyclic rotor modes; thus, they comprise a system of homogeneous ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients.

We used a high resolution 12 CO (J= 1 - 0) image obtained by Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA) and an Hα image. We derived <b>angular</b> <b>offsets</b> (θ) in the galactic disk, and found that these offsets show a linear dependence on the angular rotation velocity of gas (ΩG). This linear relation can be expressed by an equation: θ = (ΩG −ΩP) · tHα, where ΩP and tHα are constant. Here, ΩP corresponds to the pattern speed of spiral arms and tHα is interpreted as the timescale between the peak compression of the molecular gas in spiral arms and the peak of massive star formation. We may thus determine ΩP and tHα simultaneously by fitting a line to our θ −ΩG plot, if we assumed they are constant. From our plot, we obtained tHα = (4. 8 ± 1. 2) × 106 yr and ΩP = 26 + 10 − 6 km s− 1 kpc− 1, which are consistent with previous studies.
