50|$|For grades fifth to twelfth, a 1 to 10 {{grading system}} is used with 10 being the best, 1 being {{the worst and}} 5 being the minimum passing grade. The system of {{continuous}} assessment is also used, with individual marks for each test, oral examination, project, homework or classwork being entered in the register (these individual marks are known as note). There {{must be at least}} as many note for a subject as the number of weekly classes for that subject plus one. Some subjects also require a partial examination {{at the end of the}} semester (teză). This requirement is however regulated by the Ministry as mandatory. The partial is valued at 25% of the final mark, and for grades 5 to 8 it applies to Romanian Language and Mathematics and only in the eight year, Geography or History, and in the case of a bilingual school or one with teaching in a minority language, that particular language. At the end of each semester, an average is computed following a four-step procedure: first, all marks are added and an <b>arithmetical</b> <b>average</b> is computed from those marks. If there is a thesis, this average, with 0.01 precision, is multiplied by 3, the mark at the teză (rounded to the nearest integer) is added, then everything is divided by 4. This average (with or without teză) is then rounded to the closest integer (5/4 system - thus 9.5 is 10) and forms the semester average per subject. The next step is computing the yearly average per subject. This is done by adding the two semester averages per subject and divided by 2. This is not rounded. The last step is adding all the yearly averages per subject and dividing that amount by the total number of subjects. This forms the yearly grade average (media generală). This is neither weighted nor rounded. If the yearly average per subject is below 5 for a maximum of two subjects, then the student must take a special exam (corigență) at the failed subject in August, in front of a school board. If he fails this exam, he must repeat the entire year (repetenție). If the yearly average per subject is below 5 for three subjects or more, the student is no longer entitled to the special exam and must repeat the year.|$|E

Six of these lines came from the Taichung population, and others derived from seven different sites. Forty different primers were used to give a total of 646 reproducible amplification products, 547 (84. 7 %) of them being polymorphic. Genetic divergence was determined using Jaccard's similarity coefficient, and a final dendrogram was constructed by UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method with <b>arithmetical</b> <b>averages)</b> cluster analysis in the CLUSTER procedure of the SAS system. The RAPD analysis was a useful tool in determining the extent of genetic diversity among Tainan-white maize inbred lines in the present case.

This research was aimed to analyze the genetic distance among rubber clones using RAPD method. Analysis was conducted on 45 rubber clones with 12 random primers. Pair-wise comparisons of unique and shared polymorphic amplification products were used to generate similarity coefficients. These coefficients were employed to construct a dendogram by using an Unweighted Pair-Group Method with <b>Arithmetical</b> <b>Averages</b> (UPGMA).

40|$|The {{systematics}} of the endemic New Zealand carabid genus Holcaspis are investigated, using phenetic and cladistic methods, {{to construct}} phenetic and phylogenetic relationships. Three different character data sets: morphological, allozyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) {{based on the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are used to estimate the relationships. Cladistic and morphometric analyses are undertaken on adult morphological characters. Twenty six external morphological characters, including male and female genitalia, are used for cladistic analysis. The results from the cladistic analysis are strongly congruent with previous publications. The morphometric analysis uses multivariate discriminant functions, with 18 morphometric variables, to derive a phenogram by clustering from Mahalanobis distances (D²) of the discrimination analysis using the unweighted pair-group method with <b>arithmetical</b> <b>averages</b> (UPGMA). In contrast to the cladistic analysis, the phonetic clustering results in a less useful estimation of affinities of the genus. However, this analysis reveals a method with a relatively high probability of assigning an individual to the correct species (70 %- 100 %). Therefore morphometric analysis is shown to be useful for species identification. Allozyme data are derived by electrophoresis using a cellulose acetate medium. A total of 42 alleles of 13 presumptive loci from 10 enzyme systems are used for cladistic and phenetic analysis of 13 Holcaspis species. A phenogram is generated by UPGMA clustering using a genetic distance matrix. Cladograms are constructed using both independent alleles and loci as characters. The cladograms from both allele and locus data are highly congruent with the phenogram derived from the genetic similarity matrix data. Intraspecific allozyme variation is also investigated with {{a limited number of}} populations and a relatively confined range of sample sites. A high degree of heterozygosity is revealed in H. oedicnema. The mean genetic similarity among the Holcaspis species is I= 0. 382 ± 0. 142 and the mean genetic distance is D= l. 055 ± 0. 143. Molecular data are used in the intraspecific variation study and to estmate species relationships of Holcaspis. Optimal RAPD-PCR conditions such as primer concentration, magnesium chloride concentration and RAPD-PCR programme, are established for reproducible and informative amplifying of banding patterns of Holcaspis species. A total of 271 band positions are scored for all individuals studied and are subjected to both cladistic and phenetic analysis to estimate the species relationships. Phenograms using UPGMA are generated from both simple matching similarity coefficients and Jaccard's similarity coefficients. The resulting two phenograms are identical. Principal coordinate analysis is also used to demonstrate the relationships among species. The results are congruent with the phenograms. However, the pattern of species relationships is indistinct. The cladogram generated from cladistic analysis shows relatively high congruence with the phenogram. In addition, the results from RAPD-PCR are much more congruent with the results from allozyme data than with the morphological data. The RAPD-PCR technique is, therefore, promising as a new tool for estimating phylogenetic relationships. In addition, the results show that the RAPD-PCR technique is a constructive, quick method for species grouping. From both RAPD-PCR and allozyme data, H. oedicnema shows extreme intraspecific variation that suggests that H. oedicnema is a species complex. To assess the best fit of phylogenetic relationships of the Holcaspis species, three character data sets: morphological, allozyme, and RAPD-PCR, are tested for congruence using both character congruence and taxonomic congruence method. The result indicates that the character congruence method of all character data sets combined produced a more informative result than the taxonomic congruence method. This study confirms the previous indication that H. punctigera and H. mordax are closely related both morphologically and genetically. The study suggests that H. ovatella is most genetically distinct {{from the rest of the}} Holcaspis species and that H. oedicnema is a genetically diverse species...|$|R

All the studied fish was divided into groups according to external indexes (among them color) in the following way: group I (sample) – grey and white form (Hikarimuji which is the most similar to Magoi), group II – black and white form (Kumonryu), group III – black and yellow form (Utsurimono), group IV – red and white form (Kohaku). For further researches scientists selected 25 exemplars of carp koi for each group. It is necessary to have a starting point (sample) for statistical research of differences in carp koi forms. Sample or optimal form was determined by distances of deviations of scalar sums of form vectors of carp koi from nyvkivskyi carp. Morphometric study of carp koi was conducted according to 30 plastic attributes, in accordance with method proposed by I. F. Pravdin.

It is evident that the less curves of two compared populations are lapped over, the more difference is between middle М 1 and М 2 divided by sum of middle quadric deviations σ 1 і σ 2. Coefficient of directive deviation (Кdv) characterizes percentage deviation of two compared indexes of particular attribute. For deviation determination (Кdv) between the index, the difference between an attribute A and the same attribute of sample index E is necessary to divide by index of attribute E and multiply by 100 %. Estimation criterion is the same as in variability index – low level of deviation Кdv ≤ 5 %, middle Кdv  = 10 - 30 %, large Кdv > 30 - 50 %. At conducting the morphological analysis of groups №I-IV of carp koi different forms authors researched 30 plastic attributes. Plastic attributes were grouped according to indexes which were determined by percents from zoological length of the body (standard length, trunk length, the biggest and smallest heights, antidorsal and postdorsal distances, length of tail-stem, antipectoral, antiventral, antianal pectroventral, ventroanal distances and length of a head); were determined by percents from length of a head (length of a fish snout, eye diameter, sight unseen distance, height and width of forehead, lengths of lower and upper jaw, height of the head near the nape and through the middle of the eye) but the measuring of all the fins were held separately so as for koi they are the criterion for estimation of form quality, which also were determined by percents from body length (the biggest height and length of dorsal fin, the biggest height and length of anal fin, length of chest and ventral fin, lower and upper flippers of tail fin). Taking research into account we determined the sample form (group № 1) which according to indexes of growth potential was proved to be the best, it means that difference from Amur carp in group № 1 was the lowest. The majority of researched plastic attributes expressed in nominal average data of compared forms (groups) of Japanese carp koi (№I-IV) were on quite low level of variation (pic. 1.) : variability index did not exceed 10 %, approximately third part of indexes were on middle level of variation, variability index was in boundaries of 10 - 25 % and only one index (forehead height) was on high level of variation (more than 25 %). Trustworthiness of variances of Japanese carp koi different forms between sample group (№I) and every group from research colorful forms was mathematically approved  by indexes of Student’s criterion (tst), Mayr’s variability index (CD) and by coefficient of directed deviation (Кdv). Emerging from these estimation criteria of trustworthiness of variances between attributes of different carp koi forms it may be concluded that from 30 different attributes only 5 are approved at least by two coefficients (table). Large difference at once by 3 coefficients is approved between sample and group №IV according to “forehead height (ho) ” which estimates tst  = 9, 8 ≥ tcr = 2, 68; CD = 1, 46; Кdv = 32, 1 %, thus achieving the level of subspecies according to Mayr’s coefficient. But the indexes of this attribute are impossible to be adequately estimated because of difficulties in the process of its measuring, indexes of this attribute should better be considered among with other attributes. But there are attributes that point at trustworthy variance according to index of Student’s criterion (tst) and are approved by coefficient of directed deviation (Kdv). As you can see the basic level of deviations is concentrated on the attributes which were determined from head length (ho, mx, mn). These attributes may characterize the adjustment of carp koi to more active catching of food items, so as brighter colorful indexes scare them, especially when the water in water pond is highly limpid. It is also interesting to note the high density of fish planting (3000 exemplars per 0, 2 ha), it tells us about high level of contest between different colorful  koi forms for food organisms. Among other things, increased indexes of attributes like “tail-stem length” (pl) and “basis of anal fin length” (lA) in three the brightest groups may point at increase of reoration power in these fish. It is possible to make an assumption that increase of indexes of these attributes was not caused by other factors of water environment, except bright color of fish (it means that this attribute may characterize connection of colorful carp koi forms with difficulties at gaining food organisms. Author conducted morpho-metric study of basic forms of Japanese carp koi. Study showed the specificity of variational changes of plastic attributes of different forms of carp koi upon condition of keeping them in the same conditions. Author researched the variance between forms of carps koi, which is proved by indexes of Student coefficients, Mayr resolution and by directional deviation.
