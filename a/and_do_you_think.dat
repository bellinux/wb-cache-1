500|$|Critic {{and writer}} Kim Newman {{described}} Vampyrs style as {{closer to the}} experimental features such as Un chien andalou than a [...] "quickie horror film" [...] made {{after the release of}} Dracula (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film Vampyr in what he described as a [...] "heavy style" [...] but changed direction after cinematographer Maté showed him one shot that came out fuzzy and blurred. This washed out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Maté shoot the film through a piece of gauze held threefeet (.9m) away from the camera to re-create this look. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration from the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Gisèle, said that Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings of Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, Henry Hellsen wrote in detail about the film and the artworks it appeared to draw on. When being asked about the intention of the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he [...] "had not any particular intention. I just wanted to make a film different from all other films. I wanted, if you will, to break new ground for the cinema. That is all. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> this intention has succeeded? Yes, I have broken new ground". The filming of Vampyr was completed the middle of 1931.|$|E

[...] "To me, it means {{that all of us}} are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together." [...] In October 2015, on the late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel asked Bernie, [...] "You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you believe in God <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that's important {{to the people of the}} United States?"
