50|$|An {{increasing}} number of companies and authorities use third party services in which the whistleblower is anonymous also towards the third party service provider. This is possible via toll free phone numbers configured not to record the whistleblower origin call, and also through web solutions which apply <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>encryption.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Data in a {{database}} of e-commerce are very important. We must assure their security completely. Through the analysis {{on the process of}} users ’ registration and retrieving password, the security problems existing in databases of traditional e-commerce are explained. Then it points out {{that it is difficult to}} ensure the security of the e-commerce system by using a single encryption technology. On the basis the technologies of symmetrical encryption and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>encryption</b> are introduced. And then the hybrid encryption thoughts of combining the both are put forward. By using the method to improve the e-commerce processs, the security of databases of e-commerce is enhanced. Index Terms—e-commerce; database security; hybrid encryption; symmetric encryption; asymmetric encryption I...|$|E
40|$|Desktop {{application}} {{is one of}} the most popular types of application being used in computer due to the one time install simplicity and the quick accessibility from the moment the computer being turned on. Limitation of the copy and usage of desktop applications has long been an important issue to application providers. For security concerns, software copy protection is usually integrated with the application. However, developers seek to reuse the copy protection component of the software. This paper proposes an approach of reusable software copy protection which consists of a certificate validator on the client computer and a certificate generator on the server. The certificate validator integrity is protected using hashing result while all communications are encrypted using <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>encryption</b> to ensure the security of this approach. </p...|$|E
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} so called {{lightweight}} crptography which is specified for low-efficiency hardware. The {{first part of}} my thesis explains basic terms and principles of cryptography, difference between symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>encryption</b> including description of the most widespread examples of both of these cryptography's branches. The thesis continues with the description and parametric comparison of newly developed algorithms focusing on lightweight cryptography. I specially pay attention to current and block ciphers and hash functions. Afterwards the thesis describes limited computing power hardware. This is about device which is limited {{from the point of}} view of power supply and size of chips. The description is focused on smart cards, RFD chips and microcontrollers. The practical part deals with testing of current ciphers which are designed for software implementations and with testing of current ciphers designed for lightweight cryptography. Results of the tests provide comprehensive view of differences of output of individual ciphers specified for different implementations...|$|E
40|$|Entering {{into the}} era of {{advancement}} in Information Technology, publishing qualification certificate in electronic form going forward. E-Certificate helps eliminate many problems {{that is associated with}} physical printed certificate such costs, management, and forgery problem. Even though implementation of such E-Certificate have been implemented around the globe, it has not been implemented for workshops in UiTM. User who owes an E-Certificate is able to retrieve from a web page and can be printed out. In order to handle the integrity issue, each certificate must be digitally signed by a signatory, and equivalent to hand signature. Digital Signature was encrypted by RSA Algorithm, a very powerful <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>encryption.</b> The system consist of a central database and organized into web page application which can be accessed by system admin, certificate user, and employer. In order to maintain the integrity of the E-Certificate, employers are allowed to verify the certificate in a specially made webpage to authenticate it. Web page application was programmed by Java Enterprise Edition (J 2 EE). Signatory however use a special Digital Signature Application which store the secret private key. The application was programmed by JAVA FX. The system was developed stage by stage as it is consist of many small components to form a large system. Therefore tests can be conducted as you develop the system. From tests, it was observed that all functions perfectly, accurately, and swiftly, indicating the advantages of an E-Certificate system...|$|E
40|$|Communication between {{parties in}} an {{important}} process in their relationship can {{be based on a}} contract. This communication can for exemple be composed by a handwritten contract or an electronic contract. Contract law makes no difference between these two forms. to create more favourable requirements for commencing a contract or an ongoing contract there are possibilities to use standard agreements. Therefore a contract can be based on the will of the parties or on a standard agreement. An electronic signature shall secure that electronic transferred information has not been altered and also to identify the sender of the information. By way of encryption information in a document is guarded from unauthorized acess. Electronic signatures are produced by using encryption technology which is devided into two groups, symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>encryption.</b> It is possible to secure this encryption in a "smart card" which functions like a charge card. To verify a signature {{is just as important as}} using encryption to secure information. A third party can be engaged by both parties. A company or a public authority can be engaged as long as they have no interest in the intermediary information. Who this third party is can be confirmed in a certificate. This certificate can also consist of details about the sender confirming that it is the right party. Existing legislation is available since swedish contract law is applicable on electronic contracts and signatures. Two EC-directives concerning this area are also available for the parties to apply when using electronic contracts. Both directives are acknowledging electronic contracts and signatures the same legal effect as other forms of contracts, like handwritten and oral ones. Further they do not accept national laws that are making it difficult or that are forbidding the use of electronic communication...|$|E
