5|$|Shuey {{was honored}} as an All-American {{as a college}} {{baseball}} pitcher for the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team. The Indians selected Shuey with the second overall selection of the 1992 MLB draft. Envisioned as a comparable pitcher to Cincinnati Reds closer Rob Dibble, Shuey had more success as <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> reliever than closer.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>a</b> tri-rocker <b>setup</b> {{is to give}} the skater good speed and maneuverability, like on <b>a</b> flat <b>setup.</b> But because of the extra space, {{grinding}} is also a little easier than <b>a</b> flat <b>setup.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that having <b>a</b> flat <b>setup</b> is just one factor in <b>a</b> fast skate <b>setup.</b> <b>A</b> long frame, low {{resistance}} bearings, and good technique all contribute greatly to a skater's speed.|$|R

5|$|For 1996, the Angels {{replaced}} Smith in {{the closer}} role with second-year pitcher Troy Percival. After only eight games as <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, {{was traded to}} Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, {{who was in the}} midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in his return to the National League. His ERA was nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E
5|$|On March 12, 1984, LeDuc {{teamed with}} former kayfabe rival Jerry Lawler {{to win the}} AWA Southern Tag Team Championship from Elijah Akeem and Kareem Muhammad. In a six-man match the {{following}} week, LeDuc teamed with Lawler and Jimmy Hart, who was their manager but wrestled on occasion. During the match, LeDuc revealed that his reconciliation with Lawler was <b>a</b> <b>setup,</b> as LeDuc and Hart turned on Lawler by walking away to leave Lawler by himself. As a result, the tag team title was vacated and the feud was rekindled.|$|E
5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves {{on the walls of}} the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> to inject Langly with a drug that {{effectively}} controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her. He takes {{her back to the}} suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as anoetic histamine. She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Umbricht threw four pitches, a fastball, curveball, slider and the changeup. He {{was used}} {{primarily}} as <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> pitcher during his brief tenure with the Colts. According to former teammate and roommate Ken Johnson, Umbricht {{was used by}} the Colts mainly to control damage caused by starting pitchers after they were removed from games. In his five-year Major League Baseball career, Umbricht compiled a 9–5 win–loss record, with 133 strikeouts, three saves and a 3.06 earned run average in 88 games.|$|E
50|$|Some hockey skates {{and other}} skates include <b>a</b> HiLo <b>setup.</b> HiLo <b>setups</b> {{resemble}} <b>a</b> flat <b>setup</b> in that all 4 wheels touch {{the ground at}} the same time. Unlike <b>a</b> flat <b>setup,</b> however, different wheel sizes are used. The front two wheels will be smaller than the back two wheels. This is possible because of the location of the axles on the frame itself. One example is a Bauer frame that has two wheels in the front that are 76mm and two wheels in the back that are 80mm.|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes {{was one of the most}} highly {{anticipated}} prospects in baseball, but his major league career has thus far been marked by inconsistency. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short his outing, as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues, eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June; pitching as <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> man for Mariano Rivera, Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|The story mode {{is split}} into several chapters. As the {{narrative}} plays out, the player swaps between different characters. Minigames are also {{incorporated into the}} story. The outcome of minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional game features include Battle Mode, Versus Mode, Training Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer modes include King of the Hill, <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight, and Survivor, which carries over the current winner's health bar and character selection over each match. Playing through any of the game modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points {{that may be used}} to unlock alternate costumes, music, concept art, and other rewards.|$|E

25|$|Some {{particle}} accelerators {{have been used}} to make neutrino beams. The technique is to collide protons with a fixed target, producing charged pions or kaons. These unstable particles are then magnetically focused into a long tunnel where they decay while in flight. Because of the relativistic boost of the decaying particle, the neutrinos are produced as a beam rather than isotropically. Efforts to construct an accelerator facility where neutrinos are produced through muon decays are ongoing. Such <b>a</b> <b>setup</b> is generally known as a neutrino factory.|$|E
25|$|Many U.S. states allow {{volunteer}} fire, EMS and Search and Rescue {{personnel to}} place emergency warning lights {{in their personal}} vehicles for use when responding to emergencies.
