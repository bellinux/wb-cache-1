5|$|I can quite {{understand}} the Prince of Wales being much <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> his son's name being {{coupled with the}} thing {{but that was the}} case before I left it... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... they will end by having out in open court exactly what they are all trying to keep quiet. I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H.|$|E
5|$|The really curious part of {{this story}} is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> having made such fools of themselves that they {{walked out of the}} inn in different directions, and were never seen or heard of again.|$|E
25|$|Having {{two types}} of {{registers}} was mildly <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times, but not hard to use in practice. Reportedly, it allowed the CPU designers to achieve {{a higher degree of}} parallelism, by using an auxiliary execution unit for the address registers.|$|R
5000|$|The TV Guide {{reviewer}} {{commented that}} [...] "the film is brooding, slow, and <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times, but {{the vision of}} McEnery as Bartleby is not easily forgotten. Scofield...gives a supremely intelligent portrayal of a man caught between logic and emotion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Toye Trill of 9jaNinja {{gave the}} album a 4.8 out of 10, adding that [...] "there {{were so much}} reggae {{infusion}} into Ice' verses, that lyrically only few songs didn't have evidence of Ice Prince's inner rasta man, for a supposed rap album, it got <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> a point." ...|$|R
5|$|Feeling {{guilty about}} her {{deception}} and concerned for the Flanders' safety, Marge goes {{to check on}} them at their new house. There, she tells them {{the truth about the}} murders, but they are not annoyed. Ned and Maude are pleased {{to be a part of}} Springfield's history, and refuse Marge's offer of returning the deposit. Unfortunately, the house is destroyed seconds later when Li'l Bandit and Wiggum's police car crash through the house. Marge returns Flanders' down payment. Hutz, <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> the damage costs and especially by the return of the money, fires Marge. At the end of the episode, Homer takes Marge to the government unemployment office to collect a welfare check.|$|E
5|$|John {{then went}} to France, {{although}} Philip II was <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> being excluded from the decision of Isabella's marriage. Matilda I, Countess of Nevers, Erard II of Chacenay, Albert, Abbot of Vauluisant and other local potentates asked John to intervene in their conflicts, indicating that he was esteemed in his homeland. John attended the funeral of Philip II at the Basilica of St Denis in July; Philip bequeathed more than 150,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land. John then visited England, attempting to mediate a peace treaty between England and France after his return to France.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> the {{way that}} Royle, a Royal Navy officer, communicated {{directly}} with the Admiralty; he was also aware that Royle had been critical of SWPA's command arrangements, and {{of some of his}} decisions. MacArthur proposed that an Australian officer, Captain John Collins, replace Royle as CNS, an appointment that Carpender also supported. Over the Admiralty's objections, Curtin appointed Collins to replace Crutchley as Commander, Task Force 44, in June 1944, at the rank of commodore, with the intention that Collins would replace Royle when his term expired. This did not occur, because Collins was seriously wounded in Leyte Gulf on 21 October 1944.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, some reviewers {{noted that}} the focus on {{immersion}} sometimes goes too far (to {{the point that the}} game became <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times), and was sometimes killed by bad game-design choices and game glitches (some inconsistent textures and generic character models, magic map, instant spawning of enemies at check points, the diamond caches, the effects of malaria being overused, vehicles and firearms jamming).|$|R
2500|$|In a 2007 Oricon poll, Usopp {{was voted}} the 10th most wanted {{character}} {{to receive a}} spin-off among all respondents, and the 5th most popular among males. In a review of Funimation Entertainment's second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter notes that Usopp [...] "brings lots of comic relief to the series", but also comments that he [...] "can be downright <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times".|$|R
50|$|Mio Hagiwara is a 14-year-old {{actress who}} also enjoys being a regular teenager. One day, Mio meets Ichiya Kumagai, a 15-year-old boy who dreams of {{becoming}} a top director of films.

The story follows Mio and Ichiya becoming a couple and pursuing their dreams.|$|R
5|$|The {{group that}} would become the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 {{as the result of}} a {{practical}} joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey. Toohey, <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> The New York Times drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey's clients (Eugene O'Neill) in his column, organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I, where he had been a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Instead Toohey used the occasion to poke fun at Woollcott on a number of fronts. Woollcott's enjoyment of the joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey to suggest that the group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.|$|E

5|$|Gellibrand was {{disappointed}} at not being appointed AA & QMG, but Bridges was unimpressed with Gellibrand's staff work. He felt that Gellibrand had mishandled the move of the 2nd Infantry Brigade to Cape Helles, where it {{participated in the}} First Battle of Krithia. He also expected Gellibrand to organise a proper officers' mess at Gallipoli and was <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> the poor quality of what Gellibrand had scrounged from ships' canteen supplies. Gellibrand might have even been dismissed by Bridges but fate intervened. On 1 May Gellibrand {{was wounded in the}} ankle by shrapnel. Then, on 11 May, while laughing at two men whose water bottles had been holed, he received a severe wound in his right shoulder and was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon. While it was still anchored off Anzac Cove, Bridges was wounded on 15 May and brought on board the same ship (and to the same bed, Gellibrand was moved out of the way), where Bridges died on 18 May 1915.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Hergé became {{increasingly}} <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> {{the success of}} René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Asterix comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing The Adventures of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate {{the success of the}} recent animated films Asterix the Gaul (1967) and Asterix and Cleopatra (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the Adventures of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of The Adventures of Tintin, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Clemens (Charles Dance) is Fury 161's doctor. When Ripley {{crashes into}} the oil sea, he nurses {{her back to}} health and shows her around. Clemens {{performs}} an autopsy on Newt at Ripley's request, although he is <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> not being told why. To gain Ripley's trust, Clemens admits that he got drunk after a long shift as a resident and accidentally killed eleven men being treated after a boiler explosion by misprescribing a painkiller. Sentenced to Fiorina 161, he served his time but remained behind with the other inmates when they refused to leave. Ripley still does not reveal {{the true nature of}} the events taking place; as Clemens injects her with a serum, the Alien kills him and drags his body away.|$|E
2500|$|Noise: Because {{the major}} source of noise of a maglev train comes from {{displaced}} air rather than from wheels touching rails, maglev trains produce less noise than a conventional train at equivalent speeds. However, the psychoacoustic profile of the maglev may reduce this benefit: a study concluded that maglev noise should be rated like road traffic, while conventional trains experience a 5–10 dB [...] "bonus", as they are found less <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> the same loudness level.|$|R
5000|$|Hector Flanagan (voiced by Matt Jones) is Sanjay and Craig's weird eye patch-wearing friend. He can <b>annoy</b> them <b>at</b> {{times and}} has a crush on Megan.|$|R
50|$|Hikari is Kenji and Suzuka's older cousin. She {{is short}} and has a long, golden hair done in twin tails. She is {{somewhat}} quick-tempered and is a tomboy. Hikari may be <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times but she really cares for her cousins and Nanami, {{and is willing to}} help them when they're in trouble. Hatano, Kenji's friend and classmate, is crazy about Hikari and pesters her when she visits her cousins during summer. She secretly likes Hatano but is too stubborn to admit it. She loves spicy food.|$|R
5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. He talks about how the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> three stagehands called David.|$|E
5|$|Quinn and Finn go {{together}} for her ultrasound appointment, and {{they learn that}} she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to be supportive, suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own baby on the ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her. Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will be kicked of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election. Afterward, with the financial aid of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.|$|E
50|$|Marina - A Brightwing bat {{slightly}} older than Shade. Marina, although <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times, is devoutly loyal to Shade, abandoning Scirocco to follow him. She is also level-headed, being suspicious of Goth and Throbb {{even before they}} revealed their true colors. Unlike Shade, she is not easily enraptured and impressed at Goth's size, which leads Goth to identify her as the main threat at first. But Marina is convinced that Shade has betrayed her when Shade appeases Goth, and rushes her decisions a lot.|$|R
50|$|Rebecca 'Becca' Louise Chadwick Referred as a 'queen bee' in {{the first}} two books, Becca later becomes a member of the Book club. Initially, she is unhappy about it, but soon adjusts and becomes friends with the girls, who also accept Becca. Her best friend in the group is Megan. She is crazy about clothes, {{shopping}} and boys, and finds her brother Stewart quiet <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times. She had blonde hair and light blue eyes. She liked Zach Norton, but in Wish You Were Eyre, she finds a boy for herself named Theodore.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Wanna See You" [...] is a pop rock {{song about}} the author missing the person they like, talks about how the person laughs at the funny things she says and admits she still likes him despite him being a little <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times. Abe wrote the song in her third year of high school, about a boy {{who lived in a}} {{different}} prefecture to her that she visited by bus. After writing the song, when she told the boy how she felt, his answer was, [...] "But...I have a job." ...|$|R
5|$|On {{returning}} to London, Murray took {{an active role}} in the feminist movement, volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations, protests, and marches. Joining the Women's Social and Political Union, she was present at large marches like the Mud March of 1907 and the Women's Coronation Procession of June 1911. She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia. Murray also pushed the professional boundaries for women throughout her own career, and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia. As women could not use the men's common room, she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women, and later ensured that a larger, better-equipped room was converted for the purpose; it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room. At UCL, she became a friend of fellow female lecturer Winifred Smith, and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university, with Murray becoming particularly <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands. Feeling that students should get nutritious yet affordable lunches, for many years she sat on the UCL Refectory Committee.|$|E
25|$|Barnet Burns {{moved to}} France in late 1836. An {{unsuccessful}} {{appearance before the}} Académie des sciences at the Institut de France in Paris resulted in the academicians being <b>annoyed</b> <b>at</b> being deceived by Burns, who had apparently claimed to be King of Zealand.|$|E
25|$|<b>Annoyed</b> <b>at</b> what he {{considered}} unfair treatment by club management towards him compared to interstate recruits, Pratt first sought to leave South Melbourne for another club in June 1936, stating that he was unemployed and believed another club could find him employment. Pratt relented when local politician Robert Williams MLC found him {{a job in a}} brewery.|$|E
2500|$|... "Some {{years ago}} when Jack was at his station he {{received}} word that his trustee, {{who was in charge}} of his property, had levanted it all. Whereupon poor Jack put a pistol to his head and blew out what brains he possessed. He was a beautiful creature, terribly <b>annoying</b> <b>at</b> times, but with something childlike and appealing--I think he was close to what the Scotch call a natural--that made one forgive pranks in him that which would be unforgivable in others. He was very proud of being the original ‘Tommy Hadden’ in [...] ‘The Wrecker,’ and carried the book wherever he went." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} the Lenslok to work {{correctly}} the displayed image {{has to be the}} correct size. This meant that before each use the software needed to be calibrated to take account {{of the size of the}} display. Users found this setup particularly <b>annoying,</b> <b>at</b> least in part because they found the instructions that were initially shipped unclear. Additionally, the device could not be calibrated at all for very large and very small televisions, and some games shipped with mismatched Lensloks that prevented the code from being correctly descrambled. The Lenslok system was not used in later releases of Elite.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time the station was {{affected}} by town planning. With increased road traffic following the construction of the Odenwald Railway in 1862, the level crossing of Rohrbacher Straße in the modern Adenauerplatz, in particular, proved to be <b>annoying.</b> <b>At</b> the end of 1949, 10,800 vehicles passed through the crossing, which was closed to road traffic for three to four hours each day. A pedestrian underpass was opened there in 1893. Passengers on the Heidelberg tramway had to pass through the crossing on foot as the tram lines ended {{on both sides of the}} level crossing.|$|R
