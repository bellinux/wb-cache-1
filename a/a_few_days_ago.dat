Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too {{difficult}} to take. Hal finds it hard to believe that, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago,</b> the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E

Stan forces Shirley, who he has been estranged from him the longest, to accept the money, and their angst is {{revealed}} to have started when Stan's drinking meant a young Mick and Tina went into care. Stan gives Shirley Deano's (Matt Di Angelo) mobile number, saying that he is now going by the name of Dean. A few weeks later, Shirley learns from her aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) that Dean has been staying with Stan. Shirley visits him, expecting to see Dean but Stan tells her that Dean went away <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago.</b> A few weeks later, Mick receives news that Stan has been involved in an accident and broken his ankle. He visits him in hospital and Tina brings him to the pub, where they agree to stick it out for three weeks. After Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) forbids Stan to smoke in the house, he secretly smokes out of the window whilst the family is out, accidentally causing a small fire when the cigarette is not stubbed out properly. He is rescued by his great-grandson Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) who {{the rest of the family}} believed was still serving in Afghanistan. It is revealed Lee has been staying with Stan for a week. After Mick believes Stan has been wetting the bed, a furious Stan demands to be taken back home. Whilst there, he is visited by Dean, who is in trouble with the law for handling stolen goods. When the police arrive, Stan takes the blame and is arrested. Mick later collects him and returns him to Walford.|$|E

It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to a girl, who was christened Leopoldina. The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother, the Empress Amélia, dated 11 July 1847, telling her of Afonso's death: [...] "With the most piercing grief I tell you that my little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month; and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me." ...|$|E

There has never surely, since the world began, been any suddenness so big, so instantly mobilised, any more than there has been an equal enormity so sudden (if, after all, that can be called sudden, or more than comparatively so, which, it is now clearly visible, had been brewing in the councils of the two awful Kaisers from a good while back.)

That is the one light, as one may call it, in so much sickening blackness--that in an hour, here, all breaches instantly healed, all divisions dropped, the Irish dissension, on which Germany had so clearly counted, dried up in a night--so that there is at once the most striking and interesting spectacle of united purpose. For myself, I draw a long breath that we are not to have failed France or shirked any shadow of a single one of the implications of the Entente; for the reason that we go in only under the last compulsion, and with cleaner hands than we have ever had, I think, in any such matter since such matters were.

And, with two out, {{you talk about a}} roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse {{trying to get rid of}} a troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago,</b> that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell.

[...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective.

6000|$|MY DEAR HARRY,--It really {{seems more}} than an age since I saw you. [...] Your last epistle, written in the {{perturbation}} of mind consequent upon [...] being doomed to spend another winter at York Fort, reached me only <b>a</b> [...] <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago,</b> and filled me with pleasant recollections of other days. [...] Oh! man, how much I wish that you were with me in this beautiful [...] country! You are aware that I have been what they call [...] "roughing it" [...] since you and I parted {{on the shores of}} Lake Winnipeg; but, my dear [...] fellow, the idea that most people have of what that phrase means is a [...] very erroneous one indeed. [...] "Roughing it" [...] I certainly have been, [...] inasmuch as I have been living on rough fare, associating with rough [...] men, and sleeping on rough beds under the starry sky; but I assure you [...] that all this is not half so rough upon the constitution as what they [...] call leading an easy life, which is simply a life that makes a poor [...] fellow stagnate, body and spirit, till the one comes to be unable to [...] digest its food, and the other incompetent to jump at so much as half [...] an idea. Anything but an easy life, to my mind. Ah! there's nothing [...] like roughing it, Harry, my boy. Why, I am thriving on it--growing [...] like a young walrus, eating like a Canadian voyageur, and sleeping [...] like a top! This is a splendid country for sport, and as our [...] bourgeois [the gentleman in charge of an establishment is always [...] designated the bourgeois] has taken it into his head that I am a good [...] hand at making friends with the Indians, he has sent me out on several [...] expeditions, and afforded me some famous opportunities of seeing life [...] among the redskins. There is a talk just now of establishing a new [...] outpost in this district, so if I succeed in persuading the governor [...] to let me accompany the party, I shall have something interesting to [...] write about in my next letter. By the way, I wrote to you a month [...] ago, by two Indians who {{said they were going to}} the missionary station [...] at Norway House. Did you ever get it? There is a hunter here just [...] now who goes by the name of Jacques Caradoc. He is a first-rater--can [...] do anything, in a wild way, that lies within the power of mortal man, [...] and is an inexhaustible anecdote-teller, in a quiet way. He and I [...] have been out buffalo-hunting two or three times, and it would have [...] done your heart good, Harry, my dear boy, to have seen us scouring [...] over the prairie together on two big-boned Indian horses--regular [...] trained buffalo-runners, that didn't need the spur to urge, nor the [...] rein to guide them, when once they caught sight of the black cattle, [...] and kept a sharp look-out for badger-holes, just as if they had been [...] reasonable creatures. The first time I went out I had several rather [...] ugly falls, owing to my inexperience. The fact is, that if a man has [...] never run buffaloes before, he's sure to get one or two upsets, no [...] matter how good a horseman he may be. And that monster Jacques, [...] although he's the best fellow I ever met with for a hunting companion, [...] always took occasion to grin at my mishaps, and gravely to read me a [...] lecture to the effect that they were all owing to my own clumsiness or [...] stupidity; which, you will acknowledge, was not calculated to restore [...] my equanimity.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{being the}} {{feelings}} of the royal family, it may well be supposed with what delight, and with what honours Nelson would be welcomed. Early on the 22nd of September the poor wretched VANGUARD, as he called his shattered vessel, appeared in sight of Naples. The CULLODEN and ALEXANDER had preceded her by some days, and given notice of her approach. Many hundred boats and barges were ready to go forth and meet him, with music and streamers and every demonstration of joy and triumph. Sir William and Lady Hamilton led the way in their state barge. They had seen Nelson only for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> four years <b>ago,</b> but they then perceived in him that heroic spirit which was now so fully and gloriously manifested to the world. Emma Lady Hamilton, who from this time so greatly influenced his future life, was a woman whose personal accomplishments have seldom been equalled, and whose powers of mind were not less fascinating than her person. She was passionately attached to the queen; and by her influence the British fleet had obtained those supplies at Syracuse, without which, Nelson always asserted, the battle of Aboukir could not have been fought. During the long interval which passed before any tidings were received, her anxiety had been hardly less than that of Nelson himself, while pursuing an enemy of whom he could obtain no information; and when the tidings were brought her by a joyful bearer, open-mouthed, its effect was such that she fell like one who had been shot. She and Sir William had literally been made ill by their hopes and fears, and joy at a catastrophe so far exceeding all that they had dared to hope for. Their admiration for the hero necessarily produced a degree of proportionate gratitude and affection; and when their barge came alongside the VANGUARD, at the sight of Nelson, Lady Hamilton sprang up the ship's side, and exclaiming, [...] "O God! is it possible!" [...] fell into his arms more, he says, like one dead than alive. He described the meeting as [...] "terribly affecting." [...] These friends had scarcely recovered from their tears, when the king, who went out to meet him three leagues in the royal barge, came on board and took him by the hand, calling him his deliverer and preserver. From all the boats around he was saluted with the same appellations: the multitude who surrounded him when he landed repeated the same enthusiastic cries; and the lazzaroni displayed their joy by holding up birds in cages, and giving them their liberty as he passed.|$|R
