5|$|Pall Mall {{is part of}} <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> squares on the British Monopoly board game, {{alongside}} Whitehall and Northumberland Avenue. All three streets converge at Trafalgar Square. Rising house prices across London mean a small flat on Pall Mall, {{which is}} in the lowest-priced third of properties on the board, now sells for over £1million.|$|E

5|$|Regent Street is a {{location}} on the British version of Monopoly as <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> green squares with Oxford Street and Bond Street. The three properties are grouped together as they are all known for their retail and commercial backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|The other {{buildings}} are <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> brick three-story rowhouses called York Row. Built in 1807 in the Federal style, {{they are an}} early example of speculative housing development. York Row was built {{at a time when}} Philadelphia's population was shifting westward, away from the Delaware River.|$|E
5|$|Among the runestones of the Viking Age, 9.1–10% {{report that}} they were raised in memory of people who went abroad, and the runestones that mention Greece {{constitute}} {{the largest group of}} them. In addition, there is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> or four runestones that commemorate men who died in southern Italy, and who were probably members of the Varangian Guard. The only group of stones comparable in number to the Greece runestones are those that mention England, followed by the c. 26 Ingvar runestones raised {{in the wake of the}} fateful Ingvar expedition to Persia.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> {{unrelated}} {{teenagers in}} Wake Forest, NC, {{have been diagnosed}} with Ewing's sarcoma.

5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down to <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the Japanese {{astronomer}} Kiyotsugu Hirayama {{began to}} study asteroid motions. By plotting the mean orbital motion, inclination and eccentricity {{of a set of}} asteroids, he discovered several distinct groupings. In a later paper he reported <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> asteroids associated with Pallas, which became named the Pallas family, after the largest member of the group. Since 1994 more than 10 members of this family have been identified, and these have semi-major axes between 2.50–2.82AU and inclinations of 33–38°. The validity of this grouping was confirmed in 2002 by a comparison of their spectra.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy VII, {{the player}} directs the protagonist {{throughout}} the game world with <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> interchangeable party members, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters.

Players can save their game at any time when not in combat to the game's single save slot for later playing.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the term}} octad (or octade) {{was used to}} {{specifically}} denote 8 bits as well at least in Western Europe; however, this usage is no longer common today. The exact origin of this term is unclear, {{but it can be}} found in British, Dutch and German sources of the 1960s and 1970s, and throughout the documentation of Philips mainframe computers. Similar terms exist in common English such as triad for <b>a</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> and decade for ten.|$|R

5|$|Shingouz {{have a high}} alcohol {{tolerance}} and preference for strong alcoholic beverages, which they consume in large quantities. The Shingouz society is capitalist to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They are especially adept in trading important and sensitive information to interested parties. Valérian and Laureline have struck up a relationship with <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> Shingouz who have a particularly useful network of contacts in all the major space communities. They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.|$|E

It is divided into three sections, {{labelled}} Structures 4a, 4b and 4c. The central Structure 4b is built upon a substructure dating to the Preclassic period. Together with Structure 6 on the opposite side of the plaza, these buildings form an E-Group that may have been used to determine the solstices and the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|The Great Circle was {{surrounded}} by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E

The ships, , and were built as the {{culmination}} of a major naval expansion program begun in the 1870s following Italy's defeat at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. The Re Umbertos incorporated several innovations over previous Italian designs, including a more efficient arrangement of the main battery, installation of wireless telegraphs, and in Sardegna, the first use of triple-expansion steam engines in an Italian capital ship. Designed by Benedetto Brin, they retained the very thin armor protection and high top speeds of his earlier designs.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set on}} the Wumpa Islands, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> fictional Australian islands {{owned by}} Doctor Neo Cortex. Levels are {{typically}} set in tribesmen's villages, fortresses or beaches. Some levels on the second island also take place in temple ruins, bridges high above the mountains, and a volcanic mine. Levels on the third island feature much more industrial settings, including a large power plant and a castle. The tropical setting of the game was inspired by Donkey Kong Country.|$|E
5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> additional allies into battle, controlling their actions {{to attack a}} single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set {{to one of three}} modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E

The other two orange properties, Bow Street and Marlborough Street, which are both valued at £180, are named after the Bow Street Runners and Marlborough Street Magistrates Court respectively. Since the Man in the Moon is now closed, students on a Monopoly board pub crawl drink {{in one of the}} nearby pubs, such as those on Swallow Street, instead.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the Government {{felt that}} the best way to ensure {{minority}} representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, as it would be economical for a town council to manage <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> constituencies. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had grown too big for the MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Tucana on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Rho in 1756, but omitted Omicron and Xi, and labelled a pair {{of stars}} close together Lambda Tucanae, and <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> stars Beta Tucanae. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Tucanae—this had not been given a designation by Lacaille who had recognized it as nebulous, {{and it is now}} known as the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Mu Tucanae was dropped by Francis Baily, who felt the star was too faint to warrant a designation, and Kappa's two components {{came to be known as}} Kappa1 and Kappa2.|$|E
