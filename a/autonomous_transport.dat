30|$|In fact, the {{contemporary}} goal of most transport policy plans to shift {{people out of}} their cars into walking, cycling and public transport still applies. But the potential for this shift is much larger with the AV. Even if the focus is currently on the autonomous car, the <b>autonomous</b> public <b>transport</b> [101] offers much more potential and AVs could prove to be the key success factor for a transport system that relies on public transport. Gains can even be extended if such <b>autonomous</b> public <b>transport</b> is integrated with higher levels of walking and cycling especially for the last mile travel [86]. The AV technology in a way does not make a big difference for transport policy, {{but at the same time}} it can make it much easier or harder to achieve the transport policy goals we set. Since the AV is imminent, the choice will have to be made and the sooner we make an informed and realistic decision on the role of the AV in the future mobility and transport system, the better. Otherwise we will find ourselves on the road we so hard try to get off from today.|$|R
30|$|Certain {{developed}} countries {{have experienced the}} ‘peak car’ phenomenon. While this remains to be confirmed longitudinally, it looks certain that future mobility in Europe and elsewhere will be shaped by a particular technological development: driverless or <b>autonomous</b> <b>transport.</b> The ‘autonomous car’ ignites the imagination, yet the research and debate on this topic largely focus on the ‘autonomous’ and not adequately on the ‘car’ element. Like any new technological development, <b>autonomous</b> <b>transport</b> presents ample opportunities to better our mobility system, but similarly it carries risks and can lead into a future mobility that exacerbates, rather than relieves, current deficiencies of our mobility systems, including its high carbon and high cost characteristics. Now {{it is high time}} to explore these, before we lock ourselves into the autonomous car future. Using Low Carbon Mobility (LCM) as a guiding framework to assess mobility patterns and based on an extensive literature review, this paper aims to explore where there is a gap between the likely and desirable outcomes when developing the autonomous car and suggest how we might reduce it. Moreover, enhancing on global empirical evidence and forecasts about the opportunities and threats emerging from ICT deployment in transport and initial evidence {{on the development of the}} autonomous car, the paper concludes that a desirable outcome will only come if technological development will be accompanied by a social change. A change where public and sharing will be seen as superior to private and individual transport, could make the autonomous car a blessing.|$|E
