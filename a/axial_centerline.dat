2500|$|Much of the {{reduction}} of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program. This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to [...] "fly out" [...] any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the <b>axial</b> <b>centerline</b> that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight. This is accomplished by a series of ejectable ballast masses consisting of two [...] tungsten weights that were jettisoned minutes before atmospheric entry. The lift vector was controlled by four sets of two reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that produced approximately [...] of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allowed the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone. Prior to parachute deployment the entry vehicle ejected more ballast mass consisting of six [...] tungsten weights such that the center of gravity offset was removed.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} a flow convergence (FC), <b>axial</b> <b>centerline</b> velocity/distance profile method {{as applied to}} chronic aortic regurgitation (AR), we compared FC results to AR flow rates and volumes simultaneously determined by aortic and pulmonary electromagnetic flow probes and meters (EM) balanced against each other. In 6 sheep, a total of 21 hemodynamic states were obtained 20 weeks after the original surgery to produce AR. Echo studies were performed to obtain complete axial FC velocity/distance profiles from apex views. The color Doppler velocity data were directly transferred in digital format from the ultrasound instrumentation to a microcomputer. AR was classified as grade I when the peak AR flow rate was 6. 0 l/min (9 conditions). All of the velocity/distance acceleration curves toward the AR orifice showed organized acceleration fields with highly significant correlations using multiplicative regression fits (y=ax–b; r= 0. 94 – 0. 99; all p 0. 6 m/sec at distances from the orifices > 0. 75 cm; the profiles for grade I regurgitation resided in a domain encompassed by velocities < 0. 45 m/sec at distances from the orifices, < 0. 5 cm. The profiles for grade II regurgitation resided in a domain between these. In addition, an equation for correlating both ‘a’ and ‘b’ (coefficients) with the peak AR flow rates (Q l/min) was derived from multiple regression analysis (Q= 16 a+ 1. 5 b – 1. 5, r= 0. 95, P< 0. 001, SEE= 0. 55 l/min).

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} two-dimensional, axisymmetric, laminar hydrogen-air flames in which a cylindrical fuel stream is surrounded by coflowing air, using laser-diagnostic and computational methods. Spontaneous Raman scattering and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) are {{used to measure the}} distributions of major species and temperature. Computationally, we solve the governing conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and species, using detailed chemistry and transport. The fuel is diluted with nitrogen (1 : 1) to reduce heat transfer to the burner, to match the zero temperature gradient at the fuel exit. Three average fuel exit velocities are studied: 18, 27, and 50 cm/s. Comparisons of the measured and computed results are performed for radial profiles at a number of axial positions, and along the <b>axial</b> <b>centerline.</b> Peak major species mole fractions and temperatures are quantitatively predicted by the computations, and the axial species profiles are predicted to within the experimental uncertainty. In the radial profiles studied, base-case computations excluding thermal diffusion of light species were in excellent agreement with the measurements. While the addition of thermal diffusion led to some discrepancy with the measured results, the magnitude of the differences was no more than 25 %. The computations predicted the <b>axial</b> <b>centerline</b> profiles from the burner exit to the maximum temperature well, though the experimental temperatures in the downstream mixing region decreased somewhat faster than the computed profiles. Radiative losses are seen to be negligible in these flames, and changes in transport properties and variations in initial flow velocities generally led to only modest changes in the axial profiles. The results also show that the detailed axial profiles of major species and temperature at different fuel jet velocities scale quantitatively with the jet velocity. (c) 2004 The Combustion Institute.

40|$|A {{turbulent}} swirling flow in {{a circular}} pipe is studied {{with the aid of}} a variational method. The turbulent-energy production effect, which is linked with spatial velocity gradients, expresses the energy cascade from mean to turbulent components of motion and is a cause of the loss of distinct mean-flow structures. In the turbulent-energy equation, weakening of the production effect tends to enhance the diffusion effect of turbulent energy, which is also harmful to the sustainment of such structures. An optimum state in which these two effects are reconciled with each other is sought with resort to a variational approach combined with helicity. The resulting state is expressed by the mean vorticity proportional to its curl. On this basis, the <b>centerline</b> <b>axial</b> vorticity is shown to play a central role in the occurrence of axial-velocity retardation or reversal in a turbulent swirling pipe flow. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{validate}} a digital color Doppler-based centerline velocity/distance acceleration profile method for evaluating the severity of aortic regurgitation. Background. Clinical and in vivo experimental applications of the flow convergence <b>axial</b> <b>centerline</b> velocity/distance profile method have recently been used to estimate regurgitant flow rates and regurgitant volumes in the presence of mitral regurgitation. Methods. In six sheep, a total of 19 hemodynamic states were obtained pharmacologically 14 weeks after the original operation in which a portion of the aortic noncoronary (n = 3) or right coronary (n = 3) leaflet was excised to produce aortic regurgitation. Echocardiographic studies were performed to obtain complete proximal axial flow acceleration velocity/distance profiles during the time of peak regurgitant flow (usually early in diastole) for each hemodynamic state. For each steady state, the severity of aortic regurgitation was assessed by measurement of the magnitude of the regurgitant flow volume/beat, regurgitant fraction and instantaneous regurgitant flow rates determined by using both aortic and pulmonary artery electromagnetic flow probes. Results. Grade I regurgitation (regurgitant volume/beat 30 ml, eight conditions) were clearly separated by using the color Doppler centerline velocity/distance profile domain technique. Additionally, an equation for correlating “a” (the coefficient from the multiplicative curve fit for the velocity/distance relation) with the peak regurgitant flow rates (Q [liters/min]) was derived showing a high correlation between calculated peak flow rates by the color Doppler method and the actual peak flow rates (Q = 13 a + 1. 0, r = 0. 95, p < 0. 0001, SEE = 0. 76 liters/min).

40|$|This report {{describes}} an experimental and numerical study of impinging, incompressible, axisymmetric, laminar jets, where the jet {{axis of symmetry}} is aligned normal to the wall. Particle Streak Velocimetry (PSV) is used to measure axial velocities along the centerline of the flow field. The jet-nozzle pressure drop is measured simultaneously and determines the Bernoulli velocity.

The axisymmetric viscous and potential-flow simulations include the nozzle in the solution domain, allowing nozzle-wall proximity e#ects to be investigated. Scaling the <b>centerline</b> <b>axial</b> velocity by the Bernoulli velocity collapses the experimental velocity profiles onto a single curve that is independent of the nozzle-plate separation distance.

It has been suggested that the influence of the Reynolds number may be somewhat different for a jet subjected to pulsation when compared to an equivalent steady jet. A comparative study of both steady and pulsating jets is presented for a Reynolds number range from Re= 4, 730 Re= 4, 730 to Re= 10, 000 Re= 10, 000.

40|$|A rectangular, variable-stiffness {{panel with}} tow {{overlaps}} was manufactured using an advanced tow placement machine. The cured panel had large anticlastic imperfections, with measured amplitudes of over two times the average panel thickness. These imperfections were {{not due to}} the overall steered-fiber layup or the tow overlaps, but instead resulted from local asymmetries in the laminate that were caused by a manufacturing oversight. In the nominal panel layup, fiber angles vary linearly from 60 degrees on the panel <b>axial</b> <b>centerline</b> to 30 degrees on the parallel edges. A geometrically nonlinear analysis was performed with a - 280 degree Fahrenheit thermal load to simulate the postcure cooldown to room temperature. The predicted geometric imperfections correlated well with the measured panel shape. Unique structural test fixtures were then developed which greatly reduced these imperfections, but they also caused prestresses in the panel. Surface imperfections measured after the panel was installed in the test fixtures were used with nonlinear finite element analyses to predict these fixturing-induced prestresses.

CND solutions are found for the most general paths relative to these sources and briefly explored. It is determined that the maximum CND from a distant location through directed effusion and sonic orifice cases occurs along the path parallel to the source plane that intersects the plume axis. For the effusive case this value is exactly twice the CND found along the ray originating from that point of intersection and extending to infinity along the plume's axis.

40|$|A model reactor {{is used to}} {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} the overall performance and detailed flowfield structure of a non-premixed swirl-stabilized distributed reaction are sensitive to modest changes in inlet conditions (e. g., fuel injection angle, inlet geometry, and swirl vane solidity). Measurements of combustor performance are based on exhaust plane species concentration profiles (HC, CO 2, CO, O 2), combustion efficiency, and visual observation of combustor stability. The detailed flowfield structure is established by spatially mapping the axial and azimuthal velocity fields using two-component laser anemometry, and the temperature field using a thermocouple probe. The results show that relatively modest changes in inlet conditions can dramatically affect the flowfield structure. As an example, for the model reactor evaluated the addition of a small step at the outer boundary of the swirler yields significantly lower <b>centerline</b> <b>axial</b> velocities and a more uniform thermal structure in the recirculation zone. Furthermore, a modest reduction in swirl vane solidity transforms the aerodynamic structure of the recirculation zone from an off-axis to a central, on-axis structure. These results explain, in part, the contradictory conclusions drawn from data acquired in non-premixed swirl-stabilized distributed reactions, and establish that comparisons and generalizations of such flows require, at a minimum, (1) careful measurements and specification of the inlet conditions, (2) detailed measurements of the flow structure, and (3) an assessment of the effects of modest changes in key operating and configurational variables. © 1988 Combustion Institute...|$|R

The NO{sub x} data show a local minimum at a swirl number of 1. 0 which may be primarily the result of the direction and magnitude of the recirculation zone. Gas species and coal char burnout data have begun but have not yet been completed. Velocity data and modeling results have been used in the process of validating the comprehensive combustion code and in designing the reburning hardware. The details concerning storing and delivering the reburning fuel (natural gas) have been completed and the fabrication of the hardware is underway...|$|E
40|$|CARS is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} and quantifiable nonlinear process in which two intersecting beams of frequency w,, w,, interact in a nonlinear medium to produce a coherent CARS signal at frequency w, = 2 w,- w,. Enhancement of the signal is obtained when w,- w 2 {{is close to the}} frequency of the Raman resonance in the species of interest. The nonlinear susceptibility giving rise to w, is density and temperature dependent, providing the basis for diagnostics. The output {{is in the form of}} a coherent beam that can be propagated away from the test site for analysis. In this way, detection equipment can be decoupled and shielded from all stray light generated (Figure 5). Jet engines analyzed The most publicized use of CARS was to analyze a jet engine exhaust manufactured by Pratt and Whitney. The CARS system consisted of a dual laser-beam transmitter and a detection system mounted on an outdoor test stand near the engine, and operated remotely while the jet engine was running. The stand permitted translation in the X-Y plane in order to map the exhaust in a plane normal to the <b>axial</b> <b>centerline.</b> All receiver and transmitter components were mounted in acoustic isolation boxes surrounded by a thermoshield. Concentrations of H,O, CO and 0,. as well as the temperature of the engine were characterized with the engine at idle, full power and full powe...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study of impinging, incompressible, axisymmetric, laminar jets is described, where the jet {{axis of symmetry}} is aligned normal to the wall. Particle streak velocimetry (PSV) is used to measure axial velocities along the centerline of the flow field. The jet-nozzle pressure drop is measured simultaneously and determines the Bernoulli velocity. The flow field is simulated numerically by an axisymmetric Navier-Stokes spectral-element code, an axisymmetric potential-flow model, and an axisymmetric one-dimensional stream-function approximation. The axisymmetric viscous and potential-flow simulations include the nozzle in the solution domain, allowing nozzle-wall proximity effects to be investigated. Scaling the <b>centerline</b> <b>axial</b> velocity by the Bernoulli velocity collapses the experimental velocity profiles onto a single curve that is independent of the nozzle-to-plate separation distance. Axisymmetric direct numerical simulations yield good agreement with experiment and confirm the velocity profile scaling. Potential-flow simulations reproduce {{the collapse of the}} data; however, viscous effects result in disagreement with experiment. Axisymmetric one-dimensional stream-function simulations can predict the flow in the stagnation region if the boundary conditions are correctly specified. The scaled axial velocity profiles are well characterized by an error function with one Reynolds-number-dependent parameter. Rescaling the wall-normal distance by the boundary-layer displacement-thickness-corrected diameter yields a collapse of the data onto a single curve that is independent of the Reynolds number. These scalings allow the specification of an analytical expression for the velocity profile of an impinging laminar jet over the Reynolds number range investigated of 200 <=Re<= 1400...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe study {{aimed to}} test whether {{reliability}} and inter-observer variability of preoperative measurements for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) among non-experts are improved by semiautomatic centerline analysis compared with manual assessment. MethodsPreoperative computed tomography (CT) angiographies of 30 patients with thoracic aortic disease (mean age 66. 8  ±  11. 6 years, 23 men) were retrospectively analysed in randomised order by one blinded vascular expert (reference standard) and three blinded non-expert readers. Aortic diameters were measured at four positions relevant to TEVAR using three measurement techniques (manual axial slices, manual multiplanar reformations (MPRs) and semiautomatic centerline analysis). Length measurements were performed using centerline analysis. Reliability was calculated as absolute measurement deviation (AMD) from reference standard and inter-observer variability as coefficient of variance (CV) among non-expert readers. ResultsFor <b>axial,</b> MPR and <b>centerline</b> techniques, mean AMD was 7. 3  ±  7. 7 %, 6. 7  ±  4. 5 % and 4. 7  ±  4. 8 % and mean CV was 5. 2  ±  4. 2 %, 5. 8  ±  4. 8 % and 3. 9  ±  5. 4 %. Both AMD and CV were significantly lower for centerline analysis compared with axial technique (p =  0. 001 / 0. 042) and MPR (p =  0. 009 / 0. 003). AMD and CV for length measurements by centerline analysis were 3. 2  ±  2. 8 % and 2. 6  ±  2. 4 %, respectively. Centerline analysis was significantly faster than MPR (p <  0. 001). ConclusionsSemiautomatic centerline analysis provides the most reliable and least variable diameter and length measurements among non-experts in candidates for TEVAR...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study for {{transient temperature response}} and pressure drop in a randomly packed bed at high Reynolds numbers is presented. The packed bed {{is used as a}} compact heat exchanger along with a solid-propellant gas generator, to generate room-temperature gases for use in control actuation, air bottle pressurization, etc. Packed beds of lengths 200 and 300 mm were characterized for packing-sphere-based Reynolds numbers ranging from 0. 8 x 10 (4) to 8. 5 x 10 (4). The solid packing used in the bed consisted of phi 9. 5 mm steel spheres. The bed-to-particle diameter ratio was with the average packed-bed porosity around 0. 43. The inlet flow temperature was unsteady and a mesh of spheres was used at either end to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. Gas temperature and pressure were measured at the entry, exit,and at three <b>axial</b> locations along <b>centerline</b> in the packed beds. The solid packing temperature was measured at three axial locations in the packed bed. A correlation based on the ratio of pressure drop and inlet-flow momentum (Euler number) exhibited an asymptotically decreasing trend with increasing Reynolds number. Axial conduction across the packed bed was found to he negligible in the investigated Reynolds number range. The enthalpy absorption rate to solid packing from hot gases is plotted as a function of a nondimensional time constant for different Reynolds numbers. A longer packed bed had high enthalpy absorption rate at Reynolds number similar to 10 (4), which decreased at Reynolds number similar to 10 (5). The enthalpy absorption plots can be used for estimating enthalpy drop across packed bed with different material, but for a geometrically similar packing...|$|R
