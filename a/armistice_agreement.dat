5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 <b>Armistice</b> <b>Agreement</b> provided for Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall. However, for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the <b>armistice</b> <b>agreement,</b> Jordan refused to abide by this clause. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.|$|E
5|$|In a third {{trial in}} early 1946, the National Court of Hungary in Budapest found Szombathelyi, Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, Deák, and Zöldi guilty of {{involvement}} in the massacres in the occupied territories, and in carrying out the deportation of Jews to extermination camps. In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the <b>Armistice</b> <b>Agreement,</b> the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia, where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946. They were all sentenced to death and executed the following month.|$|E
5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} {{of a civil}} war between two rival Korean regimes, each of which was supported by external powers, with each trying to topple the other through political and guerrilla tactics. The conflict was expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the Korean <b>Armistice</b> <b>Agreement</b> was signed on July 27, 1953.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean <b>Armistice</b> <b>Agreement,</b> are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after her}} commissioning, Littorio was badly damaged during the British air raid on Taranto on 11 November 1940, which put {{her out of}} action until the {{following}} March. Littorio thereafter took part in several sorties to catch the British Mediterranean Fleet, most of which failed to result in any action, the notable exception being the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942, where she damaged several British warships. Littorio was renamed Italia in July 1943 {{after the fall of}} the Fascist government. On 9 September 1943, the Italian fleet was attacked by German bombers while it was on its way to internment. During this action, which saw the destruction of her sister , Italia herself was hit by a Fritz X radio-controlled bomb, causing significant damage to her bow. As part of the <b>armistice</b> <b>agreement,</b> Italia was interned at Malta, Alexandria, and finally in the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal, where she remained until 1947. Italia was awarded to the United States as a war prize and scrapped at La Spezia in 195254.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July Wilton {{had ordered}} Lieutenant Colonel Peter Jeffreys {{to prepare a}} {{counter-attack}} by 1 DLI to recover some of the ground lost to the Chinese the night before, but after preparatory fire failed to clear the Chinese from the objective the assault was cancelled. The Chinese subsequently made another attempt against the US Marines on Hill 119 {{on the night of}} 26/27 July, but it lacked the weight of those of the previous nights and was easily repelled. In a final attempt to capture Boulder City at 21:30 a Chinese platoon had advanced on the wire at Hill 119, defended by Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines. Just after midnight another Chinese platoon-sized assault was also halted by the Marines. At 00:45 a Chinese platoon probed the US Marines on Hill 111, yet after an hour and twenty minutes it was also checked. Meanwhile, despite the clashes nearby on Hill 111 the Australians suffered no more casualties. The <b>Armistice</b> <b>Agreement</b> was subsequently signed at 10:00 on 27 July. Sporadic fighting continued, and the New Zealand gunners fired several counter-battery tasks, engaging several Chinese guns. The Commonwealth Divisional Artillery fired 1,300 rounds during the day; by evening the front was largely silent. In the last four hours of the war the Chinese fired 44,000 artillery rounds into the US Eighth Army positions, although none against the 1st Commonwealth Division. There were no further attacks and the ceasefire came into effect at 22:00 the same day. The following day some soldiers from both sides moved forward into no man's land to exchange greetings, although relatively few Australians did so and the Marines were under orders not to fraternise or communicate with the Chinese.|$|E

25|$|After the 1948–49 Arab-Israeli War, the Golan Heights were partly demilitarised by the Israel-Syria <b>Armistice</b> <b>Agreement.</b> During the {{following}} years, the area {{along the border}} witnessed thousands of violent incidents; the <b>armistice</b> <b>agreement</b> was being violated by both sides. The underlying causes of the conflict were a disagreement over {{the legal status of}} the demilitarised zone (DMZ), cultivation of land within it and competition over water resources. Syria claimed that neither party had sovereignty over the DMZ. Israel contended that the <b>Armistice</b> <b>Agreement</b> dealt solely with military concerns and that she had political and legal rights over the DMZ. Israel wanted to assert control up till the 1923 boundary in order to reclaim the Hula swamp, gain exclusive rights to Lake Galilee and divert water from the Jordan for its National Water Carrier. During the 1950s, Syria registered two principal territorial accomplishments: it took over Al-Hammah enclosure south of Lake Tiberias and established a de facto presence on and control of eastern shore of the lake.|$|E
