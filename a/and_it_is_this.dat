5|$|LTP is persistent, lasting {{from several}} minutes to many months, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> {{persistence}} that separates LTP from {{other forms of}} synaptic plasticity.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} in double brick, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> unreinforced masonry construction that was unable {{to cope with the}} earthquake forces. Upstairs, windows were round-headed. Downstairs, many of the openings were French doors.|$|E
5|$|The {{people are}} unwilling to be confronted {{by the results of}} their actions in the afterlife, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> problem that Swift wants to prevent.|$|E
50|$|Hutchinson's {{military}} career {{was to take}} him to India <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> which curtailed his rugby playing career. Whilst in India, he died in 1880.|$|R
50|$|Cadolle was a {{close friend}} of the French insurrectionist Louise Michel, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> {{connection}} that led her to leave for the safety of Buenos Aires. Here, in 1887, Herminie opened a shop selling made-to-measure underwear.|$|R
50|$|During this period, the Marine air {{units at}} El Toro were molded {{together}} with the 1st Marine Division troops at Camp Pendleton, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> combination that embarked for Korea when hostilities erupted in that area.|$|R
5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> {{emphatic}} assertion {{that makes the}} judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true {{in their power to}} entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> effect {{that leads to the}} difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
50|$|For {{performances}} of Luigi Cherubini's Médée in Frankfurt in 1855, Lachner composed recitatives {{to replace the}} original spoken dialogue, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> version, translated into Italian, which was used in many twentieth-century revivals and recordings of that opera.|$|R
50|$|Born in Birmingham, {{he moved}} to Suffolk just before {{the closure of the}} Mid-Suffolk Light Railway branch line from Haughley to Laxfield <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> that <b>is</b> said to have {{inspired}} the novel Love on a Branch Line.|$|R
50|$|Hallam, like Thomas Babington Macaulay, {{ultimately}} referred political {{questions to}} the standard of Whig constitutionalism. But he was conscientious with his materials, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> which made the Constitutional History one of the standard textbooks of English politics.|$|R
5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in {{referring}} to a quark's mass: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while constituent quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus {{the mass of the}} gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE) – <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons. See Chiral symmetry breaking.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{acceptance}} criterion is final state, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> {{acceptance criterion}} {{which is used}} to define the deterministic context-free languages.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} he {{suffered}} from dropsy while coaching at Charterhouse <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> that probably contributed to his early death.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{discontinued}} in 1999, {{and directly}} {{replaced by the}} Proudia. However, Mitsubishi also developed its first V8 engine for the new Dignity limousine around <b>this</b> time, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> latter model which took position as the domestic flagship of the company.|$|R
50|$|According to Ian Cassells, Harald Finehair {{became the}} first King of all Norway in 885 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> king who created the Norwegian earldom of Orkney. In 1266 Caithness was defined as Scottish rather than Norwegian by the Treaty of Perth.|$|R
25|$|The {{decision}} effectively {{gave the}} FCC {{power to regulate}} the networks. As {{a result of this}} 1943 decision, NBC was forced to sell one of its networks <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> action which then {{led to the creation of}} the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).|$|R
25|$|Unsorted {{glacial till}} {{gives rise to}} such {{features}} of glacial deposition as eskers, and drumlins which are predominant {{over much of the}} area. Such elements provide natural transport routes <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> complex underlying geology that the town is built upon.|$|E
25|$|In Zadspram 34.31, Jeh is {{appointed}} by Ahriman for the defilement of females, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> defilement that causes {{women to have}} their menses. In Shayest-ne-Shayest 3.29, Jeh's gaze {{is said to be}} powerful enough to kill.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiment}} {{observed the}} light produced by relativistic electrons {{in the water}} created by neutrino interactions. As relativistic electrons travel through a medium, they lose energy producing a cone of blue light through the Cherenkov effect, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> light that is directly detected.|$|E
50|$|Birkinshaw's {{wrought iron}} rails were {{taken up by}} George Stephenson in 1821 for the {{proposed}} Stockton and Darlington Railway, {{despite the fact that}} Stephenson already held the rights to the best cast iron product <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> railway that effectively launched the rail era.|$|R
50|$|He {{represented}} {{not only}} the fun-loving and partying charro, but also the urban hero of the working class, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> character that won him the love and admiration of the public in Mexico and other countries, such as Venezuela, Guatemala and El Salvador.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the river}} {{has been the}} focus of intense gold-mining. The Central Otago Gold Rush began in 1861, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> influx of people that led to the {{establishment}} of many of the river towns that still exist today, such as Alexandra, Clyde, and Cromwell.|$|R
25|$|The role {{of divine}} {{inspiration}} in philosophy {{must also be}} considered; the philosopher is struck with the fourth kind of madness, that of love, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> divine inspiration that leads him and his beloved towards the good—but only when tempered with self-control.|$|E
25|$|However Rømer also {{realised}} {{that any}} {{effect of the}} finite speed of light would add up over {{a long series of}} observations, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> cumulative effect that he announced to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris. The effect can be illustrated with Rømer's observations from spring 1672.|$|E
25|$|If {{you find}} {{as a result}} of your {{deliberations}} that the rules and safeguards were broken by {{one or more of the}} railwaymen concerned, or in other words that they have been negligent, there remains one point which you must decide, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gilchrist first joined Oxford United from Hartlepool United for £100,000 in February 1995. He soon formed one of {{the best}} {{defensive}} partnerships ever seen at The Manor Ground, alongside Matt Elliott, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> partnership that formed the basis for the promotion winning side of 1995-96.|$|R
50|$|Cannabis use in Algeria {{also played}} a role in {{spreading}} the habit to France, following France's 1830 occupation of Algeria. Dr. Jacques-Joseph Moreau observed the effects of cannabis in Algeria {{in the form of an}} edible called dawamesc, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> drug that he introduced to Paris' Club des Hashischins.|$|R
25|$|The New Delhi town plan, {{like its}} architecture, was chosen with one single chief consideration: to be {{a symbol of}} British power and supremacy. All other {{decisions}} <b>were</b> subordinate to <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> framework that dictated the choice and application of symbology and influences from both Hindu and Islamic architecture.|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{algebraic}} geometry, the algebraic variety of rational {{points on the}} unit circle is birational to the affine line over the rational numbers. The unit circle is thus called a rational curve, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> fact which enables an explicit parameterization of the (rational number) points on it by means of rational functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{powers of}} ω {{function}} {{is also an}} exponential function, but {{does not have the}} properties desired for an extension of the function on the reals. It will however be needed {{in the development of the}} base-e exponential, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> function that is meant whenever the notation ωx is used in the following.|$|E
25|$|Searle has {{produced}} a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990. The {{only part of the}} argument which should be controversial is A3 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> point which the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.|$|E
50|$|After the Mayflower sailed, Katherine {{made another}} attempt to {{challenge}} the decision through the courts, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> legal action in early 1622 before Chief Justice James Ley {{which led to the}} statement from Samuel explaining where he sent the children and why, which provided the main historical evidence for the events.|$|R
25|$|On 13 July 1940, the Volksdeutsche Bewegung (VdB) {{was founded}} in Luxembourg City under the {{leadership}} of Damian Kratzenberg, a German teacher at the Athénée de Luxembourg. <b>Its</b> main goal <b>was</b> to push the population towards a German-friendly position by means of propaganda, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> organisation that used the phrase Heim ins Reich.|$|R
50|$|A former pupil {{and gang}} member of Misako, {{he died in}} a {{motorcycle}} accident before the manga started. He and Mafuyu {{used to go out}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> relationship which brought about Mihara's wrath. He was blinded in one eye when Mihara punched him and was told by doctors not to drive, advice which he sadly didn't follow.|$|R
