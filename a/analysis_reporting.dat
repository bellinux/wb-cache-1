5|$|One {{can also}} {{calculate}} auto fatalities per driver's license. From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have car accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through its Fatality <b>Analysis</b> <b>Reporting</b> System stated that auto fatalities continue to be {{the leading cause of death}} for young adults.|$|E
25|$|Motorcycles have {{a higher}} rate of fatal {{accidents}} than automobiles or trucks and buses. United States Department of Transportation data for 2005 from the Fatality <b>Analysis</b> <b>Reporting</b> System show that for passenger cars, 18.62 fatal crashes occur per 100,000 registered vehicles. For motorcycles this figure is higher at 75.19 per 100,000 registered vehicles four times higher than for cars.|$|E
25|$|UMTRI {{houses the}} Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics. For many years, {{it has worked}} collaboratively with FMCSA and NHTSA to {{maintain}} the Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents (TIFA) and Buses Involved in Fatal Accidents (BIFA) databases. Starting with cases identified in the Fatality <b>Analysis</b> <b>Reporting</b> System (FARS) (the U.S. national database of road traffic fatalities based on police crash reports), UMTRI researchers collect detailed data on vehicle configuration, cargo type, hours of driving, and other variables. In addition, TIFA and BIFA data collection protocols are easily adapted to address emerging issues. Other strengths of the UMTRI program include vehicle engineering, crash avoidance systems such as collision warning systems and stability control, biomechanics, and risk factors such as distraction, fatigue, and medical conditions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{national}} {{surveillance system}} based on police crash reports provides more detailed information on circumstances and contributing factors for fatal MVCs. The [...] National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Fatality <b>Analysis</b> <b>Reporting</b> System (FARS) collects comprehensive data on the crash, the vehicle, the driver and other persons involved. However, FARS identifies work-related fatalities only through the death certificate, which often does not fully ascertain work-related fatalities. Nor does FARS categorize fatally injured workers by industry or occupation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{patient safety}} {{organization}} (PSO) is a group, institution or association that improves medical care by reducing medical errors. In the 1990s, reports {{in several countries}} revealed a staggering number of patient injuries and deaths each year due to avoidable adverse health care events. In the United States, the Institute of Medicine report (1999) called for a broad national effort to include the establishment of patient safety centers, expanded reporting of adverse events and development of safety programs in health care organizations. [...] The organizations that developed ranged from governmental to private, and some founded by industry, professional or consumer groups. Common functions of patient safety organizations are data collection and <b>analysis,</b> <b>reporting,</b> education, funding and advocacy.|$|E
