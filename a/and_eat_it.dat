5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E
5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> {{with regards to the}} truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

25|$|After the holiday, eating {{from the}} etrog or etrog jam is {{considered}} a segula (efficacious remedy) {{for a woman to}} have an easy childbirth. A common Ashkenazi custom is to save the etrog until Tu Bishvat <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> in candied form or as succade, accompanied by prayers that the worshiper will merit a beautiful etrog next Sukkot. Some families make jam or liqueur out of it, or stick cloves in the skin for use as besamim at the havdalah ceremony after Shabbat.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous have {{established}} {{themselves in the}} folklore and histories of the indigenous people of South America and Central America. Forest tribes of Brazil and Colombia believe the jaguar imitates {{the call of the}} great tinamou in order to track <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b> A tale from the Guahibo Indians tells of a young man traveling by canoe who tried to locate a calling tinamou. As he approached the bank he became suspicious at the harshness of the call and backed away just as a jaguar burst out of the vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Some feed on carrion. Cameras {{show that}} when a dead fish {{is placed on the}} bottom, {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> from the inside out. Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on epipelagic fish. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.|$|E

25|$|An unusual feeding {{strategy}} {{is that of}} the oxpeckers of Africa. They perch on living animals and glean parasites from the animals' hides. On furry animals, such as buffalo, giraffe, and donkey, these birds run their bills through the fur of the animal, using a scissors-like motion to extract ticks and lice from near the skin. When they pull the insect out {{to the end of the}} fur, they catch it <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b> (On animals with bare hides, such as rhinoceros and hippopotamus, oxpeckers pick at any open wounds the animals happen to have, consuming blood and pus, and possibly keeping the wounds free of maggots.) Historically, rhinoceros and other large wild mammals have been among the favored hosts, but as the populations of large mammals in the African savanna have declined in modern times, the population and range of both red-billed and yellow-billed oxpecker have also changed, and now the birds will use donkeys and domestic cattle as hosts.|$|E
500|$|After {{the revelation}} {{in the closing}} minutes of [...] "The Bill", the {{character}} of the episode changes. The biggest changes come about in Watkins's Kevin and White's Anya. Kevin changes from a penny pincher referred to as [...] "the professor" [...] apparently in jest to a menacing criminal mastermind. Anya, initially reminiscent of Manuel of Fawlty Towers or a character from 'Allo 'Allo, faces criticism for taking her characterisation too far, allowing the writers, for one critic, to have their cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b> The writers also acknowledge the plot's [...] "silliness" [...] in an almost-fourth-wall-breaking piece of dialogue, with Shearsmith's Archie declaring that the characters' plan [...] "was too elaborate".|$|E

500|$|Though {{defending}} the suit in Illinois might be burdensome on Hemi, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that Illinois courts {{had a strong}} interest in resolving a dispute that involved the state as a party. Moreover, because Illinois law would be applied, the Court also observed that it would be most convenient for Illinois to have the suit adjudicated in an Illinois court. The Court also noted that [...] "Hemi wants to have its cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> too: it wants the benefit of a nationwide business model with none of the exposure. There is nothing constitutionally unfair about allowing Illinois, a state with which Hemi has had sufficient minimum contacts, to exercise personal jurisdiction over Hemi." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of the episode, Hader ad-libbed calypso scat singing, which series creator Loren Bouchard cited as an [...] "amazing [...] when a person comes in and ad-libs music." [...] Bouchard further stated: [...] "There's something so musical about it and he's clearly so talented, but it's also silly and in character. It's nice to have your cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> too." [...] Hader's singing is incorporated into a scene in the episode where Mickey sings while making a hole in Bob's basement wall, and is later reprised in the episode's end credits. The same scene sees Mickey attempting {{to cover up the}} hole with a Big film poster, which serves as a reference to the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E
500|$|As {{there is}} {{insufficient}} {{evidence to prove}} Milhouse ate all the food, Bart acquits him. Upset, the other students attempt to kill Milhouse along with Bart and Lisa, who tried to intervene. They chase them into a cave, where it is revealed that Milhouse's [...] "monster" [...] is actually a wild boar. On one of the boar's tusks is an empty bag of chips, revealing {{that it was the}} actual culprit who ate the snacks. Lisa notices that the boar has survived by licking slime from the sides of rocks and proclaims they can likewise live off the slime. The other kids instead kill the boar <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> while Lisa adheres to her vegetarianism by licking slime from rocks. A deus ex machina narration by James Earl Jones says the children are eventually rescued by Moe Szyslak.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his own thing, taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go.

[...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is going to respond to that, we can only wait and see." [...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E
500|$|The most criticized {{aspect of}} the Climax Series is the one-game {{advantage}} that is awarded to the regular-season champions for the Final Stage. When the rule was implemented the for the 2008 Climax Series, many players reacted negatively with some describing the rule as [...] "unfair", [...] "bad", [...] "bull" [...] and [...] "messed up". Former player and current manager Alex Ramírez, however, believed that the league champion deserves the advantage. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey believes that the [...] "phantom win" [...] gives the pennant winner {{too much of an}} advantage. According to him, the First Stage bye plus all home games during the Final Stage should be advantage enough for the top-seeded team. He describes the situation as NPB [...] "trying to have its cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too" [...] by trying to reap the benefits of a playoff system while also trying to maintain the traditional showdown of pennant winners in the Japan Series.|$|E

George is finally able to call Tatiana, but he gets the answering machine, so he leaves a message. Tatiana calls the restaurant to reach George, but the maître d' calls [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza", and she [...] "said curse word" [...] {{when he told her}} that George is not there.

[...] Jackson unveils anger and deceit, saying [...] "Thought you'd get the money too / Greedy motherfuckers try to have their cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too". She also offers a comeuppance to a [...] "baby gigolo" [...] who hollers at [...] "everything that walks / No substance, just small talk."

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's {{almost as if the}} funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by [...] Wiig in the Lifetime movie." [...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, {{and it seemed to me}} like the show was trying to have its cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> too." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{music videos}} {{contributed to a}} higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, as Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before (2007) wrote: [...] "In Alfred Kinsey's studies in the 1950s, only 3% of the young women had {{received}} oral sex from a man. By the mid-1990s, however, 75% of women aged 18-24 had experienced cunnilingus. Music videos by female artists have contributed to the trend, with both Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in exactly the right position." [...] Similarly, Paula Kamen in Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution (2000) states that [...] "n the early to mid-1990s, oral sex even reached mainstream music as politically charged demand of truly liberated women," [...] citing TLC, Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson as examples of female artists simulating cunnilingus in their videos. Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "she celebrated becoming an erotic being... young women a way to have their sexual freedom and their dignity, to have their cake <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too." [...] She was named Best Female Singer and Female Sex Symbol by Rolling Stone for the year 1993 in pop music. Goren adds that later pop stars such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Pink would rely on image, sex appeal and choreography as much as musical talent.|$|E
