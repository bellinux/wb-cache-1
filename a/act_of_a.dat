5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public {{officials}} have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.|$|E

In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor.

Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it.

According to Law 31 of the Laws of Cricket, an umpire may not rule a batsman out unless the fielding side appeals. On many occasions when a batsman has otherwise technically been out, the fielding team neglects to appeal so the umpire can not declare him out. An appeal may be made at any point before the bowler starts his run-up for the next ball. A bowler's appeal combined with the wicket keeper is crucial in umpire's decision.|$|E

25|$|The government's claim {{regarding}} the Statute of Westminster {{was based on}} two principal theories. The first {{was based on the}} repeal of the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act to South Africa. The Colonial Laws Validity Act provided that any <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> colonial parliament would be valid within the colony unless it contradicted a British act applying to the colony. The argument was that an alteration of the Cape franchise without a two-thirds majority would have contradicted the South Africa Act (which was itself an act of the British Parliament) and therefore would be impermissible under the Colonial Laws Validity Act; and that once that act no longer applied the entrenchment was not enforceable. The court disagreed, noting that section 152 of the South Africa Act specifically empowered the South African Parliament to amend the South Africa Act, and that the Colonial Laws Validity Act had no application and therefore its repeal had no effect.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not. Historians mostly agree that {{the framers of the}} Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court {{to have some sort of}} judicial review; Marshall made their goals operational. Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution. Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> president unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|In 1175, {{the emperor}} was seriously ill {{and decided to}} entrust the regentship of his son Lý Long Trát to Tô Hiến Thành.

During the Lý Dynasty, Tô Hiến Thành was the only possessor of the title Prince who did not come from the Lý royal family. From the fourth month of 1175, Tô Hiến Thành began his regency because the emperor was not able to rule the country as the crown prince was only two years old. The emperor died in the seventh month in 1175 and began the campaign of the Empress Mother in supporting another prince, Lý Long Xưởng, to replace the infant emperor Lý Long Trát, now Lý Cao Tông. The Empress Mother tried to bribe Tô Hiến Thành's wife and persuaded the regent many times. Tô Hiến Thành refused by a simple answer that he had to follow the order of the late emperor and preferred being honest to being rich but disloyal. His firmness in refusing the proposal of the Empress Mother and controlling the army and order during the funeral time made other officials believe in Lý Cao Tông. They therefore declined the campaign of replacing him by the prince Lý Long Xưởng.|$|E
