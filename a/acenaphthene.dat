Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, <b>acenaphthene,</b> anthracene and dicyclopentadiene.

The lead optimization involves relative hydrophobicity and substitution of functional groups, such as electron withdrawing or donating. Many such groups are placed on hydrophobic moiety and their positional bioisosters are characterized. Among these analogue piperazine derivatives on optimization with respect to hydrophobicity and electronegativity showed inhibition at nanomolar levels.

A series of phosphine–stibine and phosphine–stiborane peri–substituted <b>acenaphthenes</b> containing all permutations of pentavalent groups –SbClnPh 4 -n (5 – 9), as well as trivalent groups –SbCl 2, –Sb(R) Cl, and –SbPh 2 (2 – 4, R = Ph, Mes), were synthesised and fully characterised including single crystal diffraction and multinuclear NMR. In addition, the bonding in these species was studied by DFT computational methods. The P–Sb dative interactions in both series range from strongly bonding to non-bonding as the Lewis acidity of the Sb acceptor is decreased. In the pentavalent antimony series, {{a significant change in}} the P–Sb distance is observed between –SbClPh 3 and –SbCl 2 Ph 2 derivatives 6 and 7, consistent with a change from a bonding to a non-bonding interaction in a response to relatively small change in Lewis acidity of the acceptor.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the {{research}} described in this thesis concern the synthesis, characterization and study of 1, 8 -bis(diarylmethylium) naphthalenediyl dications. Such dications have been prepared from the corresponding diols and have been fully characterized. Single crystals X-ray diffraction studies indicate that the two cationic centers of these derivatives are separated by 3. 0 - 3. 1 ??. The enforced proximity of the cationic centers intensifies the electron deficiency of these derivatives which behave as strong organic oxidants. As indicated by cyclic voltammetry, these dications undergo a two-electron reduction to afford the corresponding <b>acenaphthenes.</b> The newly formed C-C bond which links the former methylium are remarkably long (1. 628 - 1. 706 ??.) and can, in some instances, be oxidatively cleaved {{in the presence of}} acids. These dications can also be reduced chemically by reducing reagent, such as hydride, chloride, bromide and iodide. Remarkably, the reaction of 1, 8 -bis(diphenylmethylium) naphthalenediyl dication with fluoride anion results in the formation of a mono fluorinated cation which features an unsymmetrical C-F?C bridge between the former methylium centers. As indicated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, the structure of this cation is fluxional with the fluorine atom oscillating between the former methylium centers.

The degree of intramolecular P-Sn bonding within the series was investigated by X-ray crystallography, solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT/B 3 LYP/SBKJC/PCM) calculations. All members of the series adopt a conformation such that the phosphorus lone pair is located directly opposite the tin center, promoting an intramolecular donor acceptor P -> Sn type interaction. The extent of covalent bonding between Sn and P {{is found to be}} much greater in triorganotin chlorides 2 - 4 in comparison with the triphenyl derivative 1. Coordination of a highly electronegative chlorine atom naturally increases the Lewis acidity of the tin center, enhancing the Ip(P) -sigma*(Sn-Y) donor acceptor 3 c- 4 e type interaction, as indicated by conspicuously short Sn-P peri distances and significant (1) J(P- 31,Sn- 119) spin spin coupling constants (SSCCs) in the range 740 - 754 Hz.

A group of sterically encumbered peri-substituted <b>acenaphthenes</b> have been prepared, containing tin moieties at the 5, 6 -positions in 1 – 3 ([Acenap(SnR 3) 2], Acenap = acenaphthene- 5, 6 -diyl; R 3 = Ph 3 (1), Me 3 (2); [(Acenap) 2 (SnMe 2) 2] (3)) and phosphorus functional groups at the proximal peri-positions in 4 and 5 ([Acenap(PR 2) (PiPr 2) ] R 2 = Ph 2 (4), Ph(iPr) (5)). Bis(stannane) structures 1 – 3 are dominated by repulsive interactions between the bulky tin groups, leading to peri-distances approaching the sum of van der Waals radii. Conversely, the quasi-linear CPh-P···P three-body fragments found in bis(phosphine) 4 suggest the presence of a lp(P) −σ*(P–C) donor–acceptor 3 c- 4 e type interaction, supported by a notably short intramolecular P···P distance and notably large JPP through-space coupling (180 Hz). Severely strained bis(sulfides) 4 -S and 5 -S, experiencing pronounced in-plane and out-of-plane displacements of the exocyclic peri-bonds, have also been isolated following treatment of 4 and 5 with sulfur. The resulting nonbonded intramolecular P···P distances, ∼ 4. 05 Å and ∼ 12 % longer than twice the van der Waals radii of P (3. 60 Å), are among the largest ever reported peri-separations, independent of the heteroatoms involved, and comparable to the distance found in 1 containing the larger Sn atoms (4. 07 Å).

40|$|Applications of tandem mass {{spectrometry}} {{for the analysis}} of complex mixtures are described. Increased specificity and selectivity were achieved by using a variety of reagent gases in both negative and positive ion modes. ^ Natural isotopic abundance ratios were examined in both simple and complex mixtures using parent, daughter and neutral loss scans. Expressions for the isotopic abundances ratios were derived for the various types of MS/MS scans, comparisons being made within a given spectrum and between spectra. Although different from the characteristic ion clusters evident in simple mass spectra themselves, these ratios are characteristic of the elemental compositions of the selected ions. An additional degree of selectivity results because not only must specific ions be present in a spectrum (or spectra), they must be present in the correct isotopic abundance ratios. ^ MS/MS was also used to discover new compounds. Daughter scans were used to identify seven new alkaloids in a cactus species. Three of these alkaloids were novel compounds, and included the first simple, fully aromatic isoquinoline alkaloids reported in Cactaceae. ^ MS/MS was used to characterize the chemical reaction products of coal in studies designed to probe its macromolecular structure. Negative ion chemical ionization was utilized to study reaction products resulting from the oxidation of coal. Possible structural units in the precursor coal were predicted based on the reaction products identified, aliphatic and aromatic acids and their anhydrides. Some of the structural units postulated include C(, 0) and C(, 2) -C(, 6) aliphatic bridges between aromatic units, fused ring aromatic structures and acenaphthene-, indan- and tetralin-like structures. In a separate study, parent scans were used to characterize series of alkylaromatic compounds, including alkylated <b>acenaphthenes,</b> naphthalenes and anthracenes and/or phenanthrenes, in coal liquefaction and/or extraction products. The various reaction products were examined for differences in nature and in hexane-soluble yields which could be related to the structure and processing of coal, respectively. The similarity of the product distributions was considered to be evidence for a two-phase structure of coal in which a mobile phase (characterized by the alkylaromatics) is released from an insoluble, macromolecular network. ^ These studies illustrate the types of problems for which MS/MS is useful. Emphasis has been placed on characterization of complex mixtures by selecting experimental parameters which enhance the information obtained.

40|$|Electron impact induced rearrangements {{have been}} {{observed}} in compounds containing either two arylthio groups or an arylthio group and an arylsulphonyl group. In addition {{to the loss of}} sulphur dioxide from the molecular ion and a sulphone-sulphinate rearrangement, 3 -arylsulphonyl- 2 -arylthiopropenes exhibited the rearrangement a bisarylsulphide ion (analogous to that reported for the isomeric l-arylsulphonyl- 2 -arylthiopropenes). A series of l-arylsulphonyl- 4 -arylthio- 2 -butynes also underwent sulphone-sulphinate rearrangement and rearranged to the bisarylsulphide ions, in the absence of sulphur dioxide or sulphur extrusion. The formation of the bisarylsulphide ion from the molecular ion of these compounds is postulated to occur after an initial { 1, 3 } arylthio shift giving an ion analogous to the molecular ion of 3 -arylsulphonyl- 2 -arylthiopropene. A skeletal rearrangement of N-(4 '-arylsulphonyl - 2 '-butynyl) -N-(4 "-arylthio- 2 "-butynyl) anilines 1 2 resulted in the elimination of Ar SC SAr from the molecular ion, but notions arising from a sulphone-sulphinate rearrangement or extrusion of sulphur or sulphur dioxide. The rearrangement of N,N- bis(4 '-arylthio- 2 '-butynyl) anilines via consecutive { 1, 3 } arylthio shifts,followed by elimination of a bisaryldisulphide moiety, was supported by the behaviour of N-(4 '-arylthio- 2 '-butynyl) -N-(2 "-arylthio- 2 "-propenyl) -p-toluidines and N,N-bis(2 'arylthio- 2 '-propenyl) -p-toluidines. Theirmolecular ions are analogous to the rearranged molecular ions of the N,N-bis(4 '-arylthio- 2 '-butynyl) anilines after one or two arylthio shifts, respectively. No extrusion of sulphur is observed, but rather the elimination of a bisaryldisulphide moiety occurs. A series of 1, 8 -bis(arylthiomethyl) naph-thalenes and 1, 2 -bis(arylthio) <b>acenaphthenes</b> were 1 2 synthesised. Electron impact showed no loss of Ar SSAr from the naphthalene derivatives, owing to the predominance of C-S bond cleavage. However, the acenaph-thene derivatives readily eliminated a bisaryldi-sulphide moiety and a qualitative substituent effect was 1 2 +observed for the formation of Ar SSAr ˙ ions.

Dans certaines conditions d'utilisation, celui-ci subit une dégradation de ses propriétés mécaniques et physico-chimiques initiales. Des échanges de matières s'établissent entre le matériau et le fluide transporté : des composés constitutifs du fluide (eau, hydrocarbures) peuvent être absorbés par le polyamide {{tandis que}} le principal additif du matériau (le plastifiant) est extrait. Cette étude, entreprise pour déterminer l'influence de la composition du milieu chimique sur les propriétés du polyamide 11, a permis : 1) De développer une nouvelle méthode d'analyse des matières diffusant dans le polyamide 11. Le principe de cette méthode consiste à réaliser une thermodésorption des différentes matières présentes dans le polymère et à les analyser en ligne par spectrométrie de masse à moyenne résolution (résolution = 3000). Cette méthode permet l'analyse quantitative simultanée du plastifiant résiduel, de l'eau et des hydrocarbures absorbés ainsi que la détermination de la répartition par familles chimiques de ces hydrocarbures. 2) De proposer un modèle prédictif du vieillissement du polyamide 11 dans des milieux modèles constitués d'eau, d'une coupe gazole principalement aliphatique et d'une coupe gazole principalement aromatique. La composition de ces différents milieux de vieillissement a été choisie à l'aide d'un plan d'expériences appliqué aux mélanges. L'influence de l'eau sur les propriétés mécaniques (diminution de l'allongement à la rupture) et physico-chimiques (diminution de la masse moléculaire moyenne et augmentation du taux de cristallinité) a été mise en évidence. Par ailleurs, {{quel que soit}} le milieu de vieillissement, à 140 °C, le plastifiant est extrait du polyamide. L'influence du milieu aromatique sur la plastification du matériau a été démontrée et a pu être attribuée à certains types d'hydrocarbures dont la nature a été précisée. Les résultats obtenus ont permis de conclure que le phénomène principal mis en jeu au cours du vieillissement est une hydrolyse causée par l'eau absorbée dans le matériau et qui entraîne une coupure des chaînes macromoléculaires et la fragilisation du polymère. 3) D'étendre l'application du modèle établi avec des coupes gazoles au cas d'un vieillissement dans un pétrole brut et de vérifier son caractère prédictif. Polyamide 11 {{is used as a}} leakproof sheath inside flexible flowlines for petroleum products. Under some operating conditions, this polymer undergoes a degradation of its original physicochemical and mechanical properties, which may be assimilated with a phenomenon of aging. Material exchanges occur between polyamide 11 and the fluid transported. The components present in the fluid (water, hydrocarbons) may be absorbed, and the principal additive of the material (the plasticizer) is extracted. This study was carried out to determine the influence of the composition of the chemical environment of aging on the properties of polyamide 11. In the first phase, a new analysis method was developed for quantifying diffusing materials in polyamide 11. Effectively, several techniques can be used for determining such materials. However, interference problems may be encountered when the polymer is in contact with oil containing sulfur-bearing products. Likewise, none of these techniques is capable of simultaneously making a complete analysis of all the materials. The principle of the method developed consists in performing a thermodesorption of the different materials present in the polymer and in analyzing them on line by medium-resolution mass spectrometry (resolution = 3000). This resolution is also capable of determining the distribution, by chemical families, of the hydrocarbons absorbed. The method was checked with aged polyamide 11 samples containing either a single type of material or several materials. These materials were analyzed at the same time by thermodesorption coupled with mass spectrometry and by other techniques. The results obtained show that this new method is capable of quantitatively and simultaneous determining : (1) the residual plasticizer content, (2) the water and absorbed-hydrocarbon content, and (3) the distribution, by chemical families, of the absorbed hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics). In the second phase, since polyamide 11 has varying affinity for the different chemical families present in a petroleum environment, we tried to determine the influence of each type of compound on the mechanical properties (ultimate elongation) and physicochemical properties (rate of crystallinity, molecular weight, contents of diffusing materials). Aging was performed in the laboratory in model environments made up in varying proportions, i. e. water, a gas-oil cut composed mainly of aromatic hydrocarbons, a gas-oil cut composed mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The composition of these different aging environments was chosen by means of an experimental plan applied to the mixtures, and a polynomial mathematical model has been postulated. The conditions of temperature, pressure and aging time were set at a constant level for all the tests, i. e. 140 °C, 6 bar of nitrogen, 15 days. The model obtained was used to plot isoresponse curves and to predict the properties analyzed {{as a function of the}} composition of the environment. The influence of water on the degradation of the mechanical properties (decrease in ultimate elongation) and the physicochemical properties (reduction of the molecular weight and increase in the rate of crystallinity) was revealed. Likewise, it was shown that, no matter what the aging environment was at 140 °C, the plasticizer is extracted and the aromatic environment influences the plastication of the material. By means of mass spectrometry, the chemical nature of the aromatic hydrocarbons absorbed preferentially, and having a pasticating role, was determined. These are two-cycle aromatics (alkylnaphthalenes, <b>acenaphthenes,</b> diphenyls, acenaphthylenes, fluorenes) and sulfur-containing aromatics (benzothiophenes and dibenzothiophenes). The different results led to the conclusion that the principal phenomenon involved in aging is a hydrolysis caused by the presence of absorbed water in the material, which leads to the cutting of the macromolecular chains and embrittlement of the polymer. Lastly, the model created with gas-oil cuts was applied to a case of aging of a crude oil, and this led to the satisfactory prediction of how the mechanical and physicochernical properties of the polymer evolve in such an environment...|$|R

The short “natural” peri-distance (2. 44 Å) and the rigidity of the aromatic system causes considerable steric strain between peri-substituted heteroatoms. As a consequence, substitution at both peri-positions leads to in- and out-of-plane distortions, which often result in buckling of the ring system. In order to relax this geometric strain, weak bonding interactions can also exist between the peri-substituents. This thesis focuses on the synthesis, structural characterisation and investigation of a range of sterically crowded peri-substituted <b>acenaphthene</b> compounds. This involves the study of the <b>acenaphthene</b> geometry, through X-ray crystallography when different peri-substituents occupy the close 5, 6 -positions; our main focus is to study weak non-bonded interactions that can occur across the peri-gap, for example weakly attractive three-centre four-electron (3 c- 4 e) type interactions which are known to prevail in such compounds under the appropriate conditions. Repulsion within these systems, resulting from the steric crowding of the peri-space is also investigated, employing changes in bond lengths, bay-region angle splay, displacement of atoms from the mean plane and central <b>acenaphthene</b> torsion angles to help quantify the degree of <b>acenaphthene</b> distortion, which are all conveniently probed by the peri-distance. To this end we have synthesised a range of novel sterically crowded mixed bromo-tin <b>acenaphthene</b> derivatives (Chapter 3), chalcogen-tin <b>acenaphthene</b> molecules (Chapter 4), phosphorus–tin derivatives (Chapter 5) and a series of homologous tin-tin acenaphthenes (Chapter 6). All the compounds studied in this thesis were characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography in an effort to gain a greater understanding of the deformation that occurs when disparate functionalities are located in close proximity and explore the potential for weak non-covalent intramolecular interactions to occur...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} and {{the performance}} of activated carbon produced from flamboyant pod back, milk bush kernel shell and rice husk for the effective removal of <b>acenaphthene</b> from simulated wastewater under the influence of carbonization temperature and initial concentration were investigated. The adsorption capacities of all the activated carbons obtained from the selected raw materials are influenced by increasing carbonization temperature. Activated carbons obtained from rice husk at carbonisation temperature of 600 °C had the maximum adsorption capacity (5. 554 mg g - 1) while carbons produced from milk bush at carbonisation temperature of 300 °C had the minimum adsorption capacity (1. 386 mg g - 1), for the adsorption of <b>acenaphthene</b> from the simulated wastewater. The removal efficiencies of the investigated adsorbents generally rank high and the highest value (80. 56 %) was obtained for the adsorption of <b>acenaphthene</b> by rice husk carbonized at 600 °C. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies obtained in the study decreased as the initial concentrations of the adsorbate increased. The four selected isotherm models; Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich described well the equilibrium adsorption of <b>acenaphthene</b> unto activated carbon derived from Flamboyant pod bark, milk bush kernel shell and rice husk. Sequence of suitability of the selected isotherms in the study was Temkin ≈ Freundlich >Dubinin-Radushkevich>Langmuir for adsorption of <b>acenaphthene.</b> It therefore shows that Temkin isotherm is the most suitable model for fitting experimental data obtained from adsorption of <b>acenaphthene</b> from simulated wastewater unto activated carbon produced from Flamboyant pod bark, milk bush kernel shell and rice husk...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the microbial degradation of naphthol, naphthalene, and <b>acenaphthene,</b> under aerobic, anaerobic, and denitrification conditions in soil-water systems. Chemical degradation of naphthol and naphthalene {{in the presence}} of a manganese oxide was also studied. Naphthol, naphthalene, and <b>acenaphthene</b> were degraded microbially under aerobic conditions from initial aqueous-phase concentrations of 9, 7, and 1 mg/liter to nondetectable levels in 3, 10, and 10 days, respectively. Under anaerobic conditions naphthol degraded to nondetectable levels in 15 days, whereas naphthalene and <b>acenaphthene</b> showed no significant degradation over periods of 50 and 70 days, respectively. Under denitrification conditions naphthol, naphthalene, and <b>acenaphthene</b> were degraded from initial aqueous-phase concentrations of 8, 7, and 0. 4 mg/liter to nondetectable levels in 16, 45, and 40 days, respectively. Acclimation periods of approximately 2 days under aerobic conditions and 2 weeks under denitrification conditions were observed for both naphthalene and <b>acenaphthene.</b> Abiotic degradation of naphthalen and naphthol were evaluated by reaction with manganese oxide, a minor soil constituent. In the presence of a manganese oxide, naphthalene showed no abiotic degradation over a period of 9 weeks, whereas the aqueous naphthol concentration decreased from 9 mg/liter to nondetectable levels in 9 days. The results of this study show that low-molecular-weight, unsubstituted, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are amenable to microbial degradation in soil-water systems under denitrification conditions...|$|E

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the occurrence of PAH degrading microorganisms in two river systems in the Western Cape, South Africa, and their ability to degrade two PAH compounds (<b>acenaphthene</b> and fluorene). A total of 19 bacterial isolates were obtained from the Diep- and Plankenburg Rivers. These microorganisms were first identified phenotypically on various selective and general media (such as nutrient agar, Eosine Methylene Blue and Mannitol Salts Agar), followed by staining and biochemical testing, followed by molecular identification using 16 S rRNA and PCR. The isolates were then tested for <b>acenaphthene</b> and fluorene degradation first at flask scale and then in a Stirred Tank Bioreactor at varying temperatures (25 ºC, 30 ºC, 35 ºC, 37 ºC, 38 ºC, 40 ºC and 45 ºC). All experiments were run without the addition of supplements, bulking agents, biosurfactants or any other form of biostimulants. Four of the 19 isolated microorganisms were identified as <b>acenaphthene</b> and fluorene degrading isolates. Three of the four microorganisms identified as PAH degrading isolates were Gram negative isolates. Results showed that Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus megaterium and Aeromonas hydrophila efficiently degraded fluorene (99. 90 %, 97. 90 %, 98. 40 % and 99. 50 %) and <b>acenaphthene</b> (98. 60 %, 95. 70 %, 90. 20 % and 99. 90 %) at 37 ºC, 37 ºC, 30 ºC and 35 ºC, respectively. The degradation of fluorene was found to be more efficient and rapid compared to that of <b>acenaphthene</b> and degradation at Stirred Tank Bioreactor scale was more efficient for all treatments. Throughout the biodegradation experiments, there was an exponential increase in microbial plate counts ranging from 5 x 104 to 9 x 108 CFU/ml. The increase in plate count was observed to correlate with the efficient degradation temperature profiles and percentages. The PAH degrading microorganisms isolated during this study significantly reduced the concentrations of <b>acenaphthene</b> and fluorene and can be used on a larger, commercial scale to bioremediate PAH contaminated river systems. Other factors that influence the optimal expression of biodegradative potential of microorganisms other than temperature and substrate (nutrient) availability, such as pH, moisture and salinity will be investigated in future studies, as well as the factors contributing to the higher fluorene degradation compared to <b>acenaphthene.</b> Furthermore, the structure and toxicity of the by-products and intermediates produced during microbial metabolism of <b>acenaphthene</b> and fluorene should be investigated in further studies...|$|E

40|$|Many {{industrial}} wastewaters are {{contaminated with}} both heavy metal ions and organic compounds, posing {{a major threat}} to public health and the environment. In this study, magnetic nanoparticle adsorbents, namely Mag-PCMA-T, which contain a maghemite core and a silica mesoporous layer that permanently confines surfactant micelles within the mesopores, were synthesized to achieve simultaneous removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (1 mg/L) and metal contaminants (1 mg/L). The individual removal efficiency of Cd(2 +) and <b>acenaphthene</b> using Mag-PCMA-T was evaluated under a range of initial ion concentrations and adsorbent dosages, as well as the competitive adsorption with Cd(2 +) and <b>acenaphthene</b> simultaneously present. The isotherms and kinetics of Cd(2 +) and <b>acenaphthene</b> sorption onto Mag-PCMA-T were determined. Mag-PCMA-T removed > 85 % of the <b>acenaphthene</b> in < 30 min, with relatively high sorption capacity (up to 1060 mg/kg). Mag-PCMA-T also exhibited high sorption capacity for Cd(2 +) (up to 2250 mg/kg). The simultaneous sorption performance was stable across a wide pH range (4 - 9) {{as well as in the}} presence of competitive metal ions (Ca(2 +) and Mg(2 +)) or natural organic matters.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the gas-phase {{oxidation}} of acenaphthylene and <b>acenaphthene</b> by OH radicals and associated secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation under low and high-NOx conditions. Experiments were carried out in an atmospheric simulation chamber using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight-mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) and an aerosol time-of-flight-mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) to chemically characterize the gas- and particle-phase products, respectively. Due to the structures of these two aromatic compounds, the proposed chemical mechanisms exhibit some differences. In the case of <b>acenaphthene,</b> H-atom abstraction from the saturated cyclopenta-fused ring was found to be competitive with the OH-addition to the aromatic rings. During the photooxidation of <b>acenaphthene</b> using nitrous acid (HONO), aromatic ring-opening products such as indanone and indanone carbaldehyde, generated through OH addition to the aromatic ring, were formed in higher yields compared to low-NOx conditions. In the case of acenaphthylene, OH addition to the unsaturated cyclopenta-fused ring was strongly favored. Hence, ring-retaining species such as acenaphthenone and acenaphthenequinone, were identified as the main reaction products in both gas- and particle-phases, especially under high-NOx conditions. Subsequent SOA formation was observed in all experiments and SOA yields were determined under low/high-NOx conditions to be 0. 61 / 0. 46 and 0. 68 / 0. 55 from the OH-initiated oxidation of acenaphthylene and <b>acenaphthene,</b> respectively...|$|E
