5|$|Women's {{health is}} {{positioned}} within a wider {{body of knowledge}} cited by, amongst others, the World Health Organisation, which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health. Women's health is affected not just by their biology, but also by their social conditions, such as poverty, employment, <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 study, did a {{regional}} survey on farmers suicide in rural Vidarbha (Maharashtra) and applied a Smith's Saliency method to qualitatively rank the expressed causes among farming families {{who had lost}} someone to suicide. The expressed reasons in order of importance behind farmer suicides were – debt, alcohol addiction, environment, low produce prices, stress <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> apathy, poor irrigation, increased cost of cultivation, private money lenders, use of chemical fertilizers and crop failure. In other words, debt to stress <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were rated as significantly higher than fertilizers and crop failure. In a different study in the same region in 2006, indebtedness (87%) and deterioration in the economic status (74%) {{were found to be}} major risk factors for suicide.|$|E

2500|$|Polk also {{acted as}} {{commissary}} for the Salisbury district, one of North Carolina's militia recruiting divisions, often using his personal assets and credit to provide {{supplies for the}} Patriot cause. When controversy arose over the propriety of his [...] practices in obtaining supplies and credit, he again resigned, but [...] continued to work with General Greene, who appointed him a brigadier general in early 1781. The North Carolina General Assembly refused to approve the commission and appointed him a [...] "colonel commandant" [...] instead. Polk declined the appointment, citing his age <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On November 5, 1781, Congress elected Hanson as {{president}} of the Continental Congress [...] (or [...] "president of the Congress of the Confederacy" [...] or [...] "president of Congress"). Under the Articles of Confederation, the United States had no executive branch; the president of Congress was a mostly ceremonial position, but the office did require Hanson to handle a good deal of correspondence and sign official documents. Hanson found the work tedious and considered resigning after just one week, citing his poor health <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Colleagues urged him to remain because Congress at the moment lacked a quorum to choose a successor. Out of a sense of duty, Hanson remained in office, [...] although his term as a delegate to Congress was nearly expired. The Maryland Assembly reelected him as a delegate on November 28, 1781, and so Hanson continued to serve {{as president}} until November 4, 1782.|$|E

Writing in 1989, Michael White differentiated between TFA's brand of libertarianism and that of civil liberties campaigners, arguing that: [...] "The unavoidable fact is that TFA represents that ancient tradition of English concepts of freedom, easily traceable to Magna Carta, which see liberty in terms of freedoms from restraints and obligations, not civil rights and duties enunciated by Jefferson in the rebellious American colonies, by Tom Paine and the revolutionaries of 1789".|$|R
40|$|Equity is {{important}} to most individuals and its perceived absence  may impact negatively on individual and organisational performance. The concept of equity presupposes fair treatment, while discrimination implies unfair treatment. The perceptions of discrimination, or being treated unfairly, may result from psycho-social processes, or from data that justifies discrimination and is quantifiable. Objectives: To assess whether differences in post grading and remuneration {{for males and females}} are based on gender, rather than on quantifiable variables that could justify these differences. Method: Biographical information was gathered from 1740 employees representing 29 organisations. The data collected included self-reported post grading (dependent variable) and 14 independent variables, which may predict the employees’ post gradings. The independent variables related primarily to education, tenure <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Results: Males reported higher post gradings and higher salaries than those of females, but the difference was not statistically significant and the practical significance of this difference was slight. Qualification types, job specific training, and membership of professional bodies did not affect post grading along gender lines. The ways in which work experience was measured had no influence on post grading or salary for either males or females. Furthermore, <b>family</b> <b>responsibility,</b> union membership <b>and</b> the type of work the employees performed did not influence the employees’ post grading. The only difference found concerned the unfair treatment of males, particularly those who were well-qualified.   Conclusions: Objective evidence of unfair gender-based discrimination affecting post grading and salary is scarce, and the few differences that do occur have little statistical and practical significance. Perceptions of being discriminated against may therefore more often be seen as the result of psycho-social processes and are not necessarily the result of justifiable differences in education, tenure <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>responsibility...</b>|$|R
