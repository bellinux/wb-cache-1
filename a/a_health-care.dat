When Pau was born, his family was living in Cornellà, but {{he was born in}} Barcelona, at Sant Pau Hospital, where both of his parents worked. When he was 6 years old, his family moved to another Barcelona suburb, Sant Boi de Llobregat, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his childhood. His parents moved to the Memphis suburb of Germantown, Tennessee, after he signed with the Grizzlies, and enrolled his younger brothers Marc and Adrià in Lausanne Collegiate School in Memphis. They planned to move to the Los Angeles area when Pau was traded to the Lakers, with Agustí accepting a job with <b>a</b> <b>health-care</b> company in that area; although the Grizzlies obtained the rights to Marc's services as part of the trade, he was expected to re-sign with his Spanish team Akasvayu Girona. However, when Marc decided to sign with the Grizzlies, their parents chose to stay in Germantown. Agustí now works from home for the same company, while Marisa now volunteers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Hormones can be {{administered}} {{in a variety}} of ways, including percutaneous skin and vaginal creams, oral pills, topical gels, vaginal rings and tablets, and transdermal patches. Though all preparations of a given type of estrogen (e.g. estradiol) may be molecularly identical before their introduction into the human body, estrogens administered orally are modified by the liver before entering the bloodstream and in this process, most is converted to estrone. However, estrogen bypassing the digestive tract and liver and entering through the skin is not converted to a new form before entering the bloodstream. Creams and gels applied to the skin also enter the blood directly and without modification but absorption of the gels, creams, and patches can vary from application to application, depending on the temperature and condition of the skin. Pharmaceutical compounding is frequently used to modify the dose, form, and additives of the preparations, based on instructions from <b>a</b> <b>health-care</b> practitioner.|$|E

Although we have become aware of the growing importance of economic issues in medicine, economic evaluations in care pathways have remained up to now rather limited. Even if we agree with the author that there is an urgent need for economic evaluations in health service interventions, we fear that this paper contains methodological flaws which may mislead the reader of the journal, as well as potential users of economic evaluations...|$|R
