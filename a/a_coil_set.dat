40|$|Magnetic {{torquing}} {{is attractive}} {{as a control}} principle on small satellites. The actuation principle {{is to use the}} interaction between the earth's magnetic field and magnetic field generated by <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>set</b> in the satellite. This control principle is inherently nonlinear, and difficult to use because control torques can only be generated perpendicular to the geomagnetic field vector. This has been a serious obstacle for using magnetorquer based control for three-axis attitude control. This paper considers the problem from time-varying, nonlinear system point of view and suggests a new controller which is shown to be globally stable. A rigorous stability analysis is presented, and simulation results show convincing performance over the entire envelope of operation. Keywords: Attitude control, satellite control, time-varying systems, periodic motion, Lyapunov stability, quaternion feedback. 1 INTRODUCTION Several control methods have been developed over the past years since the first sat [...] ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of stellarators, both helical and modular, is that their <b>coil</b> <b>sets</b> must take difficult shapes {{in order to produce}} the complicated stellarator magnetic fields.

40|$|An {{experimental}} program underway at Caltech {{has produced}} plasmas where the shape is neither fixed by the vacuum chamber nor fixed by <b>an</b> external <b>coil</b> <b>set,</b> but instead {{is determined by}} self-organization. The plasma dynamics is highly reproducible and so can be studied in considerable detail even though the morphology of the plasma is both complex and time-dependent. A surprising result has been the observation that self-collimating MHD-driven plasma jets are ubiquitous and play {{a fundamental role in}} the self-organization. The jets can be considered lab-scale simulations of astrophysical jets and in addition are intimately related to solar coronal loops. The jets are driven by the combination of the axial component of the J×B force and the axial pressure gradient resulting from the non-uniform pinch force associated with the flared axial current density. Behavior is consistent with a model showing that collimation results from axial non-uniformity of the jet velocity. In particular, flow stagnation in the jet frame compresses frozen-in azimuthal magnetic flux, squeezes together toroidal magnetic field lines, thereby amplifying the embedded toroidal magnetic field, enhancing the pinch force, and hence causing collimation of the jet...|$|R

Fast energy transients, {{incident}} on the DIII-D divertors due to Type-I edge localized modes (ELMs), are eliminated using small dc currents {{in a simple}} <b>set</b> of non-axisymmetric <b>coils</b> that produce edge resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). In ITER similar shaped (ISS) plasmas, with electron pedestal collisionalities matched to those expected in ITER a sharp resonant window in the safety factor at the 95 percent normalized poloidal flux surface is observed for ELM suppression at q 95 = 3. 57 with a minimum width �q 95 of ± 0. 05.

These systems proved their robustness over the years. As a replacement for the old system, off-the-shelf products were used to ensure continuity, reliability and to reduce the development cost. To provide advanced control scenarios, the new system allows the implementation of more sophisticated algorithms for magnetic and kinetic control. The LabVIEW Real-Time (RT) modules and real-time hardware from National Instruments satisfy these requirements to a large extent. The new system has already been successfully commissioned at TEXTOR and {{is used to calculate}} in real-time the plasma density profile (10 ms), the Shafranov shift (10 ms), the plasma vertical and horizontal position (20 mu s) and to control the plasma shape (1 ms).

40|$|Activation of {{the cardiac}} muscle is {{associated}} with ion transport through the membrane of the cardiac cell. This {{gives rise to the}} strongest electrophysiological signals in human body: the cardiograms. Segments of the cardiogram are related to the contraction of the hearts chambers. In fetal magnetocardiography, the magnetic field of a fetal heart is recorded {{in the vicinity of the}} maternal abdomen. This magnetic field, however, is extremely weak and can only be recorded by means of Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). To reach the superconducting state the SQUIDs are cooled to about - 270 oC. Typically, fetal magnetocardiograms are recorded inside magnetically shielded rooms in order to reduce the influence of the environmental magnetic interference. As an alternative to magnetic shielding, higher-order gradiometers can be used. Ideally, a higher-order gradiometer is insensitive to the lower-order gradients of the magnetic field that originate from relatively remote noise sources. In practice, however, it is difficult to manufacture a gradiometer such that its sensitivity to these lower-order gradients is eliminated completely. The residual sensitivity to the lower-order gradients is referred to as imbalance. Balancing a gradiometer reduces imbalance and, thus, improves the environmental interference suppression. The objective of the work presented in this thesis is to design a highly-balanced higherorder gradiometer that enables measurements of fetal magnetocardiograms in unshielded environment. This includes optimization of the geometry of the gradiometer with respect to signal-to-noise ratio, design of <b>a</b> magnetic <b>coils</b> <b>set</b> for gradiometer balancing and gradiometer balancing experiments...|$|R

These generalist instruments are large, typically having a bore of 0. 9 - 1. 0 m and a length of 1. 7 - 2. 5 m and therefore are expensive to site, somewhat claustrophobic to the patient, and offer little access by attending physicians.
