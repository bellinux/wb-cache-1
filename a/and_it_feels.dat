Abby Konowitch from Cyrus' label Hollywood Records admitted that the record drew more inspiration from dance-pop music than she originally intended, but maintained that it [...] "feels very comfortable for her, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> very comfortable {{in terms of the}} state of contemporary music." ...|$|E

Steve Mullen praised the episode not only for the Michael/Dwight war, but also for smaller moments like the cheese puff tosses and the messages Pam and Ryan wrote on a clipboard for Michael during his phone call; Mullen said, [...] "I'm not sure any other 30 minute comedy currently on TV can even touch The Office." [...] Amy Stetts of The Express-Times said the Michael Scott Paper Company plot [...] "peaked" [...] with this episode, and she genuinely could not predict how the storyline would end.|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, it was {{identified}} that Morison was eligible to represent Wales due to Welsh ancestry – as his grandmother {{was born in}} Tredegar, near Ebbw Vale. Wales assistant manager Roy Evans was present to watch Morison in Millwall's 1–0 victory against Swindon Town, while Morison [...] "registered his interest" [...] in representing Wales. In July 2010, Wales boss John Toshack named Morison in the Wales squad for a friendly against Luxembourg in Llanelli on 11 August 2010.

500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered different {{interpretations of the}} music video and its story line. Allen Metz, {{one of the authors}} of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, noted that when Madonna enters the church at the beginning of the clip, the line [...] "I hear you call my name, <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like.... Home" [...] is played. The women of Italian East Harlem in New York call their Church as la casa di momma (Momma's House). In that respect, Metz believed that Madonna alluded herself to be one from Harlem, but also refers herself as divinity returning to the Church. This divine aspect is further explored by Nicholas B. Dirks, author of Culture/power/history, who argued that Madonna falling into a dream is the most important point of the narrative as it signified that [...] "Madonna is really not putting herself in place of the redeemer, but imagining herself as one." ...|$|E

In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com, Max stated that performance was [...] "the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy". After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring. Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he said all the songs were ready when he had only finished one. He added, [...] "It was one of those good lies. Everything rolled from there.

500|$|On 20 May 2012, York regained their Football League {{status with}} {{promotion}} to League Two after a 2–1 win over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. Luton {{took the lead}} when Andre Gray scored in the second minute, before Chambers scored the equaliser on 26 minutes with a low shot from a Smith hooked cross. The winner came two minutes into the second half after Blair, despite being in an offside position, scored from close range after latching onto Parslow's header. After the match, Blair {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I scored the goal <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> unbelievable but I'm not taking anything away from the other lads today. The back five, and Daniel Parslow in front, defended like heroes and were brilliant all game". Mills summarised York's achievements by saying [...] "To come to Wembley Stadium two weeks running and do the double is an incredible feeling. In fact, with the ground announcement, it's been a terrific treble and probably the best hat-trick ever at York City Football Club".|$|E
500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing things differently, and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as hard as they can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so we knew the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{of all four}} classes appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Tréluyer was delighted with the victory, saying: [...] "What a race, It was a tough lights-to-flag job, just like at Silverstone, but it was huge fun and we’re already looking forward to Le Mans." [...] He further stated: [...] "We did it and I am very happy for the team {{because we had a}} really strong weekend <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> great to win in this fashion." [...] Lotterer said of the result: [...] "It's no holds barred all the time and is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track." [...] Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with Tréluyer was [...] "great" [...] and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had [...] "too many own goals" [...] and that they did not wanted to be [...] "gifted results" [...] if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium.|$|E
500|$|Caroline Bansal from musicOMH gave a mixed {{review for}} the song, {{feeling that the}} singer's vocals over the Spanish guitar was monotonous. She felt that the chorus was more melodic {{but it was the}} lyrics and the dance beats which did not {{complete}} the track. Bansal said that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] could have been composed better. Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine wrote that [...] "Love Profusion", along with the song [...] "Intervention", [...] "address Madonna's marriage to director Guy Ritchie", and [...] "find the once-cynical pop star surprisingly open and emotional, which prompts her to spit out cliché after cliché as she tells us how happy she is". Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was the most straight forward dance track on the album. He added that [...] "this is one of those [...] which could become a favorite <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like a classic upbeat Madonna song. It fuses the message behind the song American Life with Mirwais' beats and acoustic elements really well". Sean O'Brien from The People complimented the song for its [...] "great melody and acoustic guitar flavor to it", and deduced {{that it would be a}} hit in the night clubs. Dan Gennoe from Dotmusic website gave a positive review of the track, calling [...] "Love Profusion", along with [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process" [...] from American Life, [...] "gracious" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] songs. In 2012, website AfterElton.com listed [...] "Love Profusion" [...] at number91 on their list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs".|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona.

500|$|Mystic Quest was {{developed}} in a graphic and gameplay style similar to Final Fantasy Legend III (part of the aforementioned SaGa series). The gameplay shares numerous similarities with that title, featuring a very similar battle system, graphical interface, and dungeon system. Even the jump feature from Final Fantasy Legend III has been reproduced, {{and almost all of}} the icons - from caves to the enemy sprites - are a color-upgraded version of Final Fantasy Legend IIIs character set. Besides allowing for computer-controlled allies, the game did away with random battles, complicated storylines, and text-based menus. To appeal to the perceived tastes of North American audiences, which gravitated towards fast-paced games, Square included action-adventure game elements; players could now brandish weapons outside of battle, jump, use a grappling hook, and set bombs to open new paths. North American translator Ted Woolsey explained that [...] "The action/adventure players...are larger in numbers and the demographic is different. They tend to be younger and like the idea of jumping straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it's an empowerment issue - you get to go out there, start whacking things <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> good! With the more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing before you're finally hooked." [...] Woolsey stated that Mystic Quest was one of the easiest games he had to translate, due to the game's small size. Because the game was marketed towards a younger demographic, the game sold for US$39.99. Mystic Quest also came with an Official Strategy Guide that helped inexperienced and new RPG players complete it.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said, [...] "The movie's being promoted as the third in the director's unofficial trilogy of faith, after The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like a self-conscious masterpiece, a summing-up from a filmmaker who, at 74, may be thinking of his legacy." [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese has hit the rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's {{the kind of work}} a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he’s as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese’s career." ...|$|E

Many television critics agreed that [...] "Trivia" [...] was a marked improvement over many of the episodes {{in the first part}} of the season. Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, [...] "Aside from a few weak moments, 'Trivia' was a solid episode of The Office and a vast improvement over most of the episodes this season." [...] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, [...] "When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I’ll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative." [...] Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that [...] "If you plan to continue watching The Office, here’s my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot." [...] He concluded that [...] "The Office is not irreparable. It’s not great either, but there is some marked improvement here over the worst episodes from the first half of the season." [...] Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar.com wrote positively on both the trivia A-plot and the Dwight and Robert B-plot. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella called the trivia conceit [...] "quite fun" [...] and awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars.

[...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode [...] "charming." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled [...] "The Quiz", writing that [...] "while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common." [...] She did, however, positively write about the humor of the episode, noting that, [...] "the writers squeezed some good laughs out of the idea, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> good to be laughing again at The Office." ...|$|E
