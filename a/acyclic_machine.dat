40|$|One of {{the main}} {{restrictions}} in scheduling problems are the machine (resource) restrictions: each machine can perform at most one job at a time. We explore machine dependencies is shop scheduling problems representing them as graphs. Our study shows that the structure of machine dependency graphs {{is important in the}} complexity analysis of shop scheduling problems. We call acyclic a shop scheduling problem with the <b>acyclic</b> <b>machine</b> dependency graph. Here we first consider the periodic jobshop scheduling problem and present a linear-time algorithm for its subclass which machine dependency graphs are allowed to have only simple so-called parti-colored cycles. This result is tight as the trivial extension of the problem becomes NP-hard. We show that the acyclic preemptive open-shop problem with at most m − 2 preemptions can be solved in linear time. This result is also tight as the same problem with at most m − 3 preemptions is NP-hard. We also show that very simple acyclic shop scheduling problems are NP-hard; for example, any flow-shop with a single job with three operations {{and the rest of the}} jobs with a single non-zero length operation is NP-hard. Key words: algorithm, shop scheduling, NP-hardness, machine dependency grap...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. " Superconductors are {{materials}} which exhibit zero {{electrical resistance}} at temperatures near absolute zero, sup orting current 2 *" densities {{in the order}} of 100, 000 amperes per cm in the fila-mentary wire form. When wound into magnets, helium cooled super-conductors provide the compact, high flux source necessary for small, efficient electric machines. In ship drive applications, the use of high-power density superconductive generators and motors provide great flexibility of arrangement and of operation. These advantages are illustrated in advanced displacement and surface effect ship hulls with size and performance estimates based on NSRDC d-c machine developments. A recently completed <b>acyclic</b> <b>machine,</b> with a unique magnet-shield configuration de-signed to maximize flux utilization and power density, is de-scribed. The 51 cm (20 inch) diameter unit, now under evalua-tion, is expected to demonstrate more than 5000 hp per cubic meter at propulsion motor speeds. The machine includes a station-ary, niobium titanium wire, solenoidal magnet surrounded by a 1010 steel magnetic shield. Rotor and stator copper drum conductors, series connected through liquid metal brushes, operate in the magnet/shield annulus. Initial motor operation indicated that *Abbreviations used in this paper are from the GPO Style Manual, 1973, unless otherwise noted. 1 the high-efficiency, high-power density, low stray magnetic field, and small diameter requirements of full-scale naval ship drives can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{of ships}} has experienced steady expansion for several decades. Since the early 20 th century, icebreakers have employed the flexibility and easy control of direct current (dc) motors {{to provide for}} ship operations that split ice with {{back and forth motion}} of the ship. More recently, cruise ships have employed diesel-electric propulsion systems {{to take advantage of the}} flexibility of diesel, as opposed to steam engines, and because the electric plant can also be used for hotel loads. Research vessels, ferries, tankers, and special purpose vessels have also taken advantage of increased flexibility and fuel efficiency with electric propulsion. Today, the U. S. Navy is building an “all electric” destroyer to be named “Zumwalt,” which employs two induction motors for propulsion. There are several different classes of motors that might be considered for use in ship propulsion, ranging from dc (commutator) motors through conventional induction and synchronous motors to permanent magnet synchronous machines, doubly fed machines and superconducting alternating current (ac) and <b>acyclic</b> homopolar <b>machines.</b> This review paper describes features of some of the major classes of motor that might be used in ship propulsion...|$|R
30|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} (AI)-based {{fault diagnosis}} techniques {{have been widely}} studied, and have succeeded in many applications of electrical machines and drives [9, 10]. For example, a two-stage learning method including sparse filtering and neural network was proposed to form an intelligent fault diagnosis method to learn features from raw signals [11]. The feed-forward neural network using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm showed {{a new way to}} detect and diagnose induction machine faults [12], where the results were not affected by the load condition and the fault types. In another study, a special structure of support vector machine (SVM) was proposed, which combined Directed <b>Acyclic</b> Graph-Support Vector <b>Machine</b> (DAG-SVM) with recursive undecimated wavelet packet transform, for inspection of broken rotor bar fault in induction motors [13]. Fuzzy system and Bayesian theory were utilized in machine health monitoring in Ref. [14]. Although these studies have shown the advantages of AI-based approaches for induction motor fault diagnosis, most of these approaches are based on supervised learning, in which high quality training data with good coverage of true failure conditions are required to perform model training [15]. However, {{it is not easy to}} obtain sufficient labelled fault data to train the model in practice.|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} several {{simple but}} powerful concepts, techniques, and results; {{and we use}} them to characterize the complexities {{of a number of}} basic problems II, that arise in the analysis and verification of the following models M of communicating automata and discrete dynamical systems: systems of communicating automata including both finite and infinite cellular automata, transition systems, discrete dynamical systems, and succinctly-specified finite automata. These concepts, techniques, and results are centered on the following: (1) reductions Of STATE-REACHABILITY problems, especially for very simple systems of communicating copies of a single simple finite automaton, (2) reductions of generalized CNF satisfiability problems [Sc 78], especially to very simple communicating systems of copies of a few basic <b>acyclic</b> finite sequential <b>machines,</b> and (3) reductions of the EMPTINESS and EMPTINESS-OF-INTERSECTION problems, for several kinds of regular set descriptors. For systems of communicating automata and transition systems, the problems studied include: all equivalence relations and simulation preorders in the Linear-time/Branching-time hierarchies of equivalence relations and simulation preorders of [vG 90, vG 93], both without and with the hiding abstraction. For discrete dynamical systems, the problems studied include the INITIAL and BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS (denoted IVPs and BVPs, respectively), for nonlinear difference equations over many different algebraic structures, e. g. all unitary rings, all finite unitary semirings, and all lattices. For succinctly specified finite automata, the problems studied also include the several problems studied in [AY 98], e. g. the EMPTINESS, EMPTINESS-OF-INTERSECTION, EQUIVALENCE and CONTAINMENT problems. The concepts, techniques, and results presented unify and significantly extend many of the known results in the literature, e. g. [Wo 86, Gu 89, BPT 91, GM 92, Ra 92, HT 94, SH+ 96, AY 98, AKY 99, RH 93, SM 73, Hu 73, HRS 76, HR 78], for communicating automata including both finite and infinite cellular automata and for finite automata specified by special kinds of context-free grammars, by regular operations augmented with squaring and intersection, and specified succinctly as in [AY 98, AKY 99]. Moreover, our development of these concepts, techniques, and results shows how several ideas, techniques, and results, for the individual models M above can be extended to apply to all or to most of these models. As one example of this and paraphrasing [BPTBl], we show that most of these models M exhibit computationally-intractable sensitive dependence on initial conditions, for the same reason. These computationally-intractable sensitivities range from PSPACE-hard to undecidable...|$|R
