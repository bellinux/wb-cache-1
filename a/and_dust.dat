5|$|An {{innovative}} {{drilling and}} blasting technique called Penetrating Cone Fracture (PCF) {{was used in}} the remedial works process. PCF was chosen over conventional drilling and/or blasting techniques due to the reduced risk of damage to the existing structure from vibration, as well as lower noxious fume <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{tidal force}} from Jupiter and Amalthea's low density and {{irregular}} shape, the escape velocity at its surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter {{is no more}} than 1 m/s <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> can easily escape from it after, e.g. micrometeorite impacts; this dust forms the Amalthea Gossamer Ring.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere on the peninsula, Cyclone Gonu's waves {{damaged the}} port in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates. In 1995 {{and again in}} 1996, the {{remnants}} of a storm that hit Oman entered Rub' al Khali, or the Empty Quarter, of Saudi Arabia. In 2008, {{the remnants of a}} storm that hit Yemen brought rainfall <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> storms to Saudi Arabia and Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> that formed the cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational aggregations {{clustered}} into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, {{organizations of}} gas <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> merged {{to form the}} first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into groups and clusters of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.|$|E

5|$|Interactions between {{galaxies are}} {{relatively}} frequent, {{and they can}} {{play an important role in}} galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange of gas <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meso{{cyclones}}, tornadoes <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> devils {{lie within}} the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without {{the presence of}} a surface low, and can pinch off {{from the base of the}} tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747-200 {{registration}} G-BDXH, {{flew through}} {{a cloud of}} volcanic ash <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. The ash <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines. The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had {{to be shut down}} again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched {{to such an extent that}} it was difficult for the pilots to see out of the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport just outside Jakarta. There were no fatalities or injuries.|$|E

5|$|Present weather, which present {{restrictions}} to visibility or {{presence of}} thunder or squalls, {{are reported in}} observations to indicate to aviation any possible threats during landings and takeoffs from airports.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{globular}} clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters {{have now been}} discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 Â± 20. These additional, undiscovered globular clusters {{are believed to be}} hidden behind the gas <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|When Bakshi was 18, {{his friend}} Cosmo Anzilotti {{was hired by}} the cartoon studio Terrytoons; Anzilotti {{recommended}} Bakshi to the studio's production manager, Frank Schudde. Bakshi was hired as a cel polisher and commuted four hours each day to the studio, based in suburban New Rochelle. His low-level position required Bakshi to carefully remove dirt <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> from animation cels.|$|E

5|$|After scalemaker Saxton {{left the}} Mint Service in 1844, {{much of the}} work of {{maintaining}} and modifying the sensitive balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale. The Chief Coiner made a number of improvements to the scales, which he wrote up for an article in the Journal of The Franklin Institute in 1847. These balances, sensitive to , were protected by plate glass from air currents <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem's {{average annual}} {{relative}} humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels {{are at their}} lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city {{is influenced by the}} Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b> Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
