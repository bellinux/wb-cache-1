5|$|To {{counteract}} these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous <b>antioxidant</b> systems, including <b>antioxidant</b> vitamins such as vitamin C {{and vitamin}} E, and <b>antioxidant</b> enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting {{damage to the}} cell.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of <b>antioxidant</b> enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with <b>antioxidant</b> metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to <b>antioxidant</b> defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one <b>antioxidant</b> enzyme can be informative.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antioxidants</b> {{are often}} used as {{preservatives}} in fat-containing foods to delay the onset or slow the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural <b>antioxidants</b> include ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E). Synthetic <b>antioxidants</b> include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), TBHQ, propyl gallate and ethoxyquin. The natural <b>antioxidants</b> tend to be short-lived, so synthetic <b>antioxidants</b> are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble <b>antioxidants</b> is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free radicals that travel through the aqueous parts of foods. A combination of water-soluble and fat-soluble <b>antioxidants</b> is ideal, usually in the ratio of fat to water.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{concerns with}} {{the occurrence of}} <b>antioxidants</b> in foods, the possibilities of their applications in nutrition and population awareness on the topic <b>antioxidants.</b> The theoretical part describes the types of <b>antioxidants,</b> effects on human health and occurrence in foods and their recommended daily dosage.

5|$|The {{relative}} importance and interactions between these different antioxidants {{is a very}} complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one <b>antioxidant</b> may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the <b>antioxidant</b> system. The amount of protection provided by any one <b>antioxidant</b> will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.|$|E
5|$|Uric acid has {{the highest}} {{concentration}} of any blood <b>antioxidant</b> and provides {{over half of the}} total <b>antioxidant</b> capacity of human serum. Uric acid's <b>antioxidant</b> activities are also complex, given that it does not react with some oxidants, such as superoxide, but does act against peroxynitrite, peroxides, and hypochlorous acid. Concerns over elevated UA's contribution to gout must be considered as one of many risk factors. By itself, UA-related risk of gout at high levels (415–530 μmol/L) is only 0.5% per year with an increase to 4.5% per year at UA supersaturation levels (535+ μmol/L). Many of these aforementioned studies determined UA's <b>antioxidant</b> actions within normal physiological levels, and some found <b>antioxidant</b> activity at levels as high as 285 μmol/L.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Antioxidants</b> {{are among}} the most popular health-protecting products, sold {{worldwide}} without prescription. Indeed, there are many reports showing the benefits of <b>antioxidants</b> but only a few questioning the possible harmful effects of these ―drugs‖. The normal balance between <b>antioxidants</b> and free radicals in the body is offset when either of these forces prevails. The available evidence on the harmful effects of <b>antioxidants</b> is analyzed in this review. In summary, a hypothesis is presented that ―antioxidant-induced stress ‖ results when <b>antioxidants</b> overwhelm the body’s free radicals...|$|R

5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, <b>antioxidant</b> activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines.

40|$|Motivation [...] Quantitative {{in vitro}} studies of the <b>antioxidants</b> and the {{inhibition}} of autooxidation by various <b>antioxidants</b> have been performed under aerobic conditions and hence, appeared to be critically reviewed, because the effectiveness of <b>antioxidants</b> {{was not related to}} that of biological system. Since the biological system is in lower oxygen tension, the effectiveness of <b>antioxidants</b> may be considerably different between nonbiological and biological conditions. To clarify this points, we evaluated here the efficiency of natural and synthetic <b>antioxidants</b> and free-radical scavengers by the induction period method, under nearly unaerobic conditions Method. Polymerization of methyl methacrylate in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>antioxidants</b> was carried out by BPO or AIBN at 70 using a DSC.

Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) <b>antioxidant.</b>|$|E

40|$|Despite recent {{comprehensive}} review articles concluding that supplemental <b>antioxidants</b> do not undermine the effective-ness of cytotoxic therapies, {{the use of}} <b>antioxidants</b> during cancer treatment remains controversial. Many oncologists take the position that <b>antioxidants</b> by their nature undermine the free radical mechanism of chemotherapy and radiother-apy and should therefore generally be avoided during treat-ment. For their part, many integrative practitioners believe that <b>antioxidants</b> taken during cancer treatment not only alle-viate some of the adverse effects of that treatment but also enhance the efficacy of cancer therapy. Until recently, research attention has focused primarily on the interaction of <b>antioxidants</b> with chemotherapy; relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the interaction of <b>antioxidants</b> with radiother-apy. This article reviews the clinical literature that has addressed whether <b>antioxidants</b> do in fact interfere with radi-ation therapy. Studies have variously investigated the use of α-tocopherol for the amelioration of radiation-induced mucositis; pentoxifylline and vitamin E to correct the adverse effects of radiotherapy; melatonin alongside radiotherapy in the treatment of brain cancer; retinol palmitate as a treat-ment for radiation-induced proctopathy; a combination of <b>antioxidants</b> (and other naturopathic treatments) and exter-nal beam radiation therapy as definitive treatment for prostate cancer; and the use of synthetic <b>antioxidants,</b> ami-fostine, dexrazoxane, and mesna as radioprotectants. With few exceptions, most of the studies draw positive conclusions about the interaction of <b>antioxidants</b> and radiotherapy. Although further studies are needed, the preponderance of evidence supports a provisional conclusion that dietary <b>antioxidants</b> do not conflict with the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers and may signifi-cantly mitigate the adverse effects of that treatment...|$|R
