5000|$|Sometimes {{the terms}} [...] "longeron" [...] and [...] "stringer" [...] are used interchangeably. Historically, though, {{there is a}} subtle {{difference}} between the two terms. If the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> in a fuselage are few in number and run all along the fuselage length (usually 4 to 8), then they are called [...] "longerons". The longeron system also requires that the fuselage frames be closely spaced (about every 4 to 6 in). If the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> are numerous (usually 50 to 100) and are placed just between two formers/frames, then they are called [...] "stringers". In the stringer system the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> are smaller and the frames are spaced farther apart (about 15 to 20 in). Generally, longerons are of larger cross-section when compared to stringers. On large modern aircraft the stringer system is more common because it is more weight-efficient, despite being more complex to construct and analyze. Some aircraft use a combination of both stringers and longerons.|$|R

50|$|The {{body of the}} Macfie {{monoplane}} comprised an uncovered V-section framework made of ash wood, {{in which}} three <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> were braced together at intervals of approximately 2 ft. (0.61 m) by wooden struts. The framework was approximately 3 ft. (0.91 m) in height at the forward end, tapering to 1 ft. (0.30 m) at the tail; likewise {{the width of the}} frame tapered from approx. 2 ft. 6 in. (0.76 m) at the front to 1 ft at the tail. The lowest <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member,</b> at the point of the V-section, was approximately parallel to the ground when at rest, so that the two upper members sloped gradually from front to rear.|$|R

It {{comprised}} a transverse trunnion box {{member at the}} front, from which six <b>longitudinal</b> tube <b>members</b> ran aftward and converged into one large main central tube at the rear; the six <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> were braced vertically and horizontally by smaller-gauge tubes. The rear central tube member supported a large horizontal-plane turntable. A steerable front truck was installed just behind the trunnion box member, while the turntable surmounted a two-axle rear bogey.|$|R

50|$|The kelson or keelson is {{the member}} which, {{particularly}} in a wooden vessel, lies parallel with its keel but above the transverse members such as timbers, frames or in a larger vessel, floors.

50|$|Longitudinal framing (also {{called the}} Isherwood system after British naval {{architect}} Sir Joseph Isherwood, who patented it in 1906) {{is a method}} of ship construction in which large, widely spaced transverse frames are {{used in conjunction with}} light, closely spaced <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members.</b> This method, Isherwood felt, lent a ship much greater longitudinal strength than in ships built in the traditional method, where a series of transverse frames were fit together closely from the keel upwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} displacement {{was increased}} from around 1350 tons (classes A to I) to around 1700 tons, length by 30 feet (9 m) {{to more than}} 355. The engine room layout was made more compact, despite vulnerability to complete engine failure by a single well-placed hit. The basic strength of these ships was derived through <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> instead of the earlier transverse ones.

However, in 1927 the centre of gravity was lowered {{as a result of}} a switch to an “underslung” chassis which left the axles directly above the <b>longitudinal</b> chassis <b>members,</b> whereas earlier car had applied the “Hochbett” overslung chassis layout whereby the <b>longitudinal</b> chassis <b>members</b> were attached directly above the axles.|$|R

Patented in 1848 by its designers James Warren and Willoughby Theobald Monzani, its structure consists of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along its length, ensuring that no individual strut, beam, or tie is subject to bending or torsional straining forces, but only to tension or compression. It is an improvement over the Neville truss which uses a spacing configuration of isosceles triangles.|$|R

50|$|The {{transformation}} {{is made possible}} by a centrally located electric motor, which stretches the vehicle with the help of two mechanical screw-and-nut gears by exactly 746 millimetres to its full extended length of 3.74 metres. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> run on low-friction precision rollers and disappear like a drawer {{in the rear of the}} floor pan. Despite its variable length the engineers succeeded in designing the adjustable floor pan with the torsional rigidity necessary for a roadster.

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{body was}} a cowl unit design, consisting of structural <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members,</b> with cross stretchers forming the supports for the internal equipment including the engine-generator. The locomotive superstructure was mechanically {{separated from the}} load bearing structures by pivots {{at either end of}} the body and incorporated roof doors for access to the diesel engine. The driving cabs incorporating nose sections were also separate structures; each cab was accessible from the other via an inner walkway, and passage between locomotives was enabled by end corridor connections. Each cab 'nose' contained a traction motor cooling fan, and an air compressor.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{design work}} on the PD2 had started during wartime under the working title [...] "9.8-litre TD9" [...] {{it was much more}} than a PD1 with a bigger engine, the frame was {{completely}} redesigned, with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> carefully graded in depth so that no part was overstressed nor over-engineered. The 600 was fitted into the chassis on a three-point flexible mounting and after a larger clutch unit the new gearbox which still had helical gear trains in second and third now also had synchromesh operation on all but first and reverse, a pioneering feature in a full-size production British bus chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} shear flow is {{particularly}} useful when analyzing semi-monocoque structures, {{which can be}} idealized using the skin-stringer model. In this model, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members,</b> or stringers, carry only axial stress, while the skin or web resists the externally applied torsion and shear force. In this case, since the skin is a thin-walled structure, the internal shear stresses in the skin can be represented as shear flow. In design, the shear flow is sometimes known before the skin thickness is determined, {{in which case the}} skin thickness can simply be sized according to allowable shear stress.|$|R

The observers cockpit was between the wings and less deep. The air-cooled 70 hp (52 kW) Renault engine was uncowled and drove a four-bladed propeller. The single-axle undercarriage was attached to two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> which ran forward to serve as anti-nose-over skids, fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of robust struts.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop mathematical tools for the reliability assessment of ship hulls subjected to the degrading effect of corrosion and of fatigue on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members.</b> The effect of corrosion {{is presented as a}} time dependent process with two states. In the first one, there is no corrosion due to existence of coating protection. Upon failure of the protection system general corrosion decreases plate thickness and affects the midship section modulus. The potential cracks are considered to occur in the connections between longitudinal stiffeners and transverse web frames. The model accounts for the crack growth process applying linear elastic fracture mechanics. It is considered that a ship hull girder is subjected to the simultaneous action of corrosion and of fatigue in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members.</b> The effect of both phenomena on the section modulus is accounted for and it is used as the reference variable to measure the reliability of the ship hull against collapse. The effect of maintenance actions is modelled as a stochastic process and it is accounted for considering that the repaired elements are restored to a state as new. Different repair policies are studied and the approach {{can be used as a}} tool to plan the maintenance action based on reliability resultsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
