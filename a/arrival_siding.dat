The departure and arrival lounges are currently apart from each other, but plans are to connect them by 2015 with airbridges. Lights must be placed on the departure side of the runway, and the platform should be expanded to accommodate more planes. The fire department barracks will be moved to a more central location.

5000|$|Nottingham Carrington Street {{railway station}} {{was the first}} railway station in Nottingham, opened in 1839 by the Midland Counties Railway. Initially there were two lines with a central {{platform}} as well as side ones according to Billson. [...] Victorian civil engineer Francis Whishaw described the station as:"The elevation next to the road to Nottingham is of plain but neat design. It consists of a central portion and two wings; the central portion contains the entrance hall, which is of the whole height of the building. In the right wing is the booking office for first and second class passengers, with windows (looking to the hall) at which the passengers receive their tickets; the third class passengers obtain their tickets at a counter fixed in the hall. In the left-wing is the boardroom and clerks offices; and in a building projecting towards the passenger shed in the rear is a waiting room for ladies.The train shed {{is covered with a}} light iron roof in two spans, which is supported on the departure side by a brick wall, in which there are eight windows; and on the <b>arrival</b> <b>side,</b> and along the middle line, by two rows of cast iron columns, nine in each row."However, Whishaw in 1840 writes the station had grown to four lines. As was usual in those days there were [...] "as many turntables without the shed; the cross line intersecting which communicates with the carriage wharf or landing, which is on the arrival side". This arrangement would probably be similar to that at Derby, allowing coaches to be manhandled between tracks to form trains.On the north side the station was next to the canal and a small warehouse allowed for transshipment of cargoes between the canal and railway. The original gateposts to the yard and the bridge under the towpath still survive.|$|R

40|$|In {{the humid}} tropics of SE-Asia the last primary forests are dwindling at an {{alarming}} rate. In many regions cultivated and degraded land outnumbers by far natural ecosystems. In the upland of Leyte island {{this is due to}} commercial and illegal logging activities and intensive slash-and-burn agriculture. The loss of the natural vegetation cover is accompanied by a decrease in diversity of fauna and flora, consequently also in ecosystem services and interactions, thus destabilizing the system and finally leading to degradation. To further preserve and restore natural biodiversity landscapes dominated by man need to be included in an overall research strategy. So far only few studies focus on the biodiversity of cleared and converted land adjacent to natural areas in the tropics. This study was conducted in a Philippine upland area and focused on interchanges of insects between the natural and the managed landscape. Two questions were approached. (1) Which structures and components of the cultural landscape are of significance for conserving arthropod biodiversity, and (2) are there species which originate from the natural forest and are able to become resident in the man-made systems? In order to answer these questions insect- and plant surveys as well as the movement patterns of selected insect species were examined along a gradient from the natural forest through the agricultural land. So as to define the effects of habitat destruction on the arthropod community of the research area arthropod communities of different habitats between the natural and agricultural ecosystems with increasing distance to the forest, in relation to the vegetation were compared. Insect sampling was carried out using modified Malaise traps, whereby four habitats were considered: (a) forest interior, (b) forest margin, (c) vegetable fields and (d) chayote ((Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw. (Cucurbitaceae); the only perennial vegetable of the area) fields. These traps allowed a separate catch for each of the two <b>arrival</b> <b>sides,</b> whereby the one was always opened to the forest and the other to the field. Trapping was set up for a total of 18 months in 2001 and 2002 at three sites with the four habitats each. Arthropod diversity, composition of the arthropod community and trophic guild composition at habitats were determined for each habitat and <b>arrival</b> <b>side.</b> Obtained results are presented and discussed with regard to first: arthropod diversity and community composition along the transect from natural through agricultural systems; second: abundance patterns of selected species in natural and agricultural systems and third: abundance patterns of selected species within the agricultural land. It was found that plant diversity, vegetation structure and taxonomic composition as well as differences in the turnover of the vegetation at habitats (productivity of vegetation) influence arthropod groups and species in the study area in different ways which could not be generalised. Further, the relationships of insects between the natural forest and the open agricultural land were considered. In order to identify species that occur in the forest {{as well as in the}} open country, first, insects at sites of the forest interior, the forest margin and the agricultural land, were recorded using modified Malaise traps. Then, movement patterns of selected species were determined based on their abundances at the different habitats and <b>arrival</b> <b>sides.</b> In addition it was tried to find out whether major pest species of the cultivated crops show any relationship to the adjacent natural forest, and whether species originating from the forest (non-pest species) are able to colonize open country. The results indicate that the habitat of the pest species considered is limited to the cultivated land and does not include the forest. None of the non-pest species recorded in this study would be able to exist permanently in the agricultural area. They all depend on a closed forest habitat and therefore will become extinct as the forest disappears with proceeding slash-and-burn agriculture. However, some but not all of the pest and forest species were regularly recorded from the forest margin. Finally it was focused on relationships of insects between perennial and consecutive changing vegetable crops. Two kinds of habitats were distinguished: (i) frequently disturbed and rotational changing vegetables with simple architecture; (ii) rarely disturbed stands of chayote, with complex architecture. The impact of changing crop and weed species composition and the agricultural practices (soil preparation, planting, weeding, harvest) applied on the abundance of selected insect species and the question whether stands of chayote are used as refuge as long as conditions in the seasonal vegetables become unfavourable due to agroecosystem management applied were analysed. The insect species investigated include phytophagous specialists and generalists as well as beneficials (predators and pollinators). It only was possible to generalize movement patterns regarding significance of abundance variations at habitats and at opposite <b>arrival</b> <b>sides</b> of the traps in each habitat. With respect to the population development of the species in relation to cropping patterns and agricultural practices applied no common patterns could be determined. The results contribute to the assessment of the effects of man-made habitat conversion on the arthropod fauna in tropical ecosystems. The identification and classification of habitats and their interactions might enhance the understanding of ecosystems in order to make aware the need to preserve and restore biodiversity. In den feuchten Tropen Süd-Ost Asiens nehmen die natürlichen Waldbestände weiterhin ab. Der Landschaftsanteil genutzter und degradierter Flächen liegt heute zumeist deutlich höher als derjenige naturbelassener Standorte. Im Hochland der Insel Leyte, Philippinen, wird der Verlust natürlicher Waldbestände vor allem durch kommerzielle und illegale Abholzung sowie intensive Brandrodung verursacht. Der Rückgang der natürlichen Vegetation wird begleitet von einer abnehmenden Vielfalt an Flora und Fauna und damit auch von Leistungen und Wechselbeziehungen innerhalb des Ökosystems. Dies führt zum Ungleichgewicht und letztendlich zur Zerstörung des betreffenden Ökosystems. Um die natürliche Biodiversität so weit als möglich erhalten und wiederherstellen zu können, müssen sowohl die Ökosysteme der natürlichen als auch der genutzten und degradierten Flächen mit ihren Wechselbeziehungen erfasst werden. Bis heute hatten in den Tropen nur wenige Studien die Artenvielfalt degradierter und genutzter Flächen im Vergleich zu den angrenzenden, natürlichen Arealen zum Gegenstand. Die vorliegende Studie wurde in einer Hochlandregion der Philippinen durchgeführt und konzentrierte sich auf ausgewählte Insekten und deren Wanderungsverhalten zwischen natürlichen (Regenwald) und landwirtschaftlich genutzten Flächen. Zwei Fragen standen hierbei im Vordergrund: (1) welche Strukturen und Komponenten der Kulturlandschaft sind für die Erhaltung der Arthropodendiversität von Bedeutung, und (2) gibt es Arten, welche im natürlichen System, dem Regenwald, beheimatet sind und sich in der neu entstandenen Kulturlandschaft ansiedeln können? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, wurden Bestandsaufnahmen zum Vorkommen von Insekten- und Pflanzenarten entlang des Habitatgradienten Wald ? Feld durchgeführt, sowie die Abundanzmuster ausgewählter Insektenarten erfasst. Die Insekten wurden mit Hilfe modifizierter Malaise-Fallen in den vier Habitaten Wald, Waldrand, annuelle Gemüsekulturen, - und perennierende Chayote ((Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw. (Cucurbitaceae), erfasst. Diese Malaise-Fallen erlauben den Rückschluss auf die Anflugrichtung der gefangenen Individuen, wobei zwischen ?vom Feld in Richtung Wald? und ?vom Wald in Richtung Feld? unterschieden wurde. Die Arthropodenfänge aus jedem Habitat, differenziert nach Anflugrichtung, wurden unter Berücksichtigung der jeweiligen Vegetation verglichen. Des weiteren wurden für jedes Habitat und jede Anflugrichtung die Diversität (nach Shannon) und Zusammensetzung der Arthropodenfänge, sowie die Verteilung der trophischen Ebenen bestimmt. Die Ergebnisse wurden bezüglich des Einflusses der Vegetation auf Diversität und Zusammensetzung der Arthropodenfänge in den untersuchten Habitaten; der Abundanzmuster ausgewählter Arten zwischen Regenwald und Agrarökosystem, sowie der Abundanzmuster ausgewählter Arten innerhalb der landwirtschaftlichen Fläche dargestellt und diskutiert. Als ursächlich für die Unterschiede in der Diversität und Zusammensetzung der Arthropodenfänge entlang des Habitatgradienten wurden der Artenreichtum, die Struktur und die taxonomische Zusammensetzung der Vegetation, aber auch Unterschiede im Wiederaufwuchs (Produktivität der Vegetation) in den Habitaten identifiziert. Die Auswirkungen dieser Faktoren auf die Abundanz der einzelnen Arthropodengruppen und Arten waren unterschiedlich und ließen sich nicht vereinheitlichen. Des weiteren wurden die Abundanzmuster ausgewählter Insekten zwischen den drei Habitaten Wald, Waldrand und annuelle Gemüsekulturen berücksichtigt. Um Arten bestimmen zu können, welche in allen drei Habitaten vorkommen, wurden zunächst Fänge aus allen Habitaten verglichen und dann die Abundanzen der ausgewählten Arten getrennt nach Habitat und Anflugrichtung aufgezeichnet. Hierbei wurden neben den ausgewählten Nicht-Schädlingsarten (Indifferente; Bestäuber; Prädatoren) zusätzlich die wichtigsten Schadinsekten der Feldfrüchte berücksichtigt, um herauszufinden, ob diese eine Affinität zum natürlichen Ökosystem, dem Wald, zeigen. Zur Ergänzung der quantitativen Daten wurden regelmäßige Feldbeobachtungen der ausgewählten Arten durchgeführt. Die ausgewählten Schädlingsarten konzentrierten sich überwiegend auf die landwirtschaftliche Fläche. Einige der ausgewählten Nicht-Schädlingsarten besuchten die landwirtschaftlichen Flächen regelmäßig, kehrten aber auch wieder in den Wald zurück. Die übrigen Nicht-Schädlingsarten konzentrierten sich auf den Wald und wurden nur sehr vereinzelt in den landwirtschaftlichen Habitaten erfasst. In Verbindung mit den Beobachtungen und der Auswertung existierender Literatur zeigten die Ergebnisse, dass keine der ausgewählten Nicht-Schädlingsarten allein in der Kulturlandschaft überleben kann. Alle benötigen zumindest zeitweise das Habitat Wald zur adäquaten Nahrungs- und Schutzsuche sowie Reproduktion. Fast alle der Schädlings- und Nicht-Schädlingsarten wurden regelmäßig am Waldrand erfasst. Diese Schnittstelle zwischen natürlichen und veränderten Habitaten fungiert als Grenze oder Transitzone für Insekten der angrenzenden Habitate oder beheimatet Arten, welche sich inzwischen auf diese Zone spezialisiert haben. Schließlich wurden auch Abundanzmuster ausgewählter Insektenarten innerhalb der landwirtschaftlichen Flächen berücksichtigt. Unterschieden wurden die beiden Habitate Chayote, perennierend, selten durch menschliche Bearbeitung gestört, mit komplexer Struktur von Blättern und Stängeln, und regelmäßig wechselnde Gemüsekulturen, häufig bearbeitet, mit einfacher Wuchsstruktur. Um den Einfluss der wechselnden Zusammensetzung von Kulturpflanzen und Unkräutern sowie der unterschiedlichen landwirtschaftlichen Eingriffe (Bodenbearbeitung, Pflanzen, Jäten, Ernte) auf die ausgewählten Insektenarten untersuchen zu können, wurden die Populationsentwicklungen dieser Arten ebenfalls erfasst. Auch der Frage, ob Chayote - Pflanzungen als Rückzugsgebiet für Insekten dienen, solange deren eigentliches Habitat, die annuellen Gemüsekulturen, durch Bearbeitungsmaßnahmen gestört sind, wurde nachgegangen. Die ausgewählten Arten umfassten sowohl phytophage Spezialisten und Generalisten als auch Nützlinge (Prädatoren und Bestäuber). Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass Abundanzmuster lediglich in Bezug auf signifikante Unterschiede der Abundanzen in den Habitaten und der beiden Einflugseiten der Fallen in den Habitaten Gemeinsamkeiten aufwiesen. Der Vergleich der Populationsentwicklung der ausgewählten Arten unter Einfluss der unterschiedlichen Kulturen und der landwirtschaftlichen Bearbeitung zeigte keinerlei Ähnlichkeiten. Die vorliegenden Ergebnisse stellen einen Beitrag zur methodischen Erfassung der Auswirkung von anthropogen bedingten Habitatveränderungen auf die Arthropodenfauna in tropischen Landschaften dar. Die Identifikation und Klassifizierung von Habitaten mit der Beschreibung der zugehörigen Zusammenhänge sind die Grundlage für ein besseres Verständnis der Ökosysteme. Dies soll ein bewusstes Management von Kulturflächen fördern und letztendlich zur Erhaltung und Wiederherstellung der natürlichen Biodiversität beitragen...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{composed of}} energy harvesting devices will introduce several transformative changes in wireless networking: energy self-sufficient, energy self-sustaining, perpetual operation; {{and an ability}} to deploy wireless networks at hard-to-reach places such as remote rural areas, within the structures, and within the human body. Energy harvesting brings new dimensions to the wireless communication problem in the form of intermittency and randomness of available energy. In such systems, the communication mechanisms need to be designed by explicitly accounting for the energy harvesting constraints. In this dissertation, we investigate the effects of intermittency and randomness in the available energy for message transmission in energy harvesting communication systems. We use information theoretic and scheduling theoretic frameworks to determine the fundamental limits of communications with energy harvesting devices. We first investigate the information theoretic capacity of the single user Gaussian energy harvesting channel. In this problem, an energy harvesting transmitter with an unlimited sized battery communicates with a receiver over the classical AWGN channel. As energy arrives randomly and can be saved in the battery, codewords must obey cumulative stochastic energy constraints. We show that the capacity of the AWGN channel with such stochastic channel input constraints is equal to the capacity with an average power constraint equal to the average recharge rate. We provide two capacity achieving schemes: save-and-transmit and best-effort-transmit. In the save-and-transmit scheme, the transmitter collects energy in a saving phase of proper duration that guarantees {{that there will be no}} energy shortages during the transmission of code symbols. In the best-effort-transmit scheme, the transmission starts right away without an initial saving period, and the transmitter sends a code symbol if there is sufficient energy in the battery, and a zero symbol otherwise. Finally, we consider a system in which the average recharge rate is time-varying in a larger time scale and derive the optimal offline power policy that maximizes the average throughput, by using majorization theory. Next, we remove the battery from the model to understand the impact of stochasticity in the energy arrival on the communication rate. We consider the single user AWGN channel in the zero energy storage case. We observe that the energy arrival is a channel state and channel state information is available at the transmitter only. We determine the capacity in this case using Shannon strategies. We, then, extend the capacity analysis to an additive Gaussian multiple access channel where multiple users with energy harvesting transmitters of zero energy storage communicate with a single receiver. We investigate the achievable rate region under static and stochastic amplitude constraints on the users' channel inputs. Finally, we consider state amplification in a single user AWGN channel with an energy harvesting transmitter to analyze the trade-off between the objectives of decoding the message and estimating the energy arrival sequence. Next, we specialize in the finite battery regime in the energy harvesting channel. We focus on the case of side information available at the receiver side. We determine the capacity of an energy harvesting channel with an energy harvesting transmitter and battery state information available at the receiver side. This is an instance of a finite-state channel and the channel output feedback does not increase the capacity. We state the capacity as maximum directed mutual information from the input to the output and the battery state. We identify sufficient conditions for the channel to have stationary input distributions as optimal distributions. We also derive a single-letter capacity expression for this channel with battery state information at both sides and infinite-sized battery at the transmitter. Then, we determine the capacity when energy <b>arrival</b> <b>side</b> information is available at the receiver side. We first find an n-letter capacity expression and show that the optimal coding is based on only current battery state s_i. We, next, show that the capacity is expressed as maximum directed information between the input and the output and prove that the channel output feedback does not increase the capacity. Then, we consider security aspects of communication in energy harvesting systems. In particular, we focus on a wiretap channel with an energy harvesting transmitter where a legitimate pair of users wish to establish secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper in a noisy channel. We characterize the rate-equivocation region of the Gaussian wiretap channel under static and stochastic amplitude constraints. First, we consider the Gaussian wiretap channel with a static amplitude constraint on the channel input. We prove that the entire rate-equivocation region of the Gaussian wiretap channel with an amplitude constraint is obtained by discrete input distributions with finite support. We also prove the optimality of discrete input distributions in the presence of an additional variance constraint. Next, we consider the Gaussian wiretap channel with an energy harvesting transmitter with zero energy storage. We prove that single-letter Shannon strategies span the entire rate-equivocation region and obtain numerically verifiable necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. In the remaining parts of this dissertation, we consider optimal transmission scheduling for energy harvesting transmitters. First, we consider the optimization of single user data transmission with an energy harvesting transmitter which has a limited battery capacity, communicating over a wireless fading channel. We consider two objectives: maximizing the throughput by a deadline, and minimizing the transmission completion time of the communication session. We optimize these objectives by controlling the time sequence of transmit powers subject to energy storage capacity and causality constraints. We, first, study optimal offline policies. We introduce a directional water-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of the necessary optimality conditions. We show the optimality of the directional water-filling algorithm for the throughput maximization problem. We solve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its equivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart. Next, we consider online policies. We use dynamic programming to solve for the optimal online policy that maximizes the average number of bits delivered by a deadline under stochastic fading and energy arrival processes with causal channel state feedback. We also propose near-optimal policies with reduced complexity, and numerically study their performances along with the performances of the offline and online optimal policies. Then, we consider a broadcast channel with an energy harvesting transmitter with a finite capacity battery and M receivers. We derive the optimal offline transmission policy that minimizes the time by which all of the data packets are delivered to their respective destinations. We obtain structural properties of the optimal transmission policy using a dual problem and determine the optimal total transmit power sequence by a directional water-filling algorithm. We show that there exist M- 1 cut-off power levels such that each user is allocated the power between two corresponding consecutive cut-off power levels subject to the availability of the allocated total power level. Based on these properties, we propose an iterative algorithm that gives the globally optimal offline policy. Finally, we consider parallel and fading Gaussian broadcast channels with an energy harvesting transmitter. Under offline knowledge of energy arrival and channel fading variations, we characterize the transmission policies that achieve the boundary of the maximum departure region in a given interval. In the case of parallel broadcast channels, we show that the optimal total transmit power policy that achieves the boundary of the maximum departure region is the same as the optimal policy for the non-fading broadcast channel, which does not depend on the priorities of the users, and therefore is the same as the optimal policy for the non-fading scalar single user channel. The optimal total transmit power can be found by a directional water-filling algorithm while optimal splitting of the power among the parallel channels is performed in each epoch separately. In the case of fading broadcast channels, the optimal power allocation depends on the priorities of the users. We obtain a modified directional water-filling algorithm for fading broadcast channels to determine the optimal total transmit power allocation policy...|$|R
