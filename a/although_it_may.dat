5|$|Prolotherapy – the {{practice}} of injecting solutions into joints (or other areas) to cause inflammation and thereby stimulate the body's healing response – has not {{been found to be}} effective by itself, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be helpful when added to another therapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not be {{appealing to}} many {{due to its}} sliminess. In China, a yak milk beverage is made with H.eburnus and yak milk, by lactic acid fermentation with Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus as mixed starter.|$|E
5|$|Very severe {{hypothyroidism}} and myxedema coma are rare, with it {{estimated to}} occur in 0.22 per million people a year. The majority of cases occur in women over 60 years of age, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> happen in all age groups.|$|E
5000|$|Antisuppression {{exercises}} - this {{is being}} less commonly practiced, <b>although</b> occasionally <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be used.|$|R
50|$|Lawrenceoceras {{is closely}} related to nautiloids such as Bassleroceras that gave rise to the Tarphycerida <b>although</b> <b>it</b> {{specifically}} <b>may</b> not be ancestral.|$|R
50|$|Western {{olivaceous warbler}} occurs mainly a passage migrant in {{southeast}} Morocco, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> also <b>may</b> breed in some densely vegetated areas there.|$|R
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{have once}} been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{there is}} little scientific evidence that yoga is beneficial for physical health, and it may cause muscular or spinal injuries, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> improve mental health both for healthy people and for those with illnesses. Clinical studies on {{the health effects of}} yoga generally are of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been a timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E
50|$|Greenhouses also {{contribute}} to mesocosm studies <b>although</b> sometimes, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> induce climate change, interfering with the experiment and resulting in inefficient data.|$|R
50|$|It {{is mostly}} carnivorous, feeding on insects {{and other small}} creatures, <b>although</b> {{occasionally}} <b>it</b> <b>may</b> devour fruit and leafy plants. In some areas, it even steals dog food.|$|R
50|$|It mainly {{affects the}} glans penis (the {{head of the}} penis), <b>although</b> uncommonly <b>it</b> <b>may</b> present on the mucous {{membranes}} of the larynx, and rarely, the mouth, or the anus.|$|R
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the group 11 elements, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to gold in group 11 as the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Roentgenium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, copper, silver, and gold, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> show some differences from them.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} {{that this type of}} {{atmosphere}} loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet's magnetic field may prevent this loss, because the exosphere would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.|$|E
5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the Seychelles, and the only true freshwater crab in that country. It lives in rainforest streams on the archipelago's granitic high islands. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be abundant, {{little is known about}} its biology. If its habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi might become endangered, but it is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|S. keratitidis is a {{human eye}} pathogen, unlike its other genus counterparts, whose habitat is either soil, manure, or fodder. <b>Although</b> rare, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> occur due to poor {{sanitation}} in individuals who wear contact lenses.|$|R
2500|$|When {{dimensional}} analysis yields only one dimensionless group, as here, {{there are no}} unknown functions, and the solution {{is said to be}} [...] "complete" [...] – <b>although</b> <b>it</b> still <b>may</b> involve unknown dimensionless constants, such as [...]|$|R
25|$|While {{playing music}} during a field show, the band makes {{a series of}} formations, called drill, on the field, which may be pictures, {{geometric}} shapes, curvilinear designs, or blocks of musicians, <b>although</b> sometimes <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be pure abstract designs using no specific form.|$|R
5|$|The Australian magpie {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} diurnal, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> call into the night, like some {{other members of}} the Artamidae. Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl. Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating house sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting. The Australian raven may take nestlings left unattended.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Wales's feathers, often {{adopted as}} {{insignia}} {{by members of}} the College, appear as decorative elements within the college buildings and appear on the official College tie. It probably represents Edward, the Black Prince, Prince of Wales, who first adopted the device, the senior grandson of King Edward II, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> represent King Charles I, who was Prince of Wales when the building of First quad began in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{be killed in}} {{interspecific}} conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E

50|$|It usually {{grows to}} between 3 and 10 metres tall, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> {{occasionally}} <b>may</b> grow {{as tall as}} 25 metres. It has a crooked trunk, rough flaking bark and a rounded canopy. Large panicles of sweetly scented small white to cream flowers are produced from autumn to spring.|$|R
50|$|The dwarf {{crocodile}} is a timid and mainly nocturnal reptile that {{spends the}} day hidden in pools or burrows, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> occasionally <b>may</b> be active during the day. Foraging is mainly done {{in or near}} the water, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> is considered {{to be one of the}} most terrestrial species of crocodilian and may expand the feeding pattern to land in extensive forays, especially after rains.|$|R
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E
5|$|The name Dunster {{derives from}} an earlier name Torre ("tor, rocky hill"), {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book written twenty years after the Norman conquest. The origin of the prefix is uncertain, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> well refer to Dunn, a Saxon noble who held land in nearby Elworthy and Willett before the conquest, giving Dunestore meaning Dunn's craggy hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> also have been bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and {{the position of the}} orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
500|$|It retires to densely-foliaged {{spots in}} {{trees in the}} daytime, each {{individual}} often having several roosting sites. Caves or ledges are alternative roosting sites {{if there are no}} trees available. <b>Although</b> unobtrusive, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> give itself away by droppings or pellets on the ground beneath. The southern boobook is mobbed by passerines if discovered. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> allow people to approach to within [...]|$|R

50|$|Buchberger's {{algorithm}} for computing Gröbner bases is a {{very similar}} algorithm. <b>Although</b> developed independently, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{also be seen as}} the instantiation of Knuth-Bendix algorithm in the theory of polynomial rings.|$|R
5|$|Zygoma implant; a long implant {{that can}} anchor to the cheek bone by {{passing through the}} maxillary sinus to retain a {{complete}} upper denture when bone is absent. While zygomatic implants offer a novel approach to severe bone loss in the upper jaw, {{it has not been}} shown to offer any advantage over bone grafting functionally <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> offer a less invasive option, {{depending on the size of}} the reconstruction required.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{distributed}} in bottles and cans {{and is also}} commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv), <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above. Beer forms {{part of the culture}} of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.|$|E
