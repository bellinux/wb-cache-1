5|$|Supertunica – {{the second}} robe {{with which the}} {{sovereign}} is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing sleeves. It is lined with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E
5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E

25|$|In Tibet, coracles, {{used for}} fishing and {{ferrying}} people, {{are made by}} stretching yak hide over juniper frames, <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> with leather thongs. They are shaped like the Iraq coracles. Yack butter is used for waterproofing. Again, different rivers have their own designs. Sometimes two coracles are strapped together for added stability.|$|E
25|$|Parade uniform (Paradeuniform) – The parade uniform for {{officers}} was the semi-dress/walking-out tunic {{with all}} authorized orders, awards and decorations attached, breeches and riding boots, steel helmet, white shirt, dark-gray necktie, and a ceremonial dagger worn {{on the left}} side <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> to a silver-gray parade belt. Officers in guards of honor carried sabers. In winter, a greatcoat, scarf, and gloves were worn.|$|E
25|$|Shirts of linen or cotton {{featured}} high upstanding or turnover collars, and neckties grew {{wider and}} were {{tied in a}} bow or looped into a loose knot <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> with a stickpin. Heavy padded and fitted frock coats (in French redingotes), now usually single-breasted and knee length, were worn for business occasions, over waistcoats or vests with lapels and notched collars. Waistcoats were generally cut straight across the front and had lapels.|$|E

25|$|The idols of the Ancient Near East were central {{figures of}} the tribal cults around the Israelites. They {{are said to have}} been placed upon pedestals, clothed and colored, <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> with chains of silver or nails of iron lest they should fall over or be carried off. To {{demonstrate}} victory over an enemy’s idols, it was customary to take away the idols of the vanquished, and a similar custom is frequently mentioned in the cuneiform texts.|$|E
25|$|Yellow flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh {{marigold}} were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn {{at the doors}} and windows and sometimes they were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{mortarboard}} {{may also}} {{be referred to as}} a trencher cap (or simply trencher). The tassel comprises a cluster of silk threads which are fixed together <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> by a button at one end, and fixed at the centre of the headpiece. The loose strands are allowed to fall freely over the board edge, typically falling over the left front side of the cap. Often the strands are plaited together to form a cord with the end threads left untied.|$|E

25|$|Brazilian {{military}} units also carry the national flag as a National Colour. This {{is in the}} dimensions 90 × 128cm. It is mounted on the same size staff and with the same finial as the Army standard, but the cravat is divided lengthwise yellow and green, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> with a cockade of blue with the Cruzeiro do Sul in white stars, yellow, and green. The staff is covered in green velvet with a yellow spiral strip. The colour belt is 10cm in width, covered with green velvet with yellow velvet stripes of width and number varying with the rank of the organization's commander.|$|E
25|$|The most {{immediately}} noticeable {{feature is}} a white cassock and zucchetto (skull cap). Only the Pope is permitted to wear a cassock made out of watered silk. The cassock {{used to have a}} train on it, but Pope Pius XII discontinued this custom. For convenience, the train could be folded up <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> {{to the back of the}} cassock. He used to wear a tufted fascia (white sash-like belt fastened about the waist, the ends of which fall down past the knees and are often embroidered with the Pope's coat of arms), until Paul VI replaced it with a simpler fringed sash. Previously, the tufted fascia (terminating in gold tassels) was worn with choir dress, and the fringed fascia (terminating in a simpler gold fringe) was worn with ordinary dress.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers) defended the titles against Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). Midnight Express's manager Jim Cornette was locked and {{suspended}} high in a steel cage <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> in a straight jacket. The match stipulated that if Fantastics won, they would {{get the opportunity to}} whip Cornette ten times with a belt. Cornette tried to involve himself into the match on several occasions but failed. The match went back and forth with the challengers double teaming Fulton. Rogers was tagged in and he battled Eaton and Lane. Lane handed Eaton a steel chain and Eaton wrapped it around his fist. Fulton was unaware of it which allowed Eaton to attack Fulton with the chain and pin him to win the titles.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} there was a repair done on the {{portside}} hull. To patch it, a larger portion of the hull was worked away and a rebate was cut around the edges. Then, a repair patch, some 1.25 m long, was manufactured with similar rebates so both parts would perfectly match. In both parts, the corresponding holes were cut and tree-nails used to fasten them from outside. The other repair, which was done to the starboard inner face of the hull at the stern, was patched by an insertion of a pre-shaped block <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> by a tree-nail. Based on the analysis of the hull, this repair was initiated as a split stopper. Boring a hole at one end of a split is a recognized way of minimizing a possibility of its spreading. The split was therefore caulked, a section of wood around the transom removed, and the repair block inserted and the transom finished.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of the Army measures 80 × 120cm, white with the Army {{coat of arms}} in the centre, trimmed with gold fringe. The name of the service is inscribed in gold letters on a green scroll beneath the shield. Above the shield is a knight's helmet with red and sky blue mantling. The staff is topped by a nickel-plated lance-head finial, 32cm high. Below the lance-head, there is a cravat (laço militar) divided lengthwise, sky blue and red, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> with a cockade of blue with the Southern Cross in white stars, red, and blue. Ten red streamers with campaign honours inscribed in sky blue letters are also attached below the lance-head. The staff is 212cm long, not including the lance-head, and 3.5cm in diameter. It is covered in sky blue velvet with a red spiral strip. The colour belt is 10cm in width, covered with sky blue velvet with red velvet stripes. The Navy's flag uses dark blue colours, the Air Force flag ultramarine blue.|$|E
25|$|In 1287, the {{original}} {{way of life}} of the order was changed to conform {{to that of the}} mendicant orders on the initiative of St. Simon Stock and at the command of Pope Innocent IV. Their former habit of a mantle with black and white or brown and white stripes—the black or brown stripes representing the scorches the mantle of Elijah received from the fiery chariot as it fell from his shoulders—was discarded. They wore the same habit as the Dominicans, except that the cloak was white. They also borrowed much from the Dominican and Franciscan constitutions. Their distinctive garment was a scapular of two strips of dark cloth, worn on the breast and back, <b>and</b> <b>fastened</b> at the shoulders. Tradition holds that this was given to St. Simon Stock by the Blessed Virgin Mary, who appeared to him and promised that all who wore it with faith and piety and who died clothed in it would be saved. There arose a sodality of the scapular, which affiliated a large number of laymen with the Carmelites.|$|E
