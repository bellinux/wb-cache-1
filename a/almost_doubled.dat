5|$|The synagogue {{experienced}} difficulty {{during the}} Great Depression—membership dropped, the congregational school was closed, and staff had their salaries reduced—but conditions had improved {{by the late}} 1930s. In 1943 the synagogue {{changed its name to}} Temple Israel, and by the late 1940s membership had <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> from its low point in the 1930s. Ettelson retired in 1954, and was succeeded by Jimmy Wax.|$|E
5|$|According to the Euro Plus Monitor Report 2013, the {{collective}} current account of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain is improving rapidly {{and is expected}} to balance by mid 2013. Thereafter these countries as a group would no longer need to import capital. In 2014, the current account surplus of the eurozone as a whole <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> compared to the previous year, reaching a new record high of 227.9bn Euros.|$|E
5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer menstrual cycle length {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E

5|$|In 1800, {{there were}} 2,545 Catholic {{households}} {{with a population}} of 10,877. Their population <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> by 1818. According to various parish books, Mangalorean Catholics numbered 19,068 in South Canara (12,877 in Mangalore and Bantval, 3,918 in Moolki, 2,273 in Cundapore and Barcoor). Most of the churches which were earlier destroyed by Tipu were rebuilt by 1815. The community prospered under the British, and the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa recommenced.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, London annexed {{nearly the}} entire {{township}} of Westminster, a large, primarily rural municipality directly south of the city, including the police village of Lambeth. With this massive annexation, London <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> in area again, adding several thousand more residents. In modern day, London stretches south to the boundary with Elgin County, north to the Town of Arva and Fanshawe Lake, west to Komoka, and East to Nilestown and Dorchester.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the decade}} 2002–2012, {{passenger}} numbers at Filton Abbey Wood <b>almost</b> <b>doubled,</b> from 395,000 to 771,000. In the 2006/07 financial year, over 50,000 passengers used Filton Abbey Wood {{to travel to}} or from Bristol Temple Meads. The line through Filton Abbey Wood has a loading gauge of W8, and the line handles over 15 million train tonnes per year. It is not electrified, though it is planned {{that it will be}} electrified as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line.|$|E

50|$|An {{especially}} technologically interesting case of {{this comes}} when one uses a Halbach array instead of a single pole permanent magnet, as this <b>almost</b> <b>doubles</b> the field strength, which in turn <b>almost</b> <b>doubles</b> {{the strength of the}} eddy currents. The net effect is to more than triple the lift force. Using two opposed Halbach arrays increases the field even further.|$|R

5|$|These {{incidents}} {{appear to}} have prompted the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made {{for the creation of}} subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Tiryns, Midea and Athens expanded their defences with new cyclopean-style walls. The extension program in Mycenae <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> the fortified area of the citadel. To this phase of extension belongs the impressive Lion Gate, the main entrance into the Mycenaean acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
5|$|Americans' {{eagerness to}} expand westward {{prompted}} {{a long series}} of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> the nation's area. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices <b>almost</b> <b>doubled,</b> at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} <b>almost</b> <b>doubled.</b> The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 1969–70, Orr <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> his scoring total {{from the}} {{previous}} season, to 120 points, six shy of the league record (which had been set by his team-mate Phil Esposito the previous season), leading the league in scoring. , Orr is the only defenceman in history to win the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer, which he also achieved a second time, in 1974-75. In addition to the Norris and the Art Ross, Orr captured {{the first of three}} consecutive Hart Trophies as regular-season MVP and later won the Conn Smythe Trophy for his playoff performance, becoming the only player in history to win four major NHL awards in one season.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon {{could be}} {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} modern Germany. After dissolving the Holy Roman Empire, he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50, prior to the German Unification. A byproduct of the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. That territory <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> the size of the United States, adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat became French {{again after}} the First World War, during which almost a {{thousand}} inhabitants died. It {{was part of the}} Third Reich during the Second World War. Its liberation took three months and ended in February 1945. The town is a recipient of the War Cross 1914–1918 and War Cross 1939–1945. Sélestat has experienced steady demographic and economic growth since 1945. Its population <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> between 1946 and 1999 and two industrial parks were built to accommodate new large factories. The service industry has enriched the town's economy since the 1970s with a large number of small businesses.|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements <b>almost</b> <b>doubled</b> the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E
