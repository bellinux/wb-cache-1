The probe was invented by Jiří Adámek in the Institute of Plasma Physics AS CR in 2004. The ball-pen probe balances the electron saturation current to the same magnitude {{as that of the}} ion saturation current. In this case, its floating potential becomes identical to the plasma potential. This goal is attained by a ceramic shield, which screens off an <b>adjustable</b> <b>part</b> of the electron current from the probe collector due to the much smaller gyro-radius of the electrons. The electron temperature is proportional to the difference of ball-pen probe(plasma potential) and Langmuir probe (floating potential) potential. Thus, the electron temperature can be obtained directly with high temporal resolution without additional power supply.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} boost the exit value, it is not {{uncommon}} that issuers report earnings in excess of cash flow generated by its operations at the initial public offering (IPO). The discretionary activity of performing earnings management can mislead investors about the intrinsic value of the newly public firm. Within this study, I examine how earnings management will affect the stock market reaction upon the lockup expiration date, the IPO adjustable offering size, and how the backing of private equity or venture capital (PEVC) affects earnings management tendencies within IPO firms. Using a unique, hand-collected dataset of 56 Swedish newly public firms from 2007 - 2014, I show that IPO firms (i) manage their earnings at the full fiscal year prior to the IPO and that earnings management will result in a negative stock market reaction upon the lockup expiration date. More importantly, I show that (ii) high adjustable offerings do not affect this relationship indicating that earnings management has no impact on the <b>adjustable</b> <b>part</b> of the offering size within IPOs. I also find that (iii) IPO firms backed by PEVC firms are more eager to manipulate their earnings, and (iv) highly reputable PEVC firms do not mitigate the manipulation of earnings within IPO firms. The results taken together suggest that studying the stock market reaction on the lockup expiration date is important for manipulative IPO firm detection, and that a participation in IPOs backed by PEVC firms must be done with caution...|$|E

The crank system was redesigned to a lightweight, <b>adjustable</b> <b>part</b> with chain clearance and high strength. The chain tension was improved by replacing the existing single idler wheel/chain tube system with a dual idler wheel system. The dual idler has a titanium sprocket in one of the wheels and a smooth low friction surface for the other wheel. A rear mechanical disc brake was added with a locking brake lever. The locking brake was added {{to make it easier for}} the user to get in and out of the seat. A weld was made on the rear seat stay in order to place a bracket for the rear brake calipers.

In particular, the design and the performance of a Miniature laser Doppler anemometer, a miniature particle sizing sensor, and an optical shear stress sensor based on micro-optical electromechanical systems (MOEMS) is reviewed. The Miniature LDA (See Figure 1) uses a diode laser, diffractive optical element and miniature optics resulting in a rugged, small and self- contained backscatter LDA with frequency shifting. It has a fixed probe distance, and except for a rotating diffraction grating, has no moving or <b>adjustable</b> <b>parts.</b> It has a dimension of 50 mm in length and 25 mm in diameter. Sensors with different fringe sizes and sensor f-numbers have been fabricated.

The particle sizing is achieved by the “IMAX” technique. The sensor is capable of sizing particles from a micron to 100 ’s of microns. The dynamic range is limited by the dynamic range of the linear or log detector. Addition of a second detector allows the sensor to measure droplet size using the “Phase Doppler ” technique.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the Avantomography demonstrator, {{which is being}} {{implemented}} and tested at Tampere University of Technology (Tampere, Finland). We also describe the first tests performed with it and the obtained results. The final aim of this master thesis is the energy calibration of the scintillating crystals and the electronic chain for data acquisition. This new small Positron Emission Tomography (PET) demonstrator follows the recent innovations presented by the AX-PET group, at CERN. This is the first functioning version of a prototype of a light and compact PET scanner. The novel geometry, used to build the Avantomography demonstrator, is based on scintillating crystals and wavelength shifting (WLS) plastic strips, allowing high resolution and high sensitivity at the same time. The device consists in two small and compact modules, with two different <b>adjustable</b> <b>parts</b> inside. Each detector module is built up from long scintillator bars placed in the trans-axial plane and orthogonal WLS strip arrays. Preliminary tests with a standard positron emitter source has been performed {{in order to test}} the acquisition chain and to calibrate the demonstrator. First test has been performed measuring the intrinsic radioactivity of the scintillating crystals. For a complete calibration of one crystal, a test with a linear positron emitter source has been performed at the Tampere University Hospital (Tampere, Finland). From these measurements the spectra of different energy peaks are acquired and plotted. Using a dedicate MATLAB code, different Gaussian fits are calculated to find the position of each peak. With these values a 3 -parameters fitting curve has been evaluated in order to obtain the non linear curve for the energy calibration. Furthermore a first evaluation of the energy resolution has been calculated starting from the acquired data. With its compact and light geometry, high resolution and high sensitivity this detector has a promising layout as a preclinical PET scanner...|$|R

Whence coming, whither going, no one knows, nor is it certain whether it was design or ignorance or panic which sent them riding so wildly through {{the darkness}}. Somebody fired. A sergeant of the Fusiliers took the bullet through his hand. Some one else shouted to fix bayonets. The mules which carried the spare ammunition kicked and reared. There was no question of treachery, for they were led by our own men, but to hold two frightened mules, one with either hand, is a feat for a Hercules. They lashed and tossed and bucked themselves loose, and an instant afterwards were flying helter skelter through the column. Nearly all the mules caught the panic. In vain the men held on to their heads. In the mad rush they were galloped over and knocked down by the torrent of frightened creatures. In the gloom of that early hour the men must have {{thought that they were}} charged by cavalry. The column was dashed out of all military order as effectively as if a regiment of dragoons had ridden over them.

The delay line is designed so that the temporal delay, with which the light is re-coupled to the resonator is smaller than the reciprocal value of the repetition rate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The Q-switched laser comprises a pump light source (1), an optical resonator, in which a laser medium is situated, and a passive Q-switch (5). The part of the light that is decoupled from the optical resonator is fed to an optical delay line (9) by a beam splitter (8) and is re-coupled to the optical resonator once it has passed through the optical delay line. The delay line is designed so that the temporal delay, with which the light is re-coupled to the resonator is smaller than the reciprocal value of the repetition rate or smaller than integral multiple of the reciprocal value of the repetition rate of the laser. The delay line is reflected. The beam splitter is a polarization beam splitter, a dielectric mirror or a fiber optical beam splitter. The delay line comprises a light-conducting fiber, which has a reflecting fiber-Bragg-lattice at end side. The light-conducting fiber comprises two or more fiber-Bragg-lattice along its longitudinal extent. The delay line comprises a multipass cell with two or more mirrors. A pumping power of the pump light source is adjustable. The delay line is <b>adjustable.</b> The <b>part</b> of the light guided by the beam splitter of the delay line passes a frequency converter against the re-coupling into the optical resonator.
