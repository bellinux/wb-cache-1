40|$|The cost of {{monitoring}} pollutants within natural waters is of major concern. Existing and forthcoming bodies of legislation continually drive {{the demand for}} spatial and <b>selective</b> <b>monitoring</b> of key pollutants within our environment. Although research and commercial entities continue to drive down {{the cost of the}} infrastructure involved in environmental sensing systems (with an aim to increase scalability), the realisation of deploying a number of such systems even now remains out of reach. High cost and maintenance continue to persist as the major limiting factors. The aim of this work is to combine recent advances in robotics with chemical sensing techniques to remove all but the chemo-responsive material from each sensing node, and package the sensing element within a low cost, mobile, biomimetic robotic fish for effective water quality monitoring. Consequently, this approach is believed to radically reduce the systemic cost and maintenance per node and in doing so it will increase the scalability for spatial and <b>selective</b> <b>monitoring</b> of key pollutants within our environment. ...|$|R

In addition, urethral rings were studied in vitro in an attempt to determine if alpha 1 - and/or alpha 2 -adrenoceptors are located postjunctionally in the urethral smooth muscle. Studies of the inhibition of [3 H]-dihydroergocryptine binding by the <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine revealed the alpha-adrenoceptor population to consist of approximately 25 % alpha 1 -adrenoceptors and 75 % alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. These proportions were confirmed in saturation studies with [3 H]-prazosin and [3 H]-rauwolscine. The sum of alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors labelled by these <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists was about equal to the number labelled by the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist [3 H]-dihydroergocryptine. Noradrenaline, as well as the <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and the <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, induced contractions of urethral ring preparations. Prazosin blocked contractions induced by phenylephrine {{to a greater extent than}} contractions induced by clonidine. The opposite was true for the inhibitory effect of rauwolscine. In addition to showing that both alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor binding sites exist in membrane preparations of the rabbit bladder base and urethra, the results reveal the presence of both adrenoceptor subtypes postjunctionally in the rabbit urethra; and both mediate contraction of the smooth muscle...|$|R

40|$|Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF- 1) is {{a master}} {{transcriptional}} factor. Under normal oxygen tension, HIF- 1 activity is usually suppressed due to the rapid, oxygen-dependent degradation {{of one of its}} two subunits, HIF- 1 alpha. Here we report that normoxic HIF- 1 activity can be upregulated through NO-mediated S-nitrosylation and stabilization of HIF- 1 alpha. In murine tumors, exposure to ionizing radiation stimulated the generation of NO in tumor-associated macrophages. As a result, the HIF- 1 alpha protein is S-nitrosylated at Cys 533 (through "biotin switch" assay) in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain, which prevents its destruction. Importantly, this mechanism appears to be independent of the prolylhydroxylase-based pathway that is involved in oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF- 1 <b>alpha.</b> <b>Selective</b> disruption of this S-nitrosylation significantly attenuated both radiation-induced and macrophage-induced activation of HIF- 1 alpha.

40|$|The {{effects of}} alpha 2 -adrenoceptor {{agonists}} (dexmedetomidine, oxymetazoline), {{alone or in}} combination with various alpha-adrenoceptor subtype-selective antagonists (CH- 38083, idazoxan, WB 4101, BRL 44408, ARC- 239, prazosin), on noradrenaline- and isoprenaline-induced lipolysis were investigated in human isolated abdominal subcutaneous fat cells. The rank order of potency of antagonists in preventing dexmedetomidine- and oxymetazoline-evoked suppression of isoprenaline-induced lipolysis was (pA 2 -values) : CH- 38083 (7. 69 and 7. 48) congruent to idazoxan (7. 5 and 7. 41) > BRL 44408 (7. 23 and 7. 19) congruent to WB 4101 (7. 13 and 7. 12) > prazosin (5. 18 and 5. 17) > ARC- 239 (4. 72, 4. 9). While CH- 38083 and idazoxan, non-subtype <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists and BRL 44408, a <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 A-adrenoceptor antagonist as well as WB 4101 potentiated the lipolytic effect of noradrenaline, ARC- 239, the <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 B-adrenoceptor antagonist failed to affect it.

40|$|Phentolamine (Phe) {{prevents}} the induction by epinephrine (E: 1800 nmol/kg, i. v.) of lung edema (LE) in urethane-anesthetized and bivagotomized rats in a dose-related manner (from 246 to 3933 nmol/kg, i. v.). Since Phe blocks and E activates both alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, the evidence {{does not allow}} us to link LE to <b>selective</b> (<b>alpha</b> 1 or alpha 2) or non-selective (alpha 1 + alpha 2) alpha-adrenoceptor activation. Accordingly, we tried to find out whether: phenylephrine (PE), a <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 -adrenoceptor agonist, and B-HT 920, a <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, would cause LE; prazosin (Praz), a <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, and yohimbine (Yoh), a <b>selective</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, would protect rats against LE caused by E or PE. We found that: 1) PE (from 736 to 5892 nmol/kg, i. v.), but not B-HT 920 (from 190 to 12200 nmol/kg, i. v.), caused LE, while both drugs increased arterial blood pressure; 2) Praz prevented induction of LE, whether by E (1800 nmol/kg, i. v.) or by PE (5892 nmol/kg, i. v.), in a dose-related manner (from 15 to 119 nmol/kg, i. v.). In contrast, Yoh was ineffective at doses up to 7675 nmol/kg, i. v. We conclude, therefore, that E-induced LE in urethane-anesthetized and bivagotomized rats strictly depends on alpha 1 -adrenoceptor activation. The outcome of E-induced LE is usually rat death, the incidence of which depends on the dose. Since alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists rank in the same order of potency for the induction of death as for that of LE, and since Phe and Praz protect from death at LE-preventing doses, {{there seems to be some}} link between LE and death, even though protection against death is obtained with doses of antagonists lower than those abolishing induction of LE. Finally, alpha 1 -agonists cause maximum arterial hypertension at all doses used, irrespective of induction of LE and of protective pretreatment against LE...|$|R
