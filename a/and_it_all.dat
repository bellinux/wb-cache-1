5|$|Nagapattinam was {{declared}} a municipality in 1866 during British times. It {{was promoted to}} a second grade municipality in 1986 and selection grade in 1998. From 1991, the municipal limits were expanded to include Nagore. The municipality has 36 wards {{and there is an}} elected councillor for each of those wards. The functions of the municipality are devolved into six departments: General administration/personnel, Engineering, Revenue, Public Health, Town planning <b>and</b> <b>IT.</b> <b>All</b> these departments are under the control of a Municipal Commissioner who is the supreme executive head. The legislative powers are vested in a body of 36 members, one from each of the 36 wards. The legislative body is headed by an elected chairperson, assisted by a deputy chairperson. The town became the district headquarters when the Nagapattinam district was created as a separate district.|$|E

Since many given names in Turkish are also gender-neutral, it is possible to describe someone without their sex being made known.|$|E

During an interview with CNN, Psy stated that [...] "the night before the music video shoot, I was watching Korea's Got Talent and saw him dance to Michael Jackson. His moves were ridiculous.

"Wannabe" [...] was {{completed}} in thirty minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a [...] "sudden creative frenzy." [...] During the session, Brown and Bunton {{came up with the}} idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha. We were in the studio <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> came together in this song." ...|$|E

In 1972–1973, the group recorded the albums Paul Butterfield's Better Days <b>and</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Comes Back, released by Albert Grossman's Bearsville Records. The albums reflected the influence of the participants and explored more roots- and folk-based styles. [...] Although without an easily defined commercial style, both reached the album chart.

500|$|In {{the words}} of Robert Smith, {{regarding}} the album's conception, [...] "I had two choices at the time, which were either completely giving in [...] or making a record of it and getting it out of me". He also claims he [...] "really thought that was it for the group. I had every intention of signing off. I {{wanted to make the}} ultimate 'fuck off' record, and then sign off [...] ". Smith was mentally exhausted during that period of time: [...] "I was in a really depressed frame of mind between 1981 and 1982".

500|$|The {{underside}} of the BT49 is shaped to create downforce through ground effect: air is accelerated under the car, reducing the air pressure beneath it and pushing the tyres down harder onto the track. This provides more grip and thus higher cornering speeds, but compared to conventional wings creates less of the drag that slows the car in a straight line. In its original form, the reduced pressure area under the car was sealed off with sliding skirts which rose and fell with {{the movement of the}} car to ensure no air could leak under it. According to Murray, the aerodynamics were the car's great strength: [...] "It had more [...] than any other car <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> came from the ground effect. We ran the car with no front wing at all and scarcely any at the back." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} Timberlake's {{tunnel vision}} {{of his love}} interest, with several voyeuristic references.

[...] According to The Huffington Posts Dean, Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] or his 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". However, his lyrics have an obsessive quality: [...] "A million people in a crowded room, but my camera lens is only set to zoom <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> becomes so clear." [...] Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on [...] "Tunnel Vision", Timberlake is lyrically [...] "playing the rom-com director": [...] "Just like a movie shoot, I’m zoomin’ in on you as we ride off into the sun." [...] According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times, Timberlake uses references to [...] "cameras and reflective surfaces" [...] {{to reflect on the}} [...] "changing nature of celebrity".|$|E

[...] Eric Blattberg of PlayStation Universe stated that the voice acting is a great feature of the game, that narrator Linda Hunt's [...] "authentic voice really helps set the attitude during the unbelievable ’s", and that Kratos [...] "acts and sounds like a badass." [...] Kristan Reed of Eurogamer wrote, [...] "Even the straight-laced voice work is handled with an expertise so sadly lacking in most other videogames." [...] Raymond M. Padilla of GameSpy, wrote that some of the voice acting and music tracks are overstated; one of his few dislikes in the game. Matt Leone of 1UP wrote that [...] "There's a mixture of in-game characters that speak to you and extremely nice CG sequences that show moments such as flashbacks, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> blends together surprisingly well." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E
500|$|Mileena's {{addition}} to the series was well received and she quickly {{became one of the}} most popular and recognizable Mortal Kombat characters. Her debut appearance in Mortal Kombat II was met with a favorable critical reception: The Miami Herald called Kitana and Mileena, [...] "leggy ladies who wear masks", an [...] "interesting step toward political correctness" [...] as [...] "a far cry from Little Miss Muffet," [...] Austin American-Statesman described them as [...] "far nastier than that martial-artless aerobics instructor from the first game," [...] while Nintendo Power called her [...] "beautiful, graceful, beguiling and strong, but most of all, deadly." [...] Some publications regarded her as the symbol of the game, including Consoles+ and Video & Games that each positioned her as an equivalent of, respectively, Cammy and Ryu from Super Street Fighter II. In the early 2010s, a retrospective article by IGN's Richard George listed [...] "the hot chicks" [...] as one of the reasons why Mortal Kombat II [...] "is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the series," [...] and UGO named [...] "the busty ninja sisters Kitana and Mileena" [...] as front characters of the Mortal Kombat franchise. GamesRadar UK wrote, [...] "we had two nigh-identical twins of svelte, slinky sex and gore...But then Milly took off her mask <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> went wrong.

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{said that}} [...] " [...] keeps the {{spotlight}} on her first record, adding non-LP singles like 'Into the Groove' for good measure, along with a bonus track of 'Where's the Party'. Since it is a dance album, it doesn't matter that 'Holiday' and 'Into the Groove' are here twice, once each in dub versions, because the essential grooves and music are quite different in each incarnation. It is true that some of this now sounds dated—these are quite clearly extended mixes from the mid 80s—but that's part of its charm, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> holds together quite well. Not essential, but fun." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau considered that [...] "the effects, repeats, breaks, and segues added by a star crew of remixers [...] amount to new music—this time the songs don't surface, they reach out and grab you". He also argued that You Can Dance reminded the audience that before MTV, they [...] "loved the way she sounded". Author J. Randy Taraborrelli noted that [...] "You Can Dance made one point clear about Madonna. While she was evolving into a serious pop star, musically she still knew how to host the best party." [...] He complimented the remixed versions of [...] "Holiday", [...] "Everybody", [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] and [...] "Into the Groove".|$|E
500|$|Author Dorothy Hobson has {{discussed}} {{the use of}} older female characters in British soap opera {{as a means of}} providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in EastEnders to the trio of Ena Sharples, Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from Coronation Street with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of [...] "'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series." [...] An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999. [...] The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because [...] "far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', {{there is a need for}} unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience." [...] Brown has spoken about the [...] "wonderful rapport" [...] she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, [...] "I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> went back to where it started." ...|$|E
500|$|Play {{started at}} three minutes past twelve on a [...] "sticky wicket", a wet pitch drying {{out as the}} sun began to shine. Only a small crowd was present <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> began well enough for Grace as he hit the opening ball of the match from Allan for four. But another firm shot off his legs sent the second ball {{straight}} to Midwinter and Grace was [...] "easily caught at square leg". Another wicket fell to Boyle in the next over and MCC were 5–2 but, with Hornby and Arthur Ridley seemingly settling in, they pushed the total on to 27. Then there was a change of bowling and Spofforth came on instead of Allan. Spofforth's first spell at Lord's was [...] "truly demonic". Within another 11 overs, MCC were all out, Spofforth taking 6–4 in just 5.3 overs including a hat-trick with the wickets of George Hearne, Alfred Shaw and George Vernon. Shaw and Morley took five wickets apiece as they dismissed the Australians for 41 but Gregory decided to open his second innings attack with Spofforth and Boyle. The decisive moment was Spofforth's second ball to Grace, which clean bowled him for 0. The MCC innings lasted just 50 minutes, Boyle taking 6–3 and Spofforth 4–16. As news of the proceedings spread, the crowd grew in the afternoon sunshine and they [...] "mobbed the Australians {{as they left the}} field in a spirit of non-partisan enthusiasm". Around 500 had been present at the start but the number grew to 4,742 by the end; the receipts of £119 7s were given to the Australians and MCC paid the expenses.|$|E

500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
