5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> the different sites. They found the different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E
5|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{lives in}} burrows among vegetation, at altitudes {{of up to}} , {{emerging}} at night to feed on plant matter and occasionally on <b>animals.</b> <b>From</b> January to March there is an annual migration to the sea to release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material sent {{to him by the}} naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship Astrolabe.|$|E

5|$|The Aalborg Zoo {{was opened}} in 1935 and {{typically}} houses 1,300 <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> 138 different species, including tigers, chimpanzees, zebra, elephants, giraffes, penguins and polar bears.

5|$|The foot-and-mouth scare of 2001 {{forced the}} zoo to close {{to protect the}} <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> {{possible}} infection. Since the zoo could not welcome any visitors, it faced significant financial losses.

Further help {{came in the form of}} a £1.9 million donation from an anonymous former resident of the city in early April, just as the zoo reopened.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Sardinian ichnusae {{subspecies}} is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies' phenotypic diversity.|$|E

5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed.

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size {{might be related to}} the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, in accordance with the trend that animals become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|De Materia Medica is {{the prime}} {{historical}} {{source of information about}} the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge <b>animals</b> <b>from</b> beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
