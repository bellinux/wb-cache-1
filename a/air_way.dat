500|$|Production of Beauty and the Beast {{was to be}} {{completed}} on a compressed timeline of two years rather than the traditional four-year Disney Feature Animation production schedule; {{this was due to}} the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdum version of the film. Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio, housed in the <b>Air</b> <b>Way</b> facility in Glendale, California. A smaller team at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida assisted the California team on several scenes, particularly the [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] number.|$|E
500|$|Until the mid-1990s, Disney Animation {{previously}} operated {{out of the}} <b>Air</b> <b>Way</b> complex, {{a cluster}} of old hangars, office buildings, and trailers in the Grand Central Business Centre, an industrial park {{on the site of}} the former Grand Central Airport about two miles (3.2km) east in the city of Glendale. Today, the DisneyToon Studios unit is currently based in Glendale. Disney Animation's archive, formerly known as [...] "the morgue" [...] (based on an analogy to a morgue file) and today known as the Animation Research Library, is also located in Glendale. Unlike the Burbank buildings, DisneyToon Studios and the ARL are located in nondescript office buildings near Disney's Grand Central Creative Campus. The 12,000-square-foot ARL is home to over 64 million items of animation artwork going back to 1924; because of its importance to the company, it requires visitors to agree to not disclose its exact location within Glendale.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scope of}} medical {{practice}} for EMTs is regulated by state law, and can vary significantly both among {{states as well}} as inside states. In general, EMTs provide what is considered basic life support and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, typical procedures provided by EMTs include CPR, Automated external defibrillation, mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of <b>air</b> <b>way</b> adjuncts such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, pulse oximetry, glucose testing using a glucometer, splinting (including spinal immobilization and traction splints), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of certain prescribed medications, including nitroglycerin, Metered-dose inhaler such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the EpiPen. EMT-Bs can typically also administer certain non-preprescribed drugs including oxygen, oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction). In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, states are rapidly changing protocols to permit EMT-Bs to administer naloxone as well.|$|E

50|$|Airborne {{pathogens}} or allergens often cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses and the lungs. This {{is caused}} by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body.

40|$|The human larynx is a {{versatile}} organ. Main functions are phonation, protection and {{regulation of the}} <b>air</b> <b>ways.</b> Patients suffer severely from the diagnosis of a laryngeal carcinoma of the stages T 3 and T 4. In most cases this diagnosis {{will lead to a}} total laryngectomy, which is usually dissatisfying in the sense of postoperative rehabilitation. The postoperative consequences include the loss of the native voice, the loss of regular <b>air</b> <b>ways</b> via mouth and nose, sense of smell, and the inability to build up an abdominal pressure. In this paper we focus on the feasibility of a modular larynx prosthesis which enables the laryngectomee to talk with his native voice, to breathe via the regular <b>air</b> <b>ways,</b> and to build up abdominal pressure. In particular we will give insights for a postoperative solution - a modular prosthesis based on a biomimetic self-regulating double clack-valve and on a voice reconstruction module, a so called vocoder. The vocoder is a device to reproduce the natural human voice. Most important for the use is an additional device required to analyze, conserve and manage voice characteristics of the patient before surgery. The self-regulating double clack-valve is designed to build up an abdominal pressure e. g. to cough. Therefore, our valve-system is working in both directions - a two-way valve system. By bridging the gap of the regular <b>air</b> <b>ways</b> lost by laryngectomy, the sense of smell and taste are restored. In the following we will present details and characteristics of these two main components required for a modular prosthesis of the larynx in laryngectomees...|$|R
