All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest.

25|$|Investment {{in public}} {{transport}} also has secondary {{positive effects on}} the local economy, with between $4 and $9 of economic activity resulting from every dollar spent. Many businesses rely on access to a transit system, in particular in cities and countries where access to cars is less widespread, businesses which require {{large numbers of people}} going to a same place {{may not be able to}} accommodate a large number of cars (concert venues, sport stadia, airports, exhibitions centres,...), or businesses where people are not able to use a car (bars, hospitals, or industries in the tourism sector whose customers may not have their cars). Transit systems also have an effect on derived businesses: commercial websites have been founded, such as Hopstop.com, that give directions through mass transit systems; in some cities, such as London, products themed on the local transport system are a popular tourist souvenir. Research in the Washington, DC area shows that public transport does <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> providing high-skill residents with access to high-skill jobs than it does mid-skill residents to mid-skill jobs and low-skill residents to low-skill jobs.|$|E

25|$|On 17 November Dagobert {{was arrested}} for disagreeing with the representatives. He was {{eventually}} acquitted {{and returned to his}} division where he died on 18 April 1794. Meanwhile, on 3 November the government replaced Turreau with François Amédée Doppet, another ex-doctor. Not wanting to wait for Turreau's successor, the representatives reappointed d'Aoust to command from 22 to 27 November. Doppet came to take command on 28 November but was practically ignored by the representatives on mission. On 7 December, d'Aoust with 10,000 men was defeated at Villelongue-dels-Monts by Ricardos with 8,000 Spanish and Portuguese troops. The Allies lost only 56 casualties while inflicting losses of 340 killed and wounded, 312 missing, 26 guns, two colors and 2,000 muskets on the French. Doppet decided to pull back to Perpignan for the winter under cover of a spoiling attack on Villelongue. D'Aoust led the attack on 18 December which overran the Portuguese camp and slaughtered its garrison. Doppet soon came down with illness and spent the next {{two and a half months}} in bed recovering. D'Aoust was finally in full command just in time to be blamed for a disaster. In the Battle of Collioure, a Spanish corps commanded by Lieutenant General Gregorio García de la Cuesta drove the French out of Collioure and Port-Vendres on 20 December, inflicting 4,000 casualties on the French. Fort Saint-Elme was betrayed to the Spanish by its traitorous commander. D'Aoust ordered a retreat on the 21st but the Spanish harassed it severely. Finally, the French fought their way back to the safety of Perpignan but their total losses in the debacle were 7,700 men and 23 guns. The government singled out the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees for disapproval despite the fact that its representatives were in large part responsible for the defeats. D'Aoust was arrested and the representatives on mission were recalled, except Fabre who was killed at Collioure. New representatives Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud and Pierre Soubrany celebrated their arrival by purging the army of both good and bad army officers. However, they subsequently did <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> keeping the army supplied while letting the army officers do their work. D'Aoust fell victim to the guillotine on 2 July 1794.|$|E

Although Bennett conceded that O'Rourke did <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> mixing the song, animosity arose between the two engineers. O'Rourke continued to remix more songs, and attempted to increase {{the drama of the}} album by reducing the contributions by the backing members of Wilco.

[...] While GameTrailers stated that Crisis Core [...] "doesn't take the easy way out and photocopy the source," [...] they found it, unlike Dirge of Cerberus, to be appealing.

500|$|Reviewers {{considered}} some of {{the smaller}} additions useful and others gimmicky. Critics appreciated the release's time-saving interface tweaks and overall pacing, but thought, for instance, that the vision camera integration added little to the game. While Electronic Gaming Monthly had wanted more development of the story, Mc Shea (GameSpot) was grateful that the story remained in the background of the game. [...] While Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that loading times had been improved, Geddes (IGN) considered them [...] "frustratingly long". Considering the previous game's slow start, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) thought that Trouble in Paradise did <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> introducing the player to the world by pre-loading player gardens with animals, plants, and decorations, and offering a tutorial.

500|$|The entire freeway {{road was}} built with {{expansion}} in mind; almost all bridges were built {{wide enough for}} expansion to the ultimate stage which includes {{as many as six}} main travel lanes in one direction, depending on location.

[...] Nick Butler from Sputnikmusic positively received the song and [...] "Dynamite" [...] saying [...] "Christina the pop singer is dead, long live Electro Christina". Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "welcome change" [...] from Aguilera's 2006 Back to Basics album, but stated that the song {{is not one of}} Aguilera's best singles. Fraser McAlpine from BBC wrote a mixed review for the song, recognizing Aguilera's maturity in the lyrics. However, he confessed that this could easily be a song by Pink, who might have made <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> making it her own. Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the singer was instantly overshadowed by fellow singer Britney Spears, but [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better" [...] proves that no other teen pop singer of her era has a better track than Aguilera, concluding that if the new songs are any indication, the title of the hits compilation [...] is no lie either.|$|E
