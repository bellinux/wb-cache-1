Cardinal O'Malley was named as the Visitor to the Archdiocese of Dublin and its suffragan sees, Ferns and Ossory and Kildare and Leighlin. He would report back to the Holy See on what steps had been taken since the reports were issued, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> needs to happen.|$|E
2500|$|Vinnie Mancuso of the New York Observer saw the {{animated}} adventures of Unit MNSKY {{as a metaphor}} of Gloria's journey in Los Angeles, stating [...] " [...] single thought reverberates through Gloria’s mind {{the same way it}} echoes constantly from Unit MNSKY: 'I can help!' She doesn’t so much follow leads as she does drift from place to place, from unhelpful person to unhelpful person, stone-faced and persistent the entire way, until she arrives in the hospital room of an elderly Howard Zimmerman, horribly crippled from Thaddeus Mobley’s attack decades earlier. The poster on the wall behind his bed for Pleonexia Pictures isn’t exactly subtle ('pleonexia' is a term for extreme greed) and neither are the answers he gives Gloria. But the words do help, if only to sum up Gloria’s entire existence in a brief science lesson [...] <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> is Gloria doing here besides floating and colliding, existing then not existing? Despair becomes hope, becomes despair, becomes hope. The question, really, is whether or not these brief moments of collision and substance are worth it, fleeting may they be. Unfortunately for Gloria, in this particular case it is not." ...|$|E
