5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create <b>an</b> <b>added</b> imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{similarities}} {{however, the}} gameplay offered many new changes. Instead of collecting four Jet Pods, the player-character must rescue four MuuMuus in each level before exiting. Another new addition {{is the new}} interface, which displays one of Robbit's travelling AI companions, a health bar, a timer and a jump-meter that displays {{whether or not the}} player is eligible for a triple jump. Other new additions include the power orbs as <b>an</b> <b>added</b> power-up and the ability to obtain Performance Medals. A certain Performance Medal may be awarded depending on how the player completes a level. For example, playing through a single level without firing any weapons will reward the player with the Flower Child medal. There are a total of twelve medals to collect.|$|E

5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has <b>an</b> <b>added</b> proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|In late March 1889, {{just as the}} izinDuna {{were about}} to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the {{amalgamation}} with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession {{from a number of}} London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as an impartial adviser, and to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession; as <b>an</b> <b>added</b> contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could.|$|E

Before release, Electronic Arts and Respawn unveiled a browser game collection of three Atari games (Asteroids, Missile Command, and Centipede) with <b>an</b> <b>added</b> Titanfall theme. Respawn also announced forthcoming Titanfall live action content from {{a partnership with}} Canadian post-production studio Playfight. Figurine manufacturer Threezero announced in March 2014 that they will produce 1/12 to 1/6 scale models of Titanfall Titans and pilots. A worldwide marketing campaign included large statues of Titans across multiple cities, and an advertising campaign that spanned billboards, television commercials, Twitch, the web, and YouTube.|$|E

5|$|Square {{announced}} in September 2001 a re-release of The Final Fantasy Legend for Bandai's WonderSwan Color unit; the Japan-exclusive port debuted March 2002 under the Japanese title. Toshiyuki Itahana redrew the concept art and graphics, and Square added animated cutscenes. Developers also enabled players {{to see in}} advance what a monster would transform into before eating meat left behind after battle. The port allowed playthrough of the intact original Game Boy version.

5|$|The song uses two-measure phrases that, {{aside from}} the choruses, use a i–III–IV–VI chord progression. The B minor chord is held for 1⅓ of a beat, and a {{relative}} transformation is then used to produce a second-inversion D major chord, which is held for 1⅔ of a beat. In the second measure, a first-inversion E major chord with <b>an</b> <b>added</b> ninth precedes a G major major seventh chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.|$|E
5|$|The whaling {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1857, when New Bedford accounted {{for half the}} U.S. fleet. Growing competition from the new petroleum industry, {{and the impact of}} the Civil War, ensured that it would not recover as it had in the past. The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire, with a new exterior and <b>an</b> <b>added</b> tower. The NBIS building became a local courthouse, and the center of commercial activity in New Bedford moved west, where it has remained, as textiles became the city's dominant industry. The whaling museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907. But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they had been before, and in 1927, the John R. Mantra made the last whaling voyage from the city and the last in American history.|$|E
