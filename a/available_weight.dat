60|$|But {{that brings}} me to my second contention, {{which is that we}} do not want such an army. I believe that the vast masses of men in uniform {{maintained}} by the Continental Powers at the present time are enormously overrated as fighting machines. I see Germany in the likeness of a boxer with a mailed fist as big as and rather heavier than its body, and I am convinced that when the moment comes for that mailed fist to be lifted, the whole disproportionate system will topple over. The military ascendancy of the future lies with the country that dares to experiment most, that experiments best, and meanwhile keeps its actual fighting force fit and admirable and small and flexible. The experience of war during the last fifteen years has been to show repeatedly the enormous defensive power of small, scientifically handled bodies of men. These huge conscript armies are made up not of masses of military muscle, but of a huge proportion of military fat. Their one way of fighting will be to fall upon an antagonist with all their <b>available</b> <b>weight,</b> and if he is mobile and dexterous enough to decline that issue of adiposity they will become a mere embarrassment to their own people. Modern weapons and modern contrivance are continually decreasing the number of men who can be employed efficiently upon a length of front. I doubt if there is any use for more than 400,000 men upon the whole Franco-Belgian frontier at the present time. Such an army, properly supplied, could--so far as terrestrial forces are concerned--hold that frontier against any number of assailants. The bigger the forces brought against it the sooner the exhaustion of the attacking power. Now, it is for employment upon that frontier, and for no other conceivable purpose in the world, that Great Britain is asked to create a gigantic conscript army.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability of}} a bit design to satisfy the two primary goals is {{constrained}} {{by a number of}} factors, most importantly the wellbore diameter. Other constraints are dictated by its intended use: formation type (hardness, plasticity, abrasiveness) to be drilled, operating environment at depth (temperature, pressure, corrosiveness), the capabilities of the equipment used in the operation (rotating speed, <b>available</b> <b>weight</b> on bit, pump horsepower) and the angle of the wellbore (vertical, directional, horizontal).

5000|$|Though {{construction}} {{costs would be}} lower than the Gen-2 version, Gen-1.5 would differ from other StarTram variants by requiring 4+ km/s to be provided by other means, like rocket propulsion. However, the non-linear nature of the rocket equation still makes the payload fraction for such a vehicle significantly {{greater than that of}} a conventional rocket unassisted by electromagnetic launch, and a vehicle with high <b>available</b> <b>weight</b> margins and safety factors should be far easier to mass-produce cheaply or make reusable with rapid turnaround than current [...] rockets.

40|$|Obesity {{represents}} a major global challenge from both healthcare and economic perspectives. Although lifestyle modifications {{aimed at reducing}} calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure remain the cornerstone of obesity management, pharmacotherapy {{can serve as a}} useful adjunct. Until recently, orlistat was the only medication registered for the treatment of obesity in the European Union (EU). A deeper understanding of the complexity of energy homeostasis has resulted in new pharmacological options for weight reduction. In 2015, two new antiobesity drugs were approved in the EU. These are a fixed combination of naltrexone/bupropion (Mysimba®) and liraglutide at a dose of 3. 0 mg (Saxenda®). In addition, lorcaserin (Belviq®) and a fixed combination of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia®) were introduced into the US market in 2012. However, the European Medicines Agency did not approve their use in the EU. The burden of previous weight loss agents that have been withdrawn due to safety concerns underlines the need for caution and close follow-up of patients undergoing pharmacological interventions for obesity treatment.

40|$|Currently in the {{development}} of Informational Retrieval (IR) systems, a set of keywords represents the semantics of a text document and after assigning weights to the set of keywords, they are used for indexing, searching and retrieval purposes. The current approaches for assigning weights are provided by an IR model that is used by an IR system. The main objective of the weight assignment was to provide ranking feature to an IR system. The retrieval performance of an IR system mainly depends on two parameters: extraction of a good set of keywords from text documents and the use of a good weight assignment approach. Most of currently <b>available</b> <b>weight</b> assignment approaches do not suggest any change to the weights of keywords after their initial assignment. It means that these approaches are static. In this study, we propose a dynamic weight assignment approach for weight assignment. In our opinion, using this proposed approach can be helpful in improving the retrieval performance of an IR system. This approach can be used as part of any IR model after initial assignment of weights...|$|E
