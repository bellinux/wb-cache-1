In July 2003, the Shire of Douglas overturned a motion to investigate {{the construction of a}} low-lying single lane bridge with a boom gate and a second ferry across the Daintree. Residents feared a bridge would threaten the rainforest due to a potential increase in traffic. Where as tourist operators stated a bridge would have boosted the local economy. Over the 2011 Easter long weekend, during a period when the ferry was free, tourists using the ferry dramatically increased and resorts were booked out.

50|$|One {{lesson that}} was learnt from World War I was that {{although}} the navy could stop ships on the open seas, little could be done about traders who acted as the middleman, importing materials the Nazis needed into their own neutral country then transporting it overland to Germany for a profit.

Diplomats from the Scandinavian nations, as well as Italy and the Balkan countries, who were also major suppliers to Germany, were given quota lists of various commodities and told they could import these amounts and no more, or action would be taken against them.|$|E

The methodology is that of regression equations and the data are from the US Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy. The regressions of annual costs on corresponding <b>annual</b> <b>quantities</b> of conservation have a good fit and positive and statistically significant coefficients. Hence the theory of energy conservation as a depleting resource industry or that of increasing cost is vindicated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to derive some economic indicators which can help in explaining the effect of government policies on sugar imports. The paper developed and statistically estimated an import demand function for sugar with the aim of providing quantitative estimates of the response of imports to the changing government policies. The results show that the factors which significantly affect sugar imports are: (1) the traditional non-policy variables: deflated imported price of sugar, and real income per capita. (2) the policy variables: deflated import subsidy, and year-ending stock. The estimated elasticities of deflated imported price, real income per capita, deflated import subsidy, and the ending stock are: - 0. 94, 1. 30, 0. 10, and - 0. 31 respectively.
