40|$|Background: In animals, neuropeptide {{signaling}} is {{an important}} component of circadian timekeeping. The neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) is required for several aspects of circadian <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> in Drosophila. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we investigate the anatomical basis for PDF’s various circadian functions by targeted PDF RNA-interference in specific classes of Drosophila neuron. We demonstrate that PDF is required in the ventrolateral neurons (vLNs) of the central brain and not in the abdominal ganglion for normal <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms.</b> Differential knockdown of PDF in the large or small vLNs indicates that PDF from the small vLNs is likely responsible for the maintenance of free-running <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> and that PDF is not required in the large vLNs for normal behavior. PDF’s role in setting the period of free-running <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> and the proper timing of evening activity under light:dark cycles emanates from both subtypes of vLN, since PDF in either class of vLN was sufficient for these aspects of behavior. Conclusions/Significance: These results reveal the neuroanatomical basis PDF’s various circadian functions and refine ou...|$|R

50|$|The European polecat's diet {{consists}} of mouse-like rodents, followed by amphibians and birds. Its most frequent prey {{item in the}} former Soviet Union is the common vole and rarely the red-backed vole. In large river floodlands, water vole are common prey. In spring and winter, amphibians (especially grass frogs and green toads) become important food items. Selective predation on male frogs by the polecat decreases the occurrence of polyandry in frog populations. However, because amphibians have little calorific value, the polecat never grows fat on them, {{no matter how many}} it consumes. In Central Europe, the diet in winter months is dominated by birds including quail, grey partridges, grouse, chickens, pigeons and passerines. Seasonal changes in the <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> is synchronised with the activity of the main prey. Some species only rarely preyed upon by the polecat include European hedgehogs, asp vipers, grass snakes and insects. In the British Isles, it commonly kills brown rats and European rabbits, and is capable of killing larger prey, such as geese and hares. One polecat was reported to frequently wait at a riverbank and catch eels, which it took back to its burrow. The polecat feeds on eels mostly during lengthy frosts when eels, unable to breathe air at regular intervals because of the ice, congregate at breathing holes. Unlike the stoat and weasel, the polecat readily eats carrion, including that of large ungulates. The European polecat hunts its prey by stalking it and seizing it with its canine teeth, killing the animal with a bite to the neck. This killing method is instinctive, but perfected with practice. The polecat sometimes caches its food, particularly during seasonal gluts of frogs and toads. Sometimes, the polecat does not kill these, but bites them {{at the base of the}} skull, thus paralyzing them and keeping them fresh for later consumption. Though they are normally shy around humans, naturalist Alfred Brehm in his Brehms Tierleben mentions an exceptional case in which three polecats attacked a baby in Hesse. During the winter period, when live prey is scarce, the European polecat may raid beehives and feed on the honey.|$|E

40|$|It was {{recently}} {{reported that the}} circadian clock machinery controls plasma levels of factor (F) VII, the serine protease triggering blood coagulation. Here, by exploiting the mouse model, {{this study showed that}} variations of photoperiod (i. e., winter or summer conditions or simulated chronic jetlag conditions) have a strong impact on plasma FVII activity levels. Under conditions mimicking summer or winter photoperiods, FVII activity showed a clear 24 h rhythmicity. Interestingly, mean daily FVII activity levels were significantly reduced in mice exposed to summer photoperiods. Behavioral <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> under both photoperiods were synchronized to LD cycles, and the amount of activity per 24 h was comparable. The authors also investigated the influence of chronic jetlag (CJL) on the FVII <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms,</b> which can be easily mimicked in mice through continuous abrupt shifts in the lighting schedule. The exposure of mice to simulated CJL of either consecutive westward or consecutive westward and eastward flights for 15 days did not abolish the behavioral <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> but was associated with a period significantly different from 24 h. Intriguingly, both types of CJL exerted a strong influence on FVII <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms,</b> which were virtually suppressed. Moreover, the mean daily FVII activity was significantly lower in the CJL than in the winter photoperiod condition. Taken together, these findings in mice provide novel insights into the modulation of FVII activity levels, which might have implications for human pathophysiology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Past {{research}} has shown that there is a circadian oscillator in laboratory rats that is entrained by restricted feeding schedules.

The second experiment examined resynchronization rates for a smaller group of animals, each treated as its own control.

However, <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> of male controls (housed alone) reentrained significantly faster than those of female controls. These experiments demonstrate a sex difference in (i) reentrainment rate by photic cues alone; (ii) donors' effect on female phase-shifters' resynchronization; and (iii) phase-shifters' resynchronization response to donor cues.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} in hamsters indicate that daily injections of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, can entrain the free-running circadian <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> {{to the period}} of the injections and that, after discontinuation of triazolam injections, {{the period of the}} free-running <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> remains close to that of the previous injection schedule for 20 - 50 cycles.

40|$|A single {{injection}} of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, can induce permanent phase {{shifts in the}} circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in free-running hamsters, with the direction and magnitude of the phase shifts being dependent on the circadian time of treatment. The shape of the "phase-response curve" to triazolam injections is totally different from that for light pulses. These findings raise the possibility that repeated injections of triazolam on a circadian basis might be capable of entraining the circadian pacemaker underlying the <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> of hamsters and that the entrainment pattern might differ from that observed in animals entrained to light pulses. To test this hypothesis, blind hamsters received intraperitoneal injections of triazolam (or vehicle) every 23. 34, 23. 72, 24. 00 or 24. 66 h for 19 - 20 days, {{and the effect of}} these injections on the period of the rhythm of wheel-running behavior was determined during and after treatment. Repeated injections of 0. 1 mg triazolam at these time intervals resulted in the entrainment of the <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> in 36 of 40 animals, whereas 0 of 40 animals entrained to vehicle injections. Importantly, the phase relationship between triazolam injections and the circadian <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> was dependent on the period of drug treatment and could be predicted from the phase-response curve to single injections of triazolam. These phase relationships are dramatically different from those observed between the <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> and 1 -h light pulses presented at similar circadian intervals.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{temporal and spatial}} separation of the <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> of ants in three Mediterranean habitats. The different abilities of ant species to tolerate thermal stress influenced {{the time of day}} and year during which they were active. Activity of ants followed environmental fluctuations both seasonally and daily. Two groups of ant species could be distinguished in the communities studied: i) heat-tolerant species that were diurnal and changed little in daily <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> throughout the year; ii) heat-intolerant species that shifted <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> from diurnal to crepuscular-nocturnal at higher temperatures, and had peak activity at temperatures lower than 30 °C. The different environmental conditions of each site affected the activity of different ant species and, therefore, community organization. In the forest areas, canopy cover created a heterogeneous environment of sunny and shaded areas throughout the day. Heat-intolerant species benefited from this spatial heterogeneity by lengthening their period of activity on hot days in areas covered by vegetation. This decreased the abundance of heat-tolerant species. Instead, in dry and open environments such as grasslands, the lack of trees caused the daily range of temperature to be sufficient to meet the requirements both of heat-adapted and cold-adapted species. This results in an increased diversity and a reduction in the dominance of heat-intolerant species. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Using biotelemetry, we tracked two sympatric ecomorphs of lake-dwelling Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus n = 23) over an annual cycle. Charr <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> reflected the above-surface photoperiod (including under ice), with diel <b>rhythms</b> of <b>activity</b> observed.

The experimental protocol was designed to determine whether the administration of carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, could mimic the effects of brief light pulses on gonadal function and/or the circadian rhythm of wheel-running activity in golden hamsters. Intraventricular injections of carbachol, administered singularly at discrete phase points throughout the circadian cycle, induced phase-dependent shifts in the free-running rhythm of activity similar to those caused by a brief light exposure. Injections of carbachol once every 23. 33 hr for 9 weeks entrained the <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> and stimulated the neuroendocrine-gonadal axis {{in a manner similar to}} that observed after the presentation of 1 -hr light pulses at this frequency.

After 21 - 25 days of this entrainment, light stimulus was shifted by 12 h, and animals were kept in shifted lighting for another 13 days. Food restriction led to a 0. 6 [deg] decrease in the mean Tc, which was expressed entirely during the day in night-fed hamsters and was evenly divided between day and night in day-fed animals. Thus, Tc and general <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> maintained the entrainment to light under both dietary conditions, with peak values for all occurring during the early night.

40|$|Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is {{well known}} as a {{circadian}} clock output factor, which drives daily <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> in many insects. The role of its homologue, pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH), in the regulation of circadian and/or circatidal rhythmicity in crustaceans is, however, poorly understood. The intertidal isopod crustacean, Eurydice pulchra has well-defined circatidal (12. 4 -hour) <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms.</b> In this study we show that this runs parallel to a circadian (24 -hour) cycle of chromatophore dispersion. As {{a first step in}} determining the potential role of PDH in these rhythms, we have identified a novel form of PDH expressed in this species. Because conventional homology cloning was unsuccessful, we employed immuno-identification and Edman microsequencing to determine the primary structure of this peptide. From this, cDNA cloning identified the nucleotide encoding sequence and thus facilitated description of PDH neurons by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. We show them to be morphologically similar to those that co-ordinate circadian <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> in insects. In animals expressing both tidal (activity) and circadian (chromatophore) rhythms, however, there was no evidence for a corresponding periodicity in the expression of pdh transcript, as determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in Eurydice heads.

Results obtained indicate that pinealectomy changes the free running period of locomotor <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm,</b> irrespective of season, while seasonal differences in activity-rest ratio were detected. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} seasonal regulation of circadian rhythms in lizards is accomplished, in part, via the output of the pineal gland...|$|E
40|$|The diurnal locomotory <b>activity</b> <b>rhythm</b> of Periplaneta {{americana}} {{is dependent}} upon the rhythmic secretion of a hormone from the neurosecretory cells of the sub-oesophageal ganglion. The phases of this secretory cycle are set by the stimulus of an environmental change from light to darkness (Harker, 1956, 1958 a), the beginnin...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{circadian}} clocks {{are based}} on multiple oscillators whose interactions allow the daily control of complex behaviors. The Drosophila brain contains a circadian clock that controls rest-activity rhythms and relies upon different groups of PERIOD (PER) -expressing neurons. Two distinct oscillators have been functionally characterized under light-dark cycles. Lateral neurons (LNs) that express the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) drive morning activity, whereas PDF-negative LNs are required for the evening activity. In constant darkness, several lines of evidence indicate that the LN morning oscillator (LN-MO) drives the <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms,</b> whereas the LN evening oscillator (LN-EO) does not. Since mutants devoid of functional CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), as opposed to wild-type flies, are rhythmic in constant light, we analyzed transgenic flies expressing PER or CRY in the LN-MO or LN-EO. We show that, under constant light conditions and reduced CRY function, the LN evening oscillator drives robust <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms,</b> whereas the LN morning oscillator does not. Remarkably, light acts by inhibiting the LN-MO behavioral output and activating the LN-EO behavioral output. Finally, we show that PDF signaling is not required for robust <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> in constant light as opposed to its requirement in constant darkness, further supporting the minor contribution of the morning cells to the behavior {{in the presence of}} light. We therefore propose that day-night cycles alternatively activate behavioral outputs of the Drosophila evening and morning lateral neurons...|$|R
40|$|In mammals, light {{input from}} the retina entrains central {{circadian}} oscillators located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The phase of circadian <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> {{with respect to the}} external light:dark cycle is reversed in diurnal and nocturnal species, although the phase of SCN rhythms relative to the light cycle remains unchanged. Neural mechanisms downstream from the SCN are therefore believed to determine diurnality or nocturnality. Here, we report a switch from nocturnal to diurnal entrainment of circadian <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> in double-knockout mice lacking the inner-retinal photopigment melanopsin (OPN 4) and RPE 65, a key protein used in retinal chromophore recycling. These mice retained only a small amount of rod function. The change in entrainment phase of Rpe 65 −/−;Opn 4 −/− mice was accompanied by a reversal of the rhythm of clock gene expression in the SCN and a reversal in acute masking effects of both light and darkness on activity, suggesting that the nocturnal to diurnal switch is due to a change in the neural response to light upstream from the SCN. A switch from nocturnal to diurnal <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> was also found in wild-type mice transferred from standard intensity light:dark cycles to light:dark cycles in which the intensity of the light phase was reduced to scotopic levels. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which changes in retinal input can mediate acute temporal-niche switching...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) is {{expressed}} in small and large ventral Lateral Neurons (sLNv and lLNv), among which sLNv are critical for <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> in constant darkness. Studies show that this is mediated by rhythmic accumulation and likely secretion of PDF from sLNv dorsal projections, which in turn synchronises molecular oscillations in downstream circadian neurons. Using targeted expression of a neurodegenerative protein Huntingtin in LNv, we evoke a selective loss of neuropeptide PDF and clock protein PERIOD from sLNv soma. However, PDF is not lost from sLNv dorsal projections and lLNv. These flies are behaviourally arrhythmic in constant darkness despite persistence of PDF oscillations in sLNv dorsal projections and synchronous PERIOD oscillations in downstream circadian neurons. We find that PDF oscillations in sLNv dorsal projections are not sufficient for sustenance of <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> in constant darkness and this is suggestive of an additional component that is possibly dependent on sLNv molecular clock and PDF in sLNv soma. Additionally, despite loss of PERIOD in sLNv, their <b>activity</b> <b>rhythms</b> entrain to light/dark cycles indicating that sLNv molecular clocks are not necessary for entrainment. Under constant light, these flies lack PDF from both soma and dorsal projections of sLNv, and when subjected to light/dark cycles, show morning and evening anticipation and accurately phased morning and evening peaks. Thus, under light/dark cycles, PDF in sLNv is not necessary for morning anticipation...|$|R
