5|$|Money was {{a problem}} in the McCartney house, as Jim only earned up to £6.00 a week, which was less than his wife. Because of their {{financial}} situation, the McCartney family could not afford to buy a television set until the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and never owned a car. His two sons were the first in the McCartney family line to buy cars. When The Beatles became successful, Jim had to leave Forthlin Road because fans used to stand outside <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> through the windows, which made him feel uncomfortable and nervous. Eight years after Mary's death, Jim married , on 24 November 1964. Williams had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ruth, whom Jim legally adopted.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E

5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> at his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are falling through is the chimney to the kitchen where Finn is being held captive. As such, Jake is eventually able to save Finn.|$|E

According to Grewal, [...] "Cho appeared to never go to class or read a book during his senior year," [...] adding that Cho just typed on his laptop, went to the dining hall and clipped his hair in the toilet, cleaning up the hair afterwards. Grewal also reported that he witnessed Cho riding his bicycle in circles {{in the parking lot}} of the dormitory.|$|E
500|$|San Francisco author Armistead Maupin {{was writing}} his {{installments}} of individual stories {{in a column}} for the San Francisco Chronicle titled Tales of the City in 1977. He remembered, [...] "I know what the battle did for me: It forced me to confront my own residual self-loathing <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> it down {{once and for all}} by coming out." [...] Maupin used the next installment of Tales to have one of his gay characters come out to his parents who, by remarkable coincidence, Maupin had previously established as Florida citrus growers.|$|E

500|$|Aikido {{training}} is mental {{as well as}} physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations. This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness. Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one [...] "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> death in the face" [...] in order to execute techniques without hesitation. As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.|$|E
500|$|Fearing {{that her}} mother was {{becoming}} too ill to cope, in 2005 (at age 17) Manning returned to the United States. She moved in with her father in Oklahoma City, where he was living with his second wife and her child. Manning got a job as a developer with a software company, Zoto, and was apparently happy for a time, but was let go after four months. Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions Manning had [...] "just locked up" [...] and would simply sit <b>and</b> <b>stare,</b> and in the end communication became too difficult. The boss told the newspaper that [...] "nobody's been taking care of this kid for a really long time." ...|$|E
500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the jurors in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> at you and have that stupid grin on his face. He would make your skin crawl." ...|$|E

Farmer Brown's boy rubbed his eyes <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>and</b> <b>stared.</b> There were Unc' Billy's tracks leading {{straight}} up to that tree and none leading away.

500|$|West {{was also}} {{regarded}} for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as [...] "obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win… {{a level of}} intensity so high it could melt lead". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: [...] "He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> into space. A loss just ripped his guts out." [...] Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a [...] "Jerry West Night", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: [...] "Jerry, you are, {{in every sense of}} the word, truly a champion… If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Vikings coach Dennis Green {{has been}} criticized for his {{decision}} to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before the end of regulation. Radio host Bob Sansevere, author of The Best Minnesota Sports Arguments, called it [...] "one of the all-time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport." [...] Of Green's play call, Peter King of Sports Illustrated wrote, [...] "Minnesota coach Dennis Green did a great job this year, but if he doesn't wake up <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> at the ceiling {{in the next few days}} and say out loud: 'Boy, I screwed that one up,' then he's not being honest with himself." [...] Nonetheless, local Minneapolis newspaper Star Tribune has contended that taking a knee was the correct decision due to the performance of the Vikings' offense, whose struggles that day were also noted by Carter.|$|E
500|$|... "Bart Gets Famous" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder. The episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor. Many {{characters}} from The Simpsons have catchphrases, including Homer ("D'oh!"), Bart ("Eat My Shorts", [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow, man!"), Marge (her worried [...] "hmmmm") and Maggie (her pacifier suck). The writers chose the phrase [...] "I didn't do it" [...] because they wanted a [...] "lousy" [...] phrase [...] "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular". It was also an intentional call {{back to the first}} season episode [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] where it was a catchphrase of Krusty the Clown. The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, Ned Flanders, Nelson Muntz, Mr. Burns and Barney Gumble. All of the characters gather around Lisa <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> at her with an anticipating look, and Lisa, displeased, finishes the episode by muttering [...] "If anyone wants me I'll be in my room", to which Homer says [...] "what kind of a catchphrase is that?" ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{commentary}} {{regarding the}} music video focused on Cyrus' increasingly provocative image. Margaret Eby of Daily News stated that she [...] "just can't stop strutting her stuff" [...] and [...] " [...] several barely-there outfits in the three-minute video." [...] A writer for The Huffington Post shared a similar sentiment, adding that [...] "even though her wardrobe {{is full of}} crop tops and itty bitty shorts, Miley Cyrus' skimpy outfits still manage to shock." [...] A writer for Rap-Up provided a favorable review, complimenting Cyrus for [...] " [...] up the heat" [...] in the [...] "striking visuals". Writing for VH1, Emily Exton joked that [...] "hip-hop's fledgling relationship with a former Disney star just got a little stronger", and noted that [...] "Jay-Z may have encouraged Miley’s love of twerking with his [...] "Somewhereinamerica" [...] shout-out, but it appears Sean is less interested in seeing Billy Ray's daughter shake her thing than having her walk around in dazzling heels <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> the camera down {{in the name of}} art." ...|$|E
500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was convinced that I was going to forget everything <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E
