25|$|Aristotle applies {{his theory}} of hylomorphism to living things. He defines a soul as that which makes <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> alive. Life is a {{property}} of living things, just as knowledge and health are. Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing.</b> Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.|$|E
25|$|Democritus (460 BC) {{thought that}} the {{essential}} characteristic of life is having a soul (psyche). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing.</b> His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul {{in exactly the same}} way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.|$|E
25|$|This {{rational}} soul is {{united to}} the body {{in such a manner}} that it is the only substantial form of the body. By virtue of his soul a man is a man, an animal, <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing,</b> a body, a substance and a being. Therefore, the soul gives man every essential degree of perfection; moreover, it gives the body a share in the act of being whereby it itself exists.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have pointed out}} a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism. According to Aristotle, <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing's</b> matter is its body, which needs a soul {{in order to be}} alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death. However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death. Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive. But if <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing's</b> matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.|$|R
500|$|Because of the {{difference}} of mass, the activity of life inside in <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing's</b> atoms would undergo many millennia before enough time passes for that <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> to take <b>a</b> single step. [...] Raëlians believe the universe is infinite {{in time and space}} and lacks a center. Because of this, one could not imagine where an ethereal soul would go.|$|R
25|$|Hylomorphism is {{a theory}} first {{expressed}} by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (322 BC). The application of hylomorphism to biology was important to Aristotle, and biology is extensively covered in his extant writings. In this view, everything in the material universe has both matter and form, and the form of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> is its soul (Greek psyche, Latin anima). There are three kinds of souls: the vegetative soul of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the animal soul, which causes animals to move and feel; and the rational soul, which {{is the source of}} consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man. Each higher soul has all of the attributes of the lower ones. Aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form, form cannot exist without matter, and that therefore the soul cannot exist without the body.|$|E

[...] However, in discussions of Raëlianism, cloning sometimes seems to refer not only to reproductive cloning, but also reproductive human cloning plus mind and/or brain transfer, or to a process of making adult clones. [...] Raëlians take this even further and say that humanity can attain eternal life through the science of cloning.|$|R

The Jack Pine, a stylized landscape with few elements– painted {{by a man who}} died the year he painted it, a man who would become an icon in his country— has encouraged various readings of Thomson's artistic motivations. Dennis Reid observes the limitations of received views of such popular artworks: [...] "The Jack Pine, is, after all, like all successful works of art <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> that grows or declines, unfolds or closes up, according to the nature {{and the quality of the}} attention it receives.

5|$|Trees {{create a}} visual {{impact in the}} same way as do other {{landscape}} features and give a sense of maturity and permanence to park and garden.

2500|$|Another {{approach}} to resolving the problem {{relies on a}} distinction between [...] "proximate" [...] and [...] "non-proximate" [...] matter. When Aristotle says that the body is matter for <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing,</b> he may be using the word [...] "body" [...] {{to refer to the}} matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this [...] "body" [...] remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same body after its death, he is using the word [...] "body" [...] to refer to the fully organized body, which (according to this interpretation) does not remain the same thing after death.|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) {{defined the}} soul, or Psūchê (ψυχή), as the [...] "first actuality" [...] of a {{naturally}} organized body, and argued against its separate existence {{from the physical}} body. In Aristotle's view, the primary activity, or full actualization, of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> constitutes its soul. For example, the full actualization of an eye, as an independent organism, is to see (its purpose or final cause). Another example is that the full actualization {{of a human being}} would be living a fully functional human life in accordance with reason (which he considered to be a faculty unique to humanity). For Aristotle, the soul is the organization of the form and matter of a natural being which allows it to strive for its full actualization. This organization between form and matter is necessary for any activity, or functionality, to be possible in a natural being. Using an artifact (non-natural being) as an example, a house is a building for human habituation, but for a house to be actualized requires the material (wood, nails, bricks, etc.) necessary for its actuality (i.e. being a fully functional house). However, this does not imply that a house has a soul. In regards to artifacts, the source of motion that is required for their full actualization is outside of themselves (for example, a builder builds a house). In natural beings, this source of motion is contained within the being itself. Aristotle elaborates on this point when he addresses the faculties of the soul.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} {{of life is}} controversial. The current definition is that organisms maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. However, many other biological definitions have been proposed, {{and there are some}} borderline cases of life, such as viruses. Throughout history, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by [...] "life" [...] and many theories on the properties and emergence of living things, such as materialism, the belief that everything is made out of matter and that life is merely a complex form of it; hylomorphism, the belief that all things are a combination of matter and form, and the form of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> is its soul; spontaneous generation, the belief that life repeatedly emerges from non-life; and vitalism, a now largely discredited hypothesis that living organisms possess a [...] "life force" [...] or [...] "vital spark". Modern definitions are more complex, with input from a diversity of scientific disciplines. Biophysicists have proposed many definitions based on chemical systems; there are also some living systems theories, such as the Gaia hypothesis, the idea that the Earth itself is alive. Another theory is that life is the property of ecological systems, and yet another is elaborated in complex systems biology, a branch or subfield of mathematical biology. Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions.|$|E

40|$|Aristotle's Parva Naturalia {{culminates in}} {{definitions}} of the stages of the life cycle, from the generation of <b>a</b> new <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> up to death. Aristotle thinks of <b>living</b> <b>things</b> as food burners: they nourish themselves, and so, in some cases, possess the capacity for higher living functions such as perceiving. Their burning must be balanced, {{if it is to}} continue - and one way they do this is through breathing. Nonetheless, all such burning naturally develops and declines, thus describing the life span of the being concerned. This book provides a detailed reading {{of the end of the}} Parva Naturalia ("On the Length and Shortness of Life", "On Youth, Old Age, Life and Death", including "On Breathing"), and shows how the investigation into life begun in the De Anima is completed in the Parva Naturalia, culminating in {{definitions of the}} stages of the life cycle, from generation of <b>a</b> new <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> up to death, using the activity of nutrition...|$|R
