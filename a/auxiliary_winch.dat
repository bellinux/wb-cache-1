40|$|Winching {{is among}} the most common logging {{techniques}} in small-scale forestry, but it is inefficient and hard on the operators. The authors conducted a comparative test to determine the benefits of introducing an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>winch</b> that automatically returned the winch cable to the loading site. Such device would make it unnecessary for a crew member to walk down to the winch and pull the cable back to the loading site. The tests were conducted in central Italy, on the Tuscan hills. The study involved six volunteers, who were meant to cover a wide range of age and physical fitness characteristics and were considered representative of the regional logging workforce. Physiological workload was determined by measuring the operators’ heart rate for a half-day individual work session. Performance was determined by stop-watching all winching cycles, with and without the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>winch.</b> The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>winch</b> improved the efficiency of downhill winching, allowing operation by two workers only, instead of three. Winching cost decreased between 20 and 35 %, while physiological workload decreased between 7 and 30 %, depending on the operator...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{characteristics of}} the evacuation and technical rescue heavy vehicles. Heavy tactical evacuation and technical rescue vehicles are built on the chassis of tactical vehicles with high loading capacity, generally with 8 x 8 driving system. In each analysed case, the vehicles {{are one of the}} family members of the tactical heavy-duty vehicles. Evacuation equipment of such vehicles is as follows: main winch, arm or towing device, and lifting equipment. A domestically manufactured vehicle, developed under the project No. 356 /BO/ 1, was presented. The testing process that such type of vehicles, including the above mentioned, are subject to have been discussed herein. Revision of parameters received and as specified in the requirements and relevant standards enforces an adequate scope of testing. In the case of the MAMUT vehicle, the following requirements have been checked: structural design, engine, driving system, cab, main winch, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>winch,</b> winch for self-recovery, hydraulic crane, hydraulic hoisting and towing equipment, power generator, electrical system, safety, ergonomics and technical aesthetics, specialist equipment, secret camouflage, and transportability...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} vehicle, control system, {{and waste}} and water scavenging system were designed and fabricated with essentially the full {{capabilities of the}} vehicle system proposed by ARD Environmental. A test tank mockup, including riser and decontamination chamber were designed and fabricated, and approximately 830 cubic feet of six varieties of waste simulants poured. The tests were performed by ARD Environmental personnel at its site in Laurel, Maryland, from 4 / 22 / 97 through 5 / 2 / 97. The capabilities tested were deployment and retrieval, extended mobility and productivity, the ability to operate the system using video viewing only, retrieval after simulated failure, and retrieval and decontamination. Testing commenced with deployment of the vehicle into the tank. Deployment was accomplished using a crane and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>winch</b> to position the vehicle and lower it through the decontamination chamber, into the 36 `` diameter x 6 ` high riser, and touch down on the waste field in the tank. The initial mobility tests were conducted immediately after deployment, prior to sluicing, as the waste field exhibited {{the greatest amount of}} variation at this time. This test demonstrated the ability of the vehicle to maneuver over the simulated waste field, and the ability of the operator to work with only video viewing available. In addition, the ability of the vehicle to right itself after being turned on its side was demonstrated. The production rate was evaluated daily through the testing period by measuring the surface and estimating the amount of material removed. The test demonstrated the ability of the vehicle to reduce the waste surface using 400 psi (nominal) water jets, scavenge water and material from the work area, and move to any location, even in the relatively confined space of the 20 ` diameter test tank. In addition, the ability to sluice to a remote scavenging module was demonstrated. The failure mode test demonstrated the ability to retrieve a stuck vehicle by pulling on the tether, even if the vehicle wheels were locked or the vehicle was on its side. Line pull required to retrieve the vehicle was measured, and side load on the riser calculated from the line pull and line angles. Finally, the decontamination test demonstrated the ability to effectively clean the umbilical and vehicle. The issues addressed and resolved during the testing were: Feasibility of deploying a vehicle- based system, mobility, production rate and limitation of water in the tank during sluicing, mining strategy, operator efficiency, vehicle recovery, and decontamination. Water usage and waste removal rates were used to estimate the time and water usage requirements for cleaning a Hanford SST...|$|E
