40|$|Whenever a rule is contractible, the law must {{establish}} separate {{rules governing}} how private parties can contract around the default legal treatment. To date, contract theorists have not developed satisfying theories {{for how to}} set “altering rules,” the rules that establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for displacing a default. This Article argues that when setting <b>altering</b> rules, efficiency-minded lawmakers should consider the costs of <b>altering,</b> the costs of various kinds of error, {{and the possibility that}} <b>altering</b> can impose negative externalities on others. There are two broad reasons for structuring <b>altering</b> rules that deviate from merely minimizing the transaction cost of <b>altering.</b> First, the Article develops conditions in which minimizing the costs of party error (especially nondrafter error) and third-party error (especially judicial error) will be paramount. It proposes a variety of <b>altering</b> interventions—including “train-and-test” <b>altering</b> rules, “clarity-requiring” <b>altering</b> rules, “password” <b>altering</b> rules, and “thought-requiring” <b>altering</b> rules—that might be deployed to reduce <b>altering</b> error. Second, when externality concerns or paternalistic concerns to protect the contractors themselves are insufficient to justify a full-blown mandatory rule, lawmakers might at times usefully impose “impeding” <b>altering</b> rules, which deter subsets of contractors from contracting for legally disfavored provisions. Impeding <b>altering</b> rules produce an intermediate category of “quasimandatory” or “sticky default” rules, which manage but do not eliminate externalities and paternalism concerns. These two deviations from transaction-cost minimization can often be usefully complemented by a third category of <b>altering</b> rules—what this Article calls “altering penalties”—which penalize one or both contractors who utilize disfavored <b>altering</b> methods. <b>Altering</b> penalties can channel contractors’ <b>altering</b> efforts toward means that better reduce error or better control externalities or paternalism. More explicitly theorizing <b>altering</b> rules as a distinct category of law can make visible legal issues that have largely gone unnoticed and lead toward the development of more defensible choices about how best to regulate opt-out...|$|R

5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that <b>alters</b> trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also <b>alters</b> the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the main}} {{objective}} is to navigate through seven worlds to {{reach the end of}} the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access hidden worlds, the player will need to locate portals which are scattered throughout the game's levels. Portals are usually locked and require keys to open. Furthermore, the exploration of these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently <b>alters</b> some sprites and the overworld map's colour scheme.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which <b>alters</b> sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E

5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but <b>alters</b> the trait {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift <b>alters</b> {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
