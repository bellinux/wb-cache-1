Even worse were the Khamsin dust storms which blow once every 50 days for a few hours or several days, turning the atmosphere into <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> floating sand particles flung about by a hot southerly wind. The troops and their commanders, unused to the conditions, suffered considerably from heatstroke and thirst during these early patrols. One such patrol, returning during the hottest part of the day after a sleepless night far from base, and very little water, suffered casualties of 160 men who collapsed from heat exhaustion.|$|E

A second standard gauge railway line from Romani to Mahamdiyah on the Mediterranean coast was completed by 9 June.

[...] Many outlets described the game as a disappointment, with Eurogamer noting that it [...] "launched to mixed reviews and polarised fans". Some critics also described the game as a missed opportunity, such as Joe Juba of Game Informer, who concluded, 'Mass Effect: Andromeda is fun, and the important parts work ...

The most notorious incident arose in August 1989, when Ozzy was arrested for attempted murder after he had returned from a peace festival in Moscow, USSR, and tried to strangle Osbourne in <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and drugs. After the incident, he spent six months in rehabilitation {{as a result of his}} actions, after which time, Osbourne said she regained her strength in their relationship and did not press charges.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Pitchforks Brent DiCrescenzo panned the album's lyrics as [...] "overly melodramatic".

NMEs Victoria Segal panned its music as [...] "background" [...] and accused it of [...] "chas 'crossover'", with [...] "grey rock sleet masquerading as a storm beneath <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> 'experimental' textures." [...] Scott Seward of The Village Voice facetiously commended Reznor for [...] "once again ... pioneering the marriage of heavy guitars, moody atmospherics, electronic drones and beats, and aggressive singing. Just like Killing Joke 20 years ago." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was even less receptive, writing that [...] "Reznor delivers double-, every second remixed till it glistens like broken glass on a prison wall. Is the way he takes his petty pain out on the world a little, er, immature for a guy who's pushing 35? Never mind, I'm told—just immerse in the music".|$|E
2500|$|Pitchfork Media commented, [...] "Over a frantic, Calvin Harris-produced, Guetta-meets-'Sandstorm' beat on her sixth record's lead-off single, Rihanna repeats {{these words}} almost 20 times. 'We Found Love' ranks among Ri's best singles because it recognizes that there's {{not much more}} {{that needs to be}} said: in three and a half minutes, the line moves from being a great pop lyric to a triumphant mantra to {{something}} suggestive of a whole spectrum of unspoken emotion. The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this secret." [...] Allmusic chose the song as a highlight on Talk That Talk, and wrote about the [...] "singer's ecstatic vocal than Calvin Harris' shrill, plinky production". Los Angeles Times commented that the song was an [...] "ode for bad love" [...] and added it [...] "wouldn't be out of place at Electric Daisy Carnival". The New York Times writer commented [...] "'We Found Love' almost criminally recalls the swinging Crystal Waters singles, with triumphant percussion somewhere between church and seventh-inning stretch." [...] Billboard magazine also praised the song, saying that: [...] "Through <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> glitter and bliss, Rihanna emerges to let us find a gorgeous hook in a hopeless place, and Calvin Harris becomes a household name." [...] As of January 2015, Billboard named [...] "We Found Love" [...] as the best song of the 2010s (so far). USA Today considered the song to be a highlight on the set, commenting that Rihanna sings [...] "bistfully". [...] Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "U.K. club king Calvin Harris trades Rihanna's usual somber synths for disco ecstasy on 'We Found Love,' a song that builds and builds to a climax that's so arena-ready it practically begs for someone to blow a vuvuzela".|$|E
