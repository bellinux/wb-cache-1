He was not fastidious and both were mental pabulum--of a sort--together with whatever lay between these extremes.

50|$|The APEXC is <b>an</b> <b>incredibly</b> <b>simple</b> machine.Instruction {{and data}} words are always 32 bits long. The {{processor}} uses integer arithmetic with 2's complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits long. The APEXC has no RAM, {{except for a}} 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, {{for a total of}} 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket calculator is faster.One oddity {{is that there is no}} program counter: each machine instruction includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder-based memory.The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching (which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may simulate it.Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there is no other adequate word.Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a stop instruction, which enables the operator to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter the address of another program and run it.Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output could be fed to a printer ('teletyper') unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with a special 32-key keyboard (each tape row had 5 data holes (<-> bits), which makes 32 differentvalues).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{show that}} on-shell {{recursion}} relations hold for tree amplitudes in generic two derivative theories of multiple particle species and diverse spins.

This result pertains to a broad class of theories, There is gathering evidence that on-shell amplitudes are far simpler than one would naively expect from conventional quantum field theory.

40|$|The niobium-phosphorus {{triple bond}} in [P=-Nb(N[Np]Ar) 3]- (Np = CH 2 tBu; Ar = 3, 5 -Me 2 C 6 H 3) has {{produced}} the first case of P 4 activation by a metal-ligand multiple bond. Treatment of P 4 with the sodium salt of the niobium phosphide complex in weakly-coordinating solvents {{led to the formation}} of the C 3 -symmetric cyclo-P 3 anion, while in THF, it {{led to the formation of}} the cyclo-P 5 anion [(Ar[Np]N) ([eta] 4 -P 5) Nb(N[Np]Ar) 2]-. The latter represents a rare example of a substituted pentaphospha-cyclopentadienyl ligand and may be interpreted as the product of trapping an intermediate h 5 -P 5 structure through the migration of one anilide ligand. A search for methods of activating P 4 that avoid tedious metal-mediated steps led to the discovery of <b>an</b> <b>incredibly</b> <b>simple</b> procedure involving only commercial reagents. Irradiation of solutions containing P 4 and readily available 1, 3 -dienes produced bicyclic organic diphosphanes in an atom-economical, one-step protocol. Use of 2, 3 -dimethylbutadiene allowed the isolation of the bicyclic diphosphane P 2 (C 6 H 10) 2 in gram-quantities, but other dienes such as 1, 3 -butadiene, isoprene, 1, 3 -pentadiene, and 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene also provided evidence for incorporation of P 2 units via double Diels-Alder reactions. Theoretical investigations provided support for the formation of P 2 molecules from photo-excited P 4. Investigations into the physical and chemical characteristics of P 2 (C 6 H 10) 2 uncovered an unprecedented stability towards cleavage of the P-P bond relative to other diphosphanes. P 2 (C 6 H 10) 2 exhibits a flexible, yet robust bicyclic framework containing lone pairs disposed at an angle of ca. 45 °, and proved to be ideally suited to form multiple bridges between two metal centers. Dinuclear complexes containing tetrahedral, zero-valent group 10 metals bridged by three diphosphane ligands were investigated in detail. These contain D 3 h-symmetric {M 2 P 6 } barrelene cages with metal-metal distances of 4 Å, and exhibited substitution reactions where the cages remain intact. Alternatively, diphosphane P 2 (C 6 H 10) 2 allowed for unprecedented selectivity towards functionalization of a single phosphorus lone pair. Additional functionalization proceeds at a significantly slower rate, thus enabling the selective isolation of various phosphoranes (EP 2 (C 6 H 10) 2 and E 2 P 2 (C 6 H 10) 2; E = O, S, N-R). Metalation reactions with the bulky diiminodiphosphorane ligand (MesN) 2 P 2 (C 6 H 10) 2 allowed for multiple metal complexes, showing that such ligands provide an attractive pre-organized binding pocket for transition metals, as well as post-transition metals. by Daniel Tofan.
