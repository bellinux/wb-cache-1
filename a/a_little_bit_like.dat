R. R. Tolkien. He reprised his roles as Smaug and the Necromancer for [...] (2013) and [...] (2014). For the motion-capture aspect of the films, he used a suit and facial markers to highlight the dragon's expressions and movements. Cumberbatch told Total Film [...] "You just have to lose your shit on a carpeted floor, in a place that looks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> a mundane government building. It was just me as well, with four static cameras and all the sensors." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart's ballet {{teacher was}} voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was {{designed}} to look <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> her. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them {{with her to the}} recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked very hard on getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had {{played a role in the}} episode [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. David Mirkin realized that Brooks was [...] "dying to do the show" [...] and asked him if he would be willing to do a guest part, and he agreed. Many of the writers were fans of Brooks, and Matt Groening described the chance to have him guest star as [...] "an incredible honor".|$|E
500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E

500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E
500|$|The song has {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH {{said that the}} song was [...] "probably the best thing here [...]" [...] He also complimented the [...] "brilliant bridge" [...] and {{the ending of the}} song where the caller gets through to her voicemail. Popjustice gave the song a positive review: [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> Gwen's 'What You Waiting For?' meets Timbaland's 'The Way I Are' meets about fifty other things... The structure's quite exciting... there is something tumultuously brilliant about Beyoncé's contribution that makes everything seem fine and as if it was the plan all along." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said that [...] "The much talked-about Beyoncé collaboration 'Telephone', which—with its double-time beat and rapid-fire verses—proves {{to be one of the}} most adrenaline-pumped songs that Gaga has yet crafted, the whole thing feeling like it's about to veer of [...] the tracks at any moment simply due to the giddy excitement shared between the two divas, easily turning it into the unquestioned highlight of The Fame Monster". Mikael Woods from Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "Telephone" [...] is [...] " [...] a carefully considered meditation on how annoying it is when a dude keeps calling you while you're throwing down at the club." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." ...|$|E

That being said, if O God Save Us All is more of the same, it’s more of the same done better. The album really shines in Disciple’s discography for several of the following reasons. First of all, the message of the album is laid out like a story that unfolds with each new chapter. The music is balanced and the flow of the album is very well done. There is a nice mix of radio-friendly, ballad, and too-hard-for-radio screaming. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that a song or two feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> Disciple’s great This Might Sting a Little album." ...|$|E

In a behind-the-scenes video, Robyn said, [...] "It's {{going to be looking}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> what I'm going to bring on tour.

National Public Radio broadcast the concert later that summer. [...] "Piano Pedal Rag", a new Carmichael tune, was performed during the concert.

The very first drawing was created as a [...] "signature" [...] to a note, and represented Casali herself with freckles, large eyes and long fair hair. She said later of these cartoons: [...] "I began making little drawings to express how I felt...

'Starships' feels <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> retreating into a musical pocket and trying a little too hard to insure another pop chart hit. The result is pleasurable but not particularly memorable." [...] Bloggers for Billboard magazine, Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez, criticized the track for, [...] "...monstrous pop hooks that overshadow its throwaway lyrics", while stating that it is, [...] "the most polarizing single in Minaj's career to date". The pair also noticed that Minaj seemed to be exploring her [...] "musical identity" [...] through singing {{instead of focusing on}} her strengths. Slant Magazine stated that [...] "Starships (along with 'Pound the Alarm', 'Whip It', and 'Automatic') are [...] "retro-techno-pop earsores [...] indiscriminately arranged bits of LMFAO's 'Sexy and I Know It', Rihanna's 'We Found Love', and pretty much any recent Britney Spears or Katy Perry song you can name" [...] adding that [...] "For the chorus to her self-affirmation anthem, Minaj shouts 'Starships were meant to fly!', echoing Katy Perry's 'Baby, you're a firework!' for its uncomprehending intuition that if something is in the sky then it must also be inspiring." ...|$|E
