40|$|Shared {{virtual memory}} systems provide the {{abstraction}} {{of a shared}} address space {{on top of a}} messagepassing communication architecture. The overall performance of an SVM system therefore depends on both the raw performance of the underlying communication mechanism and the e#ciency with which the SVM protocol uses that mechanism. The <b>Automatic</b> <b>Update</b> Release Consistency (AURC) protocol was proposed to take advantage of simple memory-mapped communication and <b>automatic</b> <b>update</b> support to accelerate a shared virtual memory protocol. However, there has not yet been a real system on which an implementation of this protocol could be evaluated. This paper reports our evaluation of AURC on the SHRIMP multicomputer, the only hardware platform that supports an <b>automatic</b> <b>update</b> mechanism. <b>Automatic</b> <b>update</b> propagates local memory writes to remote memory locations automatically. We compare the AURC protocol with its all-software counterpart protocol, Home-based Lazy Release Consistency (HLRC). By int [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Shared {{virtual memory}} is a {{software}} technique to provide shared memory {{on a network}} of computers without special hardware support. Although several relaxed consistency models and implementations are quite effective, {{there is still a}} considerable performance gap between the "software-only" approach and the hardware approach that uses directory-based caches. <b>Automatic</b> <b>update</b> is a simple communication mechanism, implemented in the SHRIMP multicomputer, that forwards local writes to remote memory transparently. In this paper we propose a new lazy release consistency based protocol, called <b>Automatic</b> <b>Update</b> Release Consistency (AURC), that uses <b>automatic</b> <b>update</b> to propagate and merge shared memory modifications. We compare the performance of this protocol against a software-only LRC implementation on several Splash 2 applications and show that the AURC approach can substantially improve the performance of LRC. For 16 processors, the average speedup has increased from 5. 9 under LRC, to 8. 3 und [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are {{data storage}} devices that use {{solid-state}} memory to store persistent data. Flash memory is {{the de facto}} nonvolatile technology used in most SSDs. It {{is well known that}} the writing performance of flash-based SSDs is much lower than the reading performance {{due to the fact that}} a flash page can be written only after it is erased. In this work, we present an SSD cache architecture designed to provide a balanced read/write performance for flash memory. An efficient <b>automatic</b> <b>updating</b> technique is proposed to provide a more responsive SSD architecture by writing back stable but dirty flash pages according to a predetermined set of policies during the SSD device idle time. Those <b>automatic</b> <b>updating</b> policies are also tested and compared. Simulation results demonstrate that both read-ing and writing performance are improved significantly by incorporating the proposed cache with <b>automatic</b> <b>updating</b> feature into SSDs...|$|R

40|$|The Internet-of-Things is an {{open source}} {{architecture}} for enabling information sharing between globally connected devices, which existing system do not offer. However, the Internet-of-Things induces the single points of failure and long communication delay. Thus, the Sensible Things platform is proposed, which is a fully distributed system. So far, it has produced components to share sensor and actuator information on the Internet. In the past, manual work was problematic since physical access could be difficult on remote locations. There were also difficulties to detect if the devices were actually working properly. Therefore, the thesis mainly focuses on the functionality which is able to check status, update software automatically and restart the devices with new software. The thesis first analyzes the mechanism of the <b>automatic</b> <b>updating</b> and describes the methods for it. The <b>automatic</b> <b>updates</b> of demonstrator is implemented in My-Eclipse.
