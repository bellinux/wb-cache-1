40|$|This report {{addresses}} the opportunities available to make multifamily housing more affordable by using efficiency practices in housing rehabilitation. Use {{of the energy}} conservation measures discussed in this report enables developers of multifamily housing to substantially reduce annual energy costs. The reduction in natural gas usage {{was found to be}} approximately 10 Btu per square foot per heating degree-day. For an <b>average</b> Chicago <b>heating</b> <b>season</b> with 6, 455 heating degree-days, an apartment of 1, 100 ft would save about 710 therms of natural gas and 2 lower its gas energy costs by approximately $ 355. This dollar savings exceeds the costs of one month of affordable housing for a family earning $ 14, 000 per year. The energy conservation measures also improve the typical net cash available per dwelling unit to the owner of the building by more than $ 250 per year after debt service. The study focuses on a number of Chicago multifamily buildings. The buildings were examined to compare energy efficiency measures that are commonly found in multifamily building rehabilitation with the high-energy-efficiency (HE) techniques that are currently available to community developers but are often unused. The HE measures include R- 43 insulation in attics, R- 19 insulation in exterior walls, low-emissivity coatings on windows, air infiltration sealing, an...|$|R

40|$|Green roof {{installation}} in the United States {{is growing}} at a significant rate. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this growth including rainwater runoff reduction and aesthetic benefits. Energy performance evaluations of green roofs, the subject of this study, are also becoming available. This monitored study is an evaluation of summer and winter energy performance aspects of a green roof on a 2 -story central Florida university building addition that was completed in 2005. An earlier report on this study was published through the 2006 Symposium on Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates. This report reviews these earlier results and provides second-summer results which show significant performance improvements for the green roof compared with the first summer results. One half of the two-story project building?s 3, 300 square foot project roof is a light-colored, conventional flat membrane roof, the other half being the same membrane roof covered with 6 ? to 8 ? of plant media and a variety of primarily native Florida vegetation up to approximately 2 feet in height to create an extensive green roof. Analysis of 2005 summer data from the first year the green roof was installed indicates significantly lower peak roof surface temperatures for the green roof compared with the conventional roof and a significant shift in when the peak green roof temperature occurs compared to the conventional roof. Data analysis of the same 2005 period also shows lower heat fluxes for the green roof. Calculations show the green roof to have an <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> flux of 0. 39 Btu/ft 2 ?hr or 18. 3 % less than the conventional roof?s <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> fluxrate of 0. 48 Btu/ft 2 ?hr. Analysis of 2006 summer data when the green roof was more established and conventional roof somewhat darker, shows even greater temperature and heat flux differences between the two roofs. The weighted <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> flux rate over the 2006 summer period for the green roof is 0. 34 Btu/ft 2 ?hr or 44. 1 % less than the conventional roof?s <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> flux rate of 0. 60 Btu/ft 2 ?hr. An additional heat flux analysis was performed for an April 1 st 2006 through October 31 st 2006 monitoring period to provide an estimate of heat flux for an extended cooling <b>season.</b> The weighted <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> flux rate over the period for the green roof is 0. 25 Btu/ft 2 ?hr or 45. 7 % less than the conventional roof?s <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> flux rate of 0. 46 Btu/ft 2 ?hr. Winter data again show substantially lower peak roof surface temperatures, higher nighttime surface temperatures and significantly lower heat flux rates for the green roof compared with the conventional roof. For periods during which the ambient air temperature was less than 55 oF, the weighted <b>average</b> winter <b>heat</b> flux rate for the green roof is - 0. 40 Btu/ft 2 ?hr or 49. 5 % less than the conventional roof?s <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> flux rate of - 0. 79 Btu/ft 2 ?hr. Because of air conditioning zoning limitations, an extensive energy savings analysis was not possible for this project. However, an energy savings analysis was performed using the roof heat flux results and equipment efficiency assumptions. Based on this analysis the total estimated cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>season</b> savings for the green roof compared with the conventional roof, if the entire 3, 300 square foot project roof were green, would be approximately 489 kWhr/yr...|$|R

To study {{the way of}} reducing the investment cost for the {{heat exchanger}} of high-temperature and high-capacity hot air furnace, the heat exchange area of the two heat exchangers was calculated by LMTD method when air temperature rose from 0 °C, 100 °Cand 200 °C to different temperature points, and {{the figure of the}} relationship between the temperature difference and <b>average</b> <b>heat</b> exchange area was given.

Temporal salinity changes registered during the experiment show strong departures from the typical annual cycle in which salinity follows average surface water flux variability.

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and five nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) in the airborne particulates were determined by HPLC with fluorescence and chemiluminescence detection, respectively. The concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs were higher in <b>heating</b> <b>season</b> than in non-heating season at the two sites. Both the concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs decreased in the non-heating season but only the concentrations of NPAHs decreased in <b>heating</b> <b>season</b> at site 1, from 2004 to 2010. These findings suggest that source control measures implemented {{by the city of}} Beijing helped to reduce air pollution in Beijing. The concentrations of PAHs increased at site 1 in 2010, possibly because of the transport of emissions from windward other areas, such as Shanxi province. Several diagnostic ratios of PAHs and NPAHs showed that the different sources contributed to Beijing's air pollution, although coal combustion was the main source in the <b>heating</b> <b>season</b> and vehicle emission was the main source in the non-heating season.
