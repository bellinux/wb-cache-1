5|$|The sea otter's use {{of rocks}} when hunting and feeding makes {{it one of}} the few mammal species to use tools. To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against a rock on its chest. To pry an <b>abalone</b> off its rock, it hammers the <b>abalone</b> shell using a large stone, with {{observed}} rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds. Releasing an <b>abalone,</b> which can cling to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its own body weight, requires multiple dives.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, anchovies, rays are harvested and {{a small number of}} <b>abalone</b> and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented anchovy), <b>abalone,</b> wakame, and squid.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters consume over 100 {{different}} prey species. In {{most of its}} range, the sea otter's diet consists {{almost exclusively}} of marine benthic invertebrates, including sea urchins, fat innkeeper worms, a variety of bivalves such as clams and mussels, <b>abalone,</b> other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses. Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and <b>abalone</b> are present {{in a range of}} sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo clams smaller than 3inches (7cm) across.|$|E
50|$|This species {{lives on}} rocky shores. These <b>abalones</b> are found intertidally or subtidally near kelp to 30 feet (9 m) depth, {{but they can}} be found to 330 feet (100 m) depth. Like all <b>abalones,</b> they are herbivorous.|$|R

5|$|There were no {{permanent}} indigenous settlements on Point Loma {{because of a}} lack of fresh water. Kumeyaay people did visit Ocean Beach periodically to harvest mussels, clams, <b>abalone</b> and lobsters.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the sea}} otter's {{preferred}} prey species, particularly <b>abalone,</b> clams, and crabs, {{are also}} food sources for humans. In some areas, massive declines in shellfish harvests have been blamed on the sea otter, and intense public debate has taken place over how to manage the competition between sea otters and humans for seafood.|$|E
5|$|The east {{district}} of Gyeongju, Gampo-eup town, is {{adjacent to the}} sea, so fresh seafood and jeotgal (fermented salted seafood) are abundant. There are over 240 seafood restaurants in Gampo Harbor offering various dishes made with seafood caught in the sea, such as hoe (raw fish dishes), jeonboktang (an <b>abalone</b> soup), grilled seafood and others.|$|E
5000|$|Haliotis pulcherrima is {{commonly}} referred to the [...] "Most Beautiful Abalone" [...] (directly translated from Latin). Its shell size ranges from 18-40 mm. This <b>Abalone's</b> shell is iridescent and creamy-white on the inside. It can be found mainly in East Polynesia. It is edible as with most <b>abalones.</b>|$|R
25|$|Black <b>abalones</b> are herbivorous gastropods, {{and feed}} mostly on drift algae and kelp. Their primary food species {{depend on the}} habitat. In {{southern}} California habitats, black <b>abalones</b> are thought to feed on the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and feather boa kelp (Egregia menziesii), while in central and northern California habitats they feed on the bull kelp (Nereocystis leutkeana).|$|R
2500|$|The black <b>abalone's</b> shell length {{can reach}} {{a maximum of}} , being {{typically}} [...] long.|$|R
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and <b>abalone,</b> because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate is}} {{complicated}} because sea otters have sometimes been {{held responsible for}} declines of shellfish stocks that were more likely caused by overfishing, disease, pollution, and seismic activity. Shellfish declines have also occurred {{in many parts of}} the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters, and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of shellfish on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade's near-extirpation of the sea otter. Although many factors affect shellfish stocks, sea otter predation can deplete a fishery to the point where it is no longer commercially viable. Scientists agree that sea otters and <b>abalone</b> fisheries cannot exist in the same area, and the same is likely true for certain other types of shellfish, as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{individuals}} {{within a particular}} area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove <b>abalone</b> from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful.|$|E
50|$|Shewanella haliotis, {{a species}} of rod-shaped, Gram-negative, facultatively {{anaerobic}} bacteria, was first isolated from the gut microflora of <b>abalones</b> (large edible sea snails) collected from the ocean near Yeosu, South Korea, by Kim et al. in 2007. Further studies showed the cells to be catalase- and oxidase-positive. The species epithet haliotis is {{a reference to the}} genus name of <b>abalones,</b> Haliotis.|$|R

5|$|The {{national}} cuisine {{has been}} described as Pacific Rim, incorporating the native Māori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia and Asia. New Zealand yields produce from land and sea—most crops and livestock, such as maize, potatoes and pigs, were gradually introduced by the early European settlers. Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb, salmon, kōura (crayfish), dredge oysters, whitebait, pāua (<b>abalone),</b> mussels, scallops, pipis and tuatua (both are types of New Zealand shellfish), kūmara (sweet potato), kiwifruit, tamarillo and pavlova (considered a national dish). A hāngi is a traditional Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven. After European colonisation, Māori began cooking with pots and ovens and the hāngi was used less frequently, although it is still used for formal occasions such as tangihanga.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{a type of}} <b>abalone,</b> Nordotis gigantea, {{is known}} as Siebold's <b>abalone,</b> and is prized for sushi.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominantly}} blue-green iridescent {{shell of}} <b>abalone</b> (or paua; genus Haliotis) is one last possible imitation. <b>Abalone</b> shell is inexpensive and plentiful {{owing to the}} commercial mariculture of these gastropods for their meat. The shell's structure is distinctive: sinuous bands of blue, green, and rose iridescence are delineated by dark brown lines of conchiolin, a proteinaceous material that holds the shell together. The luster of <b>abalone</b> shell is silky rather than the near vitreous luster of polished ammolite, and {{the colors of the}} two materials do not closely approximate. However, some <b>abalone</b> shell has been dyed and given a transparent cap of synthetic quartz, forming a doublet in the same fashion as ammolite. These doublets are perhaps the most deceptive, and have also been used to imitate opal. Under magnification most <b>abalone</b> doublets will show dye concentrated along certain areas and air bubbles trapped at the shell-quartz interface.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, police {{brutality}} and persecution drove {{many of the}} Beat Generation writers, musicians, and artists out of San Francisco.

Bowen's singer friend, Janis Joplin was a frequent guest at the Princeton <b>Abalone</b> studio.|$|E
