Immediate reactions <b>to</b> team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room were investigated by means of lag sequential analysis. As expected, we found that in high performing teams, immediate consequences of team monitoring were speaking-up and providing unsolicited assistance. <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> the room led <b>to</b> further <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room <b>and</b> substituted explicit coordination. The results highlight the relevance of team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room for team coordination and performance in dynamic healthcare environments...|$|R
