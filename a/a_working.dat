5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Limousin region was characterised by the mediocrity of its animals. Texier-Olivier Louis, prefect of the Haute-Vienne, observed that Limousin cattle weighed 300 to 350kg and measured 1.5 metres at the withers. The defect was considered to be attributable to poor genetics, nutrition and breeding practices. In competitions, Limousin cattle were among the worst performers. The breed was considered to be <b>a</b> <b>working</b> breed, but poorly shaped and with poor milk.|$|E

40|$|A Stirling cycle {{cryogenerator}} {{operates on}} a closed regenerative thermodynamic cycle with compression {{and expansion of}} the working fluid occurring at different temperature levels. Generally, hydrogen or helium is used as <b>a</b> single-component <b>working</b> fluid in the cryogenerators used for liquefaction of nitrogen. The use of <b>a</b> two-component <b>working</b> fluid, one condensing at the required refrigerating temperature, can improve {{the performance of the}} cryogenerator. If maximum cycle pressure in the cryogenerator is kept the same as when using <b>a</b> single-component <b>working</b> fluid, the pressure varies over a larger range. This provides an increase in the available refrigerating effect, but at a correspondingly higher input power. Thus, a particular cryogenerator can provide a larger liquefaction capacity when <b>working</b> with <b>a</b> two-component two-phase <b>working</b> fluid. Alternately, for a fixed liquefaction capacity, the maximum cycle pressure can be kept lower than the maximum cycle pressure with <b>a</b> single-component <b>working</b> fluid. The change over to a two-component fluid does not involve any change in the cryogenerator configuration. In this paper a computer simulation using second order cyclic analysis has been carried out for a PLN- 106 cryogenerator used for the liquefaction of nitrogen at a capacity of 6 - 6. 5 dm(3) h(- 1). The results using <b>a</b> single-component <b>working</b> fluid are compared with those for <b>a</b> two-component <b>working</b> fluid with the same maximum cycle pressure...|$|R
