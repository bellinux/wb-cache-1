5|$|The Third World Congress in 1951 {{resolved}} {{that the}} economies of the East European states <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>political</b> regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more.

The term deformed was used rather than degenerated, because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Oxford, Tsakalotos joined the Communist Party of Greece (Interior), a eurocommunist party that had split from the main Communist Party of Greece, a Marxist–Leninist party, in 1968. In the early 1990s, shortly after moving to Greece, Tsakalotos became a member of Synaspismos, a radical left-wing {{political}} party, which was to become the largest constituent party of Syriza. Syriza itself was formed in 2004, ahead of that year's legislative election, as a coalition of 13 left-wing political parties in Greece. Tsakalotos was elected to their Central Committee in December 2004. However, he also remained a prominent member of Synaspismos and served on both their Central Political Committee <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>Political</b> Secretariat until a July 2013 party congress, during which Syriza voted to become an independent political party and for all component parties to disband, including Synaspismos.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the civil war lie in the {{succession}} arrangements of Harun al-Rashid (reigned 786–809), as well as the internal political dynamics of the Abbasid Caliphate. The two main contenders, Muhammad al-Amin and Abdallah al-Ma'mun, were born six months apart in AH 170 (786–787), with al-Ma'mun being the elder. It was al-Amin however who was named first heir in 791 or 792, while al-Ma'mun followed in 797, a sequence which was influenced by their lines of descent <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>political</b> implications: al-Amin had a solidly Abbasid lineage, being Harun's son by Zubayda, herself descended from the second Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), while al-Ma'mun's mother was Marajil, a Persian concubine from Badhgis in Khurasan.|$|E
5|$|While {{the queen}} had {{designated}} her son, Radama II, as her successor, Rainimaharo {{and the conservative}} faction knew of his progressive leanings and tried instead to ensure the queen's nephew, Ramboasalama, would come to power and maintain loyalties to them <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>political</b> agenda. The progressive brothers Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony, who were the queen's co-prime minister {{and head of the}} army respectively {{at the time of her}} death, supported the succession of Radama and were able to exercise greater influence than Ramboasalama, particularly in ensuring the support of the army for the prince's claim to the throne. As Ranavalona lay on her death bed, Radama took precautions to ensure his succession would be uncontested, surrounding his residence at the Rova of Antananarivo with several hundred soldiers and sending a member of Ramboasalama's family to bring him to the Rova to swear a public oath of allegiance to the new king, to whom he submitted.|$|E

25|$|According to Ronald M.
