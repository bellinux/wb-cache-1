5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such <b>as</b> <b>what</b> enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.|$|E

5|$|As Saomai {{approached}} South Korea, the typhoon {{forced the}} cancellation of flights beginning on September12. Four airports had their air service suspended.

As a result, about 16,600campers and hikers were evacuated to safer areas. As {{a result of the}} inclement weather, the operation of 149passenger ships were cancelled. On September13, the Korea Meteorological Administration(KMA) issued a typhoon warning for waters south of South Korea and Jeju Province.

Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were not as important <b>as</b> <b>what</b> the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well <b>as</b> <b>what</b> he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, a number of senior U.S. {{intelligence}} officials met {{with the leaders of}} the KLA, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in Kosovo and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside Kosovo, not to continue participating in the drug trade, and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, the KLA ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave Kosovo. Though few Kosovo Albanians sympathized with the Islamists, some argued that the KLA should have accepted assistance from any source, fundamentalist or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered the mujahideen to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within the KLA ranks <b>as</b> <b>what</b> was to be done with them.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco.

The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called Blender that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c <b>as</b> <b>what</b> will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E

60|$|A priori {{knowledge}} {{is not all}} of the logical kind we have been hitherto considering. Perhaps the most important example of non-logical a priori {{knowledge is}} knowledge as to ethical value. I am not speaking of judgements <b>as</b> to <b>what</b> is useful or <b>as</b> to <b>what</b> is virtuous, for such judgements do require empirical premisses; I am speaking of judgements as to the intrinsic desirability of things. If something is useful, it must be useful because it secures some end; the end must, if we have gone far enough, be valuable on its own account, and not merely because it is useful for some further end. Thus all judgements <b>as</b> to <b>what</b> is useful depend upon judgements <b>as</b> to <b>what</b> has value on its own account.|$|R

5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed it in the same genus (Hesperomys) <b>as</b> <b>what</b> is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} was French {{reaction to the}} attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant {{to start a new}} risky and costly expedition to save Habré; this evaluation proved wrong, <b>as</b> <b>what</b> the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Opération Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.|$|E
