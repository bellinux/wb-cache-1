2500|$|While {{the answer}} is being stated, the voice in which the subject was {{previously}} heard continues with new material. If this new material is reused in later statements of the subject, it is called a countersubject; if this <b>accompanying</b> <b>material</b> is only heard once, it is simply referred to as free counterpoint. [...] The countersubject is written in invertible counterpoint at the octave or fifteenth. The distinction is made {{between the use of}} free counterpoint and regular countersubjects accompanying the fugue subject/answer, because in order for a countersubject to be heard accompanying the subject in more than one instance, it must be capable of sounding correctly above or below the subject, and must be conceived, therefore, in invertible (double) counterpoint.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the middle}} of the 1930s the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration began to bring {{attention}} to the housing plight of lower-income groups in the United States. [...] Many of the New Deal administrators became convinced that decent housing was the right of every citizen, and believed it the duty of the government to find ways to provide such housing. [...] A decentralized lower-income housing program was developed, which relied heavily on local community involvement, organization and input. [...] Financial and administrative support for this initiative were provided by the federal government. In support of this effort, a well-developed public relations campaign was begun to promote and explain the need for public housing, and to establish popular support for the program. [...] Some administrators of the housing program were not satisfied with assisting only the lower-income groups. They asked why programs could not be expanded to assist the middle-income groups in finding decent, affordable housing. [...] Able to afford higher rents, yet often unable to accumulate the required down payments for ownership, members of the middle-income group found it very difficult, if not impossible, to make the jump from rental housing to home ownership. [...] Affordable housing plans were developed but were unable to garner the necessary support within government circles, and they were filed away to await a time when the environment would be right for implementation. [...] Surprisingly, the wait was not long. [...] Just prior to direct American involvement in World War II, the nation entered an emergency period of military buildup that required the development of housing for the middle-income defense workers then streaming into defense plants across the country. [...] The nation's entire public housing program needed to adjust quickly {{to the needs of the}} middle-income worker, and the proposals for housing programs—filed away just a few years earlier—were dusted off. During this relatively brief period of time (1940–1941) just prior to the outbreak of war and its <b>accompanying</b> <b>material</b> shortages and limitations, housing officials had a great deal of freedom to implement these experimental middle-income housing plans.|$|E
