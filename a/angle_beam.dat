40|$|Equispaced beam {{arrangements}} are typically used for IMRT plans. This beam arrangement provides adequate dose coverage {{to the target}} while sparing dose to other structures. However, an equispaced beam arrangement may not provide the best dose coverage to the target while sparing dose to the other structures. <b>Beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization attempts to optimize the beam directions to produce a better IMRT plan; this is achieved by increasing dose to the target while minimizing dose to the remaining structures. Most methods of <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization attempt to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and the <b>beam</b> intensity profiles to find an optimal set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> This thesis attempts to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> without determining the beam intensity profiles. An MCNP simulation is run to score the beam directions; the simulation is run as an adjoint problem to reduce simulation time, with the target as the source and the detectors scoring the dose for the gantry <b>angles</b> of the <b>beam.</b> Then, an optimization algorithm is run to select a set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> for an optimized IMRT plan. The optimized IMRT plan is compared to an equispaced IMRT plan on a commercial treatment planning system to determine if this method of <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization is better than using an equispaced beam arrangement. The results of this thesis indicate that the coupling of an MCNP simulation for scoring with an optimization algorithm to select <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> will produce a better IMRT plan than an equispaced IMRT plan. Three different geometries were used and for all geometries, the optimized IMRT plan had a higher average dose to the target while maintaining or increasing dose sparing to the critical structure and normal tissue.

50|$|Beam {{angle is}} chosen {{to suit the}} {{conditions}} and activities of the planned dive. Cave divers frequently choose narrow beam lights when diving in good visibility as these provide good illumination over relatively long distances, which is useful when navigating into an unfamiliar space where it is actually possible to see a fairly long distance ahead. Some feel that in poor visibility, or at short range, a narrow beam is not much use, and a wider beam spreads the light over a more useful area. Others feel that in low visibility settings a wide beam angle is distracting as it tends to reflect back to much light from floating particulates (back-scatter). Video lighting usually requires a wider beam as the view angle of the video camera must be accommodated for good results. In the case of very wide angle video, such as the GoPro and similar, an extremely wide <b>angle</b> <b>beam</b> is necessary.|$|E

The new furnace commenced production on November 1, 1881. In order {{to pay for the}} expansion, the firm was recapitalized at $600,000. By this time, the Mill included two puddling mills with 11 furnaces and a total output of 50 tons per day, a mill for boiler and ship plate with a capacity of 45 tons per day, and a mill for <b>angle,</b> <b>beam</b> and skelp iron with a daily capacity of 35 tons. Included in the above were two large gas-operated furnaces and a mill which could produce plates from ⅛ to 6 inch thickness and 27 feet wide.

40|$|The Io-Jupiter {{interaction}} generates strong decametric radio emissions (DAM), {{which appear}} as arcs in the time-frequency plane. These emissions are <b>beamed</b> at an <b>angle</b> from {{the magnetic field}} lines, which may vary with frequency and longitude amongst other properties. Empirical models of this <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> describe {{the shape of the}} DAM arcs and offer insight into the emission mechanism for DAM. Several studies have investigated the variation in the emission <b>beaming</b> <b>angle.</b> The studies span a range of frequencies which depend on the observational means (spacecraft, ground-based radio telescopes) used to obtain data. Subsequently, because of the varying assumptions made (e. g. relativistic vs. non-relativistic electrons for the wave polarization), methods used (e. g. prescribing a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function vs. determining a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function from observational geometry) and frequency ranges observed, different results have been found in each study. In the present paper, we model the shape of the emission with an empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function and adjust the parameters to best fit the emission arcs. However, our model builds on previous models by taking into account the location of Io in the Jovian magnetic field. We also look at a broader frequency range than many of the intermediate studies. We find that a simple empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function describes the shape of the A, B, and D arcs and that the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function must decrease at high and low frequencies. We then propose a simple explanation for the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> profile, deduced from cyclotron maser theory. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

40|$|The DGS {{method has}} been {{developed}} for planar disk shaped straight beam transducers generating a rotational symmetric sound distribution in the test material. <b>Angle</b> <b>beam</b> probes using circular or rectangular transducers generate an asymmetric sound field due to the refraction between the wedge and the test material. Today in many test procedures the use of <b>angle</b> <b>beam</b> probes is required.

Despite these facts the measurement results of current <b>angle</b> <b>beam</b> probes are evaluated using the DGS method.

40|$|The mmWave {{communication}} system is operating at a regime with {{high number of}} antennas and very limited number of RF analog chains. Large number of antennas are used to extend the communication range for recovering the high path loss while fewer RF analog chains are designed to reduce transmit and processing power and hardware complexity. In this regime, typical MIMO algorithms are not applicable. Before any communication starts, devices are needed to align their <b>beam</b> pointing <b>angles</b> towards each other.

Materials and Methods: Three patients with localized prostate cancer retrospectively selected from our institution were studied. For each patient, IMPT plans were designed using two, three and four <b>beam</b> <b>angles,</b> respectively, obtained from a <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization algorithm. Those plans were then compared with ones using two lateral parallel-opposed beams according to the conventional planning protocol for localized prostate cancer adopted at our institution. Results: IMPT plans with two optimized angles achieved significant improvements in rectum sparing and moderate improvements in bladder sparing against those with two lateral angles. Plans with three optimized angles further improved rectum sparing significantly over those two-angle plans, whereas four-angle plans found no advantage over three-angle plans. A possible three-beam class solution for localized prostate patients was suggested and demonstrated with preserved dosimetric benefits because individually optimized three-angle solutions were found sharing a very similar pattern.
