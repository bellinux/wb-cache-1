40|$|A self {{clamping}} {{cutting tool}} {{which includes a}} handle attached to a C-shaped housing is described. Rotatably mounted within the housing is a C-shaped tool body carrying a set of clamping rolls, two support rolls, and an edged cutting roll (64). The support rolls are disposed {{to one side of}} the axis of a pipe and the cutting roll is disposed to the other side of a pipe axis so that these rolls contact a pipe at three circumferential points. Cutter advancing apparatus advance the cutting roll toward the support rollers. The support rolls and cutting roll <b>are</b> <b>rotatable</b> <b>independently</b> of the C-shaped housing. A one way ratchet mechanism disposed between the C-shaped housing and the C-shaped tool body permits operation by movement in one rotational direction about the pipe axis...|$|R
40|$|We {{design a}} vehicle with a {{steering}} system made of two <b>independently</b> <b>rotatable</b> wheels on the front. We quantify {{the effectiveness of the}} steering system in the mobility and maneuverability of the vehicle running in a box containing a layer ping-pong balls with a packing density 0. 8, below the random close packing value 0. 84 in 2 D. The steering system can reduce the resistance exerted by the jammed balls formed ahead of the fast-moving vehicle. Moreover, if only one of the two steering wheels rotates, the vehicle can turn into the direction opposite to the rotating wheel. The steering system performs more efficiently if the wheels engage the ping-pong balls better by increasing the contact area between the wheels and the balls. We advocate applying our design to machines moving in granular materials with a moderate packing density. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|PublishedArticleCopyright © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 The study {{investigated}} whether symptoms {{of anxiety and}} depression <b>are</b> <b>independently</b> associated with reduced goal facilitation in a school sample of adolescents (N = 119). Participants listed their goals and rated {{the extent to which}} they facilitated or inhibited each other. Anxious and depressive symptoms were both associated with reduced levels of goal facilitation, although regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms but not anxious symptoms <b>were</b> <b>independently</b> associated with reduced levels of goal facilitation. Similarly, ratings of distress and repetitive thinking associated with participants’ most conflicting goals <b>were</b> <b>independently</b> associated with depressive symptoms but not anxious symptoms. There was no association between the number of goals listed and anxious or depressive symptoms. Results suggest that depression, but not anxiety, <b>is</b> <b>independently</b> associated with reduced coherence in personal goal systems and a negative preoccupation with conflicting goals...|$|R
