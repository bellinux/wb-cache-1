5|$|During his lifetime, Morris {{produced}} {{items in}} a range of crafts, mainly those to do with furnishing, including over 600 designs for wall-paper, textiles, and embroideries, over 150 for stained glass windows, three typefaces, and around 650 borders and ornamentations for the Kelmscott Press. He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and that where possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and hand processing. He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> learning the techniques of production prior to producing a design.|$|E
5|$|Dyer {{took his}} role as a {{physical}} culture expert very seriously <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> managing the diet of his boxers. He was also at the forefront of a fad in the mid-1920s which was based on a diet of fruit and vegetable drinks, a lifestyle choice that he believed could cure all illnesses. Dyer continued in his career as a physical culture expert into the next decade and was still working out of London in that capacity in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses in the British {{infantry}} {{recorded as}} many as 12assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite carabinier brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> their involvement.|$|E

5|$|After {{going through}} the script, JAR Pictures' Ajay G. Rai decided to produce the film, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> Iyer to direct it as well. Although {{initially}} reluctant, Iyer agreed to direct and learnt the major aspects of cinematography {{as a part of}} her preparation. Gavemic U Ary worked as the cinematographer for the film, and Kunal Sharma headed the sound department. The visual effects were provided by Prasad Film Labs, a motion picture post-production studio based in Hyderabad, and the costumes were designed by Sachin Lovalekar.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
5|$|Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, {{was sent}} against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused {{to abandon the}} holy city <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of Muhammad, like {{restoring}} the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, he waited {{a few days before}} the ditch and repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a few doors over the ditch and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.|$|E

5|$|The {{province}} of Greater Poland {{was acquired by}} Kingdom of Prussia following the Congress of Vienna, when it was detached from the Duchy of Warsaw and given to Prussia, where it became reorganized as the Grand Duchy of Posen. The King of Prussia gave the Grand Duchy the right to call a parliament in 1823, with specific decrees defining its competences in 1826. The parliament carried {{the traditions of the}} General Sejmik of Greater Poland, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> using the Polish word sejm in its name. The Sejm {{met for the first time}} on 24 December 1827. The second sejm session begun on 30 January 1830.|$|E
5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal {{choices for}} the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was wrong for the part <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> Assante; he thought the charm and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E

5|$|Fryderyk's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had {{emigrated to}} Poland in 1787 {{at the age}} of sixteen. Nicolas tutored {{children}} of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Justyna Krzyżanowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Brochów. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807–55), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811–81) and Emilia (1812–27). Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of the Polish language in the household.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Kenney {{also became}} embroiled in the affair, having been {{informed}} by Bostock, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> speaking {{directly to the}} pilots himself over Jones' protest {{that this was an}} internal RAAF disciplinary matter. During a visit to Morotai from his Manila headquarters, Kenney tried to persuade the officers to reconsider their positions, but again they refused. He agreed with Bostock that Cobby should be replaced by Scherger, and declared that if the pilots were court-martialled he would appear in their defence. The commander of the Australian Army's ICorps, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, who was at Morotai preparing for the Borneo campaign, also supported Cobby's removal. Morshead and other senior army officers were concerned that the dispute could disrupt preparations for the Australian landings in Borneo and consulted with Kenney on the matter. Jones resolved to dismiss not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms. Scherger took over as Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF on 10May.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{despite the}} {{activities}} of Loredan around Gallipoli, the situation in Thessalonica was so dire by October 1424 that the Great Council had to authorize the dispatch of between 150 and 200 soldiers, as well as supplies and money, to the city. On 13 January 1425, the Venetians decided to equip 25 galleys, an unusually large and expensive number, for the next year; Fantino Michiel was appointed captain-general. The fleet sailed in April, and was tasked both with settling affairs in the Venetian colonies as well as reassure the Thessalonians of Venetian support. He was also instructed {{to make contact with}} the Sultan and pledge considerable sums to the Grand Vizier, Çandarlı Ibrahim Pasha, {{and other members of the}} Ottoman court, to gain a sympathetic hearing. The Republic proposed to restore the salt pans that the Sultan had previously controlled, as well as the tribute of 100,000 aspers that the Despot Andronikos had paid. The Venetians refused, however, to allow the Turks in the city to be tried by their own kadi, as had been the case under the Despot Andronikos, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the reinstatement of customs posts in the city gates. Michiel was also instructed to secure the release of Venetian citizens taken during an Ottoman raid into the Morea the previous March, and re-confirm the previous peace treaty of 1419, including, if possible, the restitution of the Marquisate of Bodonitsa to its ruler, Niccolo III Zorzi.|$|E

5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5|$|The Bereans {{were formed}} by John Barclay in Edinburgh in 1773. Barclay {{was one of}} the most {{prominent}} followers of moral philosopher Archibald Campbell and espoused a rigorous form of pre-destination <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> Biblical-based preaching. Having been rejected from various pastorships and by the General Assembly, he founded independent churches in Scotland and then in England, taking the name Bereans from the people mentioned in Acts 17:11. After Barclay's death in 1798 his followers joined the congregationalists. The Buchanites were a Millenarian cult that broke away from the Relief Church when Hugh White, minister at Irvine, declared Elspeth Buchan to be a special saint identified with the woman described in Revelation 12. They attracted less than fifty followers and having been expelled by local magistrates they formed a community at a farm known as New Cample in Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire. The sect collapsed after the death of Buchan in 1791. Other minor sects include the McMillanites, reported as a group of Covernanters who had separated from kirk discipline in Dumfrisshire in 1721. Another group in the same area, called the Hebronites, were alleged to have sworn at a minister. The Hebronites were later absorbed into the Secession Church with other Covenanters after 1736.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn Féin, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived with soldiers and police to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between the police {{and the members of the}} procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E

5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E
