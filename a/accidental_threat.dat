The <b>threat</b> from <b>accidental</b> insiders is a reality across all enterprises and can be extremely damaging to the systems, data and reputation of an organisation. Recent industry reports and academic literature underline the fact that the risk of accidental insider compromise is potentially more pressing than that posed by a malicious insider. In this paper we focus on the ability of enterprises’ {{information security}} policies to mitigate the <b>accidental</b> insider <b>threat.</b> Specifically we perform an analysis of real-world cases of <b>accidental</b> insider <b>threat</b> to define the key reasons, actions and impacts of these events – captured as a grounded insider threat classification scheme.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to review mortality from external causes (accidental injury) in children and adolescents in systematically selected journals. This was a systematic review of the literature on mortality from accidental injury in children and adolescents. We searched the Pubrvled, Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences and Excerpta Medica databases for articles published between July of 2001 and June of 2011. National data from official agencies, retrieved by manual searches, were also reviewed. We reviewed 15 journal articles, the 2011 edition of a National Safety Council publication and 2010 statistical data from the Brazilian National Ministry of Health Mortality Database. Most published data were related to high-income countries. Mortality from accidental injury was highest among children less than 1 year of age. <b>Accidental</b> <b>threats</b> to breathing (non-drowning threats) constituted the leading cause of death among this age group in the published articles. Across the pediatric age group in the surveyed studies, traffic accidents were the leading cause of death, followed by accidental drowning and submersion. Traffic accidents constitute the leading external cause of accidental death among children in the countries understudy. However, infants were vulnerable to external causes, particularly to <b>accidental</b> non-drowning <b>threats</b> to breathing, and this age group had the highest mortality rates for external causes. Actions to reduce such events are suggested. Further studies investigating the occurrence of accidental deaths in low-income countries are needed to improve the understanding of these preventable events...|$|R
40|$|The {{smart grid}} vision implies {{extensive}} use of ICT in the power system, enabling increased flexibility and functionality and thereby meeting future demands and strategic goals. Consequently, power system reliability will increasingly depend on ICT components and systems. While adding functionality, ICT systems also contribute to failures, such as hidden failures in protection systems, as has been exemplified by recent power outages. It also brings new threats, {{such as that of}} cyber-attacks. To ensure effective power system reliability, the interdependencies between power and ICT systems need to be properly understood. This paper provides an overview of main interdependency categories, as well as methods {{that can be used to}} identify and study interdependencies. Based on a study of recent papers in major archival journals, we conclude that appropriate methods for identification of interdependencies between power and ICT systems seem to be lacking. In addition, current methods seem unable to both cover the power system at large, and at the same time take into account the full array of intentional and <b>accidental</b> <b>threats.</b> Based on these findings, we make recommendations for future research in this field...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} deaths due to unintentional injuries among children in Japan {{to identify the}} age groups and sexes at most risk, {{and the types of}} injuries, so that effective forms of targeted intervention can be devised. Among children aged 0 – 14 years, deaths whose underlying causes had been classified under code V 01 -X 59 of the ICD- 10 were defined as deaths of children caused by unintentional injuries. Using data from the Vital Statistics 2000 – 2009 for analysis, we examined the changes in mortality and trends in terms of sex, age, and cause of death. Mortality decreased by 46. 2 %, from 933 in 2000 to 502 in 2009. The mortality rate among children aged 1 – 4 years decreased by almost half. The total number of deaths during this decade was 7, 362 (boys: 4, 690, girls: 2, 672). Among the causes of death, the majority were due to “transport accidents”, followed by “other <b>accidental</b> <b>threats</b> to breathing”, and “accidental drowning and submersion”. The characteristics observed in terms of sex, age, and cause of death—that is, deaths from suffocation among infants aged less than 1 year, drowning deaths among boys, and transport accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists—must be addressed as targets for future intervention...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a distributed Data Acquisition System (DAQ) {{developed for the}} TAWARA-RTM project (TAp WAter RAdioactivity Real Time Monitor). The aim is detecting the presence of radioactive contaminants in drinking water; {{in order to prevent}} deliberate or <b>accidental</b> <b>threats.</b> Employing a set of detectors, it is possible to detect alpha, beta and gamma radiations, from emitters dissolved in water. The Sensor Network (SN) consists of several heterogeneous nodes controlled by a centralized server. The SN cyber-security is guaranteed in order to protect it from external intrusions and malicious acts. The nodes were installed in different locations, along the water treatment processes, in the waterworks plant supplying the aqueduct of Warsaw, Poland. Embedded computers control the simpler nodes, and are directly connected to the SN. Local-PCs (LPCs) control the more complex nodes that consist signal digitizers acquiring data from several detectors. The DAQ in the LPC is split in several processes communicating with sockets in a local sub-network. Each process is dedicated to a very simple task (e. g. data acquisition, data analysis, hydraulics management) {{in order to have a}} flexible and fault-tolerant system. The main SN and the local DAQ networks are separated by data routers to ensure the cyber-security...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Incentive {{regulation}} {{needs to}} adapt to the emerging changes in the operating environment of the electricity networks and take into account the security of these. This paper assesses the current issues and options in economic regulation of network security across the European electricity systems. An outputoriented incentive regulatory approach combines the efficiency promoting mechanisms in a revenue cap framework with outputbased incentives such as better provision of network security. Thus, incentive regulation is destined to move from pursuing the optimal to being more practical. The RIIO regulatory framework in the UK and the service quality regulation in Italy provide good examples of application of output-based regulation. We also propose an output-based approach for regulation of network security, which accounts for the risks from natural, <b>accidental</b> and malicious <b>threats.</b> We conclude that regulation for network security may also involve looking beyond economic network regulation and focus on the wider security policy and regulation interface considering the risks facing the electricity networks...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{proposed}} to assess the reliability of aircraft structures subject to accidental damage using in-service damage data. The development of this method is motivated by {{the increasing use of}} composite materials in aircraft structures, which are particularly sensitive to impact damage. In addition, damage to composite structures may not be visible or may be difficult to detect. Based on the equivalent Level of Safety (LOS) concept, this method consists of two essential elements: a probabilistic assessment of detected damages and the probability of non-destructive inspection methods to detect such damage. <b>Accidental</b> damage <b>threats</b> are first characterized by identifying damage type, size, cause, and frequency for different aircraft models and structural components. The damage threats are then modeled by constructing histograms and detected damage probability distributions. Probability of detection models for various non-destructive inspection techniques are then used to calculate the equivalent Level of Safety. This approach can be used to design a new aircraft structure that is equivalently or more reliable as current designs. Furthermore, maintenance service guidelines and optimum inspection intervals may be estimated once design limit load is established. Engineers can use this methodology in the future as a guide to establish design and inspection criteria while considering safety risk and maintenance cost at the same time. The current reliability method relies on the completeness of the reported data on detected damage. Fleet service data currently available may not contain accurate information on damage size and the associated inspection method. In addition, damage reporting procedures vary from one operator to another, and damage data available for composite structures are limited. Therefore, sample representation of the extracted damage sizes and the probability of reporting are issues that must be addressed in order to apply the method to practical aircraft design. In this paper, 100 % reporting and 100 % sample representation is assumed. The results of the current reliability analysis method may give insight on general damage threats and future methods for designing and inspecting composite aircraft structures...|$|R
