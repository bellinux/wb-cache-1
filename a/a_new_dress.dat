25|$|In February 1971 the {{principal}} circulated {{a memo to}} all employees outlining <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dress</b> code, apparently motivated by the administration's belief that {{public support for the}} district's bond issues was in part motivated by the teachers' appearance. Doyle, as an association official, had been aware that the administration was considering such a measure but had been led to believe that the association would have had some input before it was announced. He thus shared the memo with a friend at Cincinnati radio station WSAI, which used it as the basis for an on-air news item.|$|E

500|$|In August 1823, in {{an issue}} of The Album, he {{published}} an article saying that more attention should {{be paid to the}} time period of Shakespeare's plays, {{especially when it comes to}} costumes. [...] In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché's more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden, that [...] "while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dress</b> or two for the principal characters". Kemble [...] "saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town", and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of King John, if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production. Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick. The research involved sparked Planché's latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.|$|E

[...] Daniel and Imogen clashed again when she dropped her birthday dress after he ran into her on his skateboard. Daniel bought her <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dress,</b> {{but it was too}} big for Imogen and she refused to accept it. Later that day, Imogen accidentally crushed Daniel's skateboard during a driving lesson, but Daniel believed it was her way of getting revenge for the dress.

40|$|Abstract. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>dressing</b> {{device for}} dense type diamond {{grinding}} wheel, whose elliptic vibration {{was prompted by}} single longitudinal vibration, was designed using a local resonance method. It was employed to dress the metallic bond super-abrasive grinding wheel and the dressing force characteristics were analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} thrust force decreased to 1 / 7 - 1 / 10 of that of conventional method, and the main cutting force decreased by 70 %. Compared to other dressing parameters, the dressing force in elliptic ultrasonic vibration was more sensitive to grinding speed. Thrust force and main cutting force increased rapidly when rotation speed beyond 72 rpm. But when the ultrasonic power was higher than 50 W, dressing force decreased very slowly. It was observed that the <b>new</b> <b>dressing</b> method is contribute to better surface finish such as more even surface, less crush abrasives, more uniform abrasive abscission and so on than the conventional method...|$|R
