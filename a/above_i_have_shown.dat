The risks {{with this approach}} cannot be described as high but are proportional to the extent and {{the complexity of the}} surgery. In future, technology is expected to make laparoscopic surgery safer. At present, risk awareness, the use of correct techniques, a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis and the treatment of complications comprise the risk reduction strategy for laparoscopic surgery. Finally, it is important that patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery should go through the process of informed consenting.|$|R

40|$|My project {{involves}} {{investigating the}} mechanisms used to selectively package primer tRNALys 3 during HIV- 1 assembly, place {{it onto the}} primer binding site(PBS) on the viral RNA genome, and allow this tRNA to initiate reverse transcription. My basic experimental approach has been to transfect COS 7 cells with wild type or mutant HVI- 1 proviral DNA and {{determine the effect of}} these mutations upon the <b>above</b> processes. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that in the mature virion, there are approximately 8 molecules of tRNALys 3, and 12 molecules tRNALys 1, 2, and that the viral tRNALys 3 /tRNALys 1, 2 ratio reflects the cytoplasmic ratio. For example, when COS- 7 cells are transfected with a plasmid containing both HIV- 1 proviral DNA and a human tRNALys 3 gene, the tRNALys 3 content per virion (i. e., per 2 molecules genomic RNA) increases from 8 to 17 molecules, with a corresponding decrease in tRNALys 1, 2, to 3 molecules/virion. Prl 60 gag-pol is required for tRNALys 3 packaging, and the RT sequences within this molecule probably contain a binding site for this tRNA. In this work, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> also provided evidence that nucleocapsid(NCp 7) sequences within Pr 55 gag contribute to this binding site. This work indicates that a Prl 60 gag-pol/Pr 55 gag complex may be responsible for binding tRNALys 3 and carrying it into the virion. We next showed that the genomic placement of tRNALys 3 onto the PBS occurs independently of precursor proteolysis, but is inhibited by mutations in the basic amino acid sequences flanking the first Cys-His box in NCp 7, mutations which do not inhibit packaging of either tRNA Lys 3 or Pr 160 gag-pol into Pr 55 gag particles. This indicates a role for one or both of protein precursors in the placement. A U 5 stem/A-rich loop structure just upstream of the PBS has been implicated in causing the short initiation complexes seen in the mature virion, and causing reverse transcription to move from a low to a high processivity. In agreement with this, we found that the deletion of the A-rich loop immediately upstream of the PBS, while not affecting tRNALys 3 placement, resulted in the synthesis of longer elongation products using low RT processivity, with a corresponding decrease in the presence of unextended and 2 base extended tRNALys 3 Four A's in the A-rich loop have been implicated in interacting with the USUU sequence in the anticodon loop of tRNALys 3.

P 2 is used differentially neither during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages nor in macrophages from controls and Gaucher patients, in whom there is a prominent storage only in cells of macrophage origin. We have thus not found any changes that would suggest a role for P 2 in the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> characterized the promoter region of HGSNAT and shown that the binding of Sp 1 transcription factor is important for its expression.

40|$|Stroke is a {{major cause}} of {{premature}} death and disability throughout the world and atrial fibrillation (AF) {{is one of the most}} common preventable causes of stroke. AF affects about 10 % of individuals aged ≥ 80 years, but warfarin is substantially under-used in this age group despite being effective in preventing AF-related thromboembolic events. AF-related ischaemic strokes tend to be severe and incur high care costs, and non-cerebral systemic embolism secondary to AF is also a major clinical burden. Despite that, there are few population-based studies on AF-related ischaemic stroke, and no recent study of the burden of AF-related thromboembolism and the population impact of under-treatment. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> used data from the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC), a prospective, population-based incidence study of vascular disease in all territories, which was started in April 2002 and is on-going. The study population comprises of 92, 728 individuals registered with 100 family physicians in nine general practices and uses multiple overlapping methods of “hot” and “cold” pursuit to achieve near-complete ascertainment of all patients with acute vascular events. There are several findings described by the research in this thesis which have important implications for public health and can be utilised to improve secondary prevention in stroke. First, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that one-third of all incident embolic events were related to AF and 60 % of AF-related embolic events occurred at ≥ 80 years. Second, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that only 9 % of patients aged ≥ 80 years with incident embolic event related to known prior AF were on premorbid warfarin, and consequently three quarters of those previously independent were dead or disabled six months post event. Third, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that there <b>has</b> been no reduction in age-specific incidence of AF-related ischaemic stroke in Oxfordshire over the last 25 years. Fourth, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that assuming age-specific incidence does not continue to rise, if prevention is not improved, the number of embolic events at age ≥ 80 years would be expected to treble by 2050 (72, 975 AF-related embolic events), with 84 % of events at all ages occurring at age ≥ 80. Fifth, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> through a meta-analysis that one in five incident strokes had a history of prior AF of which only 19 % were on premorbid warfarin, and AF was related to one in three incident ischaemic strokes. Sixth, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that 1 in 5 stroke patients with known prior AF subsequently became institutionalised and incurred high acute and long-term care costs. Seventh, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that one in five patients with undetermined cerebral ischaemic event subsequently had AF-related late recurrent stroke. Eighth, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that even though TIA or ischaemic stroke patients who subsequently turned out to have new AF at follow-up had significantly higher baseline NT-proBNP compared to non-AF group, its utility is limited by low sensitivity and specificity. Ninth, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> in another meta-analysis that the duration of cardiac monitoring after cerebral ischaemic events was the main determinant of the observed rate of pAF, and that 5 - 7 days of monitoring may be adequate in unselected patient populations. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that using 5 -day event loop recording in clinic patients with TIA and minor ischaemic stroke could detect 12 % new AF and the delay in monitoring did not reduce the sensitivity of pAF detection.
