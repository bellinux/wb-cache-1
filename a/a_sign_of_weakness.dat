5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's lure did {{not stop}} at that. On 25 November, General Savary {{was sent to the}} Allied {{headquarters}} at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.|$|E
5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, {{and he seems to}} have had better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic {{on the rights of the}} clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in March 1953, the new {{collective}} Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course. Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a New Course in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General Gómez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness,</b> now secured Ulbricht's position. Subsequently, five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing {{up to be a}} rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{used the}} respite to ferry in {{additional}} reinforcements from Asia Minor and repair {{the walls of}} Blachernae. When Thomas returned in spring, he decided to focus his attack on the Blachernae sector. Before the offensive, Michael himself ascended the walls and addressed Thomas's troops, exhorting them to abandon their commander and promising amnesty if they would defect. Thomas's army viewed the plea as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness,</b> and advanced confidently to begin the assault, but as they neared the wall, the defenders opened the gates and attacked. The sudden onslaught drove back Thomas's army; at the same time, the Imperial Fleet defeated Thomas's ships, whose crews broke and fled to the shore in panic. This defeat diminished Thomas's naval strength, and although he continued blockading the capital by land, the loss demoralized his supporters, who began defecting. Gregory Pterotos, whose family was in Michael's hands, resolved to desert Thomas, followed by {{a small band of}} men loyal to him. He departed the rebel camp, headed west, and sent a monk to inform Michael of his defection, but the monk failed to circumvent the blockade and reach the capital. Upon learning of this defection, Thomas reacted quickly: with a select detachment, he followed Gregory, defeated his troops and killed the deserter.|$|E

25|$|On 15 November 1984 Schäuble was {{appointed}} as Minister for Special Affairs {{and head of}} the Chancellery by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. When in 1986 Soviet press belabored Kohl for having, in a magazine interview, made a comparison between the propaganda skills of Mikhail S.

25|$|The {{internal}} {{situation of}} the Byzantine Empire {{at the beginning of}} the 10th century was seen by SimeonI as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> There was an attempt to murder emperor Leo VI the Wise (r.886–912) in 903 and a rebellion of the commander of the Eastern army Andronikos Doukas in 905. The situation further deteriorated as the emperor entered into a feud with the Ecumenical Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos over his fourth marriage, to his mistress Zoe Karbonopsina. In 907, LeoVI had the patriarch deposed.|$|E

25|$|Philip II of Spain {{on hearing}} {{the news of}} the raid, as well as Walter Raleigh's capture of the {{settlement}} of Trinidad and the sack of Caracas by George Somers and Amyas Preston, held the notion that any attack must be answered by an appropriate response, since a failure to act would be taken by friends and foes alike as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness,</b> and lead ultimately to the ruin of his states. As a result, the Spanish raid on Cornwall on 13 August of the same year was carried out in retaliation.|$|E

25|$|Loeb is {{best remembered}} nationally for his alleged role in attacking Edmund Muskie through The Union Leader {{in what is}} known locally as the Canuck letter, derailing the Maine senator's 1972 presidential bid. Loeb {{is said to have}} helped in the forgery and {{publication}} of the letter in the paper's op-ed section. The letter slandered French-Canadians, and implied Muskie was prejudiced against them. Muskie's emotional defense of himself in front of the Union Leader offices in Manchester was seen as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> and instability. Muskie later claimed that there were not tears in his eyes, as many papers reported, but rather snowflakes (as it had been snowing that evening).|$|E

25|$|In 233, Man Chong wrote a {{memorial}} to the Wei imperial court, seeking permission to move the troops out of Hefei and station them in an area some 30 li west of the city, and build a fortress there. His plan was meant to lure Wu forces to attack a weakly defended Hefei, cut off their retreat route, and use the opportunity to destroy them. Jiang Ji, a Wei official, disagreed with Man Chong's plan because {{he believed that the}} Wu forces would see the drastic reduction in Hefei's defences as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> on Wei's part, and become more emboldened to attack and pillage the city.

25|$|The {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} non-interdigitating sutures in the skull of some reptilian groups, including Dilophosaurus, has been interpreted as indicating {{the presence of a}} system of levers, driven by jaw muscles, as an aid to predation. Welles (1984) rejected this hypothesis and interpreted the potential mobility in the skull of Dilophosaurus as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness,</b> and argued that the loose connection of the premaxilla precluded the capture and subduing of prey. This led to the early hypothesis that Dilophosaurus scavenged off carrion, because its teeth were too weak to bring down large prey. Recently, some researchers have argued that Dilophosaurus may have been piscivorous, due to the presence of Eubrontes-sized swim tracks at some localities, as well as anatomical similarities with spinosaurids.|$|E

25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of {{intimacy}} with people they consider to be high-status. Their sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations and to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are aware that their statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and to view it as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated.

500|$|Scholars {{argue that}} Muhammad {{had already decided}} upon this {{judgment}} before the Qurayza's surrender, and that Sa'ad was putting his allegiance to the Muslim community above that to his tribe.

Maxime Rodinson interprets the massacre as an astute political move that overrode all feelings of humanity, in order to remove a constant source of threat to Medina, and dishearten his enemies.|$|E
500|$|In {{a feature}} for 1UP.com, Jeremy Parish states that many Metroid fans were {{disappointed}} by the game's story, power-up restrictions and its [...] "awkward handling of its leading lady". Video game scholar Luke Arnott argued that players were dissatisfied with Other M {{because it did not}} consistently balance gameplay constraints with player agency, and because it failed at what he calls “imperative” storytelling. Arnott suggested that studying how games like Other M create meaning in virtual spaces may help design better games and situate them within wider theories of postmodern subjectivity. Clyde Mandelin of Legends of Localization noted that the game received mixed-to-positive reactions from Japanese fans. Kotakus Luke Plunkett wrote that Team Ninja was blamed by [...] "many people" [...] for the game's story; Hayashi later clarified that Sakamoto wrote the story himself.
