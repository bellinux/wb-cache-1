40|$|The {{structure}} and soot properties of nonbuoyant and weakly-buoyant round jet diffusion flames were studied, considering ethylene, propane and <b>acetylene</b> <b>burning</b> in air at pressures of 0. 125 - 2. 0 atm. Measurements of flame structure included radiative heat loss fractions, flame shape and temperature distributions in the fuel-lean (overfire) region. These measurements {{were used to}} evaluate flame structure predictions based on the conserved-scalar formalism {{in conjunction with the}} laminar flamelet concept, finding good agreement betweem predictions and measurements. Soot property measurements included laminar smoke points, soot volume function distributions using laser extinction, and soot structure using thermophoretic sampling and analysis by transmission electron microscopy. Nonbuoyant flames were found to exhibit laminar smoke points like buoyant flames but their properties are very different; in particular, nonbuoyant flames have laminar smoke point flame lengths and residence times that are shorter and longer, respectively, than buoyant flames...|$|E
40|$|The scalar {{structure}} of the overfire (fuel-lean) region of sooting turbulent diffusion flames was investigated, considering ethylene and <b>acetylene</b> <b>burning</b> in air. Measurements and predictions are reported of the mean concentrations of major gas species and mean soot volume fractions. Predictions {{were based on the}} conserved-scalar formalism in conjunction with the laminar flamelet approximation. The comparison between predictions and measurements was encouraging, suggesting that state relationships for major gas species, found in laminar diffusion flames, were preserved in the overfire region of the turbulent flames. Measurements also indicated nearly constant soot generation efficiencies from point to point in the overfire region for sufficiently long characteristic residence times to yield nearly universal soot volume fraction state relationships at the same conditions. However, effects attributed to finite-rate chemistry were observed at shorter characteristic residence times, causing spatial variations of soot generation efficiencies in the overfire region, with associated loss of universal soot volume fraction state relationships...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation {{conducted at}} the 2. 2 -s drop tower of the NASA Lewis Research Center is presented to quantify the influence of moderate fuel preheat on soot-field structure within 0 -g laminar gas jet diffusion flames. Parallel work in 1 -g is also presented to delineate the effect of elevated fuel temperatures on soot-field structure in buoyant flames. The experimental methodology implements jet diffusion flames of nitrogen-diluted <b>acetylene</b> fuel <b>burning</b> in quiescent air at atmospheric pressure. Fuel preheat of approximately 100 K in the 0 -g laminar jet diffusion flames is found to reduce soot loadings in the annular region, but causes an increase in soot volume fractions at the centerline. In addition, fuel preheat reduces the radial extent of the soot field in 0 -g. In 1 -g, the same fuel preheat levels have a more moderated influence on soot loadings in the annular region, but are also seen to enhance soot concentrations near the axis low in the flame. The increased soot loadings near the flame centerline, as caused by fuel preheat, {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that preheat levels of approximately 100 K enhance fuel pyrolysis rates. The results show that the growth stage of particles transported along the soot annulus is shortened both in 1 -g and 0 -g when elevated fuel temperatures are used...|$|R

5000|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1890s the lights were {{provided}} by <b>burning</b> <b>acetylene</b> gas generated in situ from calcium carbide reacting with water. The acetylene-gas illumination system could reliably be turned on and off automatically, enabling automated unattended lighthouses to be used. Once electricity became available, often provided {{by one or more}} diesel electric generators in remote locations, the light source was gradually converted to electrical power and the clockworks were run by some type of electric motor. For example, of modern changes, the Chatham Light in Chatham, Massachusetts (near the [...] "elbow" [...] of Cape Cod) the light was converted in 1969 from its Fresnel lens light assembly to a Carlisle & Finch DCB-224 rotating light generating over 2.8 million candela.

40|$|About 80 {{samples of}} {{antarctic}} air were collected between 1982 and 1985 at the “Georg von Neumayer” station (70 ° 36 ′S and 8 ° 22 ′W) and analyzed for ethane, ethene, acetylene, propane, and propene. Yearly average mixing ratios were 0. 37, 0. 36, 0. 011, 0. 07, and 0. 21 ppb, respectively. The seasonal cycles for ethane and acetylene showed minima around the late southern hemispheric summer and maxima in late winter. The {{phase of the}} seasonal cycle in ethane and acetylene {{can be explained by}} seasonal variation of atmospheric removal rates. Seasonal variation of one of the major southern hemispheric ethane and <b>acetylene</b> sources, biomass <b>burning,</b> would cause a similar seasonal change. Propane exhibits a much higher variability and shows no clear seasonal cycle. The atmospheric mixing ratios of ethene and propene peak around early austral fall and are most probably mainly determined by seasonal variation in emissions from the oceans surrounding Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} chemical {{kinetic model}} is developed and {{tested for the}} combustion of C 2 and C 3 oxygenated fuels such as ethanol, DME (dimethyl ether), acetone and n-propanol. It is validated by comparing predictions with experimental data {{on the structure of}} low pressure burner stabilised premixed flames and laminar burning velocities over a wide range of equivalence ratios. Data from shock tube and stirred reactor studies has also been considered. The elementary reactions of ethanol and DME oxidation have been studied extensively and were used {{as a starting point for}} extension to C 3 oxygenated fuels. The chemistry of acetylene which is one of major intermediate species in higher hydrocarbon flames was also updated to improve the reliability of the present mechanism and <b>acetylene</b> laminar <b>burning</b> velocities and low-pressure premixed lean and rich flames were also computed. The detailed mechanism features more than 1500 reaction steps and 269 species. The structure of laminar premixed flames are predicted by using measured temperature profiles and conditions cover fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures at low pressure. The profiles of reactants, products and major intermediate species are compared to experimental data from mass spectrometry and the overall agreement between the kinetic model and experimental data is satisfactory. An analytic study of fuel consumption pathways is carried out to understand the detailed consumption pathways. The present mechanism is also tested against laminar flame speeds by calculating freely propagating premixed flames to extend the understanding of the combustion characteristics of oxygenated fuels. A sensitivity analysis is also performed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
2500|$|An {{excess of}} {{acetylene}} creates a carbonizing flame. This flame {{is characterized by}} three flame zones; the hot inner cone, a white-hot [...] "acetylene feather", and the blue-colored outer cone. This {{is the type of}} flame observed when oxygen is first added to the <b>burning</b> <b>acetylene.</b> The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being the length of the inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately [...] The reducing flame is typically used for hard facing operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to carbonize it. The carbonizing flame will tend to remove the oxygen from iron oxides which may be present, a fact which has caused the flame to be known as a [...] "reducing flame".|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distributions}} and morphological {{properties of}} the soot aerosol are examined experimentally {{in a series of}} 0 -g laminar gas-jet nonpremixed flames. The methodology deploys round jet diffusion flames of nitrogen-diluted <b>acetylene</b> fuel <b>burning</b> in quiescent air at atmospheric pressure. Full-field laser-light extinction is utilized to determine transient soot spatial distributions within the flames. Thermophoretic sampling is employed in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy to define soot microstructure within the soot-emitting 0 -g flames. The microgravity tests indicate that the 0 -g flames attain a quasi-steady state roughly 0. 7 s after ignition, and sustain their annular structure even beyond their luminous flame tip. The measured peak soot volume fractions show a complex dependence on burner exit conditions, and decrease in a nonlinear fashion with decreasing characteristic flow residence times. Fuel preheat by approximately 140 K appears to accelerate the formation of soot near the flame axis via enhanced fuel pyrolysis rates. The increased soot presence caused by the elevated fuel injection temperatures triggers higher flame radiative losses, which may account for the premature suppression of soot growth observed along the annular region of preheated-fuel flames. Electron micrographs of soot aggregates collected in 0 -g reveal the presence of soot precursor particles near the symmetry axis at midflame height, The observations also verify that soot primary particle sizes are nearly uniform among aggregates present at the same flame location, but vary considerably with radius at a fixed distance from the burner. The maximum primary size in 0 -g is found to be by 40 % larger than in 1 -g, under the same burner exit conditions. Estimates of the number concentration of primary particles and surface area of soot particulate phase per unit volume of the combustion gases are also made for selected in-flame locations...|$|R
40|$|Nonbuoyant flames offer {{themselves}} as an attractive and promising platform {{to gain a}} better understanding of soot mechanisms. The effects of buoyancy can be eliminated temporarily in drop towers which sustain brief intervals of reduced gravity-typically lower than 10 (exp - 3) g- extending up to several seconds at a time. Microgravity facilities have been employed to show that nonbuoyant flames are longer, wider and sootier than their normal-gravity counterparts. Sunderland et al. recently verified the existence of smoke point in laminar nonbuoyant flames. As reported, microgravity flames operating above their smoke point displayed a blunt tip and much broader soot-containing regimes in comparison to their buoyant counterparts. Mortazavi et al. established that residence times in microgravity laminar jet diffusion flames with Re= 0 (100) tend to be proportional to burner diameter and inversely proportional to burner exit velocity. This offers the capability to alter residence times in nonbuoyant laminar jet diffusion flames when varying the burner exit diameters and velocities. Megaridis et al. presented a quantitative definition of the soot-field structure within laminar microgravity jet diffusion flames which operated well above their smoke point. The experimental methodology involved a full-field laser-light extinction technique and jet diffusion flames of nitrogen-diluted (50 % vol.) <b>acetylene</b> fuel <b>burning</b> in quiescent air at atmospheric pressure. The work was conducted at the 2. 2 s drop tower of the NASA Lewis Research Center (NASA-LeRC). Parallel work on 1 -g flames was also presented in (6) to facilitate comparisons on the effect of gravity on the soot fields. As reported, the soot spatial distributions in 0 -g flames did not change in a detectable manner after 1 s within a typical 2. 2 s experiment. During that period, the soot field was shown to sustain a pronounced annular structure throughout the luminous nonbuoyant-flame zone. The maximum soot volume fraction measured at 0 -g was nearly a factor of two higher than that at 1 -g, thus confirming the enhanced sooting tendency of nonbuoyant flames. Greenberg and Ku presented a similar study and reported trends that matched those of for the 50 % (vol.) nitrogen-diluted acetylene fuel. Furthermore, they examined pure acetylene flames and reported similar trends with respect to the influence of gravity on maximum soot volume fractions and flame cross-section-averaged soot loadings. Both studies clearly demonstrated the improved spatial resolution of microgravity flames compared to their normal-gravity counterparts. The current study evaluates the influence of moderate fuel preheat on soot formation within 0 -g laminar gas jet diffusion flames. While fuel temperature variations have little influence on residence times in 1 -g, they have a much more significant effect in 0 -g. The primary objective of this program is to quantify this effect and its consequences on sooting by comparing soot volume fraction distributions under preheated and unpreheated-fuel conditions. Furthermore, the current work aims at expanding the limited soot database available for nonbuoyant flames. Soot fields in such flames can be used to perform additional tests of recently developed soot sub-models which have the potential to become powerful predicting tools in combustion design...|$|R
