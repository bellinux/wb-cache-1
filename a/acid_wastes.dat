The process requires anaerobic conditions and an organic carbon source, as well as other life-sustaining constituents. These denitrification studies produced process design information on a columnar denitrification plant and on continuous- flow, stirred-bed reactors. Denitrification, using packed columns, was found to be desirable for soluble salts, such as those of sodium and ammonium; denitrification, using stirred reactors, was found to be desirable for mixtures containing insoluble salts, such as those of calcium and aluminum. Packed columns were found to have denitrification rates ranging up to 122 grams of nitrate per day per cubic decimeter of column volume; stirred-bed reactors have been shown to have reaction rates near 10 grams of nitrate per day per cubic decimeter of reactor volume. The continuous-flow, stirred-bed reactors were selected for scaleup studies because of the solids-removal problems associated with packed columns when operating on feeds containing high concentrations of insoluble salts or ions which form insoluble salts with the products of the denitrification reaction.

The barge which transports this waste has a 1, 000, 000 gallon capacity and makes approximately three trips to the disposal site per week.

Since some acids have a strong green component during dumping and turn slowly more brownish-reddish with age, the ratio of radiance signatures between the green and red bands may give an indication of how long before the satellite overpass the acid was dumped. Enlarged enhancements of the acid waste plumes, prepared from the ERTS- 1 MSS digital tapes aided considerably in studies of the dispersion of the waste plume. Currently acid dumps are being coordinated with ERTS- 1 overpasses...|$|E

Over 14 × 106 m 3 of sewage sludge, dredge spoils, <b>acid</b> <b>wastes,</b> and cellar dirt are discharged into this area each year. Large populations of Bacillus sp. resistant to 20 μg of mercury per ml were observed in Bight sediments contaminated by these wastes. Resistant Bacillus populations were much greater in sediments containing high concentrations of Hg and other heavy metals than in sediments from areas further offshore where dumping has never been practiced and where heavy-metal concentrations were found to be low. Ampicillin resistance due mainly to β-lactamase production was significantly (P < 0. 001) more frequent in Bacillus strains from sediments near the sewage sludge dump site than in similar Bacillus populations from control sediments. Bacillus strains with combined ampicillin and Hg resistances were almost six times as frequent at the sludge dump site as in control sediments. This observation suggests that genes for Hg resistance and β-lactamase production are simultaneously selected for in Bacillus and that heavy-metal contamination of an ecosystem can result in a selection pressure for antibiotic resistance in bacteria in that system. Also, Hg resistance was frequently linked with other heavy-metal resistances and, in a substantial proportion of Bacillus strains, involved reduction to volatile metallic Hg (Hg°) ...|$|E

The aim of this work was to study the adaptation of microalgae (which play an important role as primary producers) from AWHM sensitivity to AWHM resistance by using the alga Scenedesmus intermedius as an experimental model. The Malthusian parameter (m) and the carrying capacity (K) were reduced by mud and soil samples collected from the affected area. A dose–effect analysis showed that fitness progressively diminished with increasing sample concentration. A fluctuation analysis demonstrated that AWHM-resistant cells arose by rare spontaneous mutations that occurred randomly prior to the incorporation of the AWHM. The rate of spontaneous mutation from AWHM sensitivity to AWHM resistance was 2 12 x 10 −O mutants per cell division. A competition experiment between wild-type AWHM-sensitive cells and AWHM-resistant mutants showed that in small populations the AWHM-resistant mutants are driven to extinction in the absence of selection for AWHM resistance. The resistant phenotypes are maintained in the absence of AWHM {{as the result of a}} balance between spontaneous mutation and natural selection, so that about 43 AWHM-resistant mutants per million cells are present in the absence of AWHM. Our experimental model suggests that mutation is essential for adaptation of microalgal populations to environmental changes. Rare spontaneous pre-adaptive mutation is enough to ensure the survival of microalgal populations in contaminated environments when the population size is large enough. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Pilot-plant studies using simulated high-level <b>acid</b> <b>wastes</b> representative of those to be produced by Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS) are also included. Combined AGNS high-level and intermediate-level waste (0. 26 M Na in blend) was successfully calcined when powdered iron was added (to result in a Na/Fe mole ratio of 1. 0) to the feed to prevent particle agglomeration due to sodium nitrate. Long-term runs (approximately 100 hours) showed that calcination of the combined waste is practical. Concentrated AGNS waste containing sodium at concentrations less than 0. 2 M were calcined successfully; concentrated waste containing 1. 13 M Na calcined successfully when powdered iron {{was added to the}} feed to suppress sodium nitrate formation. Calcination of dilute AGNS waste by conventional fluid-bed techniques was unsuccessful due to the inability to control bed particle size [...] both particle size and bed level decreased. Fluid-bed solidification of AGNS dilute waste at conditions in which most of the calcined solids left the calciner vessel with the off-gas was successful. In such a concept, the steady-state composition of the bed material would be approximately 22 wt percent calcined solids deposited on inert particles.

Extensive laboratory and pilot plant work, proper equipment design, and satisfactory oper ating procedures were the bases for developing adequate safeguards that assure complete control of the reaction at all times. During operation, the formaldehyde and the preheated PAW stream (with 50 to 100 parts antifoam per million parts PAW) are added continuously to the reactor which is maintained at 95 deg C. From an initial feed concentration of approximately 6. 1 M, the free acid is reduced to 0. 5 to 1. 0 M in the treated waste. About 2. 5 moles of free acid are destroyed per mole of formaldehyde added to the unit for a 60 % reaction efficiency.
