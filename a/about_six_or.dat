5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

[...] Gazebo and Tiara feared that Dr. Robotnik was after the six Rings of Order, and called on Sonic to get the Rings before Robotnik could. Dr. Robotnik kidnapped Gazebo after he requested Sonic's help, making it so Sonic had to retrieve both him and the Rings of Order. [...] At one point in the development process, there was a possibility for 4 playable characters: Knuckles the Echidna, Tiara Boobowski, Miles [...] "Tails" [...] Prower, and Sonic the Hedgehog. [...] Other characters intended {{to be included in the}} game were Fang the Sniper and Metal Sonic, who would have been a boss character in the final level.

2500|$|The rattle {{consists}} {{of a series of}} loosely interlocking hollow shells, each of which was at one point the scale covering the tip of the tail. In most other snakes, the tail tip, or terminal spine, is cone-shaped, hardly any thicker {{than the rest of the}} skin, and is shed along with it at each successive molt. In this case, however, the end-scale, or [...] "button", is much thicker and shaped like a bulb, with one or two annular constrictions to prevent it from falling off. Before each molt, a new button will have developed inside the last one and before the skin is shed, the tip of new button shrinks, thereby loosening the shell of the previous one. This process continues so the succession of molts produces an appendage consisting of a number of interlocking segments that make an audible noise when vibrated. Since younger specimens may shed three or four times in a year, every time adding a new segment to the rattle, the number of segments bears no relation to the age of the snake. In theory, the rattle could become very long indeed, but in practice, the older segments tend to wear out and fall off. How quickly this happens depends on the snake's environment, but end segments tend to break off after the rattle becomes <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven segments long; it is uncommon to find specimens with as many as a dozen segments. In captive specimens, however, as many as 29 segments have been found.|$|E
2500|$|Alfred Richardson duly {{started his}} duties at Newcastle-under-Lyme Police Station on 2 September 1901. The Force size {{for the town}} was 18 men. His new {{telephone}} number was '9'. Within a few days there was a ceremony at the Town Hall and Square for the Mayor and the town dignitaries and local citizens to meet their new Chief Constable, which he attended in his Number One uniform. This showed the Chief Constable's badge of rank, worn on the epaulettes, which consisted of crossed tipstaves in a wreath, surmounted by a crown, similar to the insignia of a Lieutenant General in the British Army. The population of the town was about 20,000 people and it was heavily industrialized. The conditions for his men were, [...] "All Officers had to wear helmets for all duties and keep Truncheons. Constables would work twelve hours a day, seven days a week. There would be two shifts, one day and one night." [...] There were no meal breaks. A beat system was such that a Constable {{was taken to the}} start of his beat on foot by a superior. Constables worked on 'shifts', which meant they spent <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven hours during the day or night at their work. Some weeks they did 'nights', others they did 'evenings', others did 'days'. At this period they worked seven days a week with no rest days, which was to become a factor in Richardson's next appointment. As he had in Birmingham previously, the new Chief Constable now appeared by name regularly in the local newspaper in court cases. In these cases Alfred Richardson was the prosecutor, a role he was to continue in his next post. At this time, and later, the Borough had an ongoing problem with smallpox which added to police work with contagion. Newcastle-under-Lyme Fire Service worked, as all fire services did, in conjunction with the local police force, but it was an entirely separate unit. There was a Fire Brigade Captain and Lieutenant, 12 men and two runners in Richardson's time. In 1901 it had a first class steam engine, one manual engine and a new fire escape. It was separated from the police force in the early 1880s.|$|E
