40|$|An {{integral}} {{model is}} proposed for recombination at the silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO 2) interface of thermally oxidized p-type silicon via Pb amphoteric centers <b>associated</b> with <b>surface</b> dangling <b>bonds.</b> The proposed {{model is a}} surface adaptation of a model developed for bulk recombination in amorphous silicon based on Sah-Shockley statistics which is more appropriate for amphoteric center recombination than classical Shockley-Read-Hall statistics. It is found that the surface recombination via amphoteric centers having capture cross-sections larger for charged centers than for neutral centers is distinguished from Shockley-Read-Hall recombination by exhibiting two peaks rather than one peak when plotted versus surface potential. Expressions are derived for the surface potentials at which the peaks occur. Such a finding provides a firm and plausible interpretation for the double peak surface recombination current measured in gated diodes or gated transistors. Successful fitting is possible between {{the results of the}} model and reported experimental curves showing two peaks for surface recombination velocity versus surface potential. On the other hand, if charged and neutral center capture cross-sections are equal or close to equal, surface recombination via amphoteric centers follows the same trend as Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and both models lead to comparable surface recombination velocities...|$|R

40|$|We {{fabricated}} a silicon nanocrystal (NC) suspension with visible, continuous, tunable {{light emission}} with pH sensitivity from violet to blue-green. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis exhibit the highly crystalline nanoparticles of silicon. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra at different pH values, such as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, reveal {{the origins of}} light emission from the silicon NC suspension, which includes both the quantum confinement effect and <b>surface</b> <b>bonding.</b> The quantum confinement effect dominates the PL origins of silicon NCs, especially determining the tunability and the emission range of PL, while the <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> regulates the maximum peak center, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and offsets of PL peaks {{in response to the}} changing pH value. The peak fitting of PLE curves reveals one of the divided PLE peaks shifts towards a shorter wavelength when the pH value increases, which implies correspondence with the <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> between silicon NCs and hydrogen atoms or hydroxyl groups. The consequent detailed analysis of the PL spectra indicates that the <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> results in the transforming of the PL curves towards longer wavelengths with the increasing pH values, which is defined as the pH sensitivity of PL. These results suggest that the present silicon NCs with pH-sensitive tunable light emission could find promising potential applications as optical sources, bio-sensors, etc...|$|R

40|$|Some <b>surface</b> <b>bonded</b> and fluram labeled primary amines show a new red-shifted {{emission}} {{in their}} fluorescence spectrum.

In order to verify this hypothesis we synthesized a <b>surface</b> <b>bonded</b> dendrimer with a step-wise increasing NH 2 density. Using molecules with different lengths as branches in the dendrimer, the amine density can be varied. Only in the case of the highest density, the new fluorescence emission was detected.

40|$|All-electron density-functional {{calculations}} {{are performed}} to study atomic structure and electronic {{properties of the}} nonpolar surfaces, namely zinc blende (110) and wurtzite (10 (1) over bar 0) of AlN. Both surfaces are modeled using a two-dimensional periodic slab allowing the relaxation {{of the first two}} surface layers in the calculations. The results predict a small layer rotation angle accompanied by a contraction of Al-N bond length for both surfaces. These results do not follow the well-accepted rotation-relaxation model that predicts large layer rotation angles (similar to 28 degrees) with no change in the bond length for most of the III-V semiconductor surfaces. Analysis of the relaxed configurations of the AlN surfaces in terms of atomic geometry, density of states, and charge density plots shows a presence of partial double-bond character in the <b>surface</b> Al-N <b>bond.</b> A similarity of these results with an earlier study on GaN nonpolar surfaces [J.

40|$|Pyridine as {{a typical}} model {{molecule}} has been most extensively studied by SERS for three decades. However, {{there has not been}} a satisfactory explanation for the dramatic change of the relative intensity of the two main bands assigned to the total symmetric modes at 1008 and 1035 cm(- 1) when pyridine was adsorbed on silver and many other metals. We performed a hybrid density functional theory study of the binding interaction and the Raman spectral properties of pyridine-metal clusters. The calculated Raman scattering factors of total symmetric modes for the pyridine-metal complexes indicate that the bonding interaction influences the relative Raman intensity of the vibrational modes. The <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> mechanism was analyzed on the basis of molecular orbital theory. It was also shown that the binding interaction will lead to geometric changes and result in metal-dependent surface Raman spectra. This theoretical approach could be helpful in using SERS to study surface chemistry, in particular to extract valuable information about <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> and adsorption through calculating and analyzing the relative intensity of SERS spectra.

40|$|An {{optical fiber}} sensor <b>surface</b> <b>bonded</b> onto a host {{structure}} and subjected to a temperature change is analytically studied in this work. The analysis is developed {{in order to assess}} the thermal behavior of an {{optical fiber sensor}} designed for measuring the strain in the host structure. For a <b>surface</b> <b>bonded</b> optical fiber sensor, the measuring sensitivity is strongly dependent on the bonding characteristics which include the protective coating, adhesive layer and the bonding length. Thermal stresses can be generated due to a mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between the optical fiber and host structure. The optical fiber thermal strain induced by the host structure is transferred via the adhesive layer and protective coating. In this investigation, an analytical expression of the thermal strain and stress in the optical fiber is presented. The theoretical predictions are validated using the finite element method. Numerical results show that the thermal strain and stress are linearly dependent on the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the optical fiber and host structure and independent of the thermal expansion coefficients of the adhesive and coating...|$|R
