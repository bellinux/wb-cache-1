This game languished in development hell and was officially cancelled on February 26, 2009 due to lack of funding and irresolvable bugs.|$|E

This paper presents a task modeling approach for user interface design and aims at exploring mappings between task, domain and presentation models. The basic idea of our {{approach is to}} identify typical configurations in task and domain models and to investigate how they relate each other. A special emphasis is put on applicationspecific functions and mappings between domain objects and operational task structures. In this respect, we will address two layers in task decomposition: a functional (planning) layer and <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> <b>layer.</b> Keywords—task modeling, user interface design, unit tasks, basic tasks, operational task model.

In addition, two cascading failure mitigation strategies are presented from both a network interdependence relation perspective and <b>a</b> physical <b>layer</b> <b>operational</b> perspective. Cascading failures in a CPPS with increasing initial failure sizes are then simulated for different scenarios.|$|R

This research seeks to provide an insight into a company's globally competitive strategies by constructing a global manufacturing model. The objective of the model is threefold; organizational, operational, and societal layers. First, an organizational layer helps understand the nature of globalization by cultivating a global mindset in order to design a worldwide organizational structure appropriately. Second, <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> <b>layer</b> discusses, the general idea of what policy a company needs to develop and how a company globally manages its operations and supply chain, resources, and markets. The third layer, societal, shows the importance and the impacts of cross-border environments such as cultures, economics and politics. As illustrations of the model, two case studies are composed. First, SmartDrill Company shows the cross-cultural and economic influences on the company plan to establish a green-field Maquiladora plant. The second case, AWC Company, highlights the effort to reduce supply chain costs, when crossing the U. S. -Mexico border, especially transportation and inventory holding costs, and illustrates the political involvement in NAFTA transportation provision. This research provides information that should contribute {{to a better understanding of}} being globally competitive and helps a company to be able to make a wise move against its competitors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{paradigm}} of ubiquitous computing has {{for some time}} attempted to blur the boundaries between computation and material practice. However such distinction still exists and suffers from lack of functional transparency. Rejecting strategies which consider computation as <b>an</b> independent addon <b>operational</b> <b>layer,</b> we seek to promote and emphasize the integration of novel materials and material technologies as elements revoking the gap between artifact and gadget, and between disciplines that have traditionally stood apart. We identify such materials as Transitive Materials, {{in that they are}} able to create and contribute to truly ubiquitous and cohesive computational systems extending invisibly across different scales of function and context. We focus on challenges and implications inherent in creating ubiquitous interaction via the augmentation of materials and structures, and addresses the design (architecture, fashion, textiles) and scientific (ubicomp, wearables, computation, materials) disciplines to support crossdisciplinary discussion of scenarios and methodologies for ubiquitous computing applications mediated by transitive materials that integrate form, function, and computation...|$|R
40|$|The {{lability}} of {{a complex}} species between a metal ion M and a binding site S, MS, is conventionally defined with respect to an ongoing process at a reactive interface, for example, the conversion or accumulation of the free metal ion M by a sensor. In the case of soft charged multisite nanoparticulate complexes, the chemodynamic features that are operative within the micro environment of the particle body generally differ substantially from those for dissolved similar single-site complexes in the same medium. Here we develop a conceptual framework for the chemodynamics and the ensuing lability of soft (3 D) nanoparticulate metal complexes. The approach considers the dynamic features of MS at the intraparticulate level {{and their impact on}} the overall reactivity of free metal ions at the surface of a macroscopic sensing interface. Chemodynamics at the intraparticulate level is shown to involve a local reaction layer at the particle/medium interface, while at the macroscopic sensor level <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> reaction <b>layer</b> is invoked. Under a certain window of conditions, volume exclusion of the nanoparticle body near the medium/sensor interface is substantial and affects the properties of the reaction layer and the overall lability of the nanoparticulate MS complex toward the reactive surface...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{trends in}} {{heterogeneous}} distributed metacomputing and in Web Services technologies exhibit several commonalities that each domain can exploit. In this paper, we present an architectural model and design issues in leveraging Web Services to construct metacomputing frameworks. Our design {{is based on}} a combination of concepts currently embodied in the Harness system and those implemented by the Web Services Description Language and associated technologies. We begin by drawing parallels between component based metacomputing and the use of web services in the electronic commerce domain. We then suggest that the direct use of web service technologies is inappropriate and inefficient for high performance distributed computing, but that natural extensions are possible to enhance the suitability of these technologies. Based on our proposed extensions, specifically with regard to component deployment, localization, and encoding, we describe <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> model, architectural <b>layering,</b> and high-level design for the Harness II metacomputing framework. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for the automatic generation of an interpretive implementation for {{a programming language}} from <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> <b>operational</b> semantic description of the language. Layers in the semantic model represent levels of abstraction which correspond {{to the needs of}} various classes of user of the semantic description (programmers, language designers, and so on). The layers are built one atop the other, with the innermost layer of the model being based on the algebraic specification of abstract data types. Different kinds of user can thus use the same language definition, examining it to differing levels of detail. The complete layered programming language definition can be submitted to a system which automatically generates an interpretive implementation of the language. The implementation will hence be consistent with the description of the language being used by each kind of user. In particular, this technique presents many advantages for language designers, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Integration {{frameworks}} for building software engineering environments provide at least data, control and presentation integration facilities, together with integration devices which afford {{access to these}} facilities by the tools which populate the framework. Typically, an integration device is a specially developed language, or extension to an existing language, in which the integration programmer specifies the desired interactions between the tools comprising the software engineering environment. Surprisingly little effort {{has been applied to}} assessing the expressiveness of integration languages, even though the power of such a language limits the level of integration a tool can achieve within the environment. Our work seeks to provide an approach to both assessing and comparing the expressiveness of the integration devices of a range of commercial and research products. The paper presents <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> <b>operational</b> model, based on information structures; this model has been developed for describing the semantics of the inter-tool communication features of integration devices in a precise manner, and in a manner which will facilitate such assessment and comparison...|$|R
