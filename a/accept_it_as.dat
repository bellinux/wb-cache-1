5|$|Betances {{was awarded}} the rank of Chévalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor by the French {{government}} in July 1887, for {{his work as a}} diplomat for the Dominican Republic, and for his work as a medical doctor in France. He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility, until friends from Puerto Rico persuaded him to <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a tribute to Puerto Rico, and not as a personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a theological concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its meaning {{in a variety}} of ways due to differences in the doctrines of salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} considered Danny Denzongpa for {{the role}} of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered {{for the role}} of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested {{to play the role of}} Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not extremely popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself.|$|E

25|$|The Ottomans took {{advantage}} of Bocskai's uprising. Lala Mehmed Pasha captured Esztergom on 3October. Bocskai's commander, Bálint Drugeth, prevented his Ottoman allies from entering Érsekújvár (now Nové Zámky in Slovakia) when he forced the defenders of the town to give in on 17October. Bocskai met Lala Mehmed Pasha at Pest on 11November. The Grand Vizier styled Bocskai king and gave a royal crown to him, {{but he refused to}} <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a royal insignia.|$|E
25|$|After the {{annexation}} of his kingdom by British, Purandar Singha {{continued to live}} in Jorhat.

The petition of Purandar Singha was turn down by Governor-General, after consulting with the British officials serving in Assam.|$|E

25|$|According to copyright, music, and {{pop culture}} {{scholars}} Kembrew Mcleod and Peter DiCola, {{the golden age}} of hip-hop sampling spans from 1987-1992.

25|$|The use of bourdon tube, diaphragm, {{and digital}} depth gauges may require {{adjustment}} for use at altitude.

25|$|The {{reconstruction}} plan, {{developed at}} a meeting of the participating European states, was drafted on June 5, 1947. It offered the same aid to the Soviet Union and its allies, but they refused to <b>accept</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> doing so would allow a degree of US control over the communist economies. In fact, the Soviet Union prevented its satellite states (i.e., East Germany, Poland, etc.) from accepting. Secretary Marshall became convinced Stalin had no interest in helping restore economic health in Western Europe.|$|E

25|$|Leviticus 1–16 {{sees the}} world as divided between the profane (i.e., not holy) masses and the holy priests. Anyone who incurs {{impurity}} must {{be separated from the}} priests and the Temple until purity is restored through washing, sacrifice, and the passage of time. Leviticus 17–26 is called the Holiness code, from its repeated insistence that Israel should be a holy people; scholars <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a discrete collection within the larger Priestly source, and have traced similar holiness writings elsewhere in the Pentateuch.|$|E
25|$|In {{editions of}} the Roman Missal before 1970, Saint Michael was {{mentioned}} in the Confiteor as recited by the priest and again in altar server's response at Mass.

Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen (Through the intercession of Blessed Michael the Archangel, standing at the right hand of the altar of incense, and of all his elect, may the Lord kindly bless this incense and <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a savour of sweetness).|$|E
25|$|This {{story is}} {{generally}} regarded as apocryphal, although some modern authors have accepted it uncritically or seen a kernel of historical truth in it. Spanish historian A. Ballesteros argued that Ferdinand adopted the title in opposition to Henry III's imperial pretensions. German historian E. E. Stengel believed the version found in Mariana {{on the grounds that}} the latter probably used the now lost acts of the Council of Florence. Juan Beneyto Pérez was willing to <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> based on tradition and Ernst Steindorff, the nineteenth-century student of the reign of Henry III, as being authentically transmitted via the romancero. Menéndez Pidal accepted the account of Mariana, but placed it in the year 1065.|$|E

25|$|Though {{at first}} the idea would shock the general public some {{eventually}} came to <b>accept</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> they came to accept the 'atomist' representation of the universe as a multitude of dots consisting of primary colors. Just as each color is modified by its relation to adjacent colors {{within the context of}} Neo-Impressionist color theory, so too the object is modified by the geometric forms adjacent to it within the context of Cubism. The concept of 'mobile perspective' is essentially an extension of a similar principle stated in Paul Signac's D'Eugène Delacroix au néo-impressionisme, with respect to color. Only now, the idea is extended to deal with questions of form within the context of both space and time.|$|E

25|$|On 11 July 1920, the {{government}} of Great Britain sent a telegram to the Soviets, signed by Curzon, which {{has been described as}} a de facto ultimatum. It requested that the Soviets halt their offensive at the Curzon line and <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a temporary border with Poland, until a permanent border could be established in negotiations. In case of Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with all the means available, which, in reality, were limited by the internal political situation in the United Kingdom. On 17 July, the Bolsheviks refused and made a counter-offer to negotiate a peace treaty directly with Poland. The British responded by threatening to cut off the ongoing trade negotiations if the Soviets conducted further offensives against Poland. These threats were ignored.|$|E
