5|$|On 22 January 1976, {{a second}} UDR soldier, Sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell (aged 29, an optical worker, also from Lurgan) {{was arrested and}} charged with the Miami killings. He served in C Company, 11th Battalion UDR. The RUC were led to him through his glasses which had been found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene.</b> Tests done on the glasses, which were {{eventually}} traced back to McDowell, revealed that the lenses were of a prescription worn by just 1 in 500,000 of the population.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene</b> did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E

50|$|A chance {{sighting}} of a pentagram brings Harry {{a flash of}} inspiration. The five-pointed diamonds found on the victims are in a similar shape - known as a Devil's Star - and Harry remembers having seen <b>the</b> same symbol <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scenes.</b> <b>The</b> further significance of the pentagram soon becomes apparent to Harry, and provides a major clue as to <b>the</b> next possible <b>murder</b> locations, which are kept under surveillance. One is in a student residence hall {{and the other a}} house {{on the outskirts of the}} city, owned by Olaug Sivertsen.|$|R
5|$|There {{were several}} {{bystanders}} {{who witnessed the}} murder and managed to see {{the faces of the}} assassins, including Juan Manuel Bautista, a colleague of Buendía; Rogelio Barrera Galindo, a man who had parked his vehicle close to the journalist's; and Felipe Flores Fernández, a bus driver. Among the first to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene</b> was José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buendía's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buendía's corpse circulated across Mexico {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Watts later shows Black {{a picture}} taken <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene,</b> with Sammael {{recognizable}} among {{a crowd of}} people. Elsewhere, a man named Martin (Guy Fauchon) is arrested after slitting a babysitter's throat at a public park; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime, Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher's murder. However, he soon starts to suspect that Martin may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to see into the minds of others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Walt's partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has just shot Gale {{to death on}} orders from Walt to foil Gus' plot to kill and replace them. Gus' henchman Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui) arrives at Gale's {{apartment}} and finds him dead, surrounded by neighbors who have just called the police. Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint {{to return to the}} meth lab, where Gus' employee Mike (Jonathan Banks) is holding Walt hostage. Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene,</b> calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E

5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene</b> was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene</b> and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces {{of blood on the}} pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene.</b> In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E

25|$|Coppola {{left his}} gun and hat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene.</b> Since the {{advancement}} of forensics since 1977, a judge ordered Coppola to submit a DNA test. When the FBI requested a DNA sample on August 8, 1996 which could have proved he was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene,</b> Coppola fled his Spring Lake, New Jersey home with his wife. He spent most his time moving between apartments in San Francisco and New York City. During his time on the run, he was featured on America's Most Wanted. Although on the run, authorities believed he was still holding power over organized crime in New Jersey as a fugitive. A fellow New Jersey mobster for the Genovese family and a Furmara/Coppola associate, was charged by the FBI with illegally harboring Coppola during the months before he was caught and arrested. In April 2002, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey obtained an indictment against Fiumara for conspiring to assist Coppola in Coppola’s flight. In March 2003, {{he pleaded guilty to}} conspiring to conceal and failing to report that he had been in contact with Coppola. In November, a federal judge ordered Fiumara back to prison for eight months for concealing Coppola’s whereabouts.|$|E

They took samples for analysis, which proved the positive identification of a human arm, buttock and thigh.|$|R
25|$|Raja Petra later distanced {{himself from}} the {{statutory}} declaration {{in an interview with}} TV3, saying his accusations linking Najib and Rosmah to the murder was repeating information passed onto him by opposition figures, rather than information he knew to be true himself. He stated that he did not genuinely believe that Rosmah was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene.</b> The Malaysian Civil Liberties Movement alleged the interview was heavily edited and spin doctored in favour of Prime Minister Najib Razak {{just in time for the}} upcoming Sarawak state elections. Raja Petra has backed up this assertion during an interview with Malaysiakini.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{testified that}} Bembenek had spoken often of killing Christine Schultz. The {{prosecution}} produced {{a witness who}} said Bembenek offered to pay him {{to carry out the}} murder. According to witnesses for the prosecution, Bembenek owned a green jogging suit similar to the one described by Schultz's son. It was pointed out that Bembenek owned a clothes line and a blue bandanna similar to what was used to bind and gag the victim. A wig found in the plumbing system of Bembenek's apartment matched fibers found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene.</b> A boutique employee testified that Bembenek purchased such a wig shortly before the murder.|$|E

Back at his apartment, he is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), who tell him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening. Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby, who likely killed Archer, immediately after he learned of Archer's death. Archer's widow Iva (Gladys George) believes that Spade shot his partner so he could have her.|$|E

25|$|Detectives went to Simpson's Rockingham {{estate to}} inform {{him that his}} ex-wife had been murdered. In {{the back of his}} home, they found some blood {{scattered}} all over on a white Ford Bronco. Detective Mark Fuhrman climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances—specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to Chicago late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found under the bed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene.</b> Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson.|$|E
500|$|Given the {{high-profile}} of the case, the police received several tips from citizens. Police theorized that Fischer {{was killed by}} a drug gang that had mistaken him for someone else. They questioned a man alleged to be the intended victim, but the rumors turned out to be false. They also investigated an abandoned vehicle near the U.S.-Mexico border they suspected was used in the shooting. The car was reported stolen in South Padre Island, but detectives determined that it was not the vehicle the murderers used. The police continued to pursue the lead from the bail office in McKinney. They called the office and asked for recent bail applications from South Texas locations. The office gave them Cuellar's full name, his Dallas address, and faxed a copy of the application. Investigators noticed that the man's handwriting, specifically how the [...] "4" [...] was written, matched the handwriting on the yellow business card found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E

Mahrad had also {{admitted to}} being present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>scene,</b> and claimed that the blood stains found on his trousers occurred {{as a result of his}} accidentally falling across Parker. Ali, defended by Mohammed Latif, denied being at the scene and claimed to have been asleep at the time of the murder, although a recording from a police van indicated this was a [...] "story" [...] that he had encouraged the others to [...] "stick to".
