5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls the knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E

25|$|The {{programme}} {{focused on}} the exploits of a handyman - Simon Bodger (played by Andy Cunningham) - and his pet badger, who has a penchant (some may say an obsession) for mashed potato (although this <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> instant mash potato and not proper mashed potatoes). The first four series focused on Bodger's varying jobs as a handyman and his attempts to hide Badger from his bosses (who would inevitably fire him should they discover a badger on their premises). However, it is not revealed how Badger kept following Simon to work {{if he was not}} allowed there, or why Simon allowed it himself.|$|E
500|$|Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 3 out of 4; he said: [...] "Woodley...balances grace with gravity, wit with heart." [...] A. O. Scott writing for The New York Times said: [...] "The film sets out to make you weepnot just sniffle or choke up a little, but sob until your nose runs and your face turns blotchy. It succeeds." [...] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr gave the film a rating of 2.5 out 4 and said: [...] "If Elgort's Gus is glibly charming and {{ultimately}} affecting, The Fault in Our Stars belongs to Woodley, a performer who <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> backing warily into her own movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Fox Mulder and Dana Scully's {{fight in}} the episode where Scully gets upset due to Mulder always driving grew out of nitpicking from fans {{about the fact that}} Mulder <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the one driving the car. Mulder's joke about Scully's [...] "little feet" [...] was a joke that Carter had made before at an X-Files {{convention}} in Pasadena, California. Gillian Anderson stated that these have been things that fans on the internet have been nitpicking about {{since the beginning of the}} show. David Duchovny later explained that the comedic episodes of the series were often more ludicrous than the other episodes in the show. He noted, [...] "There's The X-Files of the stand-alone, and then there's The X-Files of the mythology, and then there are the comedic X-Files as well, in which the characters are really not quite the characters that we know." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show's {{official}} website describes Leslie as a [...] "skilled attorney". She {{is a lawyer}} at Vance Abram's law firm. Conwell stated: [...] "She's sharp as a tack and self-assured." [...] Of Leslie's on and off storyline, Conwell said: [...] "With my character being a lawyer there <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> something {{going on in the}} city so Leslie is out there tending to her business". She explained that Leslie loves what she does, and [...] "finds different angles" [...] in cases which she can focus on. When Leslie first arrived, she became a [...] "one-time" [...] love interest for long-running character Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John). The couple didn't last long. Conwell said that when Leslie and Neil first hooked up, they went [...] "in for the kill" [...] and moved fast, but she wasn't sure whether the romance would be revisited.|$|E

[...] McDavid had a strong start to the season before breaking his hand in an on ice fight on November 11, 2014. [...] At the time, McDavid was leading the OHL in points, having scored 16 goals and 35 assists in 18 games. [...] McDavid missed six weeks of play {{as a result of his}} injury, returning to the ice to play for Canada at the 2015 World Junior Championships.

Marie Greyhounds player, Nick Ritchie, was second in playoff scoring with 26 points). He was awarded the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as playoff MVP despite the fact that the Erie Otters were eliminated in 5 games in the OHL Championship by the Oshawa Generals. New York Islanders captain, and former Oshawa General, John Tavares, was in attendance during Game 3 of the 2015 finals and said of McDavid: [...] "I don't think I've ever seen anyone with that kind of acceleration — you think he's at top gear and there just <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] another level." ...|$|E
