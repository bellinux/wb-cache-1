25|$|This disarray <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{meant that}} the government's lawyers often failed to foster viable test cases and {{arguments}} for their defense, subsequently handicapping them before the courts. As Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes would later note, it was {{because much of the}} New Deal legislation was so poorly drafted and defended that the court did not uphold it.|$|E

As special prosecutor, Ruff also oversaw a three-month campaign-finance investigation of President Gerald R. Ford, who was cleared. During the Watergate years, he also taught at Georgetown University Law Center.|$|R
25|$|In 1924, when President Calvin Coolidge cleaned {{house at}} the Department of Justice {{in the wake of}} the late President Warren G. Harding's Teapot Dome scandal, he {{appointed}} Donovan's former professor Harlan Stone as Attorney General and named Donovan as Stone's assistant, in charge of the criminal division. Donovan and his wife split their time between Washington and Buffalo, where he continued to run his law firm. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> Donovan hired women and eschewed yes-men. He and his wife became a popular Washington couple, although Donovan's relationship with FBI Acting Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was briefly one of his underlings, was fraught with friction.|$|E
25|$|Garland {{insisted on}} {{being sent to}} Oklahoma City in the {{aftermath}} of that attack to examine the crime scene and oversee the investigation in preparation for the prosecution. He represented the government at the preliminary hearings of the two main defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Garland offered to lead the trial team, but could not because he was needed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> headquarters. Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols. Garland won praise for his work on the case from the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the scandals}} that have marred the {{reputation}} of Harding's administration did not emerge until after his death. The Veterans' Bureau scandal was known to Harding in January 1923 but, according to Trani and Wilson, [...] "the president's handling of it did him little credit". Harding allowed the corrupt director of the bureau, Charles R. Forbes, to flee to Europe, though he later returned and served prison time. Harding had learned that Daugherty's factotum <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> Jess Smith, was involved in corruption. The president ordered Daugherty to get Smith out of Washington and removed his name from the upcoming presidential trip to Alaska. Smith committed suicide on May 30, 1923. It is uncertain how much Harding knew about Smith's illicit activities. Murray noted that Harding {{was not involved in}} the corruption and did not condone it.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to this allegation, Riconosciuto also claimed— in a March 21, 1991 affidavit submitted to the court in the Inslaw case— that he had modified Inslaw's software <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department's</b> behest {{so that it could}} be sold to dozens of foreign governments with a secret [...] "back door," [...] which allowed outsiders to access computer systems using PROMIS. These modifications allegedly took place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cabazon Indian Reservation near Indio, California. Because the reservation was sovereign territory where enforcement of U.S. law was sometimes problematic, Riconosciuto further claimed that he had worked on weapons programs there for the Wackenhut Corporation, such as a powerful [...] "fuel air explosive". On March 29, 1991, eight days after submitting the affidavit, Riconosciuto was arrested for, and later convicted of, distributing methamphetamine and methadone, charges that he said were a set-up to keep him from telling his story.|$|R

2500|$|Washington, D.C. bureau {{reporter}} Christopher Newton, an AP reporter since 1994, {{was fired}} by AP in September 2002 after {{he was accused of}} fabricating sources since 2000, including at least 40 people and organizations.

During this period, Hiss was {{also a member of}} the liberal legal team headed by Jerome Frank that defended the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) against challenges to its legitimacy. Because of intense opposition from agribusiness in Arkansas, Frank and his left-wing assistants, who included future labor lawyer Lee Pressman, were fired in 1935 in what came to be known as [...] "the purge of liberals." [...] Hiss was not fired, but allegations that during this period he was connected with radicals on the Agriculture Department's legal team were to be the source of future controversy.|$|E

2500|$|On October 4, 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that, {{shortly after}} Alberto Gonzales became Attorney General in February 2005, the Justice Department issued a secret opinion {{which for the}} first time provided CIA explicit authorization to barrage terror suspects with a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics, including head-slapping, simulated drowning and frigid temperatures. This was in direct opposition to a public legal opinion issued in December 2004 that declared torture [...] "abhorrent". Gonzales reportedly approved the legal memorandum on [...] "combined effects" [...] over the objections of James B. Comey, the outgoing deputy attorney general, who told colleagues <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> that they would all be [...] "ashamed" [...] when the world eventually learned of it.

2500|$|According to a New York Times report, {{shortly after}} Gonzales became Attorney General in February 2005 the Justice Department issued a {{classified}} opinion {{which for the}} first time provided Central Intelligence Agency explicit authorization to apply to terror suspects a variety of painful physical and psychological interrogation methods, either alone or in combination. The approved techniques included striking a prisoner, exposure to extreme temperatures, stress positions, walling, sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours, and the simulated drowning procedure known as [...] "waterboarding". This secret memo superseded a previous, unclassified legal opinion that declared torture [...] "abhorrent." [...] Nevertheless, the classified opinion claimed that its reasoning and conclusions were based upon and fully consistent with the previous legal opinion. Gonzales reportedly approved the May 10, 2005 classified legal memorandum over the policy objections of James B. Comey, the outgoing deputy attorney general, who told colleagues <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> that they would all be [...] "ashamed" [...] when the world eventually learned of it.

In response to Thomas' favorable ruling, and in alarm at Malcolm X's visit, Andrew Young, who was not in charge of the Selma movement, said he would suspend demonstrations. James Bevel, however, continued to ask people to line up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> voter's registration office as they had been doing, and Dr. King called Young from jail, telling him the demonstrations would continue. They did so the next day, and more than 500 protesters were arrested. On February 5, King bailed himself and Abernathy out of jail.

5000|$|In {{a meeting}} of senior judges after the crisis, {{he and his colleagues}} were left unimpressed with the mental state of the {{returning}} Chief Judge McGruder and he gently mocked her in front of everyone. He went on to advocate a tightening of judicial control in the face of public outrage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department's</b> failures during Necropolis. However, Judge Dredd persuaded McGruder to permit the citizens to vote (in 2113) in a referendum about whether the Judges should continue to rule the city, or whether democratic government should be restored. Grice was left outraged and argued against it: when he pointed out Dredd was [...] "outvoted", Dredd snapped back [...] "you don't believe in voting, Grice" [...] and forced his view {{on the rest of the}} judges. This controversial scheme was unpopular with many judges, and Grice assumed that the result was a foregone conclusion: that the people would vote to remove the Judges from power. Firmly believing that this would result in total chaos, Grice formed a conspiracy with half a dozen other judges to prevent the referendum from happening. They planned to assassinate Dredd, reasoning that since Dredd was almost the only judge who believed that the Judges could win the vote, then without him all support for the referendum would disappear and McGruder would cancel the project.|$|R
