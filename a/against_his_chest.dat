5|$|The next {{match of}} the evening was the fourth-annual Money in the Bank ladder match, in which there were no {{disqualifications}} or countouts, {{and the only way}} to win the match was to climb a ladder in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (M.V.P.) from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a ladder <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the ladder. Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder in the ring, sending him crashing through another ladder set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy (returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury), entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the ladder, and delivered a Twist of Fate to MVP off that ladder. As soon as Morrison started to climb a ladder, see-sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a ladder. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match.|$|E
25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures {{of one sort or}} another, the Menasco engines being the primary source of those problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "mise au tombeau" [...] scene {{there are}} eight people around the body of Jesus. St John holds the Virgin Mary's arm as he turns towards her. The female saint (thought to be Mary Salome) next to Joseph of Arimathea looks towards him as he holds the crown of thorns. Gamaliel has his arms crossed <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and next to him another holds a pot of {{embalming}} oil. Joseph of Arimathea, {{the largest of the}} figures portrayed, stands in silhouette and prepares to cover the body with the shroud he is holding.|$|E
60|$|De Beauvais at {{once took}} up his position, and, without the parade of {{courtesy}} that usually preceded an encounter, fell furiously upon Hector. The latter did not give way a step. With a wrist of iron he put aside half a dozen thrusts, and then lunging, ran de Beauvais through the body, his sword hilt striking <b>against</b> <b>his</b> adversary's <b>chest.</b>|$|R
60|$|The tender {{sweetness}} of Mackenzie told greatly {{in dealing with}} these poor creatures. He {{did not think it}} waste of time to spend an hour a day trying to teach the little ones their letters; and Mr. Rowley draws a beautiful picture of him feeding, with a bottle, a black babe, whose mother had not nutriment enough to sustain it,--the little naked thing nestling up to his big beard, and going to sleep <b>against</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>chest.</b>|$|R
60|$|Through the {{darkness}} her light garment swished against the long grass. He sprang up. Then {{he was holding}} her, bending her head back. He exulted to find that his gripping hand was barred from the smoothness of her side only by thin silk that glided and warmed under his fingers. She sat {{on his knees and}} snuggled her loosened hair tinglingly <b>against</b> <b>his</b> bare <b>chest.</b> He felt that she was waiting for him to go on.|$|R
60|$|I shoved my head closer <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> There {{was another}} {{silence for a}} long time.|$|E
60|$|He tucked {{his head}} on the biceps of his right arm, with the hollow of the left snuggling Jerry in <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and dozed off to sleep.|$|E
60|$|There was no comment. On they went, {{the two of}} them, Hendricks {{walking a}} little ahead, David {{trailing}} behind him, hugging his dirty teddy bear <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As the {{conductor}} went on his affable way, huge watch-chain jingling <b>against</b> <b>his</b> blue <b>chest,</b> Babbitt and Ted gravely considered colleges. They arrived at Chicago late at night; they lay abed in the morning, rejoicing, [...] "Pretty nice {{not to have}} to get up and get down to breakfast, heh?" [...] They were staying at the modest Eden Hotel, because Zenith business men always stayed at the Eden, but they had dinner in the brocade and crystal Versailles Room of the Regency Hotel. Babbitt ordered Blue Point oysters with cocktail sauce, a tremendous steak with a tremendous platter of French fried potatoes, two pots of coffee, apple pie with ice cream for both of them and, for Ted, an extra piece of mince pie.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{report a}} case of a 45 -year-old man, {{complaining}} of swelling and pain in his epigastric region for the last 3  years. According to his medical history, he had undergone various investigations and treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux, without relief. He had had a history of chronic repeated microtraumas to his sternum during 9  years of working as a carpenter, as a result of placing wood <b>against</b> <b>his</b> anterior <b>chest</b> wall and pushing the former into a plank cutting machine. On examina-tion, a tender swelling was palpable as an immobile, hard mass showing minimal protrusion under the skin on the xiphoid process. He was diagnosed as having xiphoid syndrome. We prescribed anti-inflammatory medication and advised him to avoid pressure on <b>his</b> anterior <b>chest</b> wall, especially on the sternum, while cutting wood. At follow-up, the symptoms were relieved. Xiphoid syndrome may be seen in people performing hard physical work who incur sustained pressure or friction on their anterior chest wall. The case emphasizes the importance of the occupational history as well as clini-cal and radiological investigation of unusual conditions as mentioned above. Key words Chest pain; xiphodynia; xiphoid syndrome...|$|R

6000|$|In Newgate Street, Johnny {{paused and}} pressed his hands <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> [...] "Funny sort of pain I've got," [...] thought Johnny. [...] "Wonder if I should shock them if I went in somewhere for a drop of brandy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ALBERTO. In a minute, my darling. There, there, poor Lucrezia. (He puts an arm round her, {{kisses her}} hair and neck. LUCREZIA leans her bowed head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> The sound of {{footsteps}} is heard. They both look up with scared, wide-open eyes.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ward nodded. [...] "I {{happened}} to pass his door this morning," [...] she said, {{in a low}} voice. [...] "It was open a little way, and he was standing up and measuring one of mother’s nightgowns <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> I couldn’t think {{what he was doing}} it for at first." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes called [...] "tube", [...] "pocket" [...] or [...] "ringless" [...] slings, {{these are}} {{generally}} formed {{by a wide}} piece of fabric sewn into a tubular shape. Simple, or fitted pouches do not have rings or other hardware. Adjustable pouches may adjust with zippers, snaps, buckles, clips, rings, drawstrings, velcro, and other methods. Most pouches have a curve sewn in to shape the cloth to the parent's body and hold the baby more securely than a simple straight tube. The wearer slips the pouch over the head and one shoulder, sash-style, creating a pocket or seat to hold the baby in. Many pediatricians and baby-wearing experts do not recommend pouch slings because babies can suffocate when held incorrectly. Suffocation risk is greatest in newborns and infants under six months, and usually occurs because the baby's chin is collapsed <b>against</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>chest,</b> constricting the airway. Pouch slings also often restrict the parent's view of their child, making suffocation more likely. When using a pouch sling, wearers should {{be sure to keep}} the baby's face elevated and clearly visible.|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{came early}} in February, one wintry day, through a biting wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down, walking from Bramblehurst railway station, {{and carrying a}} little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to foot, and {{the brim of his}} soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulders and <b>chest,</b> and added a white crest to the burden he carried. He staggered into the [...] "Coach and Horses" [...] more dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down. [...] "A fire," [...] he cried, [...] "in the name of human charity! A room and a fire!" [...] He stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn.|$|R
60|$|There {{were the}} two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff as a handspike, with his arms {{stretched}} out {{like those of a}} crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped <b>against</b> the bulwarks, <b>his</b> chin on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>his</b> hands lying open before him on the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they read}} the letter through once more, sitting close together, he with one arm round her shoulder, she {{nestling}} <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> her hair brushing against his lips and with the letter in her hands which she could scarcely read for the tears of joy which filled her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood before}} Amyntas, letting him gaze; then {{suddenly}} {{she lifted her}} eyes to his. Amyntas's heart gave a mighty beat <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Her eyes, her eyes were the very lights of love, carrying passionate kisses on their beams. A sob of ecstasy choked the youth, and {{he felt that he}} could kneel down and worship before them.|$|E
60|$|Craig {{did as he}} was told. Then {{he turned}} and held the loose ends up. Quest lowered his {{revolver}} for a moment as he pushed Feerda toward it. Craig, with a wonderful spring, reached his side and kicked the revolver away. Before Quest could even stoop to recover it, he saw the glitter of the other's knife pressed <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God, he {{has gone}} off!" [...] he said. [...] "Now for the tourniquet. That is right; twist {{gradually}} now, Godfrey, and place the stone on the main artery. Now," [...] {{he said to the}} Buriat, [...] "hold this stick firm with one hand and place the other on <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> to prevent <b>his</b> moving. Do you lay your arm across him," [...] this to the mother; [...] "that is right. Kneel with your face <b>against</b> <b>his.</b> Now, Godfrey, grasp the leg just below the knee and hold it firmly." ...|$|R

60|$|The soldier had a sweetheart, a {{girl from}} the mountains, {{independent}} and primitive. The two walked together, rather silently. He went with her, not to talk, but to have his arm round her, and for the physical contact. This eased him, {{made it easier for}} him to ignore the Captain; for he could rest with her held fast <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> And she, in some unspoken fashion, was there for him. They loved each other.|$|E
60|$|He {{touched the}} smooth white {{slope of the}} stone gently with {{discovering}} fingers, {{in the same way}} as he touched the cheek of Helena, or of his own babies. He found great pleasure in this feeling of intimacy with things. A very soft wind, shy as a girl, put his arms round him, and seemed to lay its cheek <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> He placed his hands beneath his arms, where the wind was caressing him, and his eyes opened with wondering pleasure.|$|E
60|$|One of {{them had}} the rigid {{precision}} of bearing which denotes military training: {{he was young and}} slight of build, with unruly dark hair fluttering round the temples from beneath his white sugar-loaf hat, and escaping the trammels of the neatly-tied black silk bow at the nape of the neck; he held himself very erect and rode his horse on the curb, the reins gathered tightly in one gloved hand, and that hand held closely and almost immovably <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E

50|$|Scrape {{the hair}} off <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> with a {{hoop-iron}} razor.|$|R
60|$|He sat up {{and turned}} his {{attention}} to immediate affairs. He had worn through the blanket-wrappings, and his feet were shapeless lumps of raw meat. His last blanket was gone. Rifle and knife were both missing. He had lost his hat somewhere, with the bunch of matches in the band, but the matches <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> were safe and dry inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper. He looked at his watch. It marked eleven o'clock and was still running. Evidently he had kept it wound.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{it touched}} {{up a bit}} by the Munchkin farmer who first made me," [...] {{answered}} the Scarecrow, pleasantly. [...] "My complexion had become a bit grey and faded, you know, and the paint had peeled off one end of my mouth, so I couldn't talk quite straight. Now I feel like myself again, and I may say without immodesty that my body is stuffed with the loveliest oat-straw in all Oz." [...] He pushed <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> [...] "Hear me crunkle?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|First, the {{scientific}} manager was gripped round {{the body and}} swung towards the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonist's head down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his waist and swung round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him again, putting a curly head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and they swayed and panted as it seemed for an age or so. Then {{the scientific}} manager was impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The black yelled hideously.|$|E

50|$|Hulse’s {{promising}} playing {{career was}} ended on September 7, 1996, {{while he was}} a member of the Milwaukee Brewers, in a game <b>against</b> <b>his</b> former team, the Texas Rangers. Hulse was on third base and attempted to score on a ground ball toward first base. When the throw came home, Hulse tried to slide around catcher Dave Valle and touch the outside of the plate. Valle, however, was firmly planted at the plate, and the two collided. In the collision, Hulse’s humerus was forced into <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> causing significant damage and severely limiting his arm movement. He attempted a long rehab, but no teams were interested in signing him.|$|R
50|$|Hodge Podge (Jim Krenn): The Action League's former accountant, Hodge Podge was accidentally {{thrown into}} and chopped up in a blender, then horribly rebuilt by Bill the Lab Guy <b>against</b> <b>his</b> will, {{making him a}} freak with parts of random toys and {{household}} objects (such as a claw for a hand, taken from a crab toy, and the top portion of a fork attached to <b>his</b> <b>chest).</b> Hodge Podge {{appears to be more}} hands-on and successful than the Mayor with his initial tactics, even though neither of them ever get their way. He specifically works with mechanics to get his way (brainwashing radio station, custom-built remote control, modified voicebox, etc.).|$|R
