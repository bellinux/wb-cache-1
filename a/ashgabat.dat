According to the official version of his biography, his father died in World War II fighting against Nazi Germany, while other sources contend that he dodged fighting and was therefore sentenced by a military court. The other members of his family were killed in the 1948 <b>Ashgabat</b> earthquake that caused extreme damage and a high number of casualties in the city. His mother Gurbansoltan Eje was part of the Cult of personality later. He grew up in a Soviet orphanage before the state put him in the custody of a distant relative.|$|E

That same day, Teague-Jones attended the Committee's meeting in <b>Ashgabat,</b> which had the task of deciding the fate of the Commissars. For some reason Teague-Jones did not communicate Malleson's request to the Committee, and later claimed he left before a decision was made and did not discover until the following day that the committee had eventually decided to issue orders that the commissars should be executed. On the night of 20 September, Shahumyan and the others were executed by a firing squad in a remote location between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma on the Trans-Caspian railway.|$|E

25|$|During that narrow {{period of}} time between 1887 and 1894, a court case was held {{following}} the assassination of a Bahá'í that for a time would vindicate the Bahá'ís. The Bahá'ís were represented by Mirza Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani along with Shaykh Muhammad-'Alí, each an Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, individuals who played {{a vital role in}} the development {{in the early stages of}} the religion comparable to the apostles of Jesus. Gulpaygani lived in <b>Ashgabat</b> off and on from 1889 to 1894. A short time after moving there, the assassination of one of the Bahá'ís there, Haji Muhammad Rida Isfahani occurred and Gulpaygani helped the Bahá'í community to respond to this event and later he was the spokesman for the Bahá'ís at the trial of the assassins was initiated by Czar Alexander III through a military commission from St. Petersburg. This event established the independence of the Bahá'í Faith from Islam both for the Russian government and for the people of <b>Ashgabat.</b> Under the protection and freedom given by the Russian authorities, the number of Bahá'ís in the community rose to 4,000 (1,000 children) by 1918 and for the first time anywhere in the world a true Bahá'í community was established, with its own hospitals, schools, workshops, newspapers, and a cemetery. This first Bahá'í House of Worship was constructed inside the city of <b>Ashgabat.</b> The design of the building was started in 1902, and the construction was completed in 1908 and was supervised by Vakílu'd-Dawlih, The city's general population was between 44 and 50 thousand at this time.|$|E
25|$|Niyazov {{was buried}} in his ready {{prepared}} tomb in Kipchak Mosque on December 24 at his home village of Gypjak, approximately 7 kilometres west of <b>Ashgabat.</b> Prior to being moved to the village, Niyazov's body lay in state in an open coffin in the presidential palace from 9:00 am to 12:00 am.

25|$|By 1946 in all Turkestan only <b>Ashgabat,</b> Samarkand and Tashkand {{communities}} continued. Bahá'ís {{had managed}} to re-enter various countries of the Eastern Bloc through the 1950s, following a plan {{of the head of}} the religion at the time, Shoghi Effendi. But by 1956 there is a vague mention of an operating community of Bahá'ís in Uzbekistan. In 1955 a delegation of Russian journalists to America were forbidden to visit the North American Bahá'í House of Worship. The 1957 letter of the head of the religion challenged Bahá'ís {{to find a way to}} have one Bahá'í in each Soviet Republic on the European continent: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, White Russia, Moldavia and Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} project {{started on}} 15 March 1995 when an inaugural {{memorandum of understanding}} between the governments of Turkmenistan and Pakistan for a pipeline project was signed. This project was promoted by Argentinian company Bridas Corporation. The U.S. company Unocal, {{in conjunction with the}} Saudi oil company Delta, promoted an alternative project without Bridas' involvement. On 21 October 1995, these two companies signed a separate agreement with Turkmenistan's president Saparmurat Niyazov. In August 1996, the Central Asia Gas Pipeline, Ltd. (CentGas) consortium for construction of a pipeline, led by Unocal, was formed. On 27 October 1997, CentGas was incorporated in formal signing ceremonies in <b>Ashgabat,</b> Turkmenistan, by several international oil companies along with the Government of Turkmenistan.|$|E
25|$|His brother Muhammad-Hasan, survived {{until the}} end of the battle of Tabarsi, and was {{executed}} along with Quddús by the Shah's army. His nephew Muhammad-Baqir survived {{until the end}} of the battle, although his fate after that point is unclear. Mullá Husayn's mother and sister had converted to Bábism at some point after the Báb's declaration—becoming close companions of Táhirih—and learned of his death at Tabarsi. They returned to their home town of Boshruyeh where they cared for the wives and children of men who had died at Tabarsi. After his mother's death, his family home was destroyed by a mob, and his sister was forced to move to <b>Ashgabat.</b> She became a Bahá’í and was given the title Leaf of Paradise (Varaqatu'l-Firdaws) by Bahá’u’lláh.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 2008, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan {{signed a}} {{framework}} agreement to buy natural gas from Turkmenistan. The intergovernmental {{agreement on the}} pipeline was signed on 11 December 2010 in <b>Ashgabat.</b> However, in April 2012, India and Afghanistan have failed to agree on transit fee for gas passing through Afghan territory. Consequently, Islamabad and New Delhi too could not agree on the transit fee for the segment of the pipeline passing through Pakistan, which has linked its fee structure to any India-Afghanistan agreement. On 16 May 2012, the Afghan Parliament, approved the agreement on a gas pipeline and the day after, the Indian Cabinet allowed state-run gas-firm GAIL to sign the Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) with Türkmengaz, Turkmenistan's national oil company.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Bahá'í Faith (Вера Бахаи) in Russia began soon after the {{founding}} in 1844 of the Bábí religion, viewed by Bahá'ís as the direct predecessor of the Bahá'í Faith, with Russian diplomats to Qajar Persia observing, reacting to, and sending updates about the Bábís. The woman later known as Táhirih, who {{played a central role}} in the religion of the Báb, was from an influential clerical family from Azerbaijan, which was then ruled by Russia. Russian diplomats later protected Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, before and after his exile from Persia. Around 1884, the religion began to spread into the Russian Empire, where the Bahá'í community in <b>Ashgabat</b> built the first Bahá'í House of Worship, elected one of the first Bahá'í local administrative institutions and became a center of scholarship. The Bahá'í Faith also attracted the attention of several Russian scholars and artists. During the Soviet period, Russia adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, leading the Russian Bahá'í community to abandon its administration and properties in accordance with its principle of obedience to legal government, though Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were nevertheless sent to prisons and camps or abroad. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union Bahá'ís in several cities were able to gather and organize as Perestroyka spread from Moscow through many Soviet republics. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the Russian Federations was ultimately formed in 1995. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated the number of Bahá'ís in Russia at about 18,990 in 2005.|$|E

He attended secondary school in <b>Ashgabat</b> and later graduated from Moscow University with a degree in psychology and child education. In 1930 he was expelled from the Soviet Union during the Stalinist persecution of religion, and, from that time on, played an ever more significant role in the work and administration of the Iranian Bahá'í community. Other tales of arrests and forced deportations are noted as early as March. Nevertheless, the head of the religion personally covered the costs of translating the Hidden Words into Russian in 1933.|$|E
