The MASCO project is a balloon-borne gamma ray telescope in final phase of development at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE - Brazil). This experiment is a low energy gamma ray telescope that employs a Modified Uniformly Redundant Array (MURA) coded mask in an one-piece mask-antimask configuration. This is the first experiment to use such a mask pattern (MURA) and configuration for astrophysical purposes. The angular resolution is approximately 14 ' over 13 deg. field of view, which requires that the expected pointing accuracy of the attitude control system should be better than {{that in order to}} allow the accomplishment of the scientific goals.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effects of {{manipulating}} the size and contour of the visual field on the accuracy of an aiming task. Subjects were required to perform pointing movements without seeing their moving hand. The target was displayed in either a wide structured visual field (control condition), a narrow visual field with orthogonal frame, or a narrow visual field with circular frame. The visual information surrounding the target was always provided prior to movement onset, but during the execution of the movement on only half of the trials. Overall, the results showed that undershooting was a common performance characteristic in all of the conditions. In comparison to the control performance, an increase of the degree of undershoot was found when the target was displayed inside a narrower visual field. An additional radial error was found when the contour of the visual scene was circular, but only when the visual context was available during the movement. The same pattern of results was observed for variable error. However, angular errors were not found to vary over the different conditions. Overall, the findings suggested that the visual context contributed to the assessment of the target locations, and the subsequent motor programming. Furthermore, visual information aided the on-line control of the unseen hand, but the extent of this was dependent on the size and shape of the frame denoting the visual scene. Finally, in the absence of any unexpected perturbation, the en-route amendment of the arm trajectory, based on visual information processing, seemed to be more related to distance than <b>azimuth</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{control system}} has been {{designed}} to keep a balloon-borne scientific instrument pointed toward a celestial object within an angular error of the order of an arc second. The design is intended to be adaptable to a large range of instrument payloads. The initial payload to which the design nominally applies {{is considered to be a}} telescope, modeled as a simple thin-walled cylinder 24 ft (approx. = 7. 3 m) long, 3 ft (approx. = 0. 91 m) in diameter, weighing 1, 500 lb (having a mass of. 680 kg). The instrument would be mounted on a set of motor-driven gimbals in pitch-yaw configuration. The motors on the gimbals would apply the control torques needed for fine adjustments of the instrument in pitch and yaw. The pitch-yaw mount would, in turn, be suspended from a motor mount at the lower end of a pair of cables hanging down from the balloon (see figure). The motor in this mount would be used to effect coarse <b>azimuth</b> <b>control</b> of the pitch-yaw mount. A notable innovation incorporated in the design is a provision for keeping the gimbal bearings in constant motion. This innovation would eliminate the deleterious effects of static friction. something that must be done in order to achieve the desired arc-second precision. Another notable innovation is the use of linear accelerometers to provide feedback that would facilitate the early detection and counteraction of disturbance torques before they could integrate into significant angular-velocity and angular-position errors. The control software processing the sensor data would be capable of distinguishing between translational and rotational accelerations. The output of the accelerometers is combined with that of angular position and angular-velocity sensors into a proportional + integral + derivative + acceleration control law for the pitch and yaw torque motors.
