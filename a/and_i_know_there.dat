6000|$|Mindful, then, {{of what we}} {{had read}} together, I thought {{of the two men}} who went up into the Temple to pray, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> were no better words that I could say beside his bed, than [...] "O Lord, be merciful to him a sinner!" ...|$|R

60|$|But he only {{shook his}} head--a bit sheepishly, I thought--and talked {{of all things}} except the one that he was {{thinking}} about; and presently he vanished down the old road.

60|$|During this mental tangle I {{confided in}} no one.

"'Squire Owl and Professor Hawk {{had gone}} away, telling Mr. Porcupine {{they were off}} for a picnic; but that didn't seem {{reasonable}} to me, for the pair were not such very warm friends as all that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was trouble in store for Cheeko if he didn't watch out a good deal sharper than <b>I</b> ever <b>knew</b> of his doing.|$|R

"Why, Emmeline made me," [...] said Prissy, as {{if there}} couldn't be any appeal from that; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> couldn't--for Prissy. <b>I</b> also <b>knew</b> that if Stephen wanted to see Prissy again Emmeline must know nothing of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told him so when he came down the next evening--to borrow a hoe, he said.

"As {{the north}} shore lies only some five or six leagues from us, brother, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> is a large bay in that quarter, might it not be well to consult some of the crew {{concerning}} our position, if, indeed, we do not call up Jasper Eau-douce, {{and tell him to}} carry us back to Oswego?

5000|$|The Temple event became {{particularly}} controversial, {{because it}} was attended by the Vice President Gore. In an interview on the January 24, 1997, edition of the Today show, Gore said: <b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> {{that it was a}} fund-raiser.

They have eyes for our women, and take them one by one. As Mesahchie has gone, {{cheating}} Neegah of her price, so will Likeeta go, so will they all go, and we be cheated.

5000|$|In 1996, Gore {{was criticized}} for {{attending}} an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California.

And with his arm on my shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> was more than mere kindness in it, he told me we had barely reached the River Plate when he discovered me. With laughter, and {{with more than one}} slap of {{his hand on my shoulder}} that was more caress than jollity, he pointed out the discrepancies in my tale (which I have since amended, steward, thanks to him, and amended well), and told me that the voyage had been a grand success, making him eternally my debtor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I would stake all I hold dear,' {{said the}} Captain, with great animation, 'that Cadurcis turns out well. He {{has such a}} good heart. Ah! Lady Annabel, if he be {{now and then a}} little irregular, only think of the temptations that assail him. Only one-and-twenty, his own master, and all London at his feet. It is too much for any one's head. But say or think what the world may, I know him better than they do; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> is not a finer {{creature}} in existence. I hope his old friends will not desert him,' added Captain Cadurcis, with a smile which, seemed to deprecate the severity of Lady Annabel; 'for in spite of all his fame and prosperity, perhaps, after all, this is the time when he most needs them.' ...|$|E

In a word, to speak frankly to you, the real secret reason why the King will not consent to this Marriage is, That he wishes to keep me on a low footing constantly, {{and to have the}} power of driving me mad, whenever the whim takes him, throughout his life; thus he never will give his consent. If it were possible that you on your side could consent that your Princess too should be exposed to such treatment, you may well comprehend that I should be very sad to bring misery on a Person whom I esteem, and to remain always in the same state as now.|$|E

5000|$|The vocal melody {{of track}} one, [...] "Fight Test", echoes Cat Stevens's [...] "Father and Son". Stevens, now Yusuf Islam, is {{receiving}} royalties following a relatively uncontentious settlement. The band's frontman, Wayne Coyne, {{claims that he}} was unaware of the songs' similarities until producer Dave Fridmann pointed them out. This claim however is contradicted by his statement to Rolling Stone magazine: 'I know [...] "Father and Son" [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> would {{be a little bit of}} comparison. [...] "Fight Test" [...] is not a reference necessarily to the ideas of [...] "Father and Son", but definitely a reference to the cadence, the melody, <b>and</b> chord progression. <b>I</b> think it's such a great arrangement of chords and melody'.|$|R
