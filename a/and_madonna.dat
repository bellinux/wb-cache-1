Although the areas are {{separated}} by a wall, Spears <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> sense their presences through extrasensory perception and dance in synchronicity. Julie Andsager in Sex in consumer culture (2006) noted that the video hints at a same-sex relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|Mike was in {{character}} the entire time. He <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> {{really had a}} great chemistry together. This video shows her absolutely hysterical sense of humour, and it's great {{for everyone to see}} that side of her. This was by far the most fun I've ever had making a video.|$|E

5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape and walking on a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded {{the simplicity of the}} video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson <b>and</b> <b>Madonna.</b> Gaga has performed the song in award shows, music festivals and her concert tours.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} show of the tour at The Forum in Inglewood, California, Madonna attends a party with her dancers celebrating {{the success of the}} opening night. The tour moves to New York City with more {{rehearsal}} footage <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> asking her dancers to register for voting in the upcoming elections. Guy Ritchie jokes around with Madonna as she gets ready for the performance at Madison Square Garden, while Michael Moore appears in an interview segment, recalling how Madonna thanked him during the concert for his documentary.|$|E
5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song {{gave the impression of}} Madonna as a black artist. That impression did not last long as Madonna would later convince Sire executives to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing to the song. The video helped to further promote the song <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> as an artist.|$|E
5000|$|... "Love Profusion" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer <b>and</b> {{songwriter}} <b>Madonna</b> for her ninth studio album American Life (2003). Written <b>and</b> {{produced by}} <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Mirwais Ahmadzaï, it was released as the fourth and final single from the album on December 8, 2003, by Maverick Records. [...] "Love Profusion" [...] was first premiered during {{the release of the}} album on AOL. It later received a number of remixes, which were also released alongside the single. The song contains rhythm from a four piece bass drum, with guitar riffs of the acoustic guitar <b>and</b> <b>Madonna's</b> voice backed by a male vocal during the chorus. Ahmadzaï used the stutter edit to create a new groove. Dedicated to director, <b>and</b> <b>Madonna's</b> then-husband, Guy Ritchie, the song's lyrics deal with Madonna's confusion regarding American culture.|$|R

5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} {{rhythm and blues}} had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music were used to {{describe}} popular music by black artists. In the 1980s, however, rhythm and blues came back into use, most often {{in the form of}} R, a usage that has continued to the present. Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson <b>and</b> <b>Madonna.</b>|$|E
5|$|Designed {{to sound}} like a 1980s record, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was {{influenced}} by artists such as the Cure, Depeche Mode, Cyndi Lauper <b>and</b> <b>Madonna.</b> The album incorporates a diverse range of genres, including electropop, dance-rock, new wave, R, hip hop, soul, and disco, while lyrically, most of its songs are about fashion and wealth. Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers concert tour. While promoting, Stefani was often accompanied by back-up dancers called the Harajuku Girls.|$|E
5|$|Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry {{were among}} the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival {{to become one of}} America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the {{development}} of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> have become global celebrities, as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.|$|E

5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, being compared to Cyndi Lauper <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> {{songs from the}} 1980s. The media have drawn parallels between the song's lyrical content and the romantic relationship that Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow group member of No Doubt. The song was moderately successful on the charts, reaching the top 10 in Australia, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, {{as well as the}} top 20 in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a focus light on Madonna's hand which {{gradually}} reveals a circular red stage surrounded by red curtains. Madonna, wearing the red velvet jacket moves around the stage throwing off a cape and does choreographed dance moves. Interspersed are visuals of a male dancer as a Minotaur wearing the horned mask, dancing on the ground <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> in the matador dress. She entices the male dancer with the cape as the chorus ends. A flock of male dancers wearing similar horned mask appear and surround Madonna around the stage.|$|E
5|$|As {{they move}} around {{the city in the}} van, they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E

5|$|By 2003, Madonna {{suggested}} {{that she was in}} a revolutionary mood, which led to journalistic discussions that another image makeover would take place for her. Still recovering from the commercial disappointment of Swept Away, Madonna changed her image completely to resemble that of a fighter, with inspirations from pictures of Argentinian guerrilla leader Che Guevara. French design team M/M Paris (Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak) were responsible for the artwork of American Life. The duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> hired the duo after discussing the concept for just six minutes. The photo shoot for the album was done by photographer Craig McDean in January 2003 at Los Angeles, and cost a reported $415,000. McDean had already worked with Madonna for the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in October 2002; this shoot had a military theme, with Madonna posing in dark green and black clothes, combat boots, and guns.|$|E
5|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is a 2005 American {{documentary}} film that follows singer-songwriter Madonna on her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. Directed by Jonas Åkerlund, the film premiered on MTV on October 21, 2005, {{and was released}} on DVD on June 20, 2006, by Warner Bros. Records. The documentary was originally called The Re-Invented Process, referencing the tour and the Steven Klein exhibition titled X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It starts with imagery from the exhibition <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> auditioning dancers for the tour, continues with her entourage travelling through different cities and performing, the singer's introspection on her life, her marriage, her religion, and her children, and ends with Madonna's visit to Israel {{in the midst of}} protests.|$|E
