5|$|While {{announcing the}} Cocked, Locked, and Ready to Rock Tour in 2009, Tyler and Perry {{said that the}} next item on the <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> a new Aerosmith album, the group's first since 2004's Honkin' on Bobo. The group did some {{recording}} with producer Brendan O'Brien in 2008 but halted because of Tyler's health problems. Aerosmith bassist Tom Hamilton told the Boston Herald in September 2010 that Tyler believes he has the {{time and energy to}} continue fronting the band while also being a judge on American Idol.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One of the items on the <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY270 was {{cut back to}} its {{junction}} with Upper Mountain Road. On November1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure that, if passed, would allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY93 designation from Upper Mountain Road, a county-maintained highway, and reassign it to Junction Road (NY270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper Mountain Road while providing additional capacity to NY93. This part of the <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY93 as proposed and truncating NY270 southward to NY31.|$|E
5|$|Madison, {{a member}} of the Democratic-Republican Party, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Saraiva, Ouro Preto was {{a staunch}} monarchist who was {{determined}} to save the regime at any cost. His program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering issues about which politicians had long been complaining. An item notably missing from his <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> any move to address the military indiscipline and the urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over the corps. This {{would prove to be}} a fatal mistake. Among the reforms proposed were the expanding of voting rights by abolishing the income requisite, the end of lifelong senate tenures and, most important of all, increased decentralization which would turn the country into a full federation by allowing the election of town mayors and provincial presidents (governors).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study <b>was</b> to suggest <b>agenda</b> {{priorities}} for nursing service R&D (Research and Development) related policies development. Methods: Two steps in developing the <b>agendas</b> and priorities <b>were</b> per-formed in this descriptive study. First, nursing service R&D <b>agendas</b> <b>were</b> extracted through needs assessment of nursing researchers and practitioners. Then, the priority of <b>agendas</b> <b>was</b> set by Analytic Hierarchy Process by ten experts who were representatives of nursing and other healthcare professionals. Results: Six core areas and forty-six nursing service R&D <b>agendas</b> <b>were</b> developed. The priority of <b>agendas</b> <b>was</b> different according to the evaluation criteria depending on weight value of nursing services. Conclusion: In order to select and promote nursing service R&D projects within national healthcare policy, nursing service R&D policy should be proposed with consideration to the importance of the criteria in reflecting characteristics of nursing care. By strengthening R&D capabilities for quality improvement and sensitive awareness of national directions for healthcare R&D policies, nursing service R&...|$|R

5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E
5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Cyprus by the Turks, the dictators finally abandoned Ioannides and his disastrous policies. On 23 July 1974, President Phaedon Gizikis called a meeting of old guard politicians, including Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Spiros Markezinis, Stephanos Stephanopoulos, Evangelos Averoff and others.

25|$|After the <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> decided, talks {{proceeded}} {{slowly with}} {{off and on}} again discussions. The longest gap between discussions started on August 23, 1951, during the morning before sunrise, when North Korea and its allies claimed the conference site in Kaesŏng had been bombed. North Korea requested the UNC conduct an immediate investigation, which concluded there was evidence a UNC aircraft had attacked the conference site. The evidence, however, appeared to be manufactured. The Communists subsequently refused to permit an investigation during daylight hours.|$|E
25|$|The party still {{failed to}} present a true {{challenge}} to the Liberal government, since its <b>agenda</b> <b>was</b> seen as too extreme for the liking {{of central and eastern}} Canada. A notable exception was rural central Ontario, an area that was almost as socially conservative as Reform's western heartland. However, due to massive vote splitting with the PCs, this support only translated into one seat in Ontario during its 1993 breakthrough--the only seat that the party ever won east of Manitoba. That seat was lost in 1997.|$|E

40|$|As {{the media}} plays {{a central role}} in the way modern democracies function, it is {{important}} to study whether the media engages in a top-down or a bottom-up mode of covering election news. The article studies whether the media <b>agenda</b> <b>is</b> congruent with the parties’ and the public’s agenda by analysing the three gendas in five national Danish election campaigns. Theoretically, increased professionalisation of politicians’ efforts to influence media coverage suggests convergence between the media and the party agendas, while increased commercialisation of the media suggests convergence between the media and the public agendas. However, since both the professionalisation of the parties and the commercialisation of the media are ongoing processes, convergence between all three <b>agendas</b> may <b>be</b> expected. Results show that the media <b>agenda</b> <b>is</b> slightly more similar to the agenda of the parties, but in general the media seems to be rather good at balancing their obligations to represent the issues of the elite on the one hand and to give voice to public concerns on the other. During the past two decades no convergence between the <b>agendas</b> <b>is</b> found, i. e. the interaction of the three different <b>agendas</b> <b>is</b> rather stable...|$|R
