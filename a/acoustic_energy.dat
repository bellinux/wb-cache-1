Methods: The researches were grounded on simulation of <b>acoustic</b> radiation <b>energy</b> at change of mechanically treated composite material properties dispersion for the mechanical model of its surface layer destruction. The data processing with definition of <b>acoustic</b> radiation statistical <b>energy</b> parameters was conducted. The analysis of <b>acoustic</b> emission <b>energy</b> parameters sensitivity to change of composite material properties dispersion, and as the analysis of influencing of composite material properties dispersion on AE amplitude and energy parameters was conducted. Results: Were obtained that at decreasing of composite material properties dispersion there is increasing an average level of <b>acoustic</b> radiation <b>energy</b> and value of its deviation. Is determined, that at decreasing of composite material properties dispersion the greatest increasing there is an <b>acoustic</b> emission <b>energy</b> average level dispersion. It is show that the increasing of <b>acoustic</b> radiation <b>energy</b> parameters advances increasing its amplitude parameters. Discussion: The simulation of <b>acoustic</b> radiation <b>energy</b> at composite material machining for the mechanical model surface layer destruction at decreasing of composite material properties dispersion (spread) is conducted. It is shown, that the decreasing of composite material properties dispersion does not influence on <b>acoustic</b> radiation <b>energy</b> nature change. At the same time, the ascending parameter, that describing of composite material properties dispersion decreasing, results in increase of <b>acoustic</b> radiation signal <b>energy</b> parameters.

This article explores that question by analyzing the <b>acoustic,</b> or sound, <b>energy</b> of vocalized names from the US Social Security Administrationâ€™s list of the thousand most popular given names for the period of 2000 - 2005.

40|$|Active {{structural}} acoustic control (ASAC) {{systems for}} flexible structures with enclosed cavities are normally designed {{with the goal}} of minimizing the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy</b> in the cavity. This goal is also taken into account during the search for an optimal actuator placement for the ASAC sys-tem. This paper is concerned with the change in the acoustic response of a structurally excited cavity when a psychoacoustic criterion is used for the placement of the actuators of the ASAC system instead. The placement of actuators on a flexible structure enclosed by a cavity is optimized using a genetic algorithm. Two optimization criteria are used: the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy</b> in the cavity and the psychoacoustic loudness in the cavity.

25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to <b>acoustic</b> <b>energy.</b> The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E

500|$|Ultrasonography {{is based}} on the {{principle}} that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by the tissue interfaces {{in the same way that}} light can reflect back on itself, from a mirror. Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance, known as acoustic impedance, to the path of the ultrasound beam. When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues, the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound. When the ultrasound beam meets air, or solid tissue such as bone, their [...] impedance difference is so great that most of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>energy</b> is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures. The examiner will see just a shadow, instead of the image expected. Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used. The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the probe, and the patient's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body. The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves. Liquids, including blood have a low impedance, which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible. One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen, in what is termed [...] "spontaneous contrast".|$|E

Fixes for the problem involved the addition of a [...] "jet wake fairing" [...] at the bottom rear of the fuselage between the engines, external ("ice tong") mass balances for the elevator, pending the design of internal mass balances, and the addition of exhaust deflectors to the fuselage to reduce the turbulence and the consequent flutter.|$|E
2500|$|As {{explained}} above, a set {{of three}} orthonormal polarizations (...) of the particle motion exist for a given propagation direction [...] in a solid. For measurement setups where the transducers can be fixated directly to the sample under investigation {{it is possible to}} create these three polarizations (one longitudinal, and two orthogonal transverse waves) by applying different types of transducers exciting the desired polarization (e.g. piezoelectric transducers with the needed oscillation mode). Thus it is possible to measure the sound velocity of waves with all three polarizations through either time dependent or frequency dependent measurement setups depending on the selection of transducer types. However, if the transducer can not be fixated to the test specimen a coupling medium is needed to transmit the <b>acoustic</b> <b>energy</b> from the transducer to the specimen. Water or gels are often used as this coupling medium. For measurement of the longitudinal sound velocity this is sufficient, however fluids do not carry shear waves, and thus to be able to generate and measure the velocity of shear waves in the test specimen the incident longitudinal wave must interact at an oblique angle at the fluid/solid surface to generate shear waves through mode conversion. Such shear waves are then converted back to longitudinal waves at the solid/fluid surface propagating back through the fluid to the recording transducer enabling the measurement of shear wave velocities as well through a coupling medium.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the structural-acoustic coupling effects on the dynamic behaviour of a vibro-acoustic system under passive/active control. The simplest model of a vibro-acoustic system one can consider is a one-dimensional acoustic cavity driven by a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structure. This simple model is used to demonstrate the physical characteristics of the coupling phenomenon. This simple analytical model can provide various degrees of structural-acoustic coupling, which are dependent upon (i) the structural-acoustic stiffness ratio, (ii) structural-acoustic natural frequency ratio, (iii) structural damping, and (iv) acoustic damping. In this case, although the geometric coupling factor is not included because the SDOF structure has a single mode, 80 percent {{of the factors that}} determine the degree of coupling can be accounted for by the simple analytical model. The coupling mechanism, in the simple vibro-acoustic system, is investigated using the mobility-impedance approach. In order to provide the threshold of the degree of coupling, a coupling factor is calculated in terms of non-dimensional structural-acoustic parameters. Vibro-acoustic responses are represented by the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy</b> in the cavity and the kinetic energy of the structure coupled to the acoustic cavity. The vibro-acoustic responses are investigated for various coupled cases. The principles are demonstrated by controlling the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy</b> in the one-dimensional finite acoustic tube driven by the SDOF structure. Three control strategies are applied; passive control, active feedforward control and decentralised velocity feedback control. Passive control is investigated to achieve physical insight into the relative benefits of passive control treatments. In the more strongly coupled case, acoustical modifications were preferable for the reduction of the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy.</b> On the other hand, in the more weakly coupled case, structural modifications were more effective. For harmonic disturbance, an active feedforward control strategy is considered for the control of the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy</b> in the cavity driven by the structure under external harmonic excitation. For the active feedforward control systems, this study uses the concept of optimal impedance, which is defined as the ratio of the control force to the velocity of a secondary source when the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy</b> is minimised. In the more strongly coupled case, all the acoustic modes were effectively suppressed at the resonance frequencies. On the other hand, in the more weakly coupled case, all the acoustic modes were controllable as in the more strongly coupled case. However, the structural mode was generally uncontrollable. For broadband disturbance, decentralised velocity feedback control is formulated to investigate the relative control effectiveness of structural and acoustic actuators for the control of the <b>acoustic</b> potential <b>energy.</b> In the more strongly coupled case, the control configuration of using the acoustic actuator was preferable. On the other hand, in the more weakly coupled case, the decentralised velocity feedback control strategy using both the actuators was desirable.
