5|$|In a 1959 essay, Boris Pasternak {{compared}} Shakespeare's Macbeth to Raskolnikov, {{the protagonist}} of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Pasternak explained that neither character begins as a murderer, but becomes one {{by a set of}} faulty rationalizations <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> that he is above the law.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, {{who opposed}} the war out of doctrinaire cynicism <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> that neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto. A small number of anarchists in Galicia and Asturias dissented and were heatedly denounced {{by the majority of}} Catalan anarcho-syndicalists (who prevailed in the anarchist union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo).|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Shero {{continued to}} coach {{and began a}} 13-year coaching career in the minor leagues. During {{his time in the}} minors, Shero proved to be a winning coach accumulating six first-place finishes, five second-place finishes and twice finishing third in various leagues. He also coached the St. Paul Saints to the IHL championship, The Turner Cup, in 1960 and 1961. In 1964, he coached the St. Paul Rangers to the CPHL championship finals. The following season Shero began his AHL coaching career with the Buffalo Bisons whom he led to a Calder Cup Championship in 1970, while winning the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award as AHL coach of the year. For the 1970–71 season Shero again changed teams this time coaching in the Central Hockey League with the Omaha Knights, winning the league Championship. Although in the Rangers farm system for several years and winning at various levels, Shero was never seriously considered to replace Emile Francis as head coach, due to Shero's perceived alcohol problem <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> that he was an ineffective communicator.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Margaret and {{her sister}} Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn, Berkshire. Although John {{provided}} them with a strongly Christian education <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> in the inferiority of women, both of which she would reject, he awakened Murray's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments. In 1873, the girls' mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to Bonn in Germany, where they both became fluent in German. In 1875 they returned to Calcutta, staying there till 1877. They then moved with their parents back to England, where they settled in Sydenham, South London. There, they spent much time visiting The Crystal Palace, while their father worked at his firm's London office. In 1880, they returned to Calcutta, where Margaret remained {{for the next seven}} years. She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was involved with the hospital's attempts to deal with a cholera outbreak. In 1887, she returned to England, moving to Rugby, Warwickshire, where her uncle John had moved, now widowed. Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people. When her father retired and moved to England, she moved into his house in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, living with him until his death in 1891. In 1893 she then travelled to Madras, Tamil Nadu, where her sister had moved to with her new husband.|$|E

25|$|In {{his annual}} address to Congress on December 2, 1845, Polk {{recommended}} giving the British the required one-year {{notice of the}} termination of the joint occupation agreement. Democratic expansionists in Congress from the Midwest, led by Senators Lewis Cass of Michigan, Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana, and William Allen of Ohio, called for war with the United Kingdom rather than accepting anything short of all of Oregon up to Parallel 54°40′ north. These pronouncements were fueled {{by a number of}} factors, including traditional distrust of the British <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> that the U.S. had the better claim and would make better use of the land.|$|E
25|$|In late 1972, Alvin Lee {{decided to}} {{undertake}} a solo project as {{a departure from the}} routine of touring and recording with his band Ten Years After. He later attributed his motivation to boredom with his role as a heavy rock guitar virtuoso <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> that financial rewards had become the only factor in the band's continued existence. Having met Mylon LeFevre, an American gospel rock singer, when LeFevre's band played as a support act to Ten Years After, Lee invited him to Jamaica for a holiday. The two musicians began writing songs there and recording rough demos with a local reggae group.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous Australians have {{a complex}} oral {{tradition}} and spiritual values based upon {{reverence for the}} land <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> in the Dreaming.

The Rainbow Serpent is a major dream spirit for Aboriginal people across Australia. The Yowie and Bunyip are other well known dream spirits.

25|$|Reincarnation is the {{philosophical}} or religious concept that {{an aspect of}} a living being starts {{a new life in}} a different physical body or form after each biological death. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and {{is a part of the}} Saṃsāra doctrine of cyclic existence. It is a central tenet of all major Indian religions, namely Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by Greek historic figures, such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as Spiritism, Theosophy, and Eckankar and is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Australia, East Asia, Siberia, and South America.|$|E
25|$|Reform Judaism (also {{known as}} Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) {{is a major}} Jewish {{denomination}} that emphasizes the evolving nature of the faith, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. A liberal strand of Judaism, it {{is characterized by a}} lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous, and openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates; since the 1970s, the movement adopted a policy of inclusiveness and acceptance, inviting as many as possible to partake in its communities, rather than strict theoretical clarity. Its greatest center today is in North America.|$|E

The crisis reshaped French strategy, forcing commanders to redraft plans to fit the dictates of fiscal shortfalls. In the background Louis XIV's agents were working hard diplomatically to unhinge the coalition but the Emperor, who had secured with the Allies his 'rights' to the Spanish succession should Charles II die during the conflict, did not desire a peace that would not prove personally advantageous. The Grand Alliance would not come apart as long as there was money available <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> that the growing strength of their armies would soon be much greater than those of France.|$|E
