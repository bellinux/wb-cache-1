Atlantic puffin, Arctic and common tern, bonxie and <b>Arctic</b> <b>skua,</b> northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{areas are}} often located 100km (60mi) or more, {{offshore}} from the nest sites, although when feeding their young, the birds venture out only half that distance. It {{has been found}} that adults bringing fish to their chicks tend to arrive in groups. This is thought to benefit the bird by reducing kleptoparasitism by the <b>Arctic</b> <b>skua</b> which harasses puffins until they drop their fish loads. Predation by the great skua (Catharacta skua) is also reduced by several birds arriving simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>skua</b> (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E
40|$|Arctic seabirds {{have often}} been used to assess metal levels in remote regions. Most Arctic-breeding seabirds are migratory, and {{differences}} in wintering locations and migration patterns have been suggested to affect their element concentrations. In a separate part of this project, the migration patterns and wintering areas in a Svalbard-breeding population of <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> (Stercorarius parasiticus) were determined (America, West Africa, the Gulf of Guinea and the Mediterranean). In the present study, the effects of winter areas on feather and blood concentrations of mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were investigated in this population of <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas.</b> Relationships between feather and blood concentrations were examined, and the temporal consistency of each element in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> was quantified by calculating their repeatabilities (REPs). Blood samples (collected during the breeding seasons from 2009 - 2013) and feather samples (from 2010 to 2013) from 23 breeding adult <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> were analysed for elements. There were significant differences in feather concentrations of all the elements among <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> migrating to the different wintering areas. Feather concentrations of Hg, Se and Cd had high REPs, which implies similar individual dietary exposure to these elements within wintering areas among years. Blood concentrations of Hg and Se differed significantly among the wintering <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas,</b> and the individual levels of these elements remained consistent between the years. There were significant relationships between feather and blood concentrations of Hg, Se, Cd and Zn. These relationships suggest that concentrations of these elements obtained during the winter affected circulating blood levels during the breeding season. Hg and Se seemed {{to be released from}} storage tissues into the bloodstream in concentrations reflecting winter levels, while Cd and Zn blood levels remained relatively similar among <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> with different migration strategies. Results concerning effects of migration on Pb blood concentrations were inconclusive because feather and blood concentrations did not correlate. High REP of Pb in blood indicates similar individual exposure to Pb in Kongsfjorden among years. Mean concentrations of Hg and Se were lower in blood of female <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> than in males, and the mean concentration of Hg was higher in blood of <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> breeding on islands of Kongsfjorden than in birds breeding on the tundra. Year was a significant predictor for Zn in feathers and blood. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering migration patterns and wintering locations, in addition to factors such as sex, year and breeding location, when evaluating year-round and local exposure to potentially toxic elements...|$|R
40|$|Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) {{are being}} transported into the Arctic {{where they are}} frequently detected in wildlife. These compounds are suspected thyroid hormone (TH) disruptors due to their structural similarity to triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4), {{in addition to their}} propensity to bind to proteins. Therefore, PFASs may affect THs by competitive binding to the thyroid binding proteins in the blood. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the concentrations of PFASs and THs, and examine effects of PFASs on THs, body condition, and body mass in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) and <b>arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> (Stercorarius parasiticus). Blood was collected from breeding black-legged kittiwakes and <b>arctic</b> <b>skuas.</b> Black-legged kittiwakes (hereafter kittiwakes) were sampled in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard in 2013 and 2014. <b>Arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> were sampled on Brensholmen, Norway and in Kongsfjorden in 2014. The blood was analyzed for perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA), perfluorododecanoate (PFDoDA), perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrDA), perfluorotetradecanoate (PFTeDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate anion (PFHxS), branched and linear perfluorooctane sulfonate anion (brPFOS and linPFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate anion (PFDS), and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA). The analyses were performed on plasma samples for the black-legged kittiwakes and on whole blood samples for the <b>arctic</b> <b>skuas.</b> PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFDS, and PFHxS were not detected in either bird species. Furthermore, total THs (TT 3 and TT 4) were quantified from plasma samples in both species. The resulting data was analyzed statistically to examine if there were associations between PFASs, THs, body condition (BC), and body mass. The dominant PFASs in both kittiwakes and <b>arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> were linPFOS and PFUnDA. In both species, males generally had significantly higher concentrations of PFASs than the females. Furthermore, positive correlations between PFASs and THs were identified in both kittiwakes and <b>arctic</b> <b>skuas.</b> Male kittiwakes with high levels of PFDoDA, PFTrDA, and PFTeDA were in a better body condition than males with lower levels. Conversely, in female kittiwakes and male <b>arctic</b> <b>skuas</b> PFASs were negatively correlated to BC and body mass. The results indicate that PFASs affect the thyroid system, BC, and body mass in the two seabird species...|$|R

50|$|Although many prior adverse practises are now banned, {{the issues}} {{surrounding}} past exploitation of animal {{resources in the}} Svalbard area remain a problem. With whale, seal and walrus populations are still far below than they were even two centuries ago (the average age of a Greenland whale). The population of polar bears are locally recovering from the major culls of the 1960s and 1970s that came about due to the availability of snow scooters; however, the polar bear remains threatened at a global level, due to unsustainable levels of killing by humans and marine water pollution.

50|$|Switha is very {{important}} for wildlife and has been designated both as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and an EU Special Protection Area. The primary reason for this is the wintering population of Greenland barnacle goose. About 1000 of the birds are thought to spend the winter months roosting on the island and feeding on nearby South Walls. This population is not only the most northerly in the UK but also the third largest after Islay and North Uist. Common seabirds known to frequent the rocky coast line include black guillemot, great black-backed gull, <b>Arctic</b> <b>skua</b> and great skua. In addition, Haswell-Smith records that there are many European storm petrel burrows. However, several surveys since the late 1960s have only revealed a small number of pairs on the island, probably never more than 10. The burrows are probably more likely to belong to the puffin, which are reported to be resident on the island in some numbers, with about 250 pairs.|$|E

50|$|More {{than one}} hundred taxa of single-cell pelagic algae have been {{identified}} around the archipelago, the most common being Thalassiosira antarctica and Chaetoceros decipiens. The bloom takes place between May and August. Of the roughly fifty species of zooplankton, calanoids dominate, with Calanus glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus constituting the greater portion of the biomass. On the sea bottom there are 34 species of macroalgae and at least 500 species of macrofauna. Most common are crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimps, polychaetes and echinoderms, such as sea bristles. The ice scouring causes there to be little life in the littoral zone, but the sublittoral zone (2 to 25 m) is dominated by laminaria, most commonly Laminaria sachcharina, and red algae, such as Phycodrys rubens.There are 33 species of fish in the waters, none of which are abundant or commercially exploitable.

40|$|Melanins are a {{ubiquitous}} {{component of}} plumage colouration in birds and serve {{a wide variety}} of functions. Although the genetic control of melanism has been studied in chickens and other domestic species, little was known about the molecular genetics of melanin distribution in wild birds until recently. Studies have now revealed that a single locus, the melanocortin- 1 receptor (MC 1 R) locus, is responsible for melanic polymorphisms in at least three unrelated species: the bananaquit, the snow goose and the <b>arctic</b> <b>skua.</b> Results show that melanism was a derived trait and allow other evolutionary inferences about the history of melanism to be made. The role of MC 1 R in plumage patterning is surprisingly diverse among different species. The conserved molecular basis for the evolution of melanism in birds and several other vertebrates is probably related to low pleiotropic effects at the MC 1 R...|$|E
