5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E

God sits above the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers. God brings princes to nothing, makes the judges of the earth like nothing; scarcely are they planted, but God blows upon them, and they wither and blow away.|$|E

25|$|In {{the bronze}} medal series, Rytas faced BC Neptūnas, {{who was now}} {{considered}} the favorite due to problems internally in Rytas. Rytas started the series with a 79–60 win in Vilnius, to shut up all critics. After losing in Klaipėda 70–83, Rytas won the third game in Vilnius 71–54, again taking a series lead. The last two games were thrillers - lead by Chris Lofton, Neptūnas tied the series in Klaipėda at 2–2 apiece with a 70–65 win, leading to a decisive Game 5 {{in the next few}} days. Led by Gailius and Baron, former Neptūnas players who hit many clutch baskets in the deciding minutes, Rytas won the game 74–66 and the series 3–2, ending the season with a bit more positive note and avenging the 2016 loss to Neptūnas. The season ended with international scandal for the team, however, as club president Gedvydas Vainauskas made a controversial statement about black players of the team who severely behaved unprofessionally (saying no more than 2 players should play in the team and that more <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gang), drawing negative attention to the team all over the world.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways insects can be fossilized and preserved including compressions and impressions, concretions, mineral replication, charcoalified (fusainized) remains, and their trace remains. Compressions and Impressions are the most extensive types of insect fossils, occurring in rocks from the Carboniferous to Recent. Impressions <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cast or mold of a fossil insect, showing its form and even some relief, like pleating in the wings, but usually little or no color from the cuticle. Compressions preserve remains of the cuticle, so color distinguishes structure. In exceptional situations, microscopic features such as microtrichia on sclerites and wing membranes are even visible, but preservation of this scale also requires a matrix of exceptionally fine grain, such as in micritic muds and volcanic tuffs. Because arthropod sclerites are held together by membranes, which readily decompose, many fossil arthropods are known only by isolated sclerites. Far more desirable are complete fossils. Concretions are stones with a fossil at the core whose chemical composition {{differs from that of}} the surrounding matrix, usually formed as a result of mineral precipitation from decaying organisms. The most significant deposit consists of various localities of the Late Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale of the Carbondale Formation at Mazon Creek, Illinois, which are composed of shales and coal seams yielding oblong concretions. Within most concretions is a mold of an animal and sometimes a plant that is usually marine in origin.|$|E

The series intended to wrap up [...] "unfinished business" [...] from the television show. Although Smallville: Chloe Chronicles began on AOL, it made its way to the United Kingdom's Channel 4 website. According to Lisa Gregorian, senior vice president for television of Warner Bros. Marketing Services, [...] "Our goal is to create companion programming that offers new and exciting ways to engage the audience, just as music videos did for record promotion." [...] Allison Mack described the show as [...] "very Nancy Drew and mysterious": [...] "I think it's a bit more like The X-Files or NYPD Blue. The Chronicles <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> detective story, with Chloe following clues and interviewing people, going from spot to spot, figuring things out." [...] The scripts were written by Brice Tidwell; Mack was given script approval for the series, allowing her to review and make changes to the script. Warshaw communicated with Gough and Millar to expand Smallville stories in Chloe's Chronicles.|$|E

500|$|By April 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. There's good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. So you need that dissenting voice, and you need to understand it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E
