5|$|Cobra Triangle is a 1989 racing, {{vehicular}} combat {{video game}} developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The player controls a weapon-equipped speedboat through 25 levels. Objectives include winning races, saving swimmers, and defusing bombs. The game also includes power-ups and is displayed from a 3D isometric perspective with <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling</b> {{that follows the}} player's movement. The Stamper brothers designed the game and David Wise wrote its soundtrack. Computer and Video Games highly recommended the game and praised its graphics and gameplay. Later reviewers lauded its level diversity and noted its graphical similarities to previous Rare game R.C. Pro-Am. IGN and GamesRadar ranked Cobra Triangle among their top NES games. The latter considered Cobra Triangle emblematic of the NES era's aesthetic. It was also included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5000|$|In Multiuser DOS, System Manager, and REAL/32, {{activating}} [...] during boot {{will enter}} a special diagnostic mode, where {{the operating system}} and loaded device drivers will display detailed status and debugging information about themselves and their interaction with the operating system, sometimes up to several screenfuls per loaded driver. <b>Automatic</b> <b>scrolling</b> is suspended {{for as long as}} [...] remains activated.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} Astro Rabby {{is that the}} player is a rabbit who has to travel through certain top-viewed levels with <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling.</b> Since the number of usable {{platforms}} are severely limited in this game, learning to control the player's jumps becomes a primary asset. Landing on platforms causes the block to break due to the excess force that the player puts on it. Sometimes, power-ups are given that will extend the relatively short time limit that Astro Rabby offers.|$|E
40|$|This {{exhibition}} {{is based upon}} the initial phase of a doctoral research project, which explores in depth the interactions between physical activity and artistic creativity through the concept of simultaneous recreational running and creative drawing. ‘Run-to-draw’ is a collaborative endeavour in which the researcher creates drawings on Phidippeddes, an original engineered product designed by, and worn on the back of, a co-runner. It contains an <b>automatic</b> <b>scroll</b> for drawing and mounted video camera to capture the run-to-draw experience in situ. Here we draw attention to the visual (Phoenix, 2010), displaying some initial artistic drawings and film footage produced over a variety of running contexts and environments. Combining physical recreation and art, these drawings offer a unique form of data where the artistic is a different way of ‘knowing’ the physical, and the physical invigorates artist creativity. We hope that these drawings amass multilayered meanings and evocative interpretations in those observing them, and offer some insight into the nuanced, sensory dimensions of the lived experience of run-to-draw engagement...|$|R
50|$|In Windows 7, several {{features}} {{have been}} removed from Windows Explorer, including the collapsible folder pane, overlay icon for shared items, remembering individual folder window sizes and positions, free disk space on the status bar, icons on the command bar, ability to disable Auto Arrange and Align to Grid, sortable column headings in other views except details view, ability to disable full row selection in details view, <b>automatic</b> horizontal <b>scrolling</b> and scrollbar in the navigation pane and maintaining selection when sorting from the Edit menu.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Conventional web {{browsing}} {{displays a}} web page {{inside of a}} window. In conventional web browsing, following a link replaces the previous document entirely, and the readers tend to lose the context. We have developed a system inlineLink, which applies an in-line, expansion-link method to web browsing. This in-line expansion inserts the linked document after the link anchor text. The inlineLink provides navigation mechanisms such as <b>automatic</b> animated <b>scrolling,</b> zooming, and index jumping {{in order to reduce}} the scrolling tasks while handling longer, inlined documents. We have adopted Dynamic HTML to implement the inline expansion functions. Casual users can try them on conventional web browsers. The results of our experiment prove the advantages of inlineLink in both click counts and mouse movement. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{next major}} release, Professional Composer 2.0, {{supported}} writing {{on up to}} 40 staves and allowed the user to enter notes as short as 128th notes, with all operations mainly controlled by menus and dialog boxes. Version 2.0 also introduced several improvements for printing (such as automatically condensing parts with several rest measures), allowing production of professional quality scores. Although the application demanded knowledge of music theory to use its rich features, it offered only rudimentary playback capabilities. A Macworld review also criticized the high price (495 USD in February 1986) {{and the lack of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling</b> when staves were filled (only via scroll bars).|$|E
5000|$|One notable {{aspect of}} this game is that while it is <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling,</b> for the most part, the player can control {{the speed of the}} engines (there is even a bonus timer that counts down, as an {{incentive}} {{for those who want to}} [...] "blast through"), and the pitch of the noise alters accordingly, while sounding vaguely like a didgeridoo. This [...] "adjustable rate autoscroll" [...] is uncommon in the genre (Armed Police Unit Gallop is another example of this) There are a few exceptions, though. Several levels end with sections where the ship is forced to fly at maximum speed (a two-note siren will sound at the beginning of such sections), where the player must be quick to avoid oncoming barriers.|$|E

50|$|Fray is {{a simple}} action RPG. The game {{proceeds}} by the player's character Fray fighting through a preset overhead view map shooting opposing monsters, jumping over obstacles, and locating powerups and Gold, the game's currency, along the way. At {{the end of each}} stage the player will fight a boss and enter a town or safe haven where the player can purchase new equipment, hit points and the option to save their progress. Fray advances in power through the items that she can equip such as different rods and shields. Battles are in real-time as Fray walks around on <b>automatic</b> vertically <b>scrolling</b> game map as well as the monster characters. She has an attack and defense rating, and can switch between different projectile weapon styles as well as use special attacks and healing items.|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} for users of mobile devices such as cellular phones equipped with a small screen and a poor input interface to browse Web pages designed for desktop PCs with large displays. Many studies and commercial products have tried to solve this problem. Web pages include images that have various roles such as site menus, line headers for itemization, and page titles. However, most studies of mobile Web browsing haven’t {{paid much attention to}} the roles of Web images. In this paper, we define eleven Web image categories according to their roles and use these categories for proper Web image handling. We manually categorized 3, 901 Web images collected from forty Web sites and extracted image features of each category according to the classification. By making use of the extracted features, we devised an automatic Web image classification method. Furthermore, we evaluated the automatic classification of real Web pages and achieved up to 83. 1 % classification accuracy. We also implemented an <b>automatic</b> Web page <b>scrolling</b> system as an application of our automatic image classification method...|$|R
50|$|Giganticrab is {{the level}} one boss. He has three eyes {{on top of his}} head you need to blow up before he corners you with his body or his moving antennas.At level two you will find Jawispede, a big worm that falls apart into three pieces you also need to destroy. Level three is an {{overview}} perspective level where you will look for a base with lots of firing eyes. It has no <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling.</b> The start of the level gives you the vague direction you need to go. Fangskull {{is at the end of}} level four. Basically it's a big skull you can only hit at the bottom.At the end of level five a fire demon with the name Torchwing is waiting. He's surrounded with fire balls he can unleash.Level six is another overview perspective level with a slightly larger base you need to destroy.Slimedragon is the end boss of the game. He's so big you're only fighting his head. He fires off massive projectiles that chase you and you can only hit him in the eye. This means you fire lasers into his mouth if you're a good shot, or you can just take it slow if you use the rings. It is impossible to hit the eye with missiles. Cobalt bombs don't damage the dragon, but you can use them to stop his projectiles at least a few times if you get cornered.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a study on}} image grid display with automatic vertical scrolling. While scroll operations are normally carried out manually by the user, {{in the context of}} RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) techniques this work considers a presentation mode in which the image grid is automatically scrolled. Through experiments carried out with 50 testers, we have investigated user performance while looking for specific target subjects within large collections of images. Different numbers of columns and scrolling speeds have been considered. The search task implied both clicking on the identified target pictures and simply vocally stating their visual recognition. To this purpose, and to identify possible specific gaze behaviours, eye tracking technology has been exploited. The obtained results show that number of columns and scroll speed do affect search performance. Moreover, the userâs gaze tends to focus on different screen areas depending on the values of these two parameters. Although {{it is not possible to}} definitely find an optimal columnsâspeed combination that is valid in all cases, the particular context of use can suggest feasible solutions according to oneâs needs. To the best of our knowledge, image grid display with <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling</b> has never been studied to date.

40|$|Scrolling is an {{essential}} part of our everyday computing experience. Contemporary scrolling techniques rely on the explicit initiation of scrolling by the user. The act of scrolling is tightly coupled with the user’s ability to absorb information via the visual channel. The use of eye gaze information is therefore a natural choice for enhancing scrolling techniques. We present several gaze-enhanced scrolling techniques for manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling</b> which use gaze information as a primary input or as an augmented input. We also introduce the use off-screen gaze-actuated buttons for document navigation and control...|$|E

The most important goal of the app {{is the ability to}} modify lyrics in such way, that they can be viewed flawlessly even on small screens of mobile devices. Application also features many other functions mostly useful for guitar players. User can download lyrics of song with chords directly from app and set up <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling</b> with different speed for each part of the song. Thesis also describes other important aspects of application development, like user testing and final app release...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to test the use of gaze {{interaction}} in common everyday computer tasks, with the intent to suggest design guidelines for gaze interaction in Microsoft Windows 7. This has been done by organizing a user test with fifteen participants, using a self-made gaze interactive software called Discovery and a Tobii X 60 eye tracker. Five demo applications have been created within the Discovery software, all utilizing gaze interaction. They are customized to reflect five user test tasks; playing a video game, exploring a picture gallery, doing drag and drop operations, browsing a web page and interacting with different Microsoft Windows controls. The four types of controls tested are command buttons, links, check boxes and sliders. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered during the user test. Through a discussion of the test results, we were able to suggest ten specific design guidelines for gaze interaction. These covers both the tested controls, drag and drop operations, <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling</b> as well as the use of head gestures. Additional findings indicate that gaze interaction is more suitable for passive tasks such as reading with <b>automatic</b> <b>scrolling,</b> than for more physical tasks like doing drag and drop operations. To support gaze interaction, we found that current software will either require a major redesign or to be used in a combination with other interaction styles. Eye tracking technology has improved over the last years, becoming increasingly affordable and accurate. Through this study we have seen that gaze interaction has much to offer everyday computing. By recommending fundamental design guidelines we hope to aid software developers and designers in the development of future gaze interactive systems. </p...|$|E
