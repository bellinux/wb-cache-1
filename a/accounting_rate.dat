40|$|Several {{national}} governments {{have expressed concern}} at the inability of carriers to negotiate lower <b>accounting</b> <b>rates.</b> Ergas and Patterson (1991) and Frieden (1997) {{argue that it is}} only on bilateral markets with facilities-based competition at both ends that conditions favour <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> reductions. In the absence of facilities-based competition, Frieden also suggests that service providers, such as resellers, may provide a second best opportunity to place downward pressure on <b>accounting</b> <b>rates.</b> This study extends the work of Ergas and Patterson by developing an econometric model of settlement rate pricing. The model is estimated on data for 27 US bilateral telephone markets for the period 1985 to 1995. Parameter estimates are used to identify settlement rate determinants, and so highlight impediments to efficient international telecommunications pricing. A novel feature of the model is the inclusion of a resale market structure variable. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Accounting</b> <b>rate</b> of return, {{also known}} as the Average rate of return, or ARR is a {{financial}} ratio used in capital budgeting. The ratio {{does not take into account}} the concept of time value of money. ARR calculates the return, generated from net income of the proposed capital investment. The ARR is a percentage return. Say, if ARR = 7%, then it means that the project is expected to earn seven cents out of each dollar invested (yearly). If the ARR is equal to or greater than the required rate of return, the project is acceptable. If it is less than the desired rate, it should be rejected. When comparing investments, the higher the ARR, the more attractive the investment. More than half of large firms calculate ARR when appraising projects.|$|E

They also establish an <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> to compensate {{each other for}} accepting calls and delivering them to the intended recipient.

40|$|The revenue {{settlement}} {{process in}} international telecommunications, {{that is used}} by the majority of carriers, is the accounting revenue division procedure (ARDP). The formula for the net-settlement which is central to revenue settlement, is a model of simplicity. However, it is often ignored that the process is based on equal sharing of the accounting revenue, between two carriers who are exchanging international telephone traffic between their respective countries. In particular, the provision of equal sharing of the accounting revenue is not compatible with a competitive global market. A further crucial element of the settlement process is the so-called <b>accounting</b> <b>rate.</b> The net-settlement is linearly dependent on the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate,</b> but changes in the level of the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> cannot eliminate the provision of equal revenue sharing. In fact, the proclaimed aim of reducing accounting rates toward cost, {{while at the same time}} preserving the provision for equal sharing of the accounting revenue, will most certainly lead to a subsidy from lesser developed countries to developed countries, regardless of the volume of telephone traffic exchanged, even if the payer of the net-settlement is the carrier of the developed country. On the other hand, removal of the provision of equal sharing of the accounting revenue from the ARDP would obliterate the entire process, and with it the opportunity offered to both carriers to simultaneously earn settlement revenues beyond the revenue requirement.

40|$|Twenty European {{countries}} {{came together}} in 1865 to form an organisation, the predecessor to the International Telecommunications Union and to arrive at mechanisms and agree upon a methodology of distributing the revenues from the international telegraph service. The current <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system is {{a modified version of}} the then developed methodology for the International telegraph. This international settlement regime based on accounting rates has long been under attack by economists, policy-makers in developed countries and international trade organisations. The ITU, the OECD, the FCC and other regulatory bodies are pursuing various initiatives to reform or replace the existing <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system. These regulatory initiatives are aimed at reducing the current pricing distortions embedded in the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system. In the wake of the WTO agreement, a system of traffic compensation that is not ‘cost oriented’ is not only unsustainable, it is also in violation of the regulatory principles set out in the WTO reference paper. The FCC has been at the forefront of the move to decrease accounting rates. In August 1997, the FCC adopted “benchmark” accounting rates for different groups of countries, which it considered more closely related to the actual costs of providing international service between those countries and the US. The benchmark rates range from $ 0. 15 -$. 23 per minute, and are far below those currently in practice, particularly for most of the developing countries which are sometimes in excess of $ 1. 00 per minute. If implemented, these rates would significantly reduce international calling revenues of these countries. While the FCC obviously has no direct regulatory jurisdiction outside of the US, it has threatened to deny access to the US market to PTOs from other countries that do not reduce their accounting rates to the benchmark levels. While the future of the existing <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system is being debated in regulatory circles, an increasing proportion of international traffic is bypassing this traditional system of compensation. Facilitated by the global trend towards the liberalisation of telecommunications markets, new technological means for bypassing the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system are also developing rapidly. ...|$|E

Using data for international calls between the US and 148 foreign destinations between 1991 and 1997, this paper finds that the increasing payment deficit for the US is associated with decreasing accounting rates.

The econometric model shows that growing asymmetries in teledensity, market concentration, and income levels between the US {{and the rest of}} the world explain the imbalances.
