5|$|During royal coronations, however, {{separate}} banners {{for each}} of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled banners in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before the crowning of the king-elect, they handed the banners to the primate who unfurled them <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the kneeling king. The king would then stand up and give the unfurled banners back to the standard-bearers.|$|E
5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

Both Bartram's and A built their first SD14's in 1967 <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their new owners in February 1968. A's takeover of Bartram's followed in October.|$|E

500|$|During the 1938 tour of England, Hassett smuggled a “wet, muddy, and complaining” {{mountain}} goat (put a waistcoat on the goat, {{according to}} some sources) into the bedroom he shared with Stan McCabe and O'Reilly while the team was staying at Grindleford, after they had fallen asleep. They awoke to unexpected smells and bleating. During the 1948 tour of England, he {{was reported to have}} unnerved his teammates and tempted fate by bringing a toy duck into the dressing room, and held up play during a county match by hiding the ball in a pile of sawdust. During the same summer, Hassett and a few teammates were being chauffeured back to London after a function. It was after midnight, but Hassett asked the driver to stop at a random mansion along the road. He then rang the bell and told the startled householder that he [...] "just thought we'd pop in". The owner happened to recognise Hassett and received the cricketers. In the Third Test of the same tour, after dropping two hooked catches from Washbrook, Hassett responded by borrowing a policeman’s helmet, before motioning to Ray Lindwall to bowl another bouncer. During the 1953 tour of England, a waiter spilled a dessert on Hassett's jacket. Initially declining the waiter's multiple offers to have his jacket taken away for cleaning, Hassett acquiesced and while taking off his jacket, noticed a spot on his trousers. He then silently pointed to the spot, removed his trousers <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the waiter, before continuing to eat his meal in his underpants.|$|E

These last changes are reflected in the Notitia Dignitatum, a list of all offices compiled circa 400.

2500|$|Only seven {{tanks of}} the {{composite}} company, one male and six female, were operational when the operation began at [...] the others having already broken down or bogged. The tanks {{drove out of}} St Julien {{one at a time}} towards Hillock Farm, about [...] up the road, which took until [...] the farm was empty and occupied by the 1/8th Warwick. Tank G. 29 (Second-Lieutenant A. G. Barker) reached the road junction at Triangle Farm but could not turn left down the road for Maison du Hibou as it had been obliterated. G. 29 was driven another [...] along the Poelcappelle road, which brought the tank {{to the rear of the}} strongpoint. The crew tried to approach cross-country and at , opened fire with the 6-pounder in the left sponson. After firing forty times, about sixty Germans fled from Maison du Hibou, half being shot down and the remainder taken prisoner by the 1/8th Warwick. From the road, the crew of tank G. 31 engaged the blockhouse with its Lewis guns but then returned to the rally-point with engine trouble. G. 29 bogged down but was able to engage the Germans in the Wilhemstellung with the gun in the right sponson, until the tank sank too far into the mud to bring the gun to bear and around [...] the crew disabled the 6-pounders, dismounted the Lewis guns <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the 1/8th Warwick.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Emancipation {{reform of}} 1861, wolf hunting was done solely by {{authorised}} firearm holders, usually police, soldiers, rich landowners or nobles. Upon {{learning of the}} frequency of attacks on livestock and humans, the Czarist Ministry of the Interior sent agents to Western Europe {{in order to learn}} how the people there dealt with wolf problems. [...] Upon returning, the Ministry of Internal Affairs developed a plan in 1846 to deal with wolves involving the opening of wolf bounties and appointment of government hunters. Each hunter was given jurisdiction to hunt in one district, with more than one for large areas. Hunters were given 3 rubles for each male wolf killed and 1.5 for each cub, with a tail presented as proof. Each hunter would receive an annual salary of 60 rubles a year, provided he kill 15 adults and 30 cubs a year. [...] Peasant hunters however were rarely rewarded, due to corrupt bureaucrats stealing the money. [...] In 1858, after paying $1 250 000 for over a million wolves in Central Russia, officials became suspicious, and discovered that some hunters bought wolf pelts for low prices, cut them up <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> magistrates as wolf tails. In the latter years of the 19th century, Russian hunting societies began an energetic campaign against wolves. In 1897, members of the Moscow Hunting Society killed their first 1000 wolves, though the number of professional wolf hunters at the time was rather low. Serfs began hunting wolves after their emancipation in 1861, though rarely with success, as civilian firearms were highly expensive, and the cheaper ones were usually primitive and unable to bare the heavy ammunition necessary to kill wolves.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they were}} going below, Francisco Portusach sailed across {{the bow of the}} Charleston in a {{whaleboat}} with the American flag at the topmast. A loud voice from the ship called, [...] "Frank, come on board." [...] Portusach looked up to the deck and saw Captain Hallett, a man whom he had known years before. The skipper of the whaleboat then went to the lee side of the cruiser and clambered aboard. When he reached the deck, he was surprised to find a reporter with whom he was acquainted, a representative of the San Francisco Chronicle. While the reporter and the old whaling captain were talking about old times, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther, the navigator, walked up to Portusach and demanded to know by what right he was hoisting the American flag at the topmast of the little boat. The Guam merchant merely grinned and replied the flag was being flown legally. The lieutenant promptly requested proof, and Portusach produced American naturalization papers from an inside coat pocket <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the doubting Braunersreuther who looked at them and said, [...] "Well! Twenty-second of October, 1888, Chicago, Cook County, State of Illinois." [...] The navigator examined the document more thoroughly and requested Portusach to accompany him to visit Glass. The [...] "welcoming party" [...] had just departed for shore, so the two men entered the captain's cabin, and the lieutenant handed the naturalization papers to Glass who looked at them for a few moments. He had already heard from José Portusach that Francisco possessed some lighters and boats, so he greeted the merchant by inquiring if it was possible to obtain the use of two lighters and a boat to transfer coal from the City of Peking to the bunkers of the Charleston and offered to pay for the service. Portusach agreed to furnish the boats without compensation since he felt an obligation, as the only United States citizen on the island, to aid his country in time of war.|$|E
