5|$|Low carbon fuel {{standards}} {{is administered by}} the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> and attempts to make wider choice of cleaner fuels to Californians. Producers of petroleum-based fuels are required to reduce the carbon intensity of their products to 10 percent in 2020.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2009, California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB) {{approved}} the specific rules and carbon intensity reference {{values for the}} California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) that take effect January 1, 2011. CARB's rulemaking included ILUC. For some biofuels, CARB identified land use changes as {{a significant source of}} additional GHG emissions. It established one standard for gasoline and alternative fuels, and a second for diesel fuel and its replacements.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB) {{classified}} the Volt as Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV), as CARB tests do {{not account}} for the Volt electric range. With all tests conducted under conditions where the engine is running the CARB rated the Volt's carbon monoxide (CO) emissions at 1.3 g/mile (0.81 g/km), missing the limit for SULEV classification by 0.3 g/mile (0.19 g/km).|$|E

5000|$|Arie Jan Haagen-Smit (December 22, 1900 Utrecht - March 17, 1977, Pasadena, California) was a Dutch chemist. He is {{best known}} for linking the smog in Southern California to {{automobiles}} and is therefore known by many as the [...] "father" [...] of air pollution control. After serving as an original board member of the Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board, formed in 1960 to combat the smog, Dr. Haagen-Smit became the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board's</b> first chairman in 1968. Shortly before his death, of lung cancer, the <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board's</b> El Monte Laboratory was named after him.|$|R
5|$|Libby {{started the}} first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972. As {{a member of}} the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board,</b> he worked to develop and improve California's air {{pollution}} standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous catalysis with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.|$|E
5|$|The {{advanced}} {{clean car}} rules program {{was made to}} reduce tail pipe emissions. The <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025. Some of their goals by 2025 are to have more environmentally superior cars to be available in different models and different types of cars. New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog-forming emissions. And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $6,000 {{over the life of}} the car.|$|E

50|$|In 1998 the <b>Air</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Board</b> {{identified}} diesel {{particulate matter}} as carcinogenic.

25|$|In 2003, the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB), {{headed by}} Democrat Alan Lloyd, finally caved to {{industry}} pressure and drastically scaled back the ZEV mandate. CARB had previously defended the regulation {{for more than}} 12 years.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{after being}} {{investigated}} by the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board,</b> Toyota extended a campaign nationwide for owners of MY 2001–2003 Prius for starting problems caused by improper working throttle body that led to electronic control module malfunction.|$|E
25|$|Owing to tetrachloroethylene's cancer risks, California's <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> {{banned the}} {{substance}} from use in new dry-cleaning machines in 2007, with older PCE-using machines {{shut down by}} mid-2010 {{and the use of}} all such machines discontinued in California by 2023.|$|E
40|$|The CARB Executive Order Exemption Process for a Hydrogen-fueled Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle was {{undertaken}} {{to define the}} requirements to achieve a California <b>Air</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Board</b> Executive Order for a hydrogenfueled vehicle retrofit kit. A 2005 to 2006 General Motors Company Sierra/Chevrolet Silverado 1500 HD pickup {{was assumed to be}} the build-from vehicle for the retrofit kit. The emissions demonstration was determined not to pose a significant hurdle due to the non-hydrocarbon-based fuel and lean-burn operation. However, significant work was determined to be necessary for Onboard Diagnostics Level II compliance. Therefore, it is recommended that an Experimental Permit be obtained from the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Board</b> to license and operate the vehicles for the durability of the demonstration in support of preparing a fully compliant and certifiable package that can be submitted...|$|R

25|$|The CVT-equipped Insight is {{classified}} as a super-low emissions vehicle. The Insight features low emissions: the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> gave the 5-speed model a ULEV rating, and the CVT model earned a SULEV rating – the 5-speed model's lean-burn ability traded increased efficiency for slightly higher NOx emissions.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB) {{rate the}} Prius {{as among the}} cleanest {{vehicles}} sold in the United States based on smog-forming emissions.

25|$|In the U.S., {{it is one}} of {{the least}} polluting {{vehicles}} available and is rated as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) as defined by the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB). The CR-Z is the third gasoline-electric hybrid model offered by Honda (after the 2000–2006 Insight and 2003–2005 Civic Hybrid) that can be equipped with a manual transmission, and the only one in the same class offered by any automaker to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to mass-produce an electric car came after GM received a favorable reception for its 1990 Impact electric concept car, {{upon which the}} design of the EV1 drew heavily. Inspired partly by the Impact's perceived potential for success, the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB) subsequently passed a mandate that made the production and sale of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) a requirement for the seven major automakers selling cars in the United States to continue to market their vehicles in California.|$|E
25|$|The Toyota Prius {{is a full}} series-parallel hybrid {{electric}} mid-size car {{developed and}} manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation. The second generation Prius had been completely redesigned as a mid-size hatchback. The XW20 series represented the second generation of the Toyota Prius, replacing its XW10 predecessor. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB) also rate the Prius as among the cleanest vehicles sold in the United States based on smog forming and toxic emissions in 2008.

25|$|In September 2006, the California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> held a Zero Emission Vehicle {{symposium}} {{that included}} several presentations on V2G technology. In April 2007, Pacific Gas and Electric Company showcased a PHEV at the Silicon Valley Leadership Alternative Energy Solutions Summit with vehicle-to-grid capability, and demonstrated {{that it could}} be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failure. Regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed, or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasible.|$|E
25|$|Eleven U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic {{states have}} {{committed}} to analyzing a single low-carbon fuel {{standard for the}} entire region, driving commercialization and creating a larger market for fuels with low carbon intensity. The standard is aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fuels for vehicles and other uses, including fuel used for heating buildings, industrial processes, and electricity generation. Ten of these states {{are members of the}} Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). California <b>Air</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Board</b> (CARB) staff has been coordinating with representatives of these States. The states developing a regional LCFS are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.|$|E
