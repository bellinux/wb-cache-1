5000|$|Hume's fork is an explanation, {{developed}} by later philosophers, of David Hume's aggressive, 1730s division of [...] "relations of ideas" [...] from [...] "matters {{of fact and}} real existence". [...] On the necessary versus contingent (concerning reality), the a priori versus a posteriori (concerning knowledge), and the analytic versus synthetic (concerning language), truths relating ideas (abstract) all <b>align</b> <b>on</b> one side (necessary, a priori, analytic), whereas truths on actualities (concrete) always <b>align</b> <b>on</b> the other side (contingent, a posteriori, synthetic).|$|E
5000|$|In 1739, Hume cast a fork aggressively {{dividing}} [...] "relations of ideas" [...] from [...] "matters of {{fact and}} real existence", such that all truths are of one type or the other. [...] By Hume's fork, truths by relations among ideas (abstract) all <b>align</b> <b>on</b> one side (analytic, necessary, a priori), whereas truths by states of actualities (concrete) always <b>align</b> <b>on</b> the other side (synthetic, contingent, a posteriori). [...] At any treatises containing neither, Hume orders, [...] "Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion".|$|E

50|$|Charles Francis and Erik Anderson showed from {{observations}} of motions of over 20,000 local stars (within 300 parsecs), that stars do move along spiral arms, and described how mutual gravity between stars causes orbits to <b>align</b> <b>on</b> logarithmic spirals.

50|$|A major {{consequence}} of CI is the delayed entry into mitosis {{of the male}} pronucleus. As a secondary consequence, stemming from this asynchrony, the paternal chromosomes do not properly condense and <b>align</b> <b>on</b> the metaphase plate during the first mitosis. As a consequence, only the maternal chromosome segregate normally, producing haploid embryos. The rescue of CI by infected eggs leads to the restoration of synchrony between the female and the male pronucleus.|$|E

The Aberdeenshire time reckoner predates the Mesopotamian calendars by nearly 5,000 years. It was also interpreted as a seasonal calendar because the local prehistoric communities, which relied on hunting migrating animals needed to carefully note the seasons to be prepared for a particular food source. The Warren Field site is particularly significant for its very early date {{and the fact that it}} was created by Hunter-gatherer peoples, rather than sedentary farmers usually associated with monument building.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander is the 5th Campione and of British descent. He is {{also known}} as Black Prince Alec, leader of {{political}} organization Royal Arsenal that oppose Princess Alice's organization Witengamot. He looks like a young man with black hair. He has an arrogant personality, willing to work with Alice when their goals <b>align</b> <b>on</b> issues. He has the Authority of Fallen Angel Ramiel [...] "Black Lightning," [...] an ability that grants him super speed. He can also turn himself into a lightning avatar made of plasma to travel even faster, evade physical injury and use lightning strikes. However, if the lightning avatar is dispelled, he will revert to his normal physical form. He also defeated the Minotaur Granting, which creates an underground labyrinth where he always understands the full layout and where his opponents are located, and the three Judging Furies, which returns all damage done in front of him back to an opponent using any physical or magical form of destructive power.|$|E
50|$|Brand New Congress is a volunteer-led American {{political}} organization that intends to run campaigns for over 400 United States Congresspeople with candidates of the organization's choosing by the 2018 midterm elections, regardless of party affiliation. The organization {{plans to make}} staffing and fundraising decisions {{for all of its}} candidates at once. About 20 volunteers from Senator Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign formed the group in April 2016 as Sanders conceded the primary to Hillary Clinton. They planned the organization to support Sanders's platform and carry its supporters' momentum into policymaking. Brand New Congress planned to announce 50 candidates by March 2017 and over 400 by July 2017. Of the 535 total seats in the United States Congress (House and Senate), 468 will be up for reelection in 2018. The group intends to run both Democratic and Republican candidates, depending on regional demographics, as well as independents when an incumbent wins the primary. Brand New Congress requires candidates to <b>align</b> <b>on</b> Bernie Sander’s presidential platform, regardless of party affiliation. While there are large differences in Republican and Democratic policy beliefs, the Brand New Congress hopes that people will unify under the goal of reforming Congress.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} {{quality of}} polyfluorenes is their thermotropic liquid crystallinity {{which allows the}} polymers to <b>align</b> <b>on</b> rubbed polyimide layers. Thermotropic liquid crystallinity refers to the polymers' ability to exhibit a phase transition into the liquid crystal phase as the temperature is changed. This {{is very important to}} the development of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) because the synthesis of liquid crystal displays requires that the liquid-crystal molecules at the two glass surfaces of the cell be aligned parallel to the two polarizer foils.This can only be done by coating the inner-surfaces of the cell with a thin, transparent film of polyamide which is then rubbed with a velvet cloth. Microscopic grooves are then generated in the polyamide layer and the liquid crystal in contact with the polyamide, the polyfluorene, can align in the rubbing direction. In addition to LCDs, polyfluorene {{can also be used to}} synthesize light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Polyfluorene has led to LEDs that can emit polarized light with polarization ratios of more than 20 and with brightness of 100 cd m−2. Even though this is very impressive, it is not sufficient for general applications.|$|E
50|$|Researchers in {{the past}} 20 years have {{determined}} that a gene mutation, specifically a homozygous mutation in the EDNRB gene, {{is the cause of}} ABCD syndrome. The advancement of technology led to new DNA material testing methods and this discovery changed the view of ABCD syndrome completely. A homozygous mutation means that there was an identical mutation on both the maternal and paternal genes. The identifying clinical report stated the test was done by scanning the Kurdish family for mutations in the EDNRB gene and the EDN3 gene by using a test called denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresis test takes advantage of electrical currents and differences in melting points of fragments of DNA or RNA to move them based on their molecular weight; the differences in mobility of the fragments then can be analyzed to determine different sequences and to detect individual alleles. Different nucleotides in DNA are codes for certain proteins, which are formed by different patterns of the base pairs adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The combination of adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine <b>align</b> <b>on</b> the double strands of DNA. The test results found “an aberrant DGGE pattern of exon 3 of the EDNRB gene. The mutation was determined to be a homozygous C to T base pair transition at the amino acid level, causing a premature stop in gene translation.” This specialized testing enables geneticists to recognize the gene mutation that is the cause of ABCD syndrome.|$|E
