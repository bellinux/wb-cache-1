40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHBackground: Although clinicians {{encounter}} <b>antimycobacterial</b> {{treatment in}} Human mmunodeficiency (HIV) -infected children {{as one of}} the most common treatments coadministered with antiretroviral treatment (ART), quantitative data on the extent of <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment among HIV-infected children at the time of commencement of ART and at different times during ART is scarce. The baseline risk factors associated with being on both ART and <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatments are not known and it remains to be elucidated how the different exposure factors impact on the <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment-free survival of children who begin ART without <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment. Objectives: To describe the prevalence of <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment among children at the time of starting ART and the <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment-free survival after starting ART. Design: A retrospective cohort study based on record reviews at the Harriet Shezi children‘s clinic (HSCC). Population: HIV-infected children less than fifteen years of age presumed ART naïve started on ART at HSCC. Analysis: A descriptive analysis of the prevalence of <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment at time of start of ART was done. Kaplan Meier (KM) survival curves were used to determine the <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment-free survival and logistic regression was used to analyze the association between baseline factors and future <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment among children who had no <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment at time of start of ART. Results: The prevalence of <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment at the time of starting ART was 518 / 1941 (26. 7 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 24. 7 - 28. 7). Among children who started ART without <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment, the KM cumulative probability of antiretroviral and <b>antimycobacterial</b> (ART/antimycobacterial) co-treatment in the first 3 months of starting ART was 4. 6 % (95 % CI: 4. 1 - 5. 2), in the first 12 months it was 18. 1 % (95 % CI: 17. 0 - 19. 2) and in the first 24 months of starting ART it was 24 % (95 % CI: 21. 9 - 25. 1). Survival analysis suggested that children with high baseline viral load, advanced World Health Organization (WHO) stage of disease, very low normalized weight for age (waz) and very young age (less than one year) at start of ART had significantly reduced <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment-free survival (log rank p < 0. 05) in the first two years of starting ART. In the logistic regression model, age less than one year {Odds ratio (OR) : 3. 7 (95 % CI: 2. 2 - 6. 0; p < 0. 0001) } and very low weight for age Z-score (waz < - 3) {OR; 2. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 4 - 3. 6; p = 0. 0015) } were the two critical risk factors independently associated with future <b>antimycobacterial</b> treatment. Conclusions: <b>Antimycobacterial</b> treatment is extremely common among HIV-infected children at the time of starting ART and early after starting ART and the incremental risk of being on ART/antimycobacterial co-treatment decreases with time on ART. The results emphasize the need for a heightened and careful alertness for mycobacterial events especially among children starting ART with severe malnutrition and those who start ART at age less than one year. The results further suggest that it is probably optimal to start ART in children before their nutritional status has deteriorated severely in the course of the HIV disease so that they get protection against mycobacterial events by early ART.

Additional literature was obtained from reference lists of pertinent articles identified through the search. STUDY SELECllON AND DATA EXTRACllON: All articles were considered for possible inclusion in the review. Information judg~JY the author to be pertinent was selected for discussion. DATA SYNIlIESIS: Mycobacterial infections, including those caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria other than MAC, have assumed greater importance over the past decade, {{due in part to}} the changing spectrum of immunosuppression as manifested by organ transplantation and HIV infection. Many pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria have been identified that are associated with a wide variety of localized, organ-specific, and systemic infections. Of concern, these organisms exhibit variable, species-specific susceptibility to traditional antimycobacterial drugs and other antimicrobials. In addition, long treatment courses and adjunctive surgical therapy are often required to effect cure. Important antimicrobials for the management of these infections include cefoxitin, imipenem/cilastatin, arninoglycosides (other than streptomycin), tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, as well as traditional <b>antimycobacterials.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Nontuberculous mycobacteria have assumed an increasing role in disease etiology in both nonimmunocompromised and immunocompromised individuals.

These compounds, such as pyrazinamide, are old synthetic <b>antimycobacterials</b> that are activated inside Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli and {{are smaller than}} the usual drug-like, single-target molecules. Based {{on the success of}} small ‘dirty’ drugs in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis, we suggested previously that fragment-based whole cell screens should be introduced in our current antimycobacterial drug discovery efforts. Here, we carried out such a screen and characterized bactericidal activity, selectivity and spectrum of hits we obtained. A library of 1725 fragments was tested at a single concentration for growth inhibitory activity against M. bovis BCG as screening strain and 38 of 116 primary hits were confirmed in dose response analyses to be active against virulent M. tuberculosis. Bacterial kill experiments showed that most hits displayed bactericidal activity at their minimal inhibitory concentration. Cytotoxicity assays established that a large proportion of hits displayed a favorable selectivity index for mammalian cells. Importantly, one third of M. tuberculosis active fragments were also active against M. abscessus and M. avium, two emerging non-tuberculous mycobacterial pathogens, opening the opportunity to develop broad spectrum <b>antimycobacterials.</b> Activity determination against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans) showed only a small overlap indicating a generally narrow spectrum of these novel antimicrobial hits for mycobacteria. In conclusion, we carried out the first fragment-based whole cell screen against bacteria and identified a substantial number of hits with excellent physicochemical properties and dual activity against M. tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial pathogens.

40|$|SummaryThe {{coalescence}} of the HIV- 1 and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa has had {{a significant}} and negative impact on global health. The availability of effective antimicrobial treatment for both HIV- 1 (in the form of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART)) and TB (with antimycobacterial agents) has the potential to mitigate the associated morbidity and mortality. However, the use of both HAART and antimycobacterial therapy is associated with the development of inflammatory paradoxical syndromes after commencement of therapy. These include paradoxical reactions (PR) and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes (IRIS), conditions that complicate mycobacterial disease in HIV seronegative and seropositive individuals. Here, we discuss case definitions for PR and IRIS, and explore how advances in identifying the risk factors and immunopathogenesis of these conditions informs our understanding of their shared underlying pathogenesis. We propose that both PR and IRIS are characterized by the triggering of exaggerated inflammation in a setting of immunocompromise and antigen loading, via the reversal of immunosuppression by HAART and/or <b>antimycobacterials.</b> Further understanding of the molecular basis of this pathogenesis may pave the way for effective immunotherapies for the treatment of PR and IRIS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{spread of}} multi-drug {{resistant}} tuberculosis necessitates the discovery of new classes of antibacterials and compounds that inhibit macromolecules involved in these resistant mechanisms. Thirty ethanol extracts from nineteen selected plants from Zimbabwe were screened against Mycobacterium aurum and Corynebacterium glutamicum using the agar disk diffusion method. These two organisms were used as models for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The amount of ciprofloxacin accumulated and effluxed by the test organism {{was used to determine}} whether the plant extracts could also act as drug efflux pump inhibitors. Vernonia adoensis and Mangifera indica extracts at 500 mg/disk had the highest growth inhibitory activity against M. aurum and C. glutamicum respectively. The extract from Parinari curatellifolia had an MIC of 8 µg/ disk and an MBC of 63 µg/disk; an MIC of 125 µg/disk and an MBC of> 500 µg/disk against M. aurum and C. glutamicum respectively. All the plant extracts were bacteriostatic and showed antagonistic effects when combined with rifampicin. The extract from P. curatellifolia made M. aurum and C. glutamicum accumulate the highest amount of ciprofloxacin.

40|$|Objectives: Early {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that pamamycins, a group of macrodiolides first isolated from Streptomyces alboniger, have potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria but not against Gram-negative bacteria. The recent availability of highly purified and reasonable quantities of several pamamycins through their total syntheses has rendered possible more extensive studies on their effects on mycobacteria. Methods: Bioluminescent strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Mycobacterium smegmatis, expressing the luxA and luxB genes from Vibrio harveyi were used for the comparison of the antimycobacterial activity of the two synthetic macrodiolides pamamycin- 607 and pamamycin- 621 A and a non-naturally occurring cyclic dimer of pamamycin- 607, i. e. yukomycin. Results: Pamamycin- 607 was the most active of the three macrocycles and was more active against M. tuberculosis than against M. smegmatis. Twenty-five clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis were sus-ceptible to pamamycin- 607 in a narrow MIC range of 1. 5 – 2. 0 mg/L.

40|$|Obligately aerobic {{tubercle}} bacilli {{are capable}} of adapting to survive hypoxia by developing into a nonreplicating or dormant form. Dormant bacilli maintain viability for extended periods. Furthermore, they are resistant to <b>antimycobacterials,</b> and hence, dormancy might {{play a role in}} the persistence of tuberculosis infection despite prolonged chemotherapy. Previously, we have grown dormant Mycobacterium bovis BCG in an oxygen-limited Wayne culture system and subjected the bacilli to proteome analysis. This work revealed the upregulation of the response regulator Rv 3133 c and three other polypeptides (α-crystallin and two “conserved hypothetical” proteins) upon entry into dormancy. Here, we replaced the coding sequence of the response regulator with a kanamycin resistance cassette and demonstrated that the loss-of-function mutant died after oxygen starvation-induced termination of growth. Thus, the disruption of this dormancy-induced transcription factor resulted in loss of the ability of BCG to adapt to survival of hypoxia. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein extracts from the gene-disrupted strain showed that the genetic loss of the response regulator caused loss of the induction of the other three dormancy proteins. Thus, the upregulation of these dormancy proteins requires the response regulator. Based on these two functions, dormancy survival and regulation, we named the Rv 3133 c gene dosR for dormancy survival regulator. Our results provide conclusive evidence that DosR is a key regulator in the oxygen starvation-induced mycobacterial dormancy response...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the current}} antimycobacterial agents require some form of {{cellular}} activation unmasking reactive groups, which in turn will bind to their specific targets. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of activation of current <b>antimycobacterials</b> not only helps to decipher mechanisms of drug resistance but may also facilitate the development of alternative activation strategies or of analogues {{that do not require}} such processes. Herein, through the use of genetically defined strains of Mycobacterium bovis BCG we provide evidence that EthA, previously shown to activate ethionamide, also converts isoxyl (ISO) and thiacetazone (TAC) into reactive species. These results were further supported by the development of an in vitro assay using purified recombinant EthA, which allowed direct assessment of the metabolism of ISO. Interestingly, biochemical analysis of [(14) C]acetate-labeled cultures suggested that all of these EthA-activated drugs inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis via different mechanisms through binding to specific targets. This report is also the first description of the molecular mechanism of action of TAC, a thiosemicarbazone antimicrobial agent that is still used in the treatment of tuberculosis as a second-line drug in many developing countries. Altogether, the results suggest that EthA is a common activator of thiocarbamide-containing drugs. The broad specificity of EthA can now be used to improve the activation process of these drugs, which may help overcome the toxicity problems associated with clinical thiocarbamide use...|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the abilities of}} gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and sensitized murine lymph node lymphocytes to activate syngeneic murine peritoneal macrophages to inhibit the growth of intracellular Mycobacterium bovis BCG in vitro. IFN-gamma could activate <b>antimycobacterial</b> defense only when added to macrophage cultures prior to their infection with BCG. TNF-alpha was without any effect. In contrast, BCG-sensitized lymphocytes could induce <b>antimycobacterial</b> defenses when added after macrophages had been infected with BCG. The cell-mediated effect required direct contact between effector lymphocytes and the targets (BCG-infected macrophages), as revealed in studies in which these cell populations were separated by a semipermeable membrane. Cyclosporin A, which inhibits the production of relevant macrophage-activating lymphokines, did not abrogate the ability of sensitized lymphocytes to activate <b>antimycobacterial</b> effects in infected macrophages. Furthermore, only BCG-sensitized lymphocytes, and not Listeria-sensitized lymphocytes, could activate the <b>antimycobacterial</b> effects. These lymphocytes were not cytotoxic to the infected macrophages. The presence of anti-TNF-alpha antibody in cocultures reduced the antimicrobial effects. We propose that the activation of <b>antimycobacterial</b> defense in macrophages can occur by direct physical contact with sensitized lymphocytes. This process {{may be due to}} lymphocyte membrane-associated TNF-alpha, as we previously demonstrated in our studies of antileishmanial defense...|$|R
