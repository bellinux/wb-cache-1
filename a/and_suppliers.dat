5|$|From 1760 to 1761, Hancock {{lived in}} England while {{building}} relationships with customers <b>and</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Upon returning to Boston, Hancock gradually {{took over the}} House of Hancock as his uncle's health failed, becoming a full partner in January 1763. He {{became a member of}} the Masonic Lodge of St. Andrew in October 1762, which connected him with many of Boston's most influential citizens. When Thomas Hancock died in August 1764, John inherited the business, Hancock Manor, two or three household slaves, and thousands of acres of land, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies. The household slaves continued to work for John and his aunt, but were eventually freed through the terms of Thomas Hancock's will; there is no evidence that John Hancock ever bought or sold slaves.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{enterprise}} development <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development are two distinct concepts in the organisational and management literature, the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation {{refers to the}} {{enterprise development}} <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development as a single concept. As a result, many companies have a single policy, strategy and structural arrangements to manage enterprise development <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development programs <b>and</b> activities, thereby conflating the two concepts. Objectives: The aim of this conceptual article was to propose an implementation framework for enterprise <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development <b>and</b> to show the rationale of keeping enterprise development <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development as two distinct but related activities. Method: The conceptual article provided {{an overview of the}} policy context regarding enterprise development, followed by a discussion on enterprise development and its complexities. The article drew from the literature on <b>supplier</b> development <b>and</b> from the <b>supplier</b> adaptation, relational view, and learning and knowledge perspective theories in the development of its argument. Results: The article presented an implementation framework for enterprise <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development <b>and</b> then concluded with some recommendations and direction for future research. Conclusion: The implications of this research have great value for organisations as they prepare to implement Enterprise <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development (ESD) programmes. The proposed framework will also contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the ESD process and the link between enterprise development <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> development processes. </p...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 8746 This thesis {{provides}} an empirical investigation of how buyer <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> teams {{make sense of}} collaboration. Specifically, this thesis explores how buyer <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> parties interpret collaboration and how their interpretations of collaboration evolve over time. In addition, it considers the actions that accompany buyer <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> parties? interpretations of collaboration and how these actions link to interpretations. Taking a sensemaking making perspective, this thesis considers collaboration as an interpretative process. The forces which mediate the interpretations of collaboration in this buyer <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> context are also explored. Consistent with the interpretivist approach underpinning this thesis, a process approach is adopted, using a qualitative multiple case study design. A comparative cross-case analysis of four buyer <b>and</b> four <b>supplier</b> teams is undertaken to address the research questions in this study...|$|R
5|$|Prime {{contractor}} Lockheed Martin Aeronautics manufactured {{the majority}} of the airframe and performed final assembly at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia; program partner Boeing Defense, Space & Security provided additional airframe components as well as avionics integration and training systems. F-22 production was split up over many subcontractors across 46 states to increase Congressional support, though this production split may have contributed to increased costs and delays. Many capabilities were deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the initial cost but increasing total program cost. Production supported over 1,000 subcontractors <b>and</b> <b>suppliers</b> and up to 95,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|Resources {{and funds}} {{were needed to}} {{construct}} most memorials, particular larger monuments or building projects; sometimes professional services could be acquired for nothing, but normally designers, workmen <b>and</b> <b>suppliers</b> had to be paid. Different countries approached this problem in various ways, depending on local culture {{and the role of}} the state. Despite the special nature of the memorials, contractual arguments and issues over costs, timings and specifications were common, from smaller works in villages through to major works, such as the Vimy Memorial. The sheer volume of work encouraged industrial innovation: carving the inscriptions into the many thousands of British memorial stones had to originally be undertaken by hand, for example, until a Lancashire company invented an automated engraving process.|$|E
5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers <b>and</b> <b>suppliers</b> the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers <b>and</b> <b>suppliers</b> would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E
40|$|Product {{modularity}} {{is considered}} a crucial driver to reduce NPD time. However, though most studies agree that it can positively influence NPD time performance, quantitative studies {{on the effect of}} product modularity on NPD time are really scant. Moreover literature suggests that product modularity is usually adopted together with other NPD practices, especially the interfunctional integration <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> involvement in NPD process. This paper analyzes the impact of product modularity, interfunctional integration <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> involvement on NPD time performance, and the moderating effects on product modularity-time performance relationship of interfunctional integration <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> involvement. Data from a sample of 266 manufacturing firms settled in several countries around the world demonstrates that product modularity <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> involvement have a direct positive effect on NPD time, and that interfunctional integration positively moderates the product modularity-time performance relationship. This implies that managers can lever product modularity <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> involvement to cut NPD time; and that should launch an appropriate mix of interventions on interfunctional integration and product modularity to maximize NPD time performance, rather than investing and focusing on product modularity only...|$|R

5|$|The {{value of}} all {{consumer}} goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion). The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers <b>and</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

The location on the harbor and along the James River facilitates a large boating industry which {{can take advantage of}} its many miles of waterfront. Newport News also serves as a junction between the rails and the sea with the Newport News Marine Terminals located at the East End of the city. Served by major east-west Interstate Highway 64, it is linked to others of the cities of Hampton Roads by the circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway, which crosses the harbor on two bridge-tunnels. Part of the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport is in the city limits.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors <b>and</b> <b>suppliers</b> as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E

40|$|Supply {{chain is}} {{required}} {{to be able to}} produce various different products and deliver to market in an acceptable speed and cost in order to be competitive in the marketplace. As the basis of competition expands to the supply chain and time also becomes increasingly important, flexibility of the supply chain has become a critical issue (Duclos, Vokurka, and Lummus, 2003). Thus, {{the purposes of this study}} are to determine the mediating effect of supply network <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> flexibility on the relationship between supply management <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> performance. This research is based on a quantitative approach using a self-administered questionnaire which was conducted at 79 participating supermarkets. Additionally, a causal research is undertaken to identify the relationship between supply management <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> performance <b>and</b> the effect of supply network <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> flexibility on this relationship. This study focused on the supermarkets in Klang Valleysâ€™ supply chain setting and the data gathered were then analyzed using statistical tests such as reliability test and multiple regression analysis. The assumption that supply network <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> flexibility mediates the relationship between supply management <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> performance was proven by mediating analysis using Baron and Kenny approach. The findings also revealed that supply management predicts supplier performance. On the other hand, supply management which consists of supplier selection (p =. 136), supplier development (p =. 222) <b>and</b> strategic <b>supplier</b> alliances (p =. 816) did not predict supply network <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> flexibility. Therefore, this study perhaps can assist the management of supermarkets in Malaysia to gain awareness about the importance of practicing good supply management to ensure that they can help their suppliers to have more integrity and flexibility in supplying food products which later on can increase the performance of these suppliers...|$|R

5|$|In 1901, trader Ebenezer Barnette sailed up Alaska's Tanana River {{in hopes}} of {{establishing}} a trading post on the trail connecting the coastal town of Valdez with the gold-mining community of Eagle. Due to low water, however, the steamboat Barnette chartered was unable to continue up the river. Discouraged, Barnette deposited his cache of goods on a riverbank of the Chena River and sailed downstream {{with the intent of}} making another attempt to sail up the river during the following year. In 1902, miner Felix Pedro struck gold at a spot about 15 miles north of the spot where Barnette left his supplies. Seeing an opportunity, Barnette decided to establish a trading post at the spot. Other miners <b>and</b> <b>suppliers</b> arrived, attracted by the gold, and Barnette named the settlement Fairbanks, after Indiana Senator and later Vice President of the United States Charles W. Fairbanks.|$|E
