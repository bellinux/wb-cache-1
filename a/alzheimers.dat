40|$|A 'frontal {{variant of}} <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease' has been {{described}} in patients with predominant behavioural or dysexecutive deficits caused by <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease pathology. The description of this rare <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease phenotype has been limited to case reports and small series, and many clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological characteristics are not well understood. In this retrospective study, we included 55 patients with <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease with a behavioural-predominant presentation (behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease) and a neuropathological diagnosis of high-likelihood <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease (n = 17) and/or biomarker evidence of <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease pathology (n = 44). In addition, we included 29 patients with autopsy/biomarker-defined <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease with a dysexecutive-predominant syndrome (dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease). We performed structured chart reviews to ascertain clinical features. First symptoms were more often cognitive (behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 53 %; dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 83 %) than behavioural (behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 25 %; dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 3 %). Apathy {{was the most common}} behavioural feature, while hyperorality and perseverative/compulsive behaviours were less prevalent. Fifty-two per cent of patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease met diagnostic criteria for possible behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia. Overlap between behavioural and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease was modest (9 / 75 patients). Sixty per cent of patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and 40 % of those with the dysexecutive syndrome carried at least one APOE ε 4 allele. We also compared neuropsychological test performance and brain atrophy (applying voxel-based morphometry) with matched autopsy/biomarker-defined typical (amnestic-predominant) <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease (typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, n = 58), autopsy-confirmed/Alzheimer's disease biomarker-negative behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 59), and controls (n = 61). Patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease showed worse memory scores than behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and did not differ from typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, while executive function composite scores were lower compared to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease. Voxel-wise contrasts between behavioural and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease patients and controls revealed marked atrophy in bilateral temporoparietal regions and only limited atrophy in the frontal cortex. In direct comparison with behavioural and those with dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia showed more frontal atrophy and less posterior involvement, whereas patients with typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease were slightly more affected posteriorly and showed less frontal atrophy (P < 0. 001 uncorrected). Among 24 autopsied behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease/dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease patients, only two had primary co-morbid FTD-spectrum pathology (progressive supranuclear palsy). In conclusion, behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease presentations are characterized by a milder and more restricted behavioural profile than in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, co-occurrence of memory dysfunction and high APOE ε 4 prevalence. Dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease presented as a primarily cognitive phenotype with minimal behavioural abnormalities and intermediate APOE ε 4 prevalence. Both behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease presentations are distinguished by temporoparietal-predominant atrophy. Based on the relative sparing of frontal grey matter, we propose to redefine these clinical syndromes as 'the behavioural/dysexecutive variant of <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease' rather than frontal variant <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease. Further work is needed to determine whether behavioural and dysexecutive-predominant presentations of <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease represent distinct phenotypes or a single continuum...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—A genetic {{association}} between the presenilin 1 (PS- 1) intronic polymorphism and sporadic <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease has {{been a matter of}} controversy. Recent findings have suggested that the PS- 1 polymorphism is not associated with <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease or amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposition in brains from patients with <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease.  OBJECTIVES—To elucidate the influence of the PS- 1 polymorphism on <b>Alzheimer</b> type neuropathological changes and the development of <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, the relation between the PS- 1 polymorphism and quantitative severity of <b>Alzheimer</b> type neuropathological changes in the brains from patients with <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and non-demented subjects was studied.  METHODS—The PS- 1 and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypes, were examined, together with the densities of the senile plaques, senile plaques with dystrophic neurites, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains from 36 postmortem confirmed patients with sporadic <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and 86 non-demented subjects. Association of the PS- 1 polymorphism with sporadic <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and ages at onset and duration of illness in <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease was also examined.  RESULTS—The PS- 1 polymorphism was not associated with the senile plaques, senile plaques with dystrophic neurites, or neurofibrillary tangles in <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease or non-demented subjects. There was no association of the PS- 1 intronic polymorphism with <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, ages at onset, or durations of illness in <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease. The results remained non-significant even when the PS- 1 genotype groups were divided into the subgroups withdifferent ApoE ε 4 status.  CONCLUSIONS—The PS- 1 intronic polymorphism does not itself have a direct causal role in the formation of <b>Alzheimer</b> type neuropathological changes or in the development of sporadic <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease. ...|$|R

25|$|For {{any given}} level of {{clinical}} impairment, {{there is a}} higher degree of neuropathological change in the brains of those Alzheimer's disease sufferers who are involved in greater number of activities. This is true even when education and IQ are controlled for. This suggests that differences in lifestyle may increase cognitive reserve by making the individual more resilient. Mortimer et al. performed cognitive testing on a population of 678 nuns in 1997, in which they showed that different levels of cognitive activity and performance were possible in patients diagnosed with <b>Alzheimers.</b> One subject showing reduced neocortical plaques survived with mild deficits, despite (or due to) low brain weight.|$|E
25|$|Caspase {{deficiency}} {{has been}} identified as a cause of tumour development. Tumour growth can occur by a combination of factors, including a mutation in a cell cycle gene which removes the restraints on cell growth, combined with mutations in apoptopic proteins such as Caspases that would respond by inducing cell death in abnormally growing cells. Conversely, over-activation of some caspases such as caspase-3 can lead to excessive programmed cell death. This is seen in several neurodegenerative diseases where neural cells are lost, such as <b>Alzheimers</b> disease. Caspases involved with processing inflammatory signals are also implicated in disease. Insufficient activation of these caspases can increase an organism's susceptibility to infection, as an appropriate immune response may not be activated. The integral role caspases play in cell death and disease has led to research on using caspases as a drug target. For example, inflammatory caspase-1 has been implicated in causing autoimmune diseases; drugs blocking the activation of Caspase-1 have been used to improve the health of patients. Additionally, scientists have used caspases as cancer therapy to kill unwanted cells in tumours.|$|E
