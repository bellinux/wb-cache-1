5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces {{to be removed}} from Gravesend Blockhouse and taken to the Tower of London, although the historian Victor Smith casts doubt on whether this was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> In 1588, however, there was a renewed threat of invasion, this time from Spain; the Spanish Armada sailed from A Coruña, while a separate invasion force was prepared in Flanders, threatening London; Rober Dudley, the Earl of Leicester was put in charge of the defences along the Thames.|$|E
5|$|William was {{promptly}} excommunicated and Henry {{moved quickly to}} suppress the revolt. The barons in the north were ordered to besiege William's castles, including Skipsea, and William shortly surrendered himself to the King and was ultimately pardoned. Following the rebellion, Henry ordered Skipsea Castle to be destroyed, although it is uncertain to what extent this order was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> William passed on the castle to his own son, another William, but {{on the death of}} his son's widow, Isabella, it passed to the Crown in 1293.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} importance of south-east England declined after peace was declared with France in 1558. Military attention instead shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west of the country; tensions grew and war finally broke out in 1569. The new threat led to improvements being made to Pendennis and St Mawes castles in Cornwall, and repairs to Calshot, Camber and Portland along the south coast. In 1588 the Spanish armada sailed for England and the Device Forts were mobilised in response. As part of this work, West Tilbury was brought back into service and supported by a hastily raised army, which was visited by Queen Elizabeth I, and further enlargement followed {{under the direction of}} the Italian engineer, Federigo Giambelli. Gravesend was improved and several of the Essex fortifications were temporarily brought back into use; there were discussions about enhancing the defences at Hull and Milford Haven, but no work was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{very first}} Commando raid– Operation Collar on 23 June 1940– was not <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by a Commando unit, but {{by one of}} their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an {{offensive}} reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey {{on the night of}} 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water so deep that it came over their heads. Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings. When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore, and they were forced to swim out to sea to be picked up.|$|E

25|$|The {{fishing was}} <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in small boats, {{carrying}} {{only two or}} three fishermen. Many of these small boats would be lost in the fog and never returned to the ship. As technology evolved, the three-mast boats disappeared, giving way to steamers, then to diesel-engined vessels. These days, only a small fishing fleet survives, restricted to fishing around coastal waters. In the harbour, pleasure-boats have taken the place of all but a few fishing-boats.|$|E
25|$|The Tramways Committee also formalised the {{stopping}} {{places for}} the tramcars, and {{negotiated with the}} Corporation Lighting Committee to have the lampposts at tramstops painted in a distinctive colour with a different coloured glass in the lantern.

The tramstops on Arkwright Street were determined to be Crocus Street, Cromford Street, Kirkwhite Street, Atlas Street, Glebe Street, Ryehill Street and Lamcote Street. Crocus Street and Lamcote Street were request stops only.|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{discussions of}} Unit 731's {{activity}} {{began in the}} 1950s, {{after the end of}} the American occupation of Japan. In 1952, human experiments carried out in Nagoya City Pediatric Hospital, which resulted in one death, were publicly tied to former members of Unit 731. Later in that decade, journalists suspected that the murders attributed by the government to Sadamichi Hirasawa were <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by members of Unit 731. In 1958, Japanese author Shūsaku Endō published the book The Sea and Poison about human experimentation, which is thought to have been based on a real incident.|$|E
25|$|The {{air intake}} {{was in the}} unusual dorsal {{location}} as the Air Force had required the carriage of an underbelly semi-conformal nuclear weapon. Some sources claim that the original chin intake caused a shock wave that interfered in launching this weapon, but no such testing was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> The implications this design choice had for the survivability of the pilot during ejection were troubling. The intake also severely limited rear visibility. Nonetheless this was not considered terribly important for a tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, and furthermore it was assumed {{at the time that}} air combat would be via guided missile exchanges outside visual range.|$|E
25|$|In June, {{four people}} {{were charged with}} premeditated murder or {{complicity}} in to premeditated murder: Anne Orderud Paust's brother Per Kristian Orderud (b. 1954), his wife Veronica Orderud (b. 1972), Veronica Orderud's half sister Kristin Kirkemo (later Kristin Kirkemo Haukeland (b. 1973)) and her former partner Lars Grønnerød (b. 1958). The motive for the killings were according to the prosecution a conflict of ownership of the Orderud estate and farm. Marie and Kristian Orderud were registered as {{the owners of the}} farm even though their son for years had operated it and wanted to take it over. Prosecutors believed that all four were involved in the murder, but neither the investigation nor the subsequent trials gave answers to who <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> the brutal killings.|$|E

25|$|Surrounded by the Abbasids {{and other}} hostile powers {{and low in}} numbers, Hassan-Al Sabbah devised a way to attack the Ismāʿīlī's enemies with minimal losses. Using the method of assassination, he ordered the murders of Sunni {{scholars}} and politicians who he felt threatened the Ismāʿīlīs. Knives and daggers were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would {{be placed on the}} pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message to mean that he was marked for death. When an assassination was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> the Hashasheen {{would not be allowed to}} run away; instead, to strike further fear into the enemy, they would stand near the victim without showing any emotion and departed only when the body was discovered. This further increased the ruthless reputation of the Hashasheen throughout Sunni-controlled lands.|$|E
25|$|From 1959 to 1966 Cuban insurgents {{fought a}} six-year {{rebellion}} in the Escambray Mountains against the Castro government. The government's vastly superior numbers eventually crushed the insurgency. The rebellion lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the Cuban Revolution. The U.S. State Department {{has estimated that}} 3,200 people were executed from 1959 to 1962. According to Amnesty International, death sentences from 1959–87 numbered 237 of which all but 21 were <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> Other estimates for {{the total number of}} political executions range from 4,000 to 33,000. The vast majority of those executed following the 1959 revolution were policemen, politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the Cuban population.|$|E
25|$|Prejudice against {{hydraulic}} transmission {{in the higher}} echelons of BR's engineering divisions decreed in 1967 that all the WR's diesel-hydraulics were non-standard and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Added to this were practical problems modernising the D800s: because of the scaled-down bodyshell {{there was very little}} room inside for extra equipment. It was, for example, physically impossible to accommodate a compressor as well as an exhauster, so the locomotives were unable to haul newer designs of air-braked coaching stock. It also proved impractical to equip them with electric train heating (ETH) equipment, for similar reasons, so they retained unreliable steam heat boilers to the end of their lives. It was intended to equip no. D870 with ETH; to provide the necessary additional power, the engines would have been uprated by the fitment of charge-air coolers. No work was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> other than the fitment of appropriate jumper cables on the locomotive ends.|$|E

25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Previously to this, in 1859, a {{committee}} {{had been appointed}} {{to report on the}} internal condition and fittings of the Chapel. Whether disrepair or the aversion of the Gothic Revivalists to the old Georgian fittings prompted this movement is not apparent, but Buckler's report would suggest that his leanings are certainly in the direction of reform, though he does not advise any very drastic change. The walls and roof were to be painted the same colour, the panels of the roof painted brilliant blue, the edges of the ribs to be gilded, and the sides coloured vermilion. One bay, over the altar, was to be coloured in this manner, as a trial. The marble screen at the east end was to be re-polished and re-gilded. The altar dais and steps and also the rest of the Chapel floor was to be paved with Minton's tiles, using for the latter as much of the black and white marble as remained, and the panelling to be darkened and varnished. The Portland stone paving of the ante-chapel was to be renewed, leaving the gravestones, and the platform on which the eagle stood altered. The ante-Chapel must have been then seated throughout, as it was proposed to remove the seats, leaving only the seat along the wall at the south end. A new altar was also suggested, and new furniture and gas standards. How much of this proposed work was <b>actually</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> is unclear.|$|E
