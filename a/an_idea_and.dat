5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E

25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent. The {{evidence}} points to manslaughter at best and murder at worst. Mrs Rice suddenly has <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> wonders if the hotel management and foreign police are open to bribery. Harold agrees {{to give it a}} try and wires for money but aside from that, and unable to speak the local language, leaves Mrs Rice to carry out the negotiations. All seems to go well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people.|$|E

They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{was less}} enthusiastic; {{he felt that}} the script could have been better and said that the film [...] "feels like it's going to be terrific", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also said that Tarantino [...] "has <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> <b>and</b> trusts the idea to drive the plot." [...] Ebert gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four and said that while he enjoyed it and that it was a very good film from a talented director, [...] "I liked what I saw, but I wanted more." [...] Ebert's biggest praise was the acting in the film.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{begins this}} track with a spoken intro where he {{describes}} the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: [...] "most of the songs that are written uptown in Tin Pan Alley, that's {{where most of the}} folk songs come from nowadays". What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as [...] "a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of like walking by a side street. You gaze in and walk on." [...] Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, absurdist humor into more complex songs, such as [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] (1964).|$|E

[...] Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, [...] "CGI for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in my stomach. It's just action." ...|$|E

500|$|Mirkin {{said that}} he [...] "brought [...] back to a more story-oriented" [...] {{approach}} and increased the character and emotion focus, while [...] "at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird". During his tenure, Mirkin moved the show's focus towards Homer, and developed some of the secondary characters, such as Apu. He also strongly opposed censorship and network interference. Mirkin's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show's fans, but the writing staff were divided on his style of humor, which saw the show move away from more [...] "realistic" [...] emotional and character based stories to [...] "pure comedy" [...] and [...] "surreal" [...] humor. The episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] was controversial when the episode was in production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] of <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> Groening felt that the idea was so big that it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. She reached out to me and said she had <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.' It sounded like something totally different than what had been on TV." ...|$|E

According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> then asking science consultants to [...] "justify it scientifically." [...] For [...] "Power Hungry", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, [...] "And through kneading that idea over and over again, we {{came up with the idea}} of a character, Joseph, who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices." [...] New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. [...] "It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads," [...] he said. [...] "And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'"? ...|$|E

In mid-July 2010, music {{magazine}} Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed. Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund, who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt. 1. Unlike the first installment, Body Talk Pt. 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund, such as Diplo, Kleerup, Niggaracci and electronic duo Savage Skulls. She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song [...] "U Should Know Better". The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single [...] "Sexual Eruption" [...] (2007). Six months later, they met up once again to write and record [...] "U Should Know Better."

I had <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> he really got it and got into it, which was awesome." [...] She also worked with Savage Skulls on two {{songs on the}} album; [...] "Love Kills" [...] and the iTunes exclusive [...] "Bad Gal".

500|$|The {{time machine}} gets {{destroyed}} {{so the two}} Candaces go to the backyard to convince the boys to fix the current time machine in the museum and take them back, creating a paradox and as a result, the Candace from the bleak future(wearing a white lab coat {{as seen in the}} picture above) ceases to exist. The boys then fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a bonus. The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace [...] "finally" [...] busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry at the boys, saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore). As Candace and the boys talk to the future Linda, Isabella sparks <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> travels back in time. After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that she had finally (but not technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change their minds about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop). In [...] "Summer Belongs To You", Phineas mentions time traveling twice and Isabella comments that Phineas has traveled through time [...] "twice", but because of the events in the credits of Quantum Boogaloo, no-one - including Isabella [...] should actually know about the time-traveling.|$|E
