40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect ICWSs on drivers’ behavior, in response to a potential conflict event at the intersections; in this case, a violator vehicle from right and left that failed to stop represented the potential conflict. The ICWSs were <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> message and visual <b>warning.</b> Both the <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> message and the visual warning provided to the driver the direction of the violator vehicle. Drivers’ reaction times were modeled following the survival analysis, by the use of the accelerated failure time (AFT) duration model with a Weibull distribution. The applied model identified one significant variable influencing the reaction time (Vi driver’s initial speed value) and the warning signal condition; the direction of the violator vehicle did not affect significantly the reaction time of drivers. For the condition of <b>audio</b> message <b>warning</b> and visual warning, the reaction time was 43. 1 % and 34. 5 % shorter than that for the baseline condition, respectively. In addition, the drivers’ reaction time for the <b>audio</b> message <b>warning</b> was 22 % shorter than that for the visual warning (statistically significant) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{operation}} of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents several hazardous situations for both ground personnel and vehicles. Collisions between the UAV {{and other objects}} can have very negative consequences resulting in potentially high costs as well as injuries or even death of human personnel. When we were approached by Northrop Grumman, they were searching {{for a way to}} mitigate these limitations by providing increased situational awareness in the region surrounding their UAV while it was in transit on the ground. After weighing the variety of options available to us we settled on the use of computer vision as our solution because it provided the greatest potential for success with our limited budget. Computer vision works by taking images received from simple digital cameras and processing them to provide the localization information we need. Through our efforts {{we have been able to}} design and build a scalable system that can isolate objects and generate both visual and <b>audio</b> <b>warnings</b> when other objects approach too close. The completed system offers an overhead display of the airfield, live video of the scene, scalable network architecture, and clear <b>audio</b> <b>warnings...</b>|$|R

50|$|Many {{other aspects}} of the new line drew complaints. The {{frequent}} use of <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> devices by train operators caused friction between nearby residents and elected officials {{on the one hand and}} the SNCF on the other.

Safety policies have since changed and the devices’ use is now limited to when there is immediate danger.|$|R

One of the aircraft's wings collided with the summit of Mont San-Pietro and broke off.

40|$|Speeding {{is a major}} {{contributing}} factor to traffic crashes and frequently happens in areas {{where there is a}} mutation in speed limits, such as the transition zones that connect urban areas from rural areas. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of an in-vehicle <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> system and lit speed limit sign on preventing drivers’ speeding behavior in transition zones. A high-fidelity driving simulator was used to establish a roadway network with the transition zone. A total of 41 participants were recruited for this experiment, and the driving speed performance data were collected from the simulator. The experimental results display that the implementation of the <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> system could significantly reduce drivers’ operating speed before they entered the urban area, while the lit speed limit sign had a minimal effect on improving the drivers’ speed control performance. Without consideration of different types of speed limit signs, it is found that male drivers generally had a higher operating speed both upstream and in the transition zones and have a larger maximum deceleration for speed reduction than female drivers. Moreover, the drivers who had medium-level driving experience had the higher operating speed and were more likely to have speeding behaviors in the transition zones than those who had low-level and high-level driving experience in the transition zones...|$|R
50|$|In 2004: Honda {{introduced}} first worldwide {{system with}} pedestrian detection on redesigned Honda Legend: Intelligent Night Vision. It detected far infrared radiation. The pedestrian detection feature alerted the driver with an <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> and visually enclosed the pedestrian {{in a box}} on the display which was presented via head-up display. The night vision system uses a separate heads up type display projected on the center bottom of the windshield. The infrared cameras do not require a light source, and the software is able to detect human like figures, surround the image with a red box and give audible caution tones.|$|R

30|$|This {{system is}} {{particularly}} perceived as having benefits for inattentive drivers, whether due to sleepiness or distractions. It {{is useful for}} drivers who may be tired or are momentarily inattentive. It could save their life if they miss the stop sign (male, 43). A female participant (42) reported that this additional <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> is harder to ignore even if your eyes are heavy. It was perceived as very useful if integrated within the car: This may help some people, especially if there are other distractions in the car. This should be built into the radio in the car so it temporarily mutes the music {{to make it very}} obvious (male, 35).|$|R
50|$|Autopilot alerts {{the driver}} under various circumstances, {{such as a}} {{surprising}} situation on the road or excessive inattention by the driver. If the driver dismisses three <b>audio</b> <b>warnings</b> within an hour, Autopilot is disabled until the car is parked. This is to prevent experienced drivers from excessive reliance on built-in safety features. At speeds under 8 mph on divided highways, Autopilot functions indefinitely without the driver's hands on the wheel. Under 45 mph free hands are allowed for five minutes, unless the car detects lateral acceleration. Above 45 mph free hands is allowed for three minutes if following another vehicle or one minute without following a car.|$|R

The system is a software prototype of this system in vehicles, where images that are captured will be processed using image processing techniques and accordingly issue warning. The overall goal of the system is to reduce the number of accidents, and therefore improve the worsening road conditions...|$|R

30|$|It is {{impracticable}} {{to upgrade}} the 18, 900 Australian passive crossings as such crossings are often located in remote areas, where power is lacking and with low road and rail traffic. The rail industry is interested in developing innovative in-vehicle technology interventions to warn motorists of approaching trains directly in their vehicles. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to evaluate the benefits of the introduction of such technology. We evaluated the changes in driver performance once the technology is enabled and functioning correctly, as well as the effects of an unsafe failure of the technology? We conducted a driving simulator study where participants (N =  15) were familiarised with an in-vehicle <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> for an extended period. After being familiarised with the system, the technology started failing, and we tested the reaction of drivers with a train approaching. This study has shown that with the traditional passive crossings with RX 2 signage, the majority of drivers complied (70  %) and looked for trains {{on both sides of the}} rail track. With the introduction of the in-vehicle audio message, drivers did not approach crossings faster, did not reduce their safety margins and did not reduce their gaze towards the rail tracks. However, participants’ compliance at the stop sign decreased by 16.5  % with the technology installed in the vehicle. The effect of the failure of the in-vehicle <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> technology showed that most participants did not experience difficulties in detecting the approaching train even though they did not receive any warning message. This showed that participants were still actively looking for trains with the system in their vehicle. However, two participants did not stop and one decided to beat the train when they did not receive the audio message, suggesting potential human factors issues to be considered with such technology.|$|R
