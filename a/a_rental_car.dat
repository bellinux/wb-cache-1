5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for <b>a</b> <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Texas, Applewhite {{attended}} several universities and, {{as a young}} man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as {{the chair of the}} music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return <b>a</b> <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Tri-Rail {{service was}} nearly cut drastically, {{with the threat}} of being shut down {{altogether}} by 2011, even as ridership was at a record high, as Palm Beach County withheld its funding of the system and looked to cut its funding from $4.1million to $1.6million per year. This would mean that Broward and Miami-Dade counties would also have had to cut their support to $1.6million each to match. The state, which was also running a budget shortfall and did not pass <b>a</b> <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> tax increase to help fund Tri-Rail, would have had to cut its support as well. This would have caused an immediate cut from 50 to 30 daily trains and a complete cutting weekend service, followed by additional cuts and possible shut down two years later. Schedules were decreased slightly, but service was never cut altogether, as dedicated federal funding was attained through the $2.5million grant as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.|$|E

500|$|In 1948, Doby {{experienced}} {{his first}} spring training with the Indians in Tucson, Arizona. Unlike their white teammates, Doby, along with Satchel Paige and Minnie Miñoso, were {{not permitted to}} stay at the nearby Santa Rita hotel but instead stayed with a local black family and used <b>a</b> <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> provided by the Indians for transportation. During spring training, Doby read books concerning outfield play, and received instruction and encouragement from former Indians manager Tris Speaker and Indians' farm system director Hank Greenberg. Doby also credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him adjust to the majors and learning the outfield. In an exhibition game in Houston against the New York Giants, Doby hit a home run that [...] "may have traveled 500 feet before landing far beyond the fence in center field." [...] As Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, [...] "With that home run, all doubts that Doby would make the 1948 Cleveland team vanished. That year, he played in 121 games and hit [...]301 for the season with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs. Throughout the regular season Doby was racially abused by opposing teams, and Veeck asked AL president Will Harridge for support in getting players to rein in their animosity towards Doby.|$|E

2500|$|Clyde {{was first}} arrested in late 1926, after running when police confronted him over <b>a</b> <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> {{he had failed}} to return on time. His second arrest, with brother Buck, came soon after, this time for {{possession}} of stolen goods (turkeys). Despite having legitimate jobs during the period 1927 through 1929, he also cracked safes, robbed stores, and stole cars. After sequential arrests in 1928 and 1929, he was sent to Eastham Prison Farm in April 1930. While in prison, Barrow used a lead pipe to crush the skull of another inmate who had sexually assaulted him repeatedly. This was Clyde Barrow's first killing, though another inmate already serving a life sentence took the blame. Barrow convinced another inmate to use an axe to chop off two of Barrow's toes to avoid hard labor in the fields; he would walk with a limp {{for the rest of his}} life as a result.

2500|$|The Woodland Cemetery Foundation {{completed}} {{a major effort}} to recognize African American veterans at Woodland Cemetery in 2012. [...] Cemetery records showed that about 1,400 Civil War veterans were buried at Woodland. Of these, 86 were African Americans. Yet roughly half of these black Civil War veteran graves lacked a headstone. On Memorial Day, the foundation hosted ceremonies to honor those who served {{in what was then}} known as the United States Colored Troops. The foundation also began assembling the paperwork to document the military service of these African Americans, so that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs would supply them with a free headstone. In mid-June 2011, the Woodland Cemetery Foundation announced that it had partnered with the Johns-Carabelli Company, a local funerary monument maker, to build a $5,000 ($ in [...] dollars) monument to all U.S. Colored Troops buried at Woodland Cemetery. The memorial was dedicated in June 2012. Its final cost had risen to $6,000 ($ in [...] dollars).
