5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E
25|$|In 1944 Lex Luthor was {{the first}} {{character}} in a comic book (and {{one of the first}} in fiction) to use an atomic bomb. The United States Department of War <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> story line be delayed from publication, which it was until 1946, to protect the secrecy of the Manhattan Project. The War Department later asked for dailies of the Superman comic strip to be pulled in April 1945 which depicted Lex Luthor bombarding Superman with the radiation from a cyclotron.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his high}} profile, Furtwängler's public {{opposition}} prompted a mixed reaction from the Nazi leadership. Heinrich Himmler wished to send Furtwängler to a concentration camp. Goebbels and Göring ordered their administration to listen to Furtwängler's requests and {{to give him the}} impression that they would do what he <b>asked.</b> <b>This</b> led him to believe that he had some positive influence to stop the racial policy. He subsequently invited several Jewish and anti-fascist artists (such as Yehudi Menuhin, Artur Schnabel, and Pablo Casals) to perform as soloists in his 1933/34 season, but they refused to come to Nazi Germany. Furtwängler subsequently invited Jewish musicians from his orchestra such as Szymon Goldberg to play as soloists.|$|E

25|$|The {{supporters}} of Caesar argued that Caesar deserved {{an extension of}} his command so that the fruit of his success would not be lost. There was a debate on this. Pompey showed goodwill towards Caesar. He claimed that he had letters from Caesar {{in which he said}} he wanted to be relieved of his command, but he said that he thought that he should be allowed to stand for the consulship in absentia. Cato opposed this and said that if Caesar wanted this he had to lay down his arms and become a private citizen. Pompey did not contest Cato's view. This gave rise to suspicions about his real feelings towards Caesar. Plutarch wrote that Pompey also asked Caesar for the troops he had lent him back, using the Parthian war as a pretext. Although Caesar knew why Pompey <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> he sent the troops back home with generous gifts. Appian wrote that Caesar gave these soldiers a donation and also sent one of his legions to Rome. Pompey was drifting toward the optimates and away from Caesar. According to Plutarch the rift between Pompey and Cato became accentuated when Pompey fell seriously ill in Naples in 50 BC. When he recovered the people of Naples offered thanksgiving sacrifices. This celebration spread throughout Italy. He was feted in towns he travelled to on his way back to Rome. Plutarch wrote that this was said ‘to have done more than anything else to bring about the subsequent civil war’. It made Pompey arrogant, incautious and contemptuous of Caesar’s power. The following year the two men were fighting each other in the Great Roman Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Jason {{has been}} {{referenced}} or parodied in other films. In the film Scream, directed by Freddy Krueger creator Wes Craven, actress Drew Barrymore's character is being stalked by a killer who calls {{her on her}} home phone. In order to survive, she must answer the man's trivia questions. One question is [...] "name the killer in Friday the 13th." [...] She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the killer for the film series until Part 2. Writer Kevin Williamson claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> question in a bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He received a free drink, because nobody got the answer right. In another Wes Craven film, Cursed, a wax sculpture of Jason, from Jason Goes to Hell, {{can be seen in}} a wax museum. [...] In 2014, Jason made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial [...] "The '80s Called".|$|E
500|$|Two more {{issues are}} {{addressed}} in the Sunday Herald article, {{but not in the}} Daily Mail article. The first is of the knots used to tie up Carol's body [...] the knots on Carol's body were mostly granny knots, of which {{there was no evidence that}} Gordon ever used [...] indeed during the trial he was specifically <b>asked</b> <b>this,</b> and he responded, [...] "I do not use granny knots". The granny knot is always a mistake, used by someone who should have used a reef knot; those learning knot-tying frequently make this mistake. Gordon Park, an experienced knot-tyer, would likely never use a granny knot, and their frequent appearance on the body of Carol is strong evidence that it was not Gordon who tied them. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area. The other piece of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two basic}} types of [...] "do not know" [...] decisions. First is a slow, low {{confidence}} decision. This occurs when a person has some knowledge relevant to the question <b>asked.</b> <b>This</b> knowledge is located and evaluated {{to determine whether the}} question can be answered based on what is stored in memory. In this case, the relevant knowledge is not enough to answer the question. Second, when a person has zero knowledge relevant to a question asked, he or she is able to produce a rapid response of not knowing. This occurs because the initial search for information draws a blank and the search stops, thus producing a faster response.|$|E
2500|$|The rise {{of music}} that is totally without social {{commitment}} also increases the separation between composer and public, and represents still another form of departure from tradition. The cynicism with which this particular departure {{seems to have been}} made is perfectly symbolized in John Cage's account of a public lecture he had given: [...] "Later, during the question period, I gave one of six previously prepared answers regardless of the question <b>asked.</b> <b>This</b> was a reflection of my engagement in Zen." [...] While Mr. Cage's famous silent piece , or his Landscapes for a dozen radio receivers may be of little interest as music, they are of enormous importance historically as representing the complete abdication of the artist's power.|$|E
