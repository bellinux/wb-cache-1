500|$|Issue #1 {{received}} an average score of 7.3/10 based on 26 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR gave it four stars writing, [...] "Overall, Civil War II #1 {{is a good}} launching point for this miniseries, even as it integrates the information from Civil War II #0 and the Free Comic Book Day special. I'm curious to see if Bendis and Marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they'll add into the mix to keep the conflict burning strong. For now, though, it's {{more than enough to}} get readers coming back for more." [...] Schedeen gave it a 7.1 saying, [...] "This first issue cleanly establishes the conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork. However, it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with the basics of this crossover, and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in the way the first issue of Civil War did ten years ago." [...] Richard Gray of Newsarama gave it a 7 and said, [...] "At this early stage, Civil War II suffers {{some of the problems that}} have beleaguered similar narratives in recent years, principally in seeing heroes all too quick to take sides against comrades on a possible future. Yet this is also just the beginning of something much larger, and while it may seem <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is an extended version of the 'zero' issue that preceded it, all the pieces are now in place for the 'war' proper to commence." ...|$|E

But, after thinking over the matter, she changed her mind, and concluded that <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> we should all be pleasant and good-natured towards one another; so she sat down and wrote a letter to Miss Calthea, which she sent to the expectant bride that very afternoon.

I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable. It did {{seem to me that}} I'd never get over it if they went out before I had a dress with them. I'd never have felt quite satisfied, you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel that I ought {{to be a very good}} girl indeed. It's <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> I'm sorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future.
