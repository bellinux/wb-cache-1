By early July, his foot was fully healed, he had gained weight, and Sherman was pleased enough with his recovery that he brought the colt back to Los Alamitos to resume training on July 17, two weeks earlier than anticipated.|$|E

5|$|During the {{national}} player career of forward Paul Van Himst, the most-praised Belgian footballer of the 20th century, Belgium took third place at Euro 1972. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> experienced two golden ages with many gifted players. In the first period, which lasted from the 1980s {{to the early}} 1990s, the team finished as runners-up at Euro 1980 and fourth in the 1986 World Cup. In the second, under guidance of Marc Wilmots in the 2010s, Belgium topped the FIFA World Rankings {{for the first time}} in November 2015. Belgium qualified for the next World Cup, in 2018, and will thereafter participate in League A of the first UEFA Nations League edition.|$|E
5|$|March 1957. Guevara {{deals with}} {{debilitating}} bouts of asthma as his group of revolutionaries {{meet up with}} Castro’s. Together, they attack an army barracks in the Sierra Maestra on May 28, 1957. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> begin {{to win over the}} rural peasant population of Cuba and receive increasing support, while battling both the government and traitors in their midst. Gradually, however, the government loses control of most of the rural areas. Soon afterward, the July 26th Movement forges alliances with other revolutionary movements in Cuba, and begin to assault towns and villages. Most fall to the rebels with little to no resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{continued}} their recent winning ways in 2013, finishing {{the season with}} a 7-1 conference and 10-2 overall record, good for second place in the MAC's West Division. They won their first two games before losing to North Texas. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> won seven consecutive games before losing in their only game against a ranked opponent, Northern Illinois on November 13. They won their final game, at which point bowl director Jerry Silverstein extended an invitation to play in the game. This will be Ball State's second GoDaddy Bowl; they had previously appeared in the 2009 game (when it was known as the GMAC Bowl), losing to the Tulsa Golden Hurricane by a score of 45-13.|$|E

5|$|Three forts in the Ohio Country {{were taken}} in a second wave of attacks in mid-June. Iroquois Senecas took Fort Venango (near {{the site of the}} present Franklin, Pennsylvania) around June 16, 1763. They killed the entire 12-man {{garrison}} outright, keeping the commander alive to write down the grievances of the Senecas. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> ritually burned him at the stake. Possibly the same Seneca warriors attacked Fort Le Boeuf (on the site of Waterford, Pennsylvania) on June 18, but most of the 12-man garrison escaped to Fort Pitt.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Tang {{slipped out of}} the city, however, the entire Nanking Garrison Force was rapidly {{disintegrating}} with some units in open flight. Furthermore, contact had already been lost with many units who thus never received Tang's message and continued to hold their positions as ordered, though even those that did receive it had little luck at slipping through the Japanese lines. China's 66th and 83rd Corps made a bid to evade the Japanese as planned through a gap to the east but immediately ran into their own minefield. <b>After</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were attacked in flight by Japanese units and lost two divisional chiefs of staff in combat. Though the two corps had started the battle at least 11,000 men strong, only 600 of them escaped Nanking. Near dawn on December 13 a portion of China's 74th Corps was also annihilated in a bid to break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanking.|$|E
5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E

5|$|In the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, El Salvador {{received}} a bye {{to the second}} round. There, they were drawn into a home-and-away round-robin group with the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, and Suriname. La Selecta won their first match, against the Dominican Republic, 3–2 with goals scored by Rodolfo Zelaya (54', 77') and Christian Javier Bautista (63'), but left many doubts about their performance. El Salvador, however, convincingly won their next match, against the Cayman Islands, 1–4 with goals from Christian Bautista (50') and defenders Luis Anaya (63', 80') and Xavier García (90+3') before winning the return leg against the Dominican Republic 1–2. Although El Salvador received the necessary 3 points, {{the performance of the}} team was not as expected. La Selecta demonstrated more skill in their 4–0 in their home match against the Cayman Islands. The goals were scored by Víctor Turcios (5'), Steve Purdy (12'), Jaime Alas (44') and Herbert Sosa (pen. 88'). The last was the 1000th goal scored {{in the history of the}} El Salvador national football team. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> easily won their remaining games to complete the second round with a perfect record of six wins in six matches.|$|E
5|$|Their lofty {{locations}} makes {{monitoring of}} Australian raven nests difficult. A clutch can comprise {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number. Measuring , eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant {{by the time the}} third or fourth egg is laid. Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. They have pink skin until 5days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their egg tooth at the same time. Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35–36 days old. They leave the nest at 40–45days of age, and stay with the parents for three to four months <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> follow their parents and beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month. Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories, and melees ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back.|$|E
