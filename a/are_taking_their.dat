5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>their</b> own actions. New Zealand has banned {{the taking of}} manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E

25|$|Hard {{times and}} new ideas have hit Elyria as the 2000s and 2010s rolled on, as {{industries}} such as Bendix, Riddell, and 3M <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>their</b> business elsewhere, outside the city. To prepare for this hit, in March 2016, voters passed Issue 6, which was a 0.5% increase on the city's income tax, which was passed to pay for police expenses, {{as well as other}} things such as parks and Fiberoptic Internet throughout the city. With the Reconstruction of State Route 57 on the city's Northwest Side by Midway Mall, traffic flow has been greatly improved and there are minor revivals in the area such as new hotels and even hopes that a buyer will revitalize the area, with plans having even been presented. Revitalization efforts for Downtown Elyria continue through the efforts of groups such as Invest Elyria, Main Street Elyria, and in general the citizens. The historic Lorain County Courthouse is also being renovated to suit it for use once again, and a few buildings are even being reconstructed, and a few new ones also being constructed. There are plans for multiple small businesses and restaurants to go in to the downtown area {{over the next few years}} as of April 2017, and the city is showing signs of hope and revival, as its residents give the effort to restore the city to its peak days of the early to mid-1900's. In 2017, Elyria will celebrate its 200th Birthday, and many events and plans have been put forward in light of the city's Bicentennial Celebration.|$|E

Knight, {{well-known}} to the staff, is visiting the closed-off areas {{to have a}} look at the new mammoth specimens: the girl, however, is eager to see more of her grandfather's paintings. During this, the staff are finally getting round to sorting out Marsh's long-neglected collection of fossils. Two of the workers discover Knight's Leaping Laelaps has been accidentally left in the storeroom yesterday. The painting is taken back downstairs while the workmen unknowingly leave Cope's skeleton and Marsh's parts behind: [...] "The rest of this stuff is stayin' put for who knows how long, but we don't want that to get buried." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Guinness {{launched}} a retrospective television advertising campaign promoting Guinness Extra Cold stout, featuring new ten-second versions of commercials broadcast between 1984 and 2004. These included Mars (with Rutger Hauer reprising {{his role as}} the [...] "Pure Genius"), Anticipation, Fish Bicycle, Surfer, and Bet on Black. noitulovE joined the campaign in 2006, and was the only piece to receive more than one new version. In the first of these, the patrons are encased only seconds after taking their first sip of Guinness in a glacier identical to the one which appeared halfway through the original spot. In the second, the sea through which the three fish bound backwards in the original spot is frozen while the trio are in mid-leap, leaving the characters skidding across the surface.

2500|$|With six laps {{remaining}} in the Bojangles' Southern 500, Busch cut a tire and subsequently caused a wreck that involved not only his car but also Ryan Newman. When leaving his pit (directly in front of Newman), Busch did a burnout and sped next to where crew members and NASCAR officials where standing. Following {{the conclusion of the}} race, while entering pit road, Busch bumped Newman's car. Busch explained the incident as an accident and unrelated, caused by taking his helmet off and not seeing where he was going. Andrew Rueger, Newman's gas man, went after Busch following the race. This turned into a heated argument, accidentally knocking over a NASCAR official. Newman, giving an interview to Sports Illustrated, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's easy to say that Kurt blew a fuse again, I'm not sure why he did it and tried to run over our guys and NASCAR officials. And nobody is. I think the chemical imbalance speaks for itself. Kurt drilled me in pit lane and said that he was taking his helmet off, and he didn't see where he was going. I'm pretty sure there were 42 other guys that <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>their</b> helmets off and doing whatever for the last 10 years, and that's the first time that's happened to me." [...] On May 15, 2012, NASCAR announced that Busch had been fined $50,000 and placed on probation until July 25, 2012 for [...] "reckless driving on pit road during the race" [...] and for being [...] "involved in an altercation with another competitor after the completion of the race." ...|$|E

[...] But this is not true. [...] It {{is very difficult to}} find in the land [...] cultivated fields that are not used for planting. [...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} find good land for cattle. [...] And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad {{are accustomed to}} believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them. [...] But this is a grave mistake. [...] The Arab, like all the Semites, is sharp minded and shrewd. [...] All the townships of Syria and Eretz Yisrael are full of Arab merchants who know how to exploit the masses and keep track of everyone with whom they deal – the same as in Europe. [...] The Arabs, especially the urban elite, see and understand what we are doing and what we wish to do on the land, but they keep quiet and pretend not to notice anything.
