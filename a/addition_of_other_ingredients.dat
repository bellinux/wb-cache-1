It is prepared by fermenting the baechu cabbage together with other vegetables and lactic acid bacteria with functional potential. Many types of ingredients are added to kimchi to enhance its taste, flavor, nutritional value, texture etc. A number of bacteria are involved in the fermentation of kimchi, but lactic acid bacteria are the dominant species in the fermentation process.

40|$|Class of 2015 AbstractObjectives: The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{determine}} the safety of various pre-workout supplements that utilize proprietary blends in comparison {{with some of the most}} common individual ingredients; caffeine, creatine, and B-alanine. We hypothesized that there will be a greater number of adverse events reported for proprietary products than for the individual active ingredients. Additionally, we also wanted to look at the efficacy of the same aforementioned products. We hypothesized that there would be no statistically significant differences in performance between the two arms. Methods: Four databases were searched for subjects that were 18 - 35 years of age that were already physically active. The number of participants included in each trial ranged from 6 to 98. Results: Caffeine was the only individual compound that affected health markers, increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P< 0. 05), and HR in 2 of the 3 studies (P< 0. 05) significantly. Both caffeine and creatine showed a benefit in maximal exertion, but only caffeine improved endurance at doses of 3 mg/kg (P< 0. 05). Proprietary blends did not show a benefit, but serious adverse events such as liver failure were reported. Conclusions: Individually caffeine, creatine, and B-alanine all look to be safe at the recommended doses in healthy and active individuals, with caffeine and creatine benefitting performance. Pre-workout blends should be safe in theory, but due to the unregulated nature of the supplement industry there are a number of serious adverse events that occur.

The results demonstrated the rather high thermal stability of lycopene. Although a treatment at 140 degrees C induced isomerization, the contribution of cis-lycopene to the total lycopene content remained small.
