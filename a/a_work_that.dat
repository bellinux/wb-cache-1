5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> gives a transparent look at poverty in England.

5|$|About 1270, he {{returned}} to England to teach at Oxford, and was elected provincial minister of the Franciscans in England in 1275. He did not long remain in that post, being summoned to Rome as lector sacri palatii, or theological lecturer at the papal palace. It is likely that he composed his Expositio super Regulam Fratrum Minorum, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> included information on preaching, a subject that Peckham felt was of great importance. In 1279 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Pope Nicholas III who had prohibited the election of Robert Burnell, Edward I's preferred candidate. He was provided (appointed by the pope to the see) on 25 January 1279 and consecrated on 19 February 1279.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1947, García Márquez {{stayed in}} Bogotá to study {{law at the}} Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he had a special dedication to reading. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> especially inspired him. He was excited {{with the idea of}} writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if they were simply an aspect of everyday life». His desire to be a writer grew. A little later, he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the September 13th, 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.|$|E
5|$|Constantine was a {{ruler of}} major importance, {{and he has}} always been a {{controversial}} figure. The fluctuations in Constantine's reputation reflect the nature of the ancient sources for his reign. These are abundant and detailed, but have been strongly influenced by the official propaganda of the period, and are often one-sided. There are no surviving histories or biographies dealing with Constantine's life and rule. The nearest replacement is Eusebius's Vita Constantini, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> is a mixture of eulogy and hagiography. Written between 335AD and circa 339AD, the Vita extols Constantine's moral and religious virtues. The Vita creates a contentiously positive image of Constantine, and modern historians have frequently challenged its reliability. The fullest secular life of Constantine is the anonymous Origo Constantini. A work of uncertain date, the Origo focuses on military and political events, to the neglect of cultural and religious matters.|$|E

5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, {{at the age}} of thirty-one, Wollstonecraft made a {{dramatic}} entrance onto the public stage with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> helped propel the British pamphlet war over the French revolution. Two years later she published what has become her most famous work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Anxious to see the revolution firsthand, she moved to France for about two years, but returned in 1795 after revolutionary violence increased and the lover she met there, American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, abandoned her and their illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay. Shortly after her return to Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted suicide in May; Imlay, however, managed to save her.|$|E

5|$|The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast {{new light}} on the {{commissioning}} of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> was previously thoughtsince it has no central religious imageto be an atypical altarpiece. Many Netherlandish diptychs intended for private use are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no donor portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, The Gardens bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a tapestry that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Because Hope was <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Grant {{began his}} {{relationship}} with Skoob Books Limited, a publisher linked to the Skoob Books bookstore in Bloomsbury, central London which had begun to develop a line of esoteric titles {{under the leadership of}} Caroline Wise and Chris Johnson. In 1991, Skoob Books published Grant's Remembering Aleister Crowley, a volume containing his memoirs of Crowley alongside reproductions of diary entries, photographs, and letters. From 1989 to 1994, Skoob reissued a number of Grant's earlier books, and in 1992 published the sixth volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, Hecate's Fountain, in which Grant provided many anecdotes about working in the New Isis Lodge and focused on describing accidents and fatalities that he believed were caused by magic. The seventh volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, Outer Gateways, followed in 1994, discussing Grant's ideas of older Typhonian traditions from across the world, with reference to the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft. It ends with the text of The Wisdom of S'lba, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> Grant claimed he had received clairvoyantly from a supernatural source.|$|E
