25|$|Quick-start {{ballasts}} {{use a small}} auto-transformer to {{heat the}} filaments when power is first applied.

The auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit. Tubes need to be mounted near an earthed metal reflector {{in order for them}} to strike. Quick-start ballasts are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs. A quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a starter switch, a common source of lamp failures. Nonetheless, Quick-start ballasts are also used in domestic (residential) installations because of the desirable feature that a Quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied (when a switch is turned on). Quick-start ballasts are used only on 240nbsp&V circuits and are designed for use with the older, less efficient T12 tubes.|$|R

50|$|The {{mercury in}} the tube is a liquid at normal temperatures. It {{needs to be}} vaporized and ionized before the tube will conduct {{electricity}} and the arc can start. So, like fluorescent tubes, mercury vapor lamps require a starter, which is usually contained within the mercury vapor lamp itself. A third electrode is mounted {{near one of the}} main electrodes and connected through a resistor to the other main electrode. In addition to the mercury, the tube is filled with argon gas at low pressure. When power is applied, there is sufficient voltage to ionize the argon and <b>strike</b> a small <b>arc</b> between the starting electrode and the adjacent main electrode. This starting arc discharge heats the mercury and eventually provides enough ionized mercury to <b>strike</b> an <b>arc</b> between the main electrodes. This process takes from 4 to 7 minutes, so mercury lamps are slow starting. Some bulbs include a thermal switch which shorts the starting electrode to the adjacent main electrode, extinguishing the starting arc once the main <b>arc</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a <b>striking</b> <b>device</b> {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on the trigger and hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|R
