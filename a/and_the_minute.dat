5|$|McCarthyism was {{supported}} by a variety of groups, including the American Legion and various other anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's groups such as the American Public Relations Forum <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minute</b> Women of the U.S.A.. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into study groups, letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate what they saw as subversion.|$|E
5|$|Some of Chopin's {{well-known}} pieces {{have acquired}} descriptive titles, {{such as the}} Revolutionary Étude (Op.10,No.12), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minute</b> Waltz (Op.64,No.1). However, {{with the exception of}} his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.|$|E

25|$|The {{words for}} “hour” and “minute” (óra and perc) {{are not usually}} {{abbreviated}} in fluent texts. If the time is given in digits, a full stop is placed between the hour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> without a space (e.g. 10.35). This latter form takes a hyphen before suffixes (e.g. 10.35-kor ‘at 10:35’).|$|E

Drizzle becomes freezing drizzle when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point.|$|E

DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> I stepped into the studio I was so nervous, but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there".

2500|$|At {{the north}} end of the Palace rises the most famous of the towers, Elizabeth Tower, {{commonly}} known as Big Ben. At 96metres (316ft), it is only slightly shorter than Victoria Tower but much slimmer. Originally known simply as the Clock Tower (the name Elizabeth Tower was conferred on it in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II), it houses the Great Clock of Westminster, built by Edward John Dent on designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. Striking the hour to within a second of the time, the Great Clock achieved standards of accuracy considered impossible by 19th-century clockmakers, and it has remained consistently reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials [...] in diameter, which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night; the hour hand is [...] long <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> hand [...] The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the Palace. In the 2012 BBC Four documentary, Richard Taylor gives a description of Pugin's Clock Tower: [...] "It rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm, higher and higher, before you reach the clock face, picked out as a giant rose, its petals fringed with gold. Medieval windows above that and then it hits the grey slate roof, its greyness relieved by those delicate little windows again picked out in gold leaf. And then rises up again in a great jet of gold to the higher roof that curves gracefully upwards to a spire with a crown and flowers and a cross. It's elegant and grand and has fairy tale qualities." ...|$|E
