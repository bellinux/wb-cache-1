5|$|Kusaka {{correctly}} {{saw these}} strikes as {{a precursor to}} U.S. troop landings, {{in part due to}} Imperial Navy intelligence collected over the previous week. Because he was still unsure exactly where enemy forces would land, he chose to execute the air component of Sho-1 or Sho-2the planned defense of the Philippines or Formosa, respectivelyon the morning of 10October. Sho was a complex plan involving multiple naval surface forces sortieing from bases as far away as Singapore and Japan. It would take these warships time to maneuver into position for a concerted attack. Rather than waiting for the arrival of the fleet for a combination of sea and air power, Kusaka ordered the air forces reserved for Sho to engage the enemy <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> reinforced this order by implementing Sho-2 in full on the morning of 12October.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1918, Mackay {{was heading}} on leave to London {{to visit his}} wife, who had managed to reach England after a long battle with wartime travel restrictions, when he was stopped and turned back at Boulogne by British {{military}} police. He had been appointed to command the 1st Infantry Brigade and had to return <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> was immediately promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general. Mackay commanded the 1st Infantry Brigade in the later stages of the fighting around Hazebrouck. In the operations east of there in June and July, his brigade was exceptionally active {{in the form of}} minor operations and patrolling that became known as the peaceful penetration.|$|E
5|$|Waugh {{began at}} Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became {{bored with the}} routine and quickly {{abandoned}} his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> <b>he</b> secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, The Temple at Thatch, intending {{to work on it}} in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 24September that Edward left Acre. Arriving in Sicily, he was met {{with the news that}} his father had died on 16November, 1272. Edward was deeply saddened by this news, but rather than hurrying home <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> <b>he</b> made a leisurely journey northwards. This was due partly to his still-poor health, but also to a lack of urgency. The {{political}} situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary. In Edward's absence, the country was governed by a royal council, led by Robert Burnell. The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France, where among other things he visited Pope Gregory X. Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England, and he was crowned on 19 August.|$|E

Reports said that he would carry 700 pounds of furs and supplies <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> served as an interpreter, and was believed to have acted as a guide for governor Lewis Cass. Well respected in the region, Bonga and his wife opened a lodge on Leech Lake after the fur trade declined. George Bonga died in 1880.|$|E
25|$|In {{the epic}} Mahabharata, Bhishma (Sanskrit: भीष्‍म) {{was well known}} for his pledge of celibacy. The eighth son of Kuru King Shantanu and the goddess Ganga Bhishma was blessed with wish-long life and was related to both the Pandava and the Kaurava. He was an unparalleled archer and warrior of his time. He is equal to 4 maharathi warriors, capable to {{defeating}} 4 maharathis <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> also handed down the Vishnu Sahasranama to Yudhishthira {{when he was on}} his death bed (of arrows) in the battle of Kurukshetra.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, however, he {{returned}} to the higher level when he was chosen by Worcestershire, and <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed the best season of his career, taking 47 wickets in his 27 games at 30.14 including his only five-wicket innings haul, 5-56 against Sussex at Hove. His batting was also much improved, and he made two half-centuries, the higher of which - 73 against his old county of Gloucestershire - was to remain his career best. He also kept wicket occasionally, picking up his only stumping when he dismissed Glamorgan's Dai Davies while substituting for named keeper Maurice Foster.|$|E

25|$|Max, a two-legged four-armed genetically {{engineered}} robotic dog, {{is the toughest}} of the three characters, with 200 health points. His gameplay is focused on high-impact firepower; standing on his two back legs, he can equip and shoot up to four guns <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> has access to numerous weapons, such an uzis, shotguns, Magnums and gatling guns. Ammo is limited for all weaponry except his default Magnum. He is also able to wear {{two different types of}} jet pack. The standard jet pack uses fuel and when empty, must be refuelled at a fuelling pump. The atomic jetpack does not use fuel, instead refilling automatically when not in use.|$|E
25|$|In modern belief, {{he is also}} {{regarded}} as founder of Vilnius, the modern capital of Lithuania. According to a legend, possibly set in 1322 {{while he was on}} a hunting trip, he dreamt of an iron clad wolf, who stood on a hill, howling in an odd manner as if thousand of wolves would be howling <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> consulted his vision with his priest Lizdeika who told him the dream spoke of a city that must be built at the exact place and decided to build a fortification on the confluence of rivers Vilnia and Neris, where the place of his vision was pointed out. This event inspired the Romantic movement, particularly Adam Mickiewicz, who gave the story a poetic form.|$|E
25|$|Believing {{that he was}} out of Kellermann's reach, Del Parque grew careless. He {{allowed his}} army to camp in a bad {{position}} astride the Tormes River. The divisions of Ballesteros and Castrofuerte bivouacked on the east bank while the divisions of Anglona, La Carrera, Losada, and Belveder were in the town and on the west bank. Since the cavalry pickets were posted too close the camp, they did not give adequate warning of the arrival of the French. Riding with his light cavalry advance guard, Kellermann determined to attack <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> feared that if he waited for Marchand's infantry, the Spanish would have time to establish a defensive line behind the Tormes. The decision meant that unsupported French cavalry would be attacking a much larger force of Spanish cavalry, infantry, and artillery.|$|E

25|$|ChuChu Rocket! was {{developed}} by Sonic Team, and led by director and producer Yuji Naka. According to Naka, he had {{the idea for the}} game because he wanted to use the power of the Dreamcast to create 100 sprites moving <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> noted there are two trends to utilize evolving hardware: one is to make increasingly beautiful graphics while the other is to squeeze as much processing power to use it to its fullest; he chose the latter in this case. Naka and his team found difficulty working on the networking component, but believed it was a good learning experience. Part of ChuChu Rocket!s purpose was to test the capabilities of online multiplayer gaming on the Dreamcast; the team used what they learned to help drive the development of Phantasy Star Online (2000). A NAOMI arcade version of the game was also planned, but later scrapped.|$|E
25|$|In MDK2, the {{two other}} playable {{characters}} are Kurt's employer, the inventor/scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and Max, a two-legged four-armed genetically engineered robotic dog. Max is the toughest of the three characters, with 200 health points. His gameplay is focused on high-impact firepower; standing on his two back legs, he can equip and shoot up to four guns <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>He</b> is also able to wear {{two different types of}} jet pack. The standard jet pack uses fuel and when empty, must be refuelled at a fuelling pump. The atomic jetpack does not use fuel, instead refilling automatically when not in use. Hawkins' levels focus on puzzle solving and platforming, with some elements of combat. He is the weakest of the characters, with 60 health points. Most of his gameplay revolves around combining objects to create new objects, which in turn allow him to proceed through the level. He has two independent inventories, one for his right hand and one for his left. Items from one inventory can be combined with items from the other, but items within the same inventory cannot be combined. His main weapon is an atomic toaster, which shoots radioactive toast.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. <b>At</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> {{told me that he was}} a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{he could}} move, however, {{he had to}} dispose of his {{thousands}} of [...] glass-plate negatives. [...] He also had to get himself out of debt once again. [...] In an attempt to accomplish both of these <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> <b>he</b> offered his collection of negatives to the Nebraska State Historical Society. [...] To Addison Sheldon, head of the Society's Legislative Reference Bureau, he wrote, [...] "Now {{is the time to}} buy me cheap, when I need the money so badly." [...] In November 1911, he and Sheldon signed a contract for the sale of the negatives for $1000. [...] Butcher was to receive $100 down; the rest would be paid after the Nebraska legislature passed a bill appropriating funds for the purchase.|$|E
500|$|Barton is a {{prominent}} user of Twitter, with over three million followers as of October 2016. Commenting on figures from Friedrich Nietzsche and George Orwell to Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Morrissey, his eclectic tweets {{have resulted in}} him being described by the BBC as [...] "a philosophical sportsman to rival Eric Cantona in his heyday". Others in the media have criticised this description, with Paul Hayward, chief sports writer for The Daily Telegraph, writing that Barton [...] "manages to be patronised [...] and held up {{as some kind of}} exemplar all <b>at</b> <b>once...</b> <b>he</b> is skilled at tricking us into watching him veer between the extremes of thinker and thug. Either this is a repudiation of societal hypocrisy or, more likely, indicative of a sociopathic tendency." [...] Ellie Mae O'Hagan of The Guardian commented that [...] "the problem, I think, is not the belief that Barton is a reformed character, but the notion that one cannot possibly be a philosopher and violent at the same time: that quoting philosophy should automatically be taken as a sign of reformation... In my mind, this all boils down to class snobbery. It is automatically assumed that Barton has violent tendencies because he's a working-class man who has chosen to play football for a living. So when he shows signs of intelligence, it's treated as a sign of reform: intellect is the preserve of the gentlemanly middle-classes." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 3:00 pm, Schwarzenberg finally {{realized}} that Napoleon was retreating. Instead of unleashing his corps <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> <b>he</b> called another council of war! Wrede was ordered to cross to the north bank of the Aube at Chaudrey, {{to the east of}} Arcis. Only his cavalry made it across the river there and his infantry had to march upstream and cross at Lesmont. The Crownprince (IV Corps) and Ignaz Gyulai (III Corps) were directed to attack Arcis while the Russian grenadiers attacked Torcy-le-Grand. Meanwhile, Pahlen and Nikolay Raevsky (VI Corps) also pressed forward. During this advance, the Allied cavalry claimed to have captured a French cavalry brigade, while Pahlen's horsemen captured three cannons. By 4:00 pm, the Allies arrived near Arcis which they took under fire with 80 cannons. In the face of this bombardment, Sebastiani withdrew his surviving horsemen across the Villette bridge and broke it down.|$|E
