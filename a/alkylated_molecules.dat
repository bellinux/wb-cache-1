40|$|Surface-confined porous {{molecular}} networks can {{be formed}} by self-assembly at the liquid-solid interface by controlling the subtle interplay between molecules, solvent and substrate. Typically, directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding or metal-ligand interactions are {{at play in}} defining the topology of the networks. However, porous molecular networks maintained only by van der Waals interactions are at the focus in this Highlight. The liquid-solid interface at atomically flat conductive substrates such as graphite is an excellent medium to support the self-assembly of <b>alkylated</b> <b>molecules.</b> Molecular symmetry defines {{the shape of the}} pores, ranging from diamond to honeycomb and Kagome. Solvent often plays an important role and sometimes several porous and non-porous structures are formed. The solute concentration is a key factor too, the formation of porous patterns is favoured at low concentrations. These pores, with diameters ranging from about three nanometres to more than seven nanometres, can be filled with guest molecules. In some cases, these porous topologies can only be formed upon addition of template molecules, which direct the structural transformation from a high-density to a low-density, i. e. porous, phase. The template molecules stabilize the pores. Following appropriate design principles, multicomponent networks can be formed, containing up to four different organic molecules. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{molecular}} beam co-deposition of rodlike conjugated <b>molecules</b> with an <b>alkylated</b> analogue resulted in thin film structures {{with layers of}} alternating semiconducting (conjugated molecular parts) and insulating (alkyl parts) character. By varying the <b>alkylated</b> <b>molecule</b> ratio, we could adjust the distance between conjugated layers with sub-nanometer precision, exploiting the mechanical flexibility of the alkyl chains. Furthermore, due to mutual molecular intercalation, mixed layers containing two conjugated moieties with vastly different electronic properties could be fabricated...|$|R
40|$|We report six {{asymmetric}} <b>alkylated</b> anthracene-based <b>molecules</b> {{with different}} alkyl side chain lengths {{for use in}} organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Alkyl side chains can potentially improve the solubility and processability of anthracene derivatives. The crystallinity and charge mobility of the anthracene derivatives may be improved by optimizing the side chain length. The highest field-effect mobility of the devices prepared here was 0. 55 cm 2 /(V s), for 2 -(p-pentylphenylethynyl) anthracene (PPEA). The moderate side chain length appeared to be optimal for promoting self-organization among asymmetric anthracene derivatives in OFETs, and was certainly better than the short or long alkyl side chain lengths, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements...|$|R
40|$|Nanocorrals with {{different}} size, shape, and orientation are created on covalently modified highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surfaces using scanning probe nanolithography, i. e., nanoshaving. <b>Alkylated</b> diacetylene <b>molecules</b> undergo laterally confined supramolecular selfassembly within these corrals. When nanoshaving is performed in situ, at the liquid−solid interface, {{the orientation of}} the supramolecular lamellae structure is directionally influenced by the gradual graphite surface exposure. Careful choice of the nanoshaving direction with respect to the substrate symmetry axes promotes alignment of the supramolecular lamellae within the corral. Selfassembly occurring inside corrals of different size and shape reveals the importance of geometric and kinetic constraints controlled by the nanoshaving process. Finally, seed-mediated crystallization studies demonstrate confinement control over nucleation and growth principles. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Supramolecular {{assembly}} {{can yield}} ordered structures by {{taking advantage of}} the cumulative effect of multiple non-covalent interactions between adjacent molecules. The thermodynamic origin of many self-assembled structures in water is the balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments of the molecule. Here, we show that this approach can be generalized to use solvophobic and solvophilic segments of fully hydrophobic <b>alkylated</b> fullerene <b>molecules.</b> Addition of n-alkanes results in their assembly—due to the antipathy of C 60 towards n-alkanes—into micelles and hexagonally packed gel-fibres containing insulated C 60 nanowires. The addition of pristine C 60 instead directs the assembly into lamellar mesophases by increasing the proportion of p-conjugated material in the mixture. The assembled structures contain a large fraction of optoelectronically active material and exhibit comparably high photoconductivities. This method is shown to be applicable to several alkyl–pi-conjugated molecules, and can be used to construct organized functional materials with pi-conjugated sections...|$|R
40|$|Chloropyruvate, like bromopyruvate, rapidly inactivates N-acetylneuraminate lyase at pH 7. 2. At 5 °C, 0. 5 mm-chloropyruvate {{reacted with}} the enzyme about {{ten times as}} fast as bromopyruvate. In contrast, at pH 6. 0 and 9 °C, chloropyruvate reacted with N-acetylcysteine seven times more slowly than bromopyruvate. A brief (2 min) {{incubation}} of the enzyme with 1. 0 mm-chloro[14 C]pyruvate gave an inactive enzyme in which 4. 5 cysteine residues were <b>alkylated</b> per <b>molecule</b> of enzyme. This corresponded to the number of [14 C]pyruvate residues (3. 7) bound to the enzyme by borohydride reduction of the [14 C]-pyruvate complex, and confirmed the previous suggestion that there is one `essential' cysteine residue per active site. It is suggested that, for this enzyme, chloropyruvate can be selectively used to alkylate the active-site residues, whereas bromopyruvate cannot. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme prepared by two slightly different methods was approx. 100000 or 250000. The latter value has been used to calculate the number of pyruvate residues bound to the enzyme...|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to create a light {{responsive}} nanostructured liquid crystalline matrix using a novel <b>alkylated</b> spiropyran photochromic <b>molecule</b> (spiropyran laurate, SPL) as a light activated drug delivery system. The liquid crystal matrix, prepared from phytantriol, responds reversibly to changes in photoisomerism of SPL on irradiation, switching between the bicontinuous cubic and the reversed hexagonal liquid crystal structures, a change previously shown to dramatically alter drug release rate. In contrast, the non-derivatized spiropyran and spirooxazine photochromic compounds do not sufficiently disrupt the matrix on isomerization to induce the phase change. Thus, novel alkylated spiropyran has the potential to be an effective agent for use in liquid crystalline systems for reversible ‘on-demand’ drug delivery applications.|$|R
40|$|Fibrinogen is an {{essential}} protein involved in several steps of hemostasis, being associated with the final steps of the blood coagulation mechanism. Herein, we describe the purification and characterization of a reptile fibrinogen, obtained from Bothrops jararaca plasma. Native B. jararaca fibrinogen showed a molecular mass of 372 kDa, and the reduced and <b>alkylated</b> fibrinogen <b>molecule</b> showed three chains of 71, 60 and 55 kDa, which {{are similar to the}} molecular masses of human and bovine Act, BP and gamma fibrinogen chains. Remarkably, B. jararaca fibrinogen was clotted by bovine thrombin, but B. jararaca, Crotalus durissus terrificus and Lachesis muta rhombeata venoms could not induce its clotting or hydrolysis. Thus, despite the similarities between B. jararaca and mammalian fibrinogens, the former shows distinctive features, which protect B. jararaca snakes from accidental envenomation.

40|$|Upon ethyl {{nitrosourea}} {{treatment of}} RNA of tobacco mosaic virus, {{up to four}} phosphodiester groups may be <b>alkylated</b> per <b>molecule</b> without chain breakage, as shown be sucrose gradient centrifugation. This indicates that ribophosphotriesters are quite stable. However, when this alkylation reaction is of longer duration and 6 to 10 triesters are formed, then an average of 1 to 2 breaks occurs and little or no intact RNA can be isolated. Methyl nitrosourea is less effective in forming triesters (about 25 % of total alkyl groups compared to about 65 % for ethyl nitrosourea), and {{a greater number of}} alkyl groups can, therefore, be introduced before breaks occur. Diethyl sulfate and dimethyl sulfate, which alkylate almost only the bases of nucleic acids, do not cause significant degradation of RNA of tobacco mosaic virus, even when as many as 70 alkyl groups are bound. All types of alkylation cause similar losses in viral infectivity at low levels of alkylation. Thus, an average of two chemical events leads to one lethal event, regardless {{of the nature of the}} alkylating reaction, which, for example, is with dimethyl sulfate about 65 % on the N- 7 guanine while with ethyl nitrosourea it is about 65 % on phosphodiesters. It is thus concluded that all alkyl groups, whether on the base or on the phosphate, have the same potential to cause inactivation and that inactivation of RNA can result from phosphotriester formation per se...|$|R
40|$|Polyethyleneimine <b>molecules</b> <b>alkylated</b> with naphthylmethyl bromide and {{benzyl bromide}} and {{internally}} cross-linked by reaction with alkyl dihalides have binding capabilities enhanced {{by up to}} twofold. The modified and cross-linked polyethyleneimines bind large numbers of methyl orange dye molecules; since no evidence is found for dye stacking the cross-linked polyethyleneimine is considered to retain {{the flexibility of the}} native material. Increasing the cross-linking percentage from 0 to 20 % of the available nitrogen causes a modest twofold increase in binding strength; cross-linking of polyethyleneimine in the presence of methyl orange dye produces a polymer which has doubled binding capacity for this dye than has the polymer cross-linked in the absence of added dye. Cross-linking does not reduce the number of primary amines in the alkylated polyethyleneimine available for reaction with Cu (1) ions or with 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulphonate anion. The reactivity of the cross-linked polymers with 4 -nitrophenyl esters is not reduced below that of the native polyethyleneimine...|$|R
40|$|Ordered {{honeycomb}} microporous {{films have}} previously been fabricated from polymeric macromolecules. We report here the successful fabrication {{of them from}} the supramolecular self-assembly of small <b>molecules,</b> <b>alkylated</b> guanosine derivatives. The ribbonlike self-assembly of the guanosines in CHCl(3) is found to be the intrinsic structure that forms regular microporous structure via Benard-Maragoni convection. Factors such as substrate, solvents, guanosine concentration, and solvent evaporation temperature are revealed to be able to control the size of the formed micropores, which in turn allows for the wettability of the honeycomb film surface to be modulated. These microporous materials exhibit excellent ability of loading organic dyes that eventually leads to the fabrication of luminescent honeycomb films. As structures of both the small molecules that can assemble and their self-assemblies can be varied and controlled, extended applications of this supramolecular method are expected to lead to microporous films of interesting functions.

40|$|The {{question}} {{at the beginning of}} the project was, whether it is possible to fabricate an electronic device based on single molecules. In order to answer this question, conjugated macromolecules were self-assembled in two-dimensional arrays on ultraflat solid substrates. In the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) currents through various molecular segments were measured in well defined environments. Also the current through conjugated, end-functionalized polymers was measured between two nanoelectrodes on a silicon wafer at a distance of less than 10 nm. A key result is the first measurement of current-voltage characteristics through a single <b>molecule</b> (<b>alkylated</b> hexabenzocoronene) at submolecular resolution, which showed that it is possible to obtain a diode-like I-V characteristic with a single aromatic molecule contacted by a conducting substrate and the STM tip. Moreover a simple method was found in order to self-assemble oriented ribbons of conjugated macromolecules on insulators. The cross-section of the ribbons is given by the dimension of single molecules, i. e. in the range of a few nanometers. The ribbons are suitable candidates for 'nanowires', which may bridge conventional microelectronic structures. (orig.)

40|$|Highly excited {{molecules}} are {{of great}} importance {{in many areas of}} chemistry including photochemistry. The dynamics of highly excited molecules are affected by the intermolecular and intramolecular energy flow between many different kinds of motions. This thesis reports investigations of the collisional quenching and reactivity of highly excited molecules aimed at understanding the dynamics of highly excited molecules. How do molecules behave in collisions with a bath gas? How do the energy distributions evolve in time? How is the energy partitioned for both the donor and bath molecules after collisions? How do molecule structure, molecule state density and intermolecular potential play the role during collisional energy transfer? To answer these questions, collisional quenching dynamics and reactivity of highly vibrationally excited azabenzene molecules have been studied using high-resolution transient IR absorption spectroscopy. The first study shows that the highly vibrationally excited <b>alkylated</b> pyridine <b>molecules</b> impart less rotational and translational energy to CO 2 than pyridine does. The strong collisions are reduced for donors with longer alkyl chains by lowering the average energy per mode but longer alkyl chain have increased flexibility and higher state densities that enhance energy loss via strong collisions. In the second study, the role of hydrogen bonding interactions is explored in collision of vibrationally excited pyridines with H 2 O. A torque-inducing mechanism is proposed that involves directed movement of H 2 O between sigma- and pi-hydrogen bonding interactions with the pyridine donors. In the third study the dynamics of strong and weak collisions for highly vibrationally excited methylated pyridine molecules with HOD are reported. Lower limits to the overall collision rate are directly determined from experimental measurements and compared to Lennard-Jones models which underestimate the collision rate. The fourth study explores reactive collisions of highly vibrationally excited pyridine molecules. D-atom abstraction reactions of pyridine-d 5 and Cl show a rate enhancement of ~ 90 with vibrational energy. A single quantum of C-D stretching vibration is observed to be used for the vibrational driven reaction. Reactions of 2 -picoline-d 3 with Cl do not show a similar enhancement. For this case, the fast rotation of -CD 3 group in highly vibrationally excited 2 -picoline-d 3 inhibits the D-atom abstraction...|$|R
40|$|Transforming DNA {{was exposed}} to either {{beta-propiolactone}} or 1, 3 -propane sultone and then used for transformation of competent bacteria to nutritional independence from tyrosine and tryptophan (linked markers) and leucine (an unlinked marker). The ability to transform was progressively lost by the DNA during incubation with either of these two chemicals. For all three markers the inactivation curve was biphasic, with {{a short period of}} rapid inactivation followed by one characterized by a much slower rate. The overall rate of inactivation was different for all three markers and presumably was related {{to the size of the}} marker. The decrease in the transforming activity was in part due to the slower rate of penetration of alkylated DNA through the cellular membrane and its inability to enter the recipient bacteria. This decrease in the rate of cellular uptake, even for DNA eventually destined to enter the cell, began almost immediately after its exposure to the chemical and ended up with an almost complete lack of recognition of the heavily alkylated DNA by the specific surface receptors of competent cells. Such DNA attached to sites on the surface of competent bacteria which were different from receptors specific for the untreated nucleic acid. This attachment was not followed by uptake of the altered DNA. Presence of albumin during the incubation with a carcinogen further increased the degree of inactivation, indicating that the artificial nucleoproteins produced under such conditions were less efficient in the transformation assay than was the naked DNA. Cotransfomration of close markers progressively decreased, beginning immediately after the start of incubation of DNA with the chemicals. Extensively alkylated DNA fractionated by sedimentation through sucrose density gradients showed a peculiar distribution of cotransforming activity for such markers; namely, molecules larger than the bulk of DNA ("megamolecules") showed less ability to transform the second marker than did some of the apparently smaller molecules which sedimented more slowly through the gradient. An increase in cotransformation of distant markers was evident in DNA molecules after a short exposure to an alkylating agent, but cotransformation of such markers was absent in DNA treated for longer periods. The observed changes in the transforming and cotransforming activities of the alkylated DNA can be explained by what is known about the physicochemistry of such DNA and in particular about the propensity of the <b>alkylated</b> and broken <b>molecules</b> to form complexes with themselves and with other macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis aims at spherical dendrimers with generation-specifically {{incorporated}} fluorescent solvatation probes. Knowledge of solvatation of {{the area}} between the core and the periphery should contribute essentially to the basic understanding of these macromolecules. In particular, the role of solvatation in directed energy and charge transfer processes is not known sufficiently. Firstly, {{the development of new}} phenylene alkylene dendrons via palladium catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of aryl halogenides and in situ prepared alkyl boranes by an orthogonal, convergent approach is demonstrated. The 3, 5 -dihalogen homoallyl benzenes 15 and 28 were found to be suitable in the synthesis of the G 2 dendron 32 on a gram scale. The main part introduces a concept that schedules for the incorporation of solvatochromic, selectively excitable phenyl pyrene derivatives in a specific generation and the equipment of all others by an inactive alkyl pyrene analogue, the so-called volume dummy. According to this a series of phenyl pyrenes 45 b-n and corresponding alkyl-bridged compounds 47 and 57 were synthesized and investigated by photophysical methods in detail. As a suitable pair of probe and dummy the two benzonitrile derivatives 45 b and 57 were chosen. 45 b can be excited exclusively in the presence of even an excess of 47 with light of lexc ? 360 nm and shows a positive solvatochromism of lmax = 36 nm (methyl cyclohexane vs. acetonitrile) in the fluorescence. Both compounds were functionalized by a second substitution at the pyrene and connected to the benzylic alcohols 84 and 85 via ether bond formation to give the branching units 86 - 88 on a 10 g scale. From these the complementary G 2 phenylene alkylene dendrons 91 and 92 were synthesized. Their structures were unequivocally confirmed by NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS, and SEC. Test reactions indicated the possible threefold connection to a benzene core to yield the dendrimers 93 and 94. Most of the reactions used in the 14 -step sequence generating the target compounds 93 and 94 (in each case) proceeded in good or very good yields. The concept presented seems to be capable of bearing the goal. Other parts of this thesis deal with the synthesis of the tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II) complex 100 that contains a pyrene substituent at one of the ligands 5 -positions (crystal structure), first steps to a multiple <b>alkylated</b> pyrene core <b>molecule</b> and the exploration of the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling in the preparation of hyperbranched polymers...|$|R
