On August 26, 1970, the 50th anniversary of the Women's Suffrage Amendment to the Constitution, Friedan organized the national Women's Strike for Equality, and led a march of an estimated 20,000 women in New York City.

25|$|During {{her years}} in Puerto Rico, Rodriguez-Trias {{became aware that}} unsuspecting Puerto Rican women were being sterilized and that Puerto Rico was {{being used by the}} United States as a {{laboratory}} for the development of birth control technology. In New York, after attending a conference on abortion at Barnard College in 1970, she focused on reproductive rights of women and became an advocate for women's reproductive rights, campaigning for change at a policy level. In 1970, Rodriguez-Trias was a founding member of Committee to End Sterilization Abuse and in 1971, {{a founding member of the}} Women's Caucus of the American Public Health Association. Rodriguez-Trias supported abortion rights, fought for the abolishment of enforced sterilization, and sought that neonatal care to underserved people be provided. In 1979, Rodriguez-Trias became a founding member of the Committee for <b>Abortion</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Against Sterilization Abuse and testified before the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for passage of federal sterilization guidelines. The guidelines, which she drafted, require a woman's written consent to sterilization, offered in a language they can understand, and set a waiting period between the consent and the sterilization procedure. She is credited with helping to expand the range of public health services for women and children in minority and low-income populations in the United States, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|She {{discussed}} {{her views}} on <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> sexual equality in a 2009 New York Times interview, {{in which she}} said about abortion that [...] "he basic {{thing is that the}} government has no business making that choice for a woman". Although Ginsburg has consistently supported <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> joined in the Court's opinion striking down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law in Stenberg v. Carhart , on the fortieth anniversary of the Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade , she criticized the decision in Roe as terminating a nascent democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.|$|E

[...] He began {{to criticize the}} [...] "moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others [...] who are trying to...make a religious organization out of it."

500|$|In 2004, Rice {{nearly died}} again from an {{intestinal}} blockage or bowel obstruction, a common complication of gastric bypass surgery. In 2005, Newsweek reported, [...] " [...] {{came close to}} death last year, when she had surgery for an intestinal blockage, and also back in 1998, when she went into a sudden diabetic coma; that same year {{she returned to the}} Roman Catholic Church, which she'd left at 18." [...] Her return did not come with a full embrace of the Church's stances on social issues; Rice remained a vocal supporter of equality for gay men and lesbians (including marriage rights), as well as <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> birth control, writing extensively on such issues. In October 2005, while promoting her book, , she announced in Newsweek that she would now use her life and talent of writing to glorify her belief in God, but did not renounce her earlier works.|$|E
500|$|Limited to {{one term}} as {{attorney}} general by the state constitution, [...] Beshear declared his candidacy for lieutenant governor in 1983. In a seven-candidate Democratic primary in May, Beshear captured 183,662 of the 575,022 votes cast to defeat a field that included former state Auditor George L. Atkins, Jefferson County judge executive Todd Hollenbach, Agriculture Commissioner Alben Barkley II, and former Kentucky Wildcats basketball star Bill Spivey. In the general election, Beshear faced Republican Eugene Stuart and Don Wiggins, who became the nominee of the newly formed Consumers Lobby Party after losing in the Republican gubernatorial primary. Stuart categorized Beshear as being too liberal for Kentucky, citing his opinion in the Ten Commandments case, {{as well as his}} support for <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> gun control. Beshear denied advocating for gun control and charged that Stuart, a state senator from Jefferson County, had not shown any leadership worthy of election to the lieutenant governor's office. Beshear easily defeated Stuart by a vote of 568,869 to 321,352; Wiggins captured just 7,728 votes.|$|E
50|$|Changing {{demographics}} {{and a growing}} Hispanic population made the state more favorable to the Democrats, although Republicans still had a hold on the state due to the party's conservative stances on social issues like <b>abortion,</b> gay <b>rights,</b> <b>and</b> gun control.|$|R

500|$|Both {{candidates}} {{started the}} campaign well-funded. Sestak {{had more than}} $3 million available from his House fund to use toward starting a Senate campaign, and raised an additional $1 million by June 30, 2009, which brought his total to about $4.2 million. Sestak called it the largest campaign war-chest of any Senate challenger. Specter, however, was ahead with $6.7 million in campaign funding as of March 31. Sestak also faced challenges arising from his low name recognition and Specter's support among high-profile members of the Democratic establishment, like Obama and Biden. Specter spent {{the early months of}} his campaign trying to reestablish and strengthen his Democratic credentials, seeking union support and making speeches highlighting his support of positions supported by the party, such as the economic stimulus package, reforming health care, increasing the minimum wage, protecting <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> supporting stem cell research. In a June 2009 speech to Pennsylvania Democratic Committee members in Pittsburgh, Specter said, [...] "I'm again a Democrat and I'm pleased and proud to be a Democrat." [...] Commentators observed that Sestak's involvement in the race would test Specter's loyalty to the Democratic party and likely force him to make more liberal votes in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|As {{mayor of}} Newark, New Jersey, he [...] "drew {{criticism}} from liberal allies for embracing charter schools and voucher programs advocated by libertarians." [...] "He also championed “enterprise zones,” a free-market approach to solving urban blight credited {{to the late}} Jack Kemp, a hard-core supply-sider and occasional Republican presidential contender who helped raise money for Booker’s first mayoral campaign." [...] Besides social media advances, Booker {{wants to see the}} rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. “We’re not moving at the speed of innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries are leaving the U.S. to work on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs. Booker supports <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> affirmative action.|$|E
2500|$|On social policy, Edwards {{supports}} <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> has {{a universal}} healthcare plan that requires all Americans to purchase healthcare insurance, [...] "requires that everybody get preventive care," [...] and requires employers {{to provide health}} care insurance or be taxed to fund public health care.

Its official ideologies are liberalism and conservatism.|$|R
