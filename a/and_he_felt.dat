5|$|Although the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was {{traditionally}} {{the most prestigious}} venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit Hope at the smaller Grosvenor Gallery. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a retrospective exhibition of Watts's work <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> an attachment to the venue. Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation. Hope was given the prime spot in the exhibition, in {{the centre of the}} gallery's longest wall.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of {{successful}} plays, Planché was never particularly wealthy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> pressure from needing to support his grandchildren. Circumstances improved when in 1871 he was awarded a civil list pension of £100 per annum 'in recognition of his literary services'. Planché died {{at his home in}} Chelsea on 30 May 1880 at the age of 84. His wealth {{at the time of his}} death was under £1000.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Capello {{returned}} to Milan, subsequently stating Baggio {{was not a}} part of his plans with the club. Baggio chose to move to Parma, but the manager at the time, Carlo Ancelotti, impeded the transfer, as he also did not feel Baggio would fit into his tactical plans. Ancelotti would later state he regretted this decision, stating that in his naïveté, he believed that the 4–4–2 formation was the ideal formation for success, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that at the time, creative players such as Gianfranco Zola and Baggio were not compatible with this system.|$|E
60|$|Leo had {{followed}} them ashore <b>and</b> now <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had them just {{where he wanted}} them.|$|R
60|$|Philip stood silent <b>and</b> flushed. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> {{that they}} {{looked at him with}} contempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{so glad to}} see you!" [...] he exclaimed, {{for want}} of {{something}} better; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> blushed--he <b>felt</b> foolish, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> false--as <b>he</b> said it.|$|R
5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Nazi–Soviet pact on 23 August 1939, the RAF mobilised. Cunningham had been test-flying the airliner de Havilland Dragon. Only 16 were complete before the declaration of war in September. The growing tension in Europe made war more likely. John was forced to commit himself either to de Havilland or the RAF at this juncture. The RAF had trained him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he could be of far more use in the RAF than test-flying aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, 1775, Montgomery {{was elected}} {{as one of}} the ten deputies to {{represent}} Dutchess County in the New York Provincial Congress. Although Montgomery had only lived in New York for two years and had not sought political involvement, he was well known and respected in the area <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> obliged to attend. He was reluctant to go, but nonetheless went to New York City, 80 miles south of Rhinebeck.|$|E
5000|$|Scaglia {{claimed to}} be “enthusiastic” about Yewno <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> “lucky {{to be a part}} of it.” ...|$|R
60|$|The elder man nodded, <b>and</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> any surprise, {{successfully}} concealed it. Even then Vine still hesitated.|$|R
60|$|Ken {{was afraid}} to utter any more of his hopes, <b>and</b> indeed <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> them to be visionary.|$|R
5|$|Regarding the {{continuation}} of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> they should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing {{a small number of}} shows in Europe with bassist Dennis Curlee. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.|$|E
5|$|Ste told Amy's father Mike to {{look after}} Lucas and Leah in the {{aftermath}} of the baby plot because he didn't think he was a good father. Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} get on. The sun was burning, <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> chill all over. He was quite empty, <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> quite sick. There was but two hundred yards of smooth pasture {{between him and the}} cottage, <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> could not walk down it. He could hear the stream murmuring only one field beyond it, and yet it seemed to him {{as if it was a}} hundred miles off.|$|R
60|$|Lewisham {{answered}} sketchily. She {{asked him}} another question <b>and</b> another. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> stupid <b>and</b> {{answered with a}} halting truthfulness.|$|R
60|$|When I came back, I found Fulk {{explaining}} why he had spoken at once, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{that she would have}} no scruples about taking the initiative, and that everyone would be having surmises.|$|R
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stripped}} of the victory in previous year's race {{because of an}} underweight car, Audi Sport ABT team principal Hans-Jurgen Abt said his team's objective was to get onto the podium. He acknowledged that getting the victory would not be easy because of the competitiveness of the field. After retiring from the preceding Buenos Aires ePrix, Bird stated that he would enter the Mexico City race with a positive attitude and affirmed his belief in his team <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{there was a possibility}} of getting onto the podium in the event they perform well in qualifying. Mitch Evans reiterated that despite his team Jaguar not scoring points in the season's opening three races, the Buenos Aires race showed that he was becoming more confident and wanted to carry over his momentum from the four-month break. He also said he was excited to compete in the Mexico City event.|$|E
5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{it would be a good}} race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race would be better than Silverstone.|$|E
60|$|The {{big hand}} that forced Slone back {{was far from}} gentle, <b>and</b> again <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the quick rush of blood.|$|R
60|$|She turned round, {{and looked}} up at him, <b>and</b> instinctively <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that {{something}} difficult to answer was coming next.|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} {{clutched his}} hand. There was nothing of affection in her touch, <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> a thrill of delight.|$|R
5|$|As his musings {{developed}} {{along these}} lines, Hazlitt continued to contribute miscellaneous articles to various periodicals. In February 1816, he reviewed August Wilhelm Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature for the Edinburgh Review. The German critic Schlegel showed {{an appreciation for}} Shakespeare of a kind {{that no one in}} Hazlitt's country had yet demonstrated, and Hazlitt, sympathising with many of Schlegel's ideas, felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of Shakespeare's plays. Such a book would provide liberal quotations from the text, and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that he could write it. His writing career was now moving in this direction (he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the Examiner and elsewhere during this period), he needed the money to support his family, and his growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the title page (as a reviewer for periodicals, his contributions were anonymous, as was customary at the time).|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{comic opera}} The Perfect Fool (1923) was {{widely seen as}} a satire of Parsifal, though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically {{received}} at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering concussion. He seemed {{to make a good}} recovery, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> up to accepting an invitation to the US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.|$|E
60|$|Baxter grew pale, {{thinking}} {{he had gone}} too far. But he soon discovered that Jerry still breathed, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> relieved.|$|R
50|$|Apple: Real felt no {{connection}} with Apple and she was too quiet <b>and</b> reserved; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that she wouldn't fit into his lifestyle.|$|R
60|$|But {{she walked}} away from him. She <b>felt</b> as if <b>he</b> had trapped her. <b>He</b> was angry <b>and</b> depressed, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> again despised.|$|R
5|$|Mochitsura Hashimoto {{was born}} in 1909 in Kyoto, Japan the eighth of nine {{children}} and fifth son of a kannushi (Shinto priest). He attended Kyoto Third High School, a prestigious school, where he performed well. In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. The family {{did not have a}} naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> entering his son into the military would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army. Hashimoto {{graduated from high school in}} 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. Leaving home for the first time, Hashimoto then attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima for four years, studying Japanese history, engineering, and naval tactics, as well as judo and other military athletics. He graduated and commissioned in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E
5|$|Qualification for Euro 1988 meant {{winning a}} group {{containing}} Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Scotland. The campaign opened with Belgium at the Heysel Stadium, and though Ireland contained danger man Nico Claesen, {{they had to}} settle for a 2–2 draw after conceding twice from corner-kicks; Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady scored the goals for Ireland. They then dominated Scotland at Lansdowne Road, but failed to find the net and instead drew 0–0. In the return fixture at Hampden Park Mark Lawrenson scored an early goal and another clean sheet won the Irish their first win of qualification. The campaign faltered with a 2–1 loss in Bulgaria, though Charlton was furious with referee Carlos Silva Valente as he felt that both of Lachezar Tanev's goals should not have counted as Nasko Sirakov allegedly pushed Mick McCarthy in the build-up to the first <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that Sirakov was outside the penalty box when he was fouled by Kevin Moran – Valente instead gave a penalty. They picked up another point after a 0–0 draw with Belgium in Dublin. Despite not particularly impressing Ireland then picked up six points with two victories over Luxembourg. They ended the campaign with a 2–0 home win over Bulgaria, Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran the scorers, though Liam Brady (an ever-present in qualification) picked up a two match suspension after lashing out late in the game after being kicked by a Bulgarian. Despite the victory the Irish had to rely on a favour from the Scots in order to qualify, who duly obliged with a 1–0 victory in Sofia to keep Bulgaria one point behind Ireland in the table.|$|E
60|$|Her face crimsoned, {{which was}} not quite what <b>he</b> had expected, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} <b>felt</b> embarrassed.|$|R
60|$|Her {{words came}} to him like numb things. There was little {{expression}} in them, <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that somehow they meant so much.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} the papered door. He had a popular craving for a vivid curtain <b>and</b> this <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{was just a little}} too mild.|$|R
