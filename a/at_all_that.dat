5|$|On May 30, 1968, after {{a wrestling}} show in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Vázquez, and fellow wrestler Popeye Franco, {{were killed by}} a Cantena owner during a fight. Records are unclear if Eusebio Vázquez had any children, {{but it is clear}} that the wrestler who later worked as Espanto Jr. and claimed to be the son of Eusebio Vázquez was not related <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>That</b> Espanto Jr., Jesús Andrade Salas, was allowed to use the name by Espanto II. Later on other Espantos would follow in the {{footsteps}} of the character that Eusebio Vázquez created, including his nephews Espanto IV and V, Los Hijos del Espanto, Espantito, and a new Espanto Jr., son of the original Espanto.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

25|$|Chidgey batted {{normally}} at No 11 {{throughout his}} first-class career, but his highest score {{came in the}} 1909 season when he was sent in as nightwatchman at No 3 against Yorkshire at Bath and made 45, his partnership with the dour Len Braund enabling Somerset to draw the match. He returned to Somerset for the 1919 season after the First World War, but the county then {{cut the number of}} professionals in its team to two in the 1920 season, and he did not play <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> year; he returned, however, for some games in 1921 before leaving finally.|$|E
25|$|Most BWR and PWR {{commercial}} reactors use uranium enriched {{to about}} 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors {{with a high}} neutron economy do not require the fuel to be enriched <b>at</b> <b>all</b> (<b>that</b> is, they can use natural uranium). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency {{there are at least}} 100 research reactors in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment uranium). Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).|$|E

25|$|In {{a recent}} 2016 article, {{an entirely new}} {{communication}} device and non-EEG-based human-computer interface was developed, requiring no visual fixation or ability to move eyes <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>that</b> is based on covert interest in (i.e. without fixing eyes on) chosen letter on a virtual keyboard with letters each having its own (background) circle that is micro-oscillating in brightness in different time transitions, where the letter selection is based on best fit between, on one hand, unintentional pupil-size oscillation pattern, and, on the other hand, the circle-in-background's brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by user's mental rehearsing the words 'bright' and 'dark' in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the circle/letter.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>That,</b> I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E

Two years later, Guzmán entered the recording studio to record A + No Poder, which would become her first studio album in over five years. The album's songs were written by Guzmán and Argentinian musician José Luis Pagán. The singer stated that the album [...] "reflects maturity and growth that has also regains my rock essence since I was pigeonholed as a balladeer but not <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>that</b> is what I am." [...] A + No Poder is Guzmán's first studio album since Único (2009), a critically acclaimed effort that was commercial unsuccessful {{due to lack of}} promotion, according to Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{those of}} most sports, {{baseball}} playing fields can vary significantly {{in size and}} shape. While {{the dimensions of the}} infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of [...] from home plate to the fences in left and right field and [...] to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only [...] from home plate. There are no rules <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> address the height of fences or other structures {{at the edge of the}} outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is [...] from home plate down the line and [...] tall.|$|E
500|$|Alfred, by [...] in {{full control}} of Wessex and {{at the height of}} his power, was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son, Edward, to the {{exclusion}} of his brother Æthelred's heirs. That kingship was never in Alfred's gift, but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward, the stronger he made that son's position in any future contest for the kingship. We must, therefore, treat anything he tells us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution, if not scepticism. The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little. As king, Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns, who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property. It is significant that the case ever came before the witan <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>That</b> it did, suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex.|$|E
