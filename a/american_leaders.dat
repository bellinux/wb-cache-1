5|$|The team's president, Bruce Allen, {{addressed}} a letter dated May 23, 2014, to Senator Reid repeating {{the position that}} the name was originated by Native Americans to refer to themselves, that the logo was also designed and approved by Native <b>American</b> <b>leaders,</b> and {{that the vast majority of}} both Native Americans and the public do not find the name offensive.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native <b>American</b> <b>leaders</b> during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the native tribes ceded large tracts {{of land in the}} west that provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement. Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which laid the foundation for the modern presidential campaign tactics.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Stillman's run was {{a turning}} point. Prior to this battle, Black Hawk had not been {{committed}} to war. Now he determined to avenge {{what he saw as}} the treacherous killing of his warriors under a flag of truce. After Stillman's defeat, <b>American</b> <b>leaders</b> like President Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass would not consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk to serve as an example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine racial biases, {{particularly}} those against Asian Americans in leadership positions, and the intersection of race, leadership, and impression formation. Ninety participants were presented a photo and vignette of either a hypothetical Asian <b>American</b> <b>leader,</b> Black leader, or White leader. Participants then proceeded to answer questions probing their impressions of the leaders, such as perceived competence. Contrary to the hypothesis that the White leader would receive the most favorable ratings across all dependent variables, the findings illustrated that the White leader only scored higher on perceived friendliness than the Black leader and the Asian <b>American</b> <b>leader.</b> Additionally, the Asian <b>American</b> <b>leader</b> did not receive higher ratings than the Black leader on perceived friendliness, perceived competence, and perceived legitimacy, thus showing no support for the hypothesis that the Asian <b>American</b> <b>leader</b> would score higher on all three variables than the Black leader. Lastly, the Black leader did not receive higher ratings than the Asian <b>American</b> <b>leader</b> on charismatic leadership and willingness to follow, contrary to the hypothesis that the Black leader would score higher than the Asian <b>American</b> <b>leader</b> on both variables. Overall, the findings showed partial support for the first hypothesis and no support for the second and third hypotheses. Implications for reducing racial biases and promoting inclusion in the workplace are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The United States' {{occupation}} of Nicaragua and Haiti continued under his administration, but Coolidge withdrew American {{troops from the}} Dominican Republic in 1924. Coolidge led the U.S. delegation to the Sixth International Conference of American States, January 15–17, 1928, in Havana, Cuba. This was the only international trip Coolidge made during his presidency. There, he extended an olive branch to Latin <b>American</b> <b>leaders</b> embittered over America's interventionist policies in Central America and the Caribbean. For 88 years {{he was the only}} sitting president to have visited Cuba, until Barack Obama did so in 2016.|$|E
5|$|These three Native <b>American</b> <b>leaders</b> {{were the}} first to be tried, for raids (Warren Wagon Train Raid) and murder, in a United States civil court instead of a {{military}} court. This would deny them any vestige of rights as prisoners of war by being tried as any common criminal in the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas in Jacksboro, Texas near Fort Richardson.|$|E
5|$|By late 1988, the Pioneer Square station {{structure}} was 70 percent complete, and work had begun on the station's entrances and the vaulted ceiling. The station {{was the subject}} of two controversies during its construction over the use of South African materials in its construction, as the country was then under a Metro boycott for its Apartheid policies. In late 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham was forced to remove steel beams used for temporary shoring at the station box after unknowingly sourcing it from South Africa. Metro later acquired South African black granite {{to be used in the}} station's platform and mezzanine, which was discovered and returned; the incident resulted in the resignation of Metro's executive director, amid outcry from African <b>American</b> <b>leaders.</b>|$|E

5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native <b>American</b> <b>leaders</b> who had signed the treaty. He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and their followers who carried out the terms of the treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native <b>American</b> <b>leaders</b> such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native <b>American</b> <b>leaders</b> came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through Detroit on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged effigies of the Indians.|$|E

5|$|The Australian coaches rested O'Brien for the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay; Peter Tonkin swam the breaststroke leg instead. It {{turned out}} to be a close call for the Australians, as they {{finished}} fourth in their heat and qualified seventh fastest, only 1.2s from elimination. In the final, O'Brien was brought into the team to combine with Peter Reynolds, Berry and Dickson. At the end of Reynolds' backstroke leg, Australia were sixth, 3.4s behind the <b>American</b> <b>leaders.</b> O'Brien dived in and completed his leg in 1min 7.8s, a breaststroke split bettered by only Henninger and Prokopenko. This pulled Australia up to fourth position, 1.7s in arrears of the Americans at the halfway mark. Australia progressed further to finish third behind the United States and Germany in a time of 4min 2.3s, missing the silver by 0.7s.|$|E
