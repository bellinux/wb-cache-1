5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E

25|$|It {{usually takes}} me {{an hour after}} I awaken {{to get all the}} pain out. It used to be easier when I was younger. I have more muscle and joint {{difficulties}} now... Recently the only way I could get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
25|$|Later {{additions}} to the church include toilets, built <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall of the church, and a brick columbarium wall near the entrance, both added in 1995. A rectory, which stood behind the church, was sold and removed in early 2004, and a recent steel building has been constructed in its place. The original timber church has also been demolished. St Paul's continues to function as the main church for the Parish of Proserpine.|$|E

25|$|In the {{background}} of the painting various objects are used to further symbolize the theological significance of the subject. A ladder, referring to Jacob's Ladder, leans <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall, and a dove which represents the Holy Spirit rests on it. Other carpentry implements refer to the Holy Trinity. Millais likely used Albrecht Dürer's print Melancholia I as a source for this imagery, along with quattrocento works. The sheep in the sheepfold seen through the door represent the future Christian flock.|$|E
25|$|Boast: The ball {{is played}} off a side wall at an angle, or the back wall, {{before hitting the}} front wall. A 'three wall boast' has the ball hit at a side wall such that the ball hits the front wall {{followed}} by the opposite side wall before finally hitting the floor. A 'back wall boast' has the ball struck <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall before reaching the front wall. It is typically not recommended to beginners due {{to the risk of}} hitting spectators above and behind players on solid backed courts. A 'trickle boast' is a boast performed at a shallow angle with the front wall at a low trajectory. A 'reverse boast' is a boast played towards the sidewall furtherst from the striker. It is played rarely at high levels due to the high risk of hitting the opponent and the typical ease of counterattack.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E

500|$|Pail toilets with {{municipal}} collection {{persisted in}} Australia {{well into the}} second half of the twentieth century. Brisbane, its third most populous city, relied on [...] "dunny carts" [...] until the 1950s (one source says until the 1970s); because the population was so dispersed, it was difficult to install sewerage. Tar, creosote, and disinfectant kept the smell down. Academic George Seddon claimed that [...] "the typical Australian back yard in the cities and country towns" [...] had, throughout the first half of the twentieth century, [...] "a dunny <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> fence, so that the pan could be collected from the dunny lane through a trap-door" ...|$|E
50|$|Toad in {{the hole}} {{involves}} throwing brass discs at a hole in a box. A variation of this game has been played in pubs in East Sussex, UK, the 'hole' being in the centre of a large wooden seat set <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> seat being a surface to rebound one's shot off. Toad {{in the hole}} is a more refined version of the coin-throwing game Pitch penny.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{faces an}} {{opponent}}, overhooks both arms, and then pivots 180° {{so that the}} opponent is facing upwards {{with his or her}} head pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>back</b> or under an arm of the wrestler. The wrestler then drops down to his/her <b>back,</b> driving <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> opponent's head and neck into the mat.|$|R
50|$|The {{loss of the}} code-share with Jetconnect was a major blow to the airline. They lost {{access to}} Qantas's {{international}} network and had to compete <b>against</b> <b>the</b> government <b>backed</b> Air New Zealand and with a competing Jetconnect. The code-share loss thus resulted in <b>the</b> scaling <b>back</b> of jobs and aircraft.|$|R
500|$|General Thielmann {{then led}} eight Saxon and two Polish cavalry squadrons <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the redoubt, while {{officers}} and sergeants of his command actually forced their horses through the redoubt's embrasures, sowing confusion {{and allowing the}} French cavalry and infantry to take the position. The battle had all but ended, with both sides so exhausted that only the artillery was still at work. At 15:30, the Raevsky redoubt fell {{with most of the}} 24th Division's troops. All the Russian cannoneers in Raevsky also died right next to their cannons, and General Likhachev was captured by the French. [...] But, besides the dead Russian troops were the corpses of 1000 Caulaincourt's cuirassiers, including Caulaincourt himself.|$|E
500|$|With no working prototypes, Green {{set about}} {{building}} seven lifts. The principle was simple. Two caissons were suspended from three carrying wheels of [...] diameter, by wrought iron chains. The caisson {{at the bottom}} was jacked against the front wall of the lift to seal it, and a door or gate was opened to allow the boat to float in. The caisson at the top was jacked <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall in a similar manner. When both boats were in, the doors on the caissons and lift were closed, and the jacks released. Because a boat displaces its own weight in water, the system should be balanced, and {{a small amount of}} energy is required to start the boats moving. When the top caisson reaches the bottom, the jacks are applied, the doors are opened, and the boats can continue.|$|E
500|$|Like many mid-15th century polyptychs, the {{exterior}} panels borrow heavily from the Ghent Altarpiece, [...] which {{was completed in}} 1432. The combination of naturalistic donor portraits with grisaille imitation statues of saints is borrowed from that work, as is {{the treatment of the}} Annunciation. Van der Weyden used iconography in the Beaune exterior panels not found in his other works, which suggests Rolin may have commissioned the altarpiece to follow van Eyck's example. Van der Weyden was not inclined merely to imitate though, and arranged the panels and figures in a concentrated and compact format. Jacobs writes that [...] "{{the exterior}} presents the most consistent pictorial rendering of trompe l'oeil sculpture to date". Gabriel's scroll and Mary's lily appear to be made of stone; the figures cast shadows <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of their niches, creating a sense of depth which adds to the illusion.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler applies an {{inverted}} facelock to a seated opponent and places his far leg between the opponent's legs and pushes his near leg's knee <b>against</b> <b>the</b> opponent's <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> wrestler then pulls the opponent's head backwards {{with their arms}} and the opponent's far leg outwards with their leg.|$|R

500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{arrived at}} the scene at 11:45. His report {{of the crime scene}} described [...] "the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the seat, and the left thigh running {{along the edge of the}} seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as we found the nearside [...] door unlocked." ...|$|E
500|$|The Palazzo dei Conservatori ("Palace of the Conservators") {{was built}} in the Middle Ages for the local {{magistrate}} on top of a sixth-century BC temple dedicated to Jupiter [...] "Maximus Capitolinus". Michelangelo's renovation of it incorporated the first use of a giant order that spanned two storeys, here with a range of Corinthian pilasters and subsidiary Ionic columns flanking the ground-floor loggia openings and the second-floor windows. Michelangelo’s new portico is a reinvention of older ideas. The portico contains entablatures and a flat, coffer-like ceiling. The entablatures rest on columns set at the front of each bay, while matching half-columns stand <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall. Each pilaster forms a compound unit with the pier and column on either side of it. Colossal pilasters set on large bases join the portico and the upper story. All of the windows are capped with segmental pediments. A balustrade fringing the roof emphasizes the emphatic horizontality of the whole against which the vertical lines of the orders rise in majestic contrast. The verticality of the colossal order creates the feeling of a self-contained space while the horizontality of the entablatures and balustrades emphasize the longitudinal axis of the piazza. The palazzo’s facade was updated by Michelangelo in the 1530s and again later numerous times.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Yurovsky Note", {{an account}} of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik {{superiors}} following the killings, was found in 1989 and detailed in Edvard Radzinsky's 1992 book, The Last Tsar. According to the note, {{on the night of the}} deaths the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. Once dressed, the family and the small circle of servants who had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house's sub-basement and told to wait. Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress's request. After several minutes, the guards entered the room, led by Yurovsky, who quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed. The Tsar had time to say only [...] "What?" [...] and turn to his family before he was killed by several bullets to the chest (not, as is commonly stated, to the head; his skull, recovered in 1991, bears no bullet wounds). The Tsarina and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross, but were killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners. The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid. Demidova survived the initial onslaught, but was quickly murdered <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall of the basement, stabbed to death while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub-basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels.|$|E
