25|$|The DACS was {{established}} in the late 1970s. The software community, at that time, recognized the need for data and information <b>about</b> <b>computer</b> software, its development process and the software technology area in general. The rapid expanison of software engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain cognizant of the current status of the software engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in software research and seriously hampered the transfer of technology from the software research environment to the user sector of the software community.|$|E

[...] Consumers deserted the TS1000 once its novelty value had worn off and, as publishers of programming guides found to their cost, the American public showed little interest in using the machine to learn <b>about</b> <b>computer</b> programming. American retailers were left with large stocks of unsold machines. Burned by this experience, many were unwilling to stock the later Timex Sinclair machines in large numbers and the big chain stores dropped the Timex Sinclair line altogether.|$|E

The purpose of this two-stage study was to investigate how baccalaureate nursing faculty learn <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> and what factors influence the learning process. In stage one, the faculty and environment of one university were studied via case study. Face-to-face interviews focused on institutional computer use, perceptions of computer resources, faculty experience with computers, and attitudes and beliefs about the use of computers in nursing and nursing education. In stage two, a sample of five nurse educators skilled in the use of at least one computer software program were interviewed about their learning process and influencing factors. A 43 -item computer skills inventory which addressed knowledge, job relevance, and interest in learning was administered in both stages. Findings supported earlier studies in which nursing faculty reported low levels of computer knowledge and high levels of interest in learning. The finding of this study that nurse educators considered teaching nurses <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> to be irrelevant to their faculty responsibilities has not been reported elsewhere. Other factors influencing learning <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> were availability of resource persons, access to equipment, doctoral study, time, fear, and multiple responsibilities. Faculty also expressed concern about the effects of high technology on patient care. Most faculty learned independently by "hands-on" practice while sitting at the computer. "Play" and "comfort" emerged as important components of the learning process. Faculty who were in the active stage of learning <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> exhibited more anxiety and self-doubt <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> than did either computer users or nonusers...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{variables that}} may enhance medical student’s preparedness for computer-based {{administration of the}} United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). Design: A cross-sectional survey of 301 medical students who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Measurements: The questionnaire was designed to obtain information <b>about</b> students’ <b>computer</b> resources, personal experience with computers, <b>computer</b> expertise, opinions <b>about</b> <b>computers,</b> experience with computer-based testing, perceived preparedness for the computer-based USMLE, and demographic variables. Variables related to students’ perceived preparedness for the computer-based USMLE were identified by ordinal logistic regression. Results: A significant regression model yielded four significant predictors: perceived preparedness for USMLE content (P < 0. 0001), opinions <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> (P < 0. 0012), gender (P < 0. 0001), and a gender by computer-based testing experience interaction (P < 0. 0004). Computer resources, personal experience with computers, computer expertise, age, race, and year of medical school were not significant predictors. Conclusion: Students’ perceived preparedness for computer-based administration of high-stakes examinations may be facilitated by preparing them for examination content, by enhancing their opinions <b>about</b> <b>computers,</b> and by increasing their computer-based testing experiences.

40|$|The {{problem with}} which {{this study was}} {{concerned}} is the association between exposure to computer instruction and changes in attitudes toward computers. The study had a two-fold purpose. The first {{was to determine the}} attitudes of undergraduate students toward computers. The second was to determine whether exposure to information <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> and their uses is associated with changes in students' attitudes toward computers. A computer literacy test was administered to subjects as a pre-and post-test. The major findings of the study indicate that there were significant, positive attitude changes among students exposed to computer instruction. There were also significant increases in knowledge <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> among participants exposed to computer instruction. The major conclusions are that attitudes are not fixed and develop in the process of need satisfaction. Participants in the study experienced attitude changes, which supports the suggestion that attitudes are developmental. Futhermore, the attitude changes observed in the study occurred in the process of learning <b>about</b> <b>computers,</b> a process assumed to be rooted in the educational and/or career needs of the participants. Attitudes are shaped by the information to which people are exposed. Attitude modification seldom, if ever, occurs in a vacuum. Instead, it most often takes place in the context of information dissemination and exposure. In this study, attitudes toward computers changed positively and significantly as participants were exposed to information <b>about</b> <b>computers...</b>|$|R
