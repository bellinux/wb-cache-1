They are entitled to use the title [...] "Scientist." [...] Formerly before the merger between ASCP and the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel (NCA), medical laboratory scientists certified by (ASCP) were entitled to use the credential [...] "MT" [...] (for medical technologist) and if credentialed by (NCA), the credential [...] "CLS" [...] (Clinical Laboratory Scientist) was used. Those certified by the Department of Health Services (HHS formally HEW), the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB) and the American Medical Technologists (AMT) are still entitled to use the credential [...] "MT." [...] Additional certifying agencies include the, National Healthcareer Association, National Phlebotomy Association, the National Center for Competency Testing, and the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools.
