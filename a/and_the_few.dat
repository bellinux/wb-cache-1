5|$|The {{black workers}} {{did most of}} the post-hurricane cleanup work, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> caskets {{available}} for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites. Additionally, the white victims received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in downtown West Palm Beach, which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorial.|$|E
5|$|The {{scope of}} the Christianization mission in its early phase was quite limited geographically, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land. Stone churches and baptisteries were {{discovered}} within the Ostrów Lednicki and Poznań gords, and a chapel in Gniezno. Poznań was also {{the site of the}} first cathedral, the bishopric seat of Jordan and Bishop Unger, who followed him.|$|E
5|$|After an {{hour and}} a half had gone (and twenty minutes had passed since the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E

5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1812, maps of the {{peninsula}} showed a marked increase in buildings: a two-story common prison, a small hospital, officers' quarters, a gunner's house, a turnkey store, fuel sheds, the agent's office and guard house, a bell house, nine sentry boxes, and four oceanside outhouses. Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> African-Americans from the majority white American population. 2078 prisoners were recorded {{by the end of}} 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen. More than 3000 arrived over the next two years, including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the Niagara area.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) {{completed}} its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, {{which meant that}} most of the remaining services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> remaining steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by diesel-electric multiple units. Various plans were proposed at this time to redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by diesel-electric multiple units.|$|E
50|$|In short - {{the lower}} {{unemployment}} is <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>the</b> laborers there are available, {{the higher the}} wages. The contrary is true when the unemployment is high. This {{is the essence of}} the wage curve.|$|R

50|$|The Cowboys were {{second in}} the NFL in scoring (369 points), <b>and</b> led <b>the</b> league in rushing yards (2,276) and total yards (5,122).

5|$|In Rotterdam, though {{reinforced}} by an infantry regiment, the Dutch failed to completely dislodge the German airborne troops from their bridgehead {{on the northern}} bank of the Maas. Despite permission from General Kurt Student, the German commander in Rotterdam refused to evacuate this bridgehead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> German defenders held fast in a single office building, protected by a canal {{in front of them}} and covered by fire from the south bank. The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug. The German forces involved in the attack of the previous day on The Hague also held out, none of the attempts to eliminate the isolated groups of in total about 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces met with success.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense began {{play from}} the Hoosiers' 34-yard line {{following}} the kick. Paci scrambled for several yards, then completed a {{pass for a}} first down at the 50-yard line. On the next play, however, Paci fumbled the ball, which bounced {{into the hands of}} Tech defensive end Lawrence Lewis, who returned it 20yards for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Tech a 2113 lead with 23 seconds remaining before halftime. Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech 42-yard line, potentially setting up an Indiana field goal try before halftime. Paci completed a pass to the 36-yard line, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> seconds remaining in the first half apparently ran off the clock before Indiana could use its final timeout to stop the clock.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling dystopia. Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E
5000|$|The Bills had a {{dominant}} defense in 1988: {{they gave up}} <b>the</b> <b>fewest</b> points (237) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fewest</b> total yards (4,578) in the AFC in 1988. The defensive unit was given the nickname [...] "Blizzard Defense," [...] alluding to Buffalo's harsh winters.|$|R

5|$|The Balts or Baltic peoples, {{or their}} Indo-European protoplasts, have settled (at {{different}} times different parts of) {{the territory of}} today's northeast Poland {{as well as the}} lands located further north and east, generally east of the lower Vistula River, the Baltic seashore north of there including and past the Sambian peninsula, and the inland area east of the above regions (some of their ancestors came from as far east as the upper Oka River), from the early Iron Age. The analysis of the Baltic historic range has been aided by the studies of their characteristic toponyms and hydronyms, in addition to the examination of the archeological record <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> ancient written sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{was found}} {{interesting}} enough that living specimens {{were sent to}} Europe and the East. The number of transported dodos that reached their destinations alive is uncertain, and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> non-fossil remains in European museums. Based {{on a combination of}} contemporary accounts, paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven transported dodos reached their destinations alive.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> people who criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|Western interpretations {{include the}} 2003 American film The Last Samurai {{directed}} by Edward Zwick, which combines {{into a single}} narrative historical situations belonging both to the Boshin War, the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion, and other similar uprisings of ex-samurai during the early Meiji period. The elements of the movie pertaining to the early modernization of Japan's military forces {{as well as the}} direct involvement of foreign (mostly French) forces relate to the Boshin War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> years leading to it. However, the suicidal stand of traditionalist samurai forces led by Saigō Takamori against the modernized Imperial army relate to the much later Satsuma Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|William Bryan and {{his wife}} donated land and built a school at nearby Glenore in 1862. The Bryans left a bequest that fully funded the school until 1914, when the state's {{education}} department assumed responsibility for {{the building and the}} teacher's salary. By 1921 56 students were attending. The building had been condemned by 1926 and a new brick school building was built a short distance away. Following a direction by Mrs Bryan in her bequest, the school was used at times for religious services, by Methodists and Anglicans. Due to low attendance the school was closed in 1941 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> remaining pupils continued schooling at Whitemore.|$|E

5|$|Without {{the means}} to {{effectively}} resist the Japanese offensive in the Solomons, the British Resident Commissioner of the Solomon Islands protectorate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> Australian troops assigned to defend Tulagi evacuated the island just before the Japanese forces arrived on 3 May. The next day, however, a U.S. aircraft carrier task force en route to resist the Japanese forces advancing on Port Moresby (later {{taking part in the}} Battle of the Coral Sea) struck the Japanese Tulagi landing force in an air attack, destroying or damaging several of the Japanese ships and aircraft involved in the landing operation. Nevertheless, the Japanese troops successfully occupied Tulagi and began the construction of a small naval base.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
5|$|By 1710 the {{population}} of Manche Ch'ol in Belén had fallen to just four; everyone else had {{died as a result}} of disease, hunger and melancholy. By 1770 the Manche Ch'ol were all but extinct; their original territory had been abandoned and had reverted to wilderness, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> survivors relocated to the highlands numbered not more than 300 in the whole Urran Valley, where there were almost as many Spanish and ladinos. Many Manche Ch'ol in Verapaz were absorbed into the expanding Q'eqchi' Maya population, which gradually occupied the vacated Manche lands. It is possible that a few Manche Ch'ol survived in the forested interior of Toledo District in Belize, to be later absorbed by incoming Q'eqchi' in the late 19th century. In the very early part of the 19th century, a handful of Maya were still recorded as speaking Ch'ol in Cobán.|$|E
