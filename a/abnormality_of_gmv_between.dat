40|$|Objective: Little {{is known}} about the {{pathological}} mechanism of early adult onset depression (EOD) and later adult onset depression (LOD). We seek to determine whether grey matter volume (GMV) change in EOD and LOD are different, which could also delineate EOD and LOD. Methods: In present study, 147 first-episode, drug-naive patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), age between 18 and 45, were divided into two groups on the basis of age of MDD onset: the early adult onset group (age 18 – 29) and the later adult onset group (age 30 – 44), and a total of 130 gender-, and age-, matched healthy controls (HC) were also divided into two groups which fit for each patient group. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on all subjects. The voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach was employed to analyze the images. Results: Widespread <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>GMV</b> throughout parietal, temporal, limbic regions, occipital cortex and cerebellum were observed in MDD patients. Compare to young HC, reduced GMV in right fusiform gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, vermis III and increased GMV in right middle occipital gyrus were seen in the EOD group. In contrast, relative to old HC, decreased GMV in the right hippocampus and increased GMV in the left middle temporal gyrus were observed in the LOD group. Compared to the LOD group, the EOD group had smaller GMV in right posterior cingulate cortex. There was no significant correlation <b>between</b> <b>GMV</b> <b>of</b> the right posterior cingulate cortex and the score of the depression rating scale in patients group. Conclusions: The <b>GMV</b> <b>of</b> the brain areas that were related to mood regulation was decreased in the first-episode, drug-naive adult patients with MDD. Adult patients with EOD and LOD exhibited different GMV changes relative to each age-matched comparison group, suggesting depressed adult patients with different age-onset might have different pathological mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Background: Convergent {{studies suggest}} that {{morphological}} <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> frontal-subcortical circuits which involved with emotional and cognitive processing {{may contribute to the}} pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Antidepressant treatment which has been reported to reverse the functional <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> frontal-subcortical circuits in MDD may have treating effects to related brain morphological abnormalities. In this study, we used voxel-based morphometry method to investigate whole brain structural abnormalities in single episode, medication-naı̈ve MDD patients. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of an 8 weeks pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine. Methods: 28 single episode, medication-naı̈ve MDD participants and 28 healthy controls (HC) acquired the baseline high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scan. 24 MDD participants acquired a follow-up sMRI scan after 8 weeks antidepressant treatment. Gray matter volumetric (<b>GMV)</b> difference <b>between</b> groups was examined. Results: Medication-naı̈ve MDD had significantly decreased GMV in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left middle frontal gyrus as well as increased GMV in the left thalamus and right insula compared to HC (P, 0. 05, corrected). Moreover, treated MDD had significantly increased GMV in the left middle frontal gyrus and right orbitofrontal cortex compared to HC (P, 0. 05, corrected).

Applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in a larger cohort of patients with BPD, we sought to extend earlier findings <b>of</b> volume <b>abnormalities</b> in limbic regions and to evaluate the influence of co-occurring PTSD in BPD patients. We used voxel-based morphometry to study gray matter volume (GMV) in 60 healthy controls (HC) and 60 patients with BPD.

In turn, yoga meditation practices may induce the state of mindfulness, which, when evoked recurrently through repeated practice, may accrue into trait or dispositional mindfulness. Putatively, these changes may be mediated by experience-dependent neuroplastic changes. Though prior studies have identified differences in gray matter volume (<b>GMV)</b> <b>between</b> long-term mindfulness practitioners and controls, no studies to date have reported on whether yoga meditation is associated with GMV differences.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore {{possible}} changes in whole brain gray matter volume (GMV) after spinal cord injury (SCI) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and to study their associations with the injury duration, severity, and clinical variables. In total, 21 patients with SCI (10 with complete and 11 with incomplete SCI) and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The 3 D high-resolution T 1 -weighted structural images of all subjects were obtained using a 3. 0 Tesla MRI system. Disease duration and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scale scores were also obtained from each patient. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was carried out to investigate the differences in <b>GMV</b> <b>between</b> patients with SCI and HCs, and between the SCI sub-groups. Associations <b>between</b> <b>GMV</b> and clinical variables were also analyzed. Compared with HCs, patients with SCI showed significant GMV decrease in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insular cortex, bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and right superior temporal gyrus. No significant difference in GMV in these areas was found either between the complete and incomplete SCI sub-groups, or between the sub-acute (duration 1 year) sub-groups. Finally, the <b>GMV</b> <b>of</b> the right OFC was correlated with the clinical motor scores of left extremities in not only all SCI patients, but especially the CSCI subgroup.

We hypothesized that AVPR 1 A RS 3 variants affect altruistic behavior by modulating the gray matter volume (<b>GMV)</b> <b>of</b> specific brain regions in a sex-specific manner. We investigated 278 young healthy adults using the Dictator Game to assess altruistic behavior. All subjects were genotyped and main effect of AVPR 1 A RS 3 repeat polymorphisms and interaction of genotype-by-sex on the GMV were assessed in a voxel-wise manner. We observed that male subjects with relatively short repeats allocated less money to others and exhibited a significantly smaller GMV in the right fusiform face area (FFA) compared with male long homozygotes. In male subjects, the <b>GMV</b> <b>of</b> the right FFA exhibited a significant positive correlation with altruistic behavior. A mixed mediation and moderation analysis further revealed both a significant mediation effect <b>of</b> the <b>GMV</b> <b>of</b> the right FFA on the association between AVPR 1 A RS 3 repeat polymorphisms and allocation sums and a significant moderation effect of sex (only in males) on the mediation effect.

High-resolution structural T 1 -weighted MR images of 71 healthy young individuals were processed using voxel-based morphometric (VBM) approach. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify the associations between personality traits and gray matter volume (GMV). The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Short Scale for Chinese was chosen to assess the personality traits. This scale includes four dimensions, namely, extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, and lie. Particularly, we studied on two dimensions (extraversion and neuroticism) of Eysenck’s personality. Our results showed that extraversion was negatively correlated with <b>GMV</b> <b>of</b> the bilateral amygdala, the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the left superior frontal gyrus, {{all of which are}} involved in emotional and social cognitive processes.
