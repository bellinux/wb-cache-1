5|$|From {{the point}} of view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such <b>as</b> <b>between</b> {{different}} breeds.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such <b>as</b> <b>between</b> the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such <b>as</b> <b>between</b> lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such <b>as</b> <b>between</b> sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E

5|$|The death {{count on}} the rebel side has {{variously}} been given <b>as</b> <b>between</b> 727 and 2,700, with royalist losses of 27 who were buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Westonzoyland, which {{was used as a}} prison for rebel soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated <b>as</b> <b>between</b> £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Great Council on 7 July, Andronikos' offer was accepted. The council sent notices to the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea—Negroponte, Nauplia, Tinos and Mykonos, and the vassal Duke of Naxos—to prepare ships to take {{possession}} of the city, while the Republic's bailo at Constantinople was instructed to secure the assent of Emperor Manuel. A week later Santo Venier and Niccolo Giorgio were named provveditori (plenipotentiary envoys) and tasked with going to Greece and, if the Despot Andronikos were still willing, take over the city and arrange for its defence by hiring mercenaries. After that, Giorgio was {{to go before the}} Sultan, inform him of Venice's acquisition of the city and justify it as an expedient to prevent the city from being captured by other Christians, who might have been hostile to the Sultan. The envoys were also to arrange for peace both between the Sultan and the Republic, as well <b>as</b> <b>between</b> the Sultan and Emperor Manuel. Emperor Manuel evidently gave his assent to the proposal, for on 14 September 1423 six Venetian galleys, accompanied by one Byzantine galley, entered the harbour of Thessalonica. The Venetians were greeted by a jubilant population as saviours. For the Thessalonians, Venetian rule meant not only security from the Turks—some 5,000 Ottoman troops were besieging the city—but also a secure flow of supplies.|$|E

5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such <b>as</b> <b>between</b> mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published <b>as</b> <b>Between</b> Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number <b>as</b> <b>between</b> 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E

5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} <b>as</b> <b>between</b> 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E

5|$|I-8 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System and is {{eligible}} for the State Scenic Highway System from I-5 to the western junction of SR98, though it is not an official state scenic highway. It is officially known as the Border Friendship Route from San Diego to the Arizona state line. The Interstate is signed as the Ocean Beach Freeway west of I-5. For the entire length within San Diego County and into Imperial County, it is signed as the Kumeyaay Highway, after the local Native American tribe and their traditional trade route which the Interstate follows. Between Old Town and El Cajon, I-8 is called the Mission Valley Freeway. In 2014, I-8 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 11,800vehicles between Bonds Corner Road and SR115, as well <b>as</b> <b>between</b> SR98 and Imperial Highway, and 239,000vehicles between I-805 and I-15, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in California.|$|E
