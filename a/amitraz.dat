25|$|Ivermectin is {{the normal}} {{treatment}} for riding rabbits and small mammals of Haemaphysalis leporispalustris. Insecticides such as pyrethrin, permethrin, and <b>amitraz</b> are dangerous to small mammals {{and must be}} avoided.|$|E
25|$|Decreased {{intestinal}} motility {{can also be}} the result of drugs such as <b>Amitraz,</b> which is used to kill ticks and mites. Xylazine, detomidine, and butorphanol also reduce motility, but will not cause colic if appropriately administered.|$|E
25|$|Greyhounds {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to insecticides. Many vets do not recommend the use of flea collars or flea spray on Greyhounds if the product is a pyrethrin-based. Products like Advantage, Frontline, Lufenuron, and <b>Amitraz</b> are safe for use on Greyhounds, however, and are very effective in controlling fleas and ticks.|$|E
25|$|Another crucial {{preventive}} measure {{is the use}} of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (<b>Amitraz),</b> phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (pyrethroids). These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.|$|E
25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently had a sudden decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in plasma volume (hypovolemia of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the water content of the ingesta and increasing risk of impaction. <b>Amitraz</b> has also been associated with large colon impaction, due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption of water and dehydration of ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course roughage, dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{chemical}} controls include [...] "hard" [...] chemicals such as <b>Amitraz</b> (marketed as Apivar [...] ), fluvalinate (marketed as Apistan), and coumaphos (marketed as CheckMite). [...] "Soft" [...] chemical controls include thymol (marketed as ApiLife-VAR and Apiguard), sucrose octanoate esters (marketed as Sucrocide), {{oxalic acid}} and formic acid (sold in gel packs as Mite-Away, but {{also used in}} other formulations). [...] According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, when used in beehives as directed, these treatments kill {{a large proportion of}} the mites while not substantially disrupting bee behavior or life span. [...] Use of chemical controls is generally regulated and varies from country to country. [...] With few exceptions, they are not intended for use during production of marketable honey.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) re-assessed the {{classification}} for <b>amitraz</b> to a non-quantifiable “Suggestive Evidence of Carcinogenicity” descriptor, and in 2013 determined that quantification of risk using a non-linear approach for <b>amitraz</b> will adequately {{account for all}} chronic toxicity, including carcinogenicity, that could result from exposure to <b>amitraz</b> and its metabolites. [...] Accidental exposure of men to greater amounts of <b>amitraz</b> can lead to death due to respiratory failure, mainly after oral uptake or inhalation. In Turkey during 1989, 41 cases of deadly <b>amitraz</b> intoxications have been detected. The observed toxic dose in about 50% of these patients has been 0.3 g to 1.25 g of 12.5% <b>amitraz</b> formulations and 0.5 to 2 g of 20% formulations. The remaining patients took doses up to 10 g. [...] Other frequently occurring symptoms after massive <b>amitraz</b> intoxication are CNS depression, respiratory depression, miosis, hypothermia, hyperglycemia, loss of consciousness, vomiting and bradycardia.|$|E
5000|$|In {{case of an}} <b>amitraz</b> {{overdose}} {{in humans}} atipamezole or yohimbine, which act as α2-antagonists, {{can be used as}} antidote. [...] Initially it is important to remove the patient from the <b>amitraz</b> contaminated area. When <b>amitraz</b> has been inhaled the patient should first get respiratory protection. Additionally the patient should be supplied with 4 L oxygen per minute. [...] In case of an intoxication via skin-contact, contaminated clothes should be removed first. Affected areas need to be washed with water. If eyes have been exposed to <b>amitraz,</b> anesthesia should be administered and the eyes carefully washed. [...] After the oral intake of <b>amitraz</b> it is important to make the patient drink ca. 0.3 L water to reduce amitraz´ irritating effect on the gullet. [...] Furthermore, it is important to prevent the patient as much as possible from vomiting, {{to reduce the risk of}} further aspiration of <b>amitraz.</b> Subsequently, the patient need to be observed for at least 24 hours to ensure that the symptoms do not recur.|$|E
50|$|These can {{be traced}} back to the {{mechanisms}} of action, which lead to a wide field of effects, including direct lethality, excitant-repellant behavioral effects, and chemosterilization for the target species. In addition, it generally causes low damage to nontarget species, which is one of the advantages of <b>amitraz.</b> Furthermore, <b>amitraz</b> is especially effective against insects such as spider mites and ticks in their juvenile and resistant forms.For agricultural purposes <b>amitraz</b> is primarily used to control the pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyricola) on Oregon pear crops and whiteflies and mites on cotton or pear crops.It's also applied to pome fruit, citrus fruit, cotton, stone fruit, bush fruit, strawberries, hops, cucurbits, aubergines, capsicums, tomatoes and ornamental plants to control all stages of tetranychid and eriophyid mites, pear suckers, scale insects, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids and eggs and first instar larvae of lepidoptera.To apply <b>amitraz,</b> various techniques can be used such as an airblast and concentrate spray to pears or by ground boom and aircraft to cotton.Territorial differences in <b>amitraz</b> use depend on the species of mites that infest the crops/trees/etc., the local practice, and the number and size of the pear trees. An infestation e.g. by Tetranychus spp requires higher rates of <b>amitraz.</b> Taking those factors into consideration the application volumes of <b>amitraz</b> have been standardized in terms of maximum spray concentration and in the rate of <b>amitraz</b> per hectare.|$|E
5000|$|Like other {{formamidines}} <b>amitraz</b> inhibits {{the synthesis}} of prostaglandin E2 from arachidonic acid by bovine seminal vesicle microsomes. [...] In a dose of 5 to 80 mg/kg body weight, given intraperitoneally to rats, <b>amitraz</b> reduces yeast-onduces fever and antagonizes the carageenin-induced swelling of the hind paw. [...] Some of the physiological effects of <b>amitraz</b> probably {{go back to this}} aspirin-like activity and occur due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amitraz</b> is {{a central}} alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist. That means that it {{selectively}} stimulates alpha adrenergic receptors, which are metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, that are usually targeted by catecholamines. Stimulating these receptors is in great extent {{the reason for the}} neurotoxic and preconvulsant effects of <b>amitraz.</b> Xylene present in <b>amitraz</b> formulations additionally induces central nervous system depression.Adrenergic Receptors can be divided into two subclasses, alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic receptors. To determine whether <b>amitraz</b> interacts with subclass 1 oder subclass 2, subcutaneous injections of <b>amitraz</b> (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) were given to mice. Consequently, a dose-dependent delay of gastrointestinal transit in conscious mice occurs. This effect could be antagonized by alpha2-adrenergic blocking agents, but administration of other antagonists did not reduce the depressant effect on the gastrointestinal transit. So it is suggested that amitraz-induced delay of gastrointestinal transit is mediated by postjunctional alpha2-adrenergic receptors and appears not to involve the activation of β-adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, GABAergic, or opioid receptors.Besides the neurotoxic effects other clinical effects observed in <b>amitraz</b> poisoning are related to alpha2-adrenergic agonistic activity. Adrenergic receptors are present in many different cells. The activation of these receptors by an agonist as <b>amitraz</b> generally induces a sympathetic response. This leads to an increased heart rate, dilation of the pupils, elevation of blood pressure and blood and energy supply focus on skeletal muscles.|$|E
50|$|Mitaban Liquid Concentrate (<b>amitraz)</b> {{contents}} include: 19.9% N’-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N-methyl-N-methyl-methanimidamide (w/w); xylol, propylene oxide, with a {{blend of}} exthoxylated polyethers and alkyl benzene sulfonates. Classified as a diamide, <b>amitraz</b> is somewhat yellow. It melts at approximately 86 °C and is only slightly water-soluble.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amitraz</b> (development code BTS27419) is a non-systemic {{acaricide}} and insecticide and {{has also}} {{been described as a}} scabicide. It was first synthesized by the Boots Co. in England in 1969. <b>Amitraz</b> has been found to have an insect repellent effect, works as an insecticide and also as a pesticide synergist. Its effectiveness is traced back on alpha-adrenergic agonist activity, interaction with octopamine receptors of the central nervous system and inhibition of monoamine oxidases and prostaglandin synthesis. [...] Therefore, it leads to overexcitation and consequently paralysis and death in insects. Because <b>amitraz</b> is less harmful to mammals, <b>amitraz</b> is among many other purposes best known as insecticide against mite- or tick-infestation of dogs.|$|E
50|$|Animal studies {{revealed}} that damages due to <b>amitraz</b> poisoning can be recovered even after {{exposure to a}} potentially lethal dose. This could mean that amitraz' effects are reversible or at least are recoverable.When an <b>amitraz</b> poisoning is lethal, death results from respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amitraz</b> {{is used as}} a pesticide. Therefore, <b>amitraz</b> {{exposure}} to humans occurs mainly through inhalation or dermal contact with the compound during its use or production.The toxic effects to humans following on amitraz-uptake include loss of consciousness, vomiting, respiratory failure, miosis, hypothermia, bradycardia, hyperglycemia and central nervous system depression.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hydrolysis}} {{reactions of}} <b>amitraz</b> strongly {{depend on the}} environmental pH. Even though <b>amitraz</b> undergoes hydrolysis reactions at any pH, spectrophotometry, HPLC, and GC-MS studies revealed that pH-depending differences occur, affecting both the sort of reaction-products and the reaction rate. [...] Under basic conditions (pH>6) <b>amitraz</b> is metabolized to 2,4-dimethylphenylformamide. Followed by hydrolysis to 2,4-dimethylaniline, which also benefits from a basic pH. [...] At very acidic pH (pH<3) 2,4-dimethylaniline has been observed as the main degradation product. Under less acidic conditions (pH 3-6) mainly N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N′-methylformamidine and already amounts of 2,4-dimethylphenylformamide occur.|$|E
5000|$|Besides its {{application}} as pesticide on plants, <b>amitraz</b> {{is also used}} as an animal ectoparasiticide on cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and dogs. In these applications, it is exclusively applied externally. It achieves special efficiency against mites (first of all Demodex canis), but it also works against lice, flies, and all development stages of ticks. [...] In combination with additional agents {{it can be used}} against flea-infestation as well.For the treatment of dogs <b>amitraz</b> is available as a collar or as a spray- or wash-solution and has an immediate effect against tick infestation as well as a preventive effect.In some countries <b>amitraz</b> emulsions are also applied to treat Demodicosis of cats or dogs, an exceeding infestation of mites of the family Demodicidae.For the treatment of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs <b>amitraz</b> is available as spray- or wash-solution, to treat or prevent infestations by mites, lice, flies and ticks. Thereby pigs and cattle should be sprayed and sheep and goats bathed.Other animal species [...] - [...] horses or Chihuahuas, for example [...] - [...] should not be treated with <b>amitraz</b> because adverse effects may occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} <b>amitraz</b> includes different mechanisms of action leading to toxic effects in humans {{as well as}} in animals.Many of these effects and most of the effects on humans are caused by its alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. Furthermore, <b>amitraz</b> inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, interacts with the octopamine receptors of the central nervous system and inhibits monoamine oxidases.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>amitraz</b> {{most common}} use is as a pesticide, it is {{important}} to consider that between animals and plants often different pathways for biotransformation occur. Most animal species, including humans can metabolize <b>amitraz</b> rapidly to form six metabolites during biotransformation, N-methyl-N&prime;-(2,4-xylyl)formamide, Form- 2'4'xylidine, 4-N-Methyl-formidoyl) amino-meta-toluix acid, 4-Formamido-meta-toluic acid, 4- Acetamido- meta-toluic acid and 4- Amino- meta- toluic acid.In rats the metabolic pathway (figure 3) has been examined after oral administration of 14C-labelled <b>amitraz,</b> which was found to be effectively metabolized, degraded and excreted to four of the metabolites in urine and six in faeces.The metabolic pathway or rate did not differ between the sexes.|$|E
50|$|Mitaban (<b>amitraz)</b> is {{prescribed}} for generalized mange; i.e., Demodex canis, {{a disease of}} dogs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amitraz</b> is {{particularly}} effective against acarids, {{but it is}} used as a pesticide in many different fields. Therefore, <b>amitraz</b> is available in many different forms, such as a wettable powder, an emulsifiable concentrate, a soluble concentrate/liquid, and an impregnated collar (for dogs).It is characterized as an insect repellent, insecticide, and pesticide synergist. These are the properties which make it especially useful as a pesticide: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{repellent}} effect causes insects to {{turn away}} from their target as this is treated with <b>amitraz.</b>|$|E
50|$|In vitro a monoamine oxidase-inhibiting {{effect of}} <b>amitraz</b> has been found. Monoamine oxidases {{catalyze}} the oxidative deamination of monoamines and thereby form flavoproteins and inactivate neurotransmitters.However, in vivo {{it has been}} observed that only at high doses of <b>amitraz</b> or its main metabolite N-2,4-dimethylphenyl-N-methyl-formamide monoamine oxidase inhibition occurs. In dogs {{it has been observed}} that after administration of such a dose an increase in plasma glucose and suppression of insulin occurs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} of this {{synthesis}} route to an N-arylformamidine as <b>amitraz</b> is the reaction of a substituted formamide, usually a dialkylformamide, with an aniline. To gain <b>amitraz</b> N-methyl formamide and 2,4 dimethyl aniline hydrochloride can be used (figure 1). This reaction is catalyzed {{by the presence of}} acid halides, such as POC3, SOC2, COCG2, or an arylsulfonylhalide, as p-toluene sulfonyl chloride (figure 1). [...] This yields an intermediate, which reacts further as its catalyzed by p-toluene acid to N, N'-dimethylidyne di-2,4-xylidine (<b>amitraz).</b> [...] Alternatively, the aniline in the first step can be replaced by an arylformamide. In addition the replacement of the dialkylformamide with an N-alkylpyrrolidone can be used to obtain products of the clenpyrin group from this reaction.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{pesticide}} synergist it {{also increases}} {{the effect of}} some other pesticides if they are combined with <b>amitraz.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since its {{discovery}} by Boots Co. in 1969 {{three main}} synthesis routes for <b>amitraz</b> has been developed, which {{stand out in}} terms of facility and generality.|$|E
50|$|Mitaban is a {{brand name}} parasiticidal drug labeled in the United States for use in dogs with demodectic mange. The active {{ingredient}} is <b>amitraz.</b> The mechanism of action for <b>amitraz</b> is may be unknown; however, the most current data available suggest the drug may act on the central nervous system. Fertility impairment studies have not been conducted in canines with Mitaban. It is not known whether it may cause impairment of fertility in dogs. Its vapors contain xylene. It is highly effective in ridding dogs from mites.|$|E
50|$|Ivermectin is {{the normal}} {{treatment}} for riding rabbits and small mammals of Haemaphysalis leporispalustris. Insecticides such as pyrethrin, permethrin, and <b>amitraz</b> are dangerous to small mammals {{and must be}} avoided.|$|E
50|$|Decreased {{intestinal}} motility {{can also be}} the result of drugs such as <b>Amitraz,</b> which is used to kill ticks and mites. Xylazine, detomidine, and butorphanol also reduce motility, but will not cause colic if appropriately administered.|$|E
5000|$|While {{federal law}} {{apparently}} mostly restricts this drug to veterinary prescription, a generic form is {{offered for sale}} over the internet, evidently not from the US. [...] A Preventic collar for dogs containing <b>Amitraz</b> is sold over the counter, as for example on Amazon.|$|E
50|$|Greyhounds {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to insecticides. Many vets do not recommend the use of flea collars or flea spray on Greyhounds if the product is a pyrethrin-based. Products like Advantage, Frontline, Lufenuron, and <b>Amitraz</b> are safe for use on Greyhounds, however, and are very effective in controlling fleas and ticks.|$|E
5000|$|As {{illustrated}} in figure 3 {{the first step is}} a hydrolysis reaction to N-methyl-N'-(2,4-xylyl)-formamidine, which already can be excreted in the urine but is still pharmacological active. Depending on the dose, the quantity of this metabolite in the urine can vary from 4% at low doses to 23%-38% at high doses (e.g. in case of rats: 1-100 mg per kg body weight).As it isn't excreted it also can be oxidized to 4-N-Methyl-formidoyl)amino-meta-toluic acid, which can be further oxidized to 4-formamido-meta-toluic acid.Form-2,4-xylidine is formed directly by hydrolysis from <b>amitraz</b> or arises from N-methyl- N'-(2,4-xylyl)formamidine. [...] During this early stage of biotransformation N-methyl- N'-(2,4-xylyl) formamidine and Form-2,4-xylidine may already form conjugates.But the major route followed after the formation of Form-2,4-xylidine is the oxidation to 4-formamido-meta-toluic acid, which is further metabolized to its acetyl conjugate, 4-acetamido-meta-toluic acid or 4-amino- meta-toluic acid.4-formamido- meta-toluic acid and 4-acetamido- meta-toluic acid make 32% of the metabolites found in urine and are detected at any administered dose. Therefore, they are considered as two of the major metabolites in the <b>amitraz</b> pathway. Form-2',4'-xylidide and 4-amino- meta-toluic acid account only for 2% of the total excretion.In insects different metabolites are formed. N-methyl- N'-(2,4-xylyl)formamidine, Form-2,4-xylidine and 4-Amino-meta-toluic acid occur, but in addition several unidentified metabolites were detected, too.In plants the biotransformation of <b>amitraz</b> proceeds very rapidly. The predominant metabolites detected are N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N'-methylformamidine (BST 27 271) and 2,4-dimethylformanilide (BST 27 919).|$|E
5000|$|Adverse {{effects in}} mammals {{are caused by}} amitraz' alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. Symptoms can include low blood {{pressure}} and pulse, hypothermia, lethargy, absence of appetite, vomiting, increased blood sugar and digestive problems. [...] Furthermore, skin- or mucosa-irritations may occur in dogs {{as a response to}} an <b>amitraz</b> containing collar. This can lead to itching, eczema, alopecia or conjunctivitis.|$|E
50|$|Because the louse {{have neither}} {{free-living}} stages nor vectors for infection of H. suis, control is difficult when using insecticides and quarantines. Sows {{can be treated}} with avermectin, a common therapy treating arthropods and nematodes, prior to farrowing to keep lice from moving to younger hogs. Pesticides such as <b>amitraz,</b> coumaphos, and fenthion {{can be used in}} hay bedding for prevention.|$|E
50|$|Another crucial {{preventive}} measure {{is the use}} of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (<b>Amitraz),</b> phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (pyrethroids). These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.|$|E
50|$|Acaricides are {{pesticides}} {{that kill}} {{members of the}} Acari group, which includes ticks and mites. Acaricides were at one time an effective method in regulating the transmission of V. jacobsoni in honey bees, but the buildup of residues in acaricide-resistant strains have decreased the effectiveness of mite control in honey bees. Among those acaricides used are acrinathrin, <b>amitraz,</b> bromopropylate, chlordimeform, coumaphos, flumethrin, and fluvalinate. Fluvalinate {{is the most effective}} acaricide.|$|E
