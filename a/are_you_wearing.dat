6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Jimmy, {{who looked}} at him with sudden sympathy. [...] "Still, I fancied you told me you had no near relatives. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> those clothes for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goloshes, Julia!" [...] exclaimed {{her sister}} [...] "Goodness me, don't {{you know what}} goloshes <b>are?</b> <b>You</b> <b>wear</b> them over your... over your boots, Gretta, isn't it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All right?" [...] asked Mr. Medill, {{reflecting}} the sheer astonishment of the others; [...] "then why the devil <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> yourself out? And {{why are we}} spending our time and money on you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That next Sunday as I drank my tea I interrogated my wife. [...] "How is this Sunday {{different}} from all other Sundays, little woman? What has happened? Have you altered the curtains, or re-arranged the furniture, or where is the indefinable difference of it? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> your hair {{in a new way}} without warning me? I perceive a change clearly, and I cannot {{for the life of me}} say what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, mother," [...] Chris {{said as they}} started, [...] "that {{what seems}} so easy now will {{be too much for}} many of the women. We started without breakfast, and unless we can get {{something}} by the way I doubt if many will reach the town to-night. Of course for the men it is nothing. Very often when I have been out on the veldt and have started early, I have had nothing till I got back late in the evening. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> that veil for, mother? I saw that you pulled it down over your face yesterday afternoon. I suppose you did it to keep the dust out of your eyes, but there is none now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] he said, [...] "I {{listen to}} you eagerly, and yet I <b>am</b> puzzled. <b>You</b> <b>wear</b> the uniform of an English officer, but you come to me, is it not so, as an {{emissary}} of Germany?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Conspirators. Why {{do you not}} say the word? Well, because {{sometimes}} one wearies even of conspiracy. Just now we triumph and can take our ease. I wish {{to make the most}} of it. What ring <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> upon your finger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> {{a look of}} idiotic {{complacency}} in a Turkish bath," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "it is the more noticeable {{from the fact that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> nothing else." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is only a}} {{deviation}} from those ordinary rules of school life, which one observes naturally and without thinking, that enables one to realise how strong public-school prejudices really are. At a school, for instance, where the regulations say that coats only of black or dark blue are to be worn, a boy who appears one day {{in even the most}} respectable and unostentatious brown finds himself looked on with a mixture of awe and repulsion, which would be excessive if he had sand-bagged the headmaster. So in the case of boots. School rules decree that a boy shall go to his form-room in boots, There is no real reason why, if the day is fine, he should not wear shoes, should he prefer them. But, if he does, the thing creates a perfect sensation. Boys say, [...] "Great Scott, what have you got on?" [...] Masters say, [...] "Jones, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> on your feet?" [...] In the few minutes which elapse between the assembling of the form for call-over and the arrival of the form-master, some wag is sure either to stamp on the shoes, accompanying the act with some satirical remark, or else to pull one of them off, and inaugurate an impromptu game of football with it. There was once a boy who went to school one morning in elastic-sided boots....|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, it is {{considered}} to be a gently derogatory comment, that can be used to a friend. An example might be 'Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> a coat? That's a bit nesh isn't it?'.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{taking a}} cue from Ronson's glam-rock experience, Dylan made the {{surprising}} theatrical choice of wearing whiteface make-up at many of the shows. Sometimes, he even walked on stage wearing a plastic mask, only to toss it aside after the first song to play harmonica on [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe." [...] According to Rivera, one heckler asked Dylan [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> a mask?" [...] to which Dylan replied, [...] "The meaning is in the words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to <b>wear,</b> <b>you</b> selfish young pig?" [...] {{said the}} skipper sternly. [...] "Always {{thinking}} about yourself. Go and git some needles and thread, and if there’s any left over, and you’re a good boy, I’ll see whether I can’t make {{something for you}} out of the leavings." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract— 53 college {{students}} answered {{questions regarding the}} circumstances in which they first heard about the news of Wenchuan earthquake or the news of their acceptance to college which took place approximately one year ago, and answered again two years later. The number of details recalled about their circumstances for both events was high and didn’t decline two years later. However, consistency in reported details over two years was low. Participants were more likely to construct central (e. g., Where <b>were</b> <b>you?)</b> than peripheral information (What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing?),</b> and the confidence of the central information was higher than peripheral information, which indicated that they constructed more when they were more confident. Keywords—flashbulb memory; consistency; reconstructive error; confidence I...|$|R
5000|$|Upton {{has said}} that her belief in God is {{important}} to her. During a photo shoot, someone joked about a cross necklace she wore, saying, [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> a cross? Like you would be religious", then took the necklace from her to do the shoot. Upton stated about the incident: [...] "I was really affected by that. The whole thing {{made me realize that}} I do want a cross with me, at all times." [...] As a result, Upton had a cross tattooed on the inside of her finger.|$|E
5000|$|On February 15, 1965, Anderson {{appeared}} - {{along with}} two [...] "imposters" [...] - on the game show To Tell The Truth, challenging the panel to determine [...] "the real Bill Anderson." [...] According to the affidavit read {{at the beginning of}} his segment, Anderson was at the time [...] "generally considered to be the top composer of country music in the nation." [...] Only two of the four panelists successfully identified Bill. At the end of the segment, he sang one of his own compositions, [...] "Po' Folks."

5000|$|In 2015, Sensation Comics {{featured}} Wonder Woman officiating a same-sex wedding (Issue #48) {{drawn by}} Australian illustrator Jason Badower. Inspired by the June Supreme Court ruling that established marriage equality in all 50 United States, Badower says DC Comics was [...] "fantastic" [...] about his {{idea for the}} issue. The Amazon people {{are not to be}} labelled sexually; Wonder Woman stated [...] "...my country is all women. To us, it’s not ‘gay’ marriage. It’s just marriage"; being a society that was only populated by women, [...] "lesbian" [...] in world's eyes may have been [...] "straight" [...] for them. “No Amazon is going to look at another Amazon and say they are Amazoning wrong. Because that wouldn’t be paradise. The society accepts everyone in it. The requirement is, you’re here and you’re female … Nobody says a dress is inappropriate. Nobody says, ‘Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> pants?’ Nobody says you’re too heavy. Nobody says you’re too skinny, or not strong enough.” ...|$|E

5000|$|State Farm {{also has}} {{commercials}} {{beginning with the}} words [...] "State of..." [...] and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 {{in the morning on}} the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: [...] "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>wearing,</b> 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, [...] "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, [...] "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, [...] "Well she's a guy, so…" [...] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.|$|E

Who are you? Are you gay?” (Refugees in Berlin, 2016).|$|E
