After aviation school, he returned to Vietnam as a UH-1 helicopter pilot in the 129th <b>Assault</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Company. He {{would go on to}} become the first member of the aviation branch to attain the rank of four-star general. In June 1978, Brown was assigned to the 158th Aviation Battalion at Fort Campbell, Kentucky flying Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks. While a member of the 158th Aviation Battalion Brown was a Company Commander. The 158th Aviation Battalion was originally part of the 101st Aviation Group, the air arm of the 101st Airborne Division.|$|E

The 2nd Battalion, 291st Aviation Regiment is the brigade's primary utility, lift, and air ambulance helicopter training unit, specializing in utility helicopters such as the UH-60 Black Hawk and the CH-47 Chinook. The 1st Battalion, 337th Regiment (Training Support) specializes in mobilization and de-mobilization for aviation units. The remaining battalions, including the 1st Battalion, 351st Regiment (Training Support), 3rd Battalion, 382nd Regiment (Logistics Support), and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of the 383rd Regiment (Combat Support/Combat Sustainment Support) specialize in areas of general instruction about other aspects of mobilization, conducting exercises, and logistics management.|$|E
5|$|While {{pursuing}} the Viet Cong, a helicopter gunship from the U.S. 68th <b>Assault</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Company {{was shot down}} and crashed in the Quảng Giao rubber plantation, about four kilometres away from Bình Giã, killing four of its crewmen. On December 31, the U.S. Marines Advisory Group sent a team of four personnel, led by Captain Donald G. Cook, to Bình Giã to observe conditions on the battlefield. At the same time, the 4th Marine Battalion was ordered to locate the crashed helicopter and recover {{the bodies of the}} dead American crewmen. Acting against the advice of his American advisor, Major Nguyễn Văn Nho, commander of the 4th Marine Battalion, sent his 2/4th Marine Battalion company out to the Quảng Giao rubber plantation. Unknown to the 4th Marine Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment had assembled in the plantation. About one hour after they had departed from the village of Bình Giã, the commander of the 2/4th Marine Battalion reported via radio that his troops had found the helicopter wreckage, and the bodies of four American crewmen. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong opened fire and the 2/4th Marine Battalion was forced to pull back. In an attempt to save the 2nd Company, the entire 4th Marine Battalion was sent out to confront the Viet Cong. As the lead element of the 4th Marine Battalion closed in on the Quảng Giao plantation, they were hit by accurate Viet Cong artillery fire, which was soon followed by repeated human wave attacks. Having absorbed heavy casualties from the Viet Cong's ambush, the 2/4th Marine Battalion had to fight {{their way out of the}} plantation with their bayonets fixed. During the entire ordeal, the company did not receive artillery support because the plantation was beyond the range of 105mm artillery guns based in Phước Tuy and Bà Rịa. They however escaped with the crucial support of the U.S. aircraft and helicopters whose rocket attacks forced the enemy to pull back and halted their attempt at pursuit.|$|E

Minutes before arrival, the White Lightning's Lyger <b>assault</b> <b>helicopter</b> is shot down by surface-to-air missiles, separating Coda and lieutenant Carlos Potrero in the process. Coda emerges from the crash, and penetrates the South Base. Carlos also survives the attack, and makes radio contact with Coda throughout the game.|$|E
25|$|During 1960, the U.S. Marine Corps evolved a {{requirement}} for a medium-lift, twin-turbine troop/cargo <b>assault</b> <b>helicopter</b> to replace the various piston-engined types that were then in widespread use with the service. That same year, American aviation company Boeing acquired Vertol, after which the group was consequently renamed Boeing Vertol. Following a competition between several competing designs, during early 1961, {{it was announced that}} Boeing Vertol had been selected to manufacture its model 107M for the U.S. Marine Corps, where it was designated as the HRB-1. During 1962, the U.S. Air Force placed its own order for 12 XCH-46B Sea Knight helicopters, which used the XH-49A designation; however, the service later decided to cancelled the order due to delays in its delivery; instead, the U.S. Air Force opted to procure the rival Sikorsky S-61R in its place.|$|E

25|$|On 20 January, the 1st Cavalry Division {{began moving}} 350km north from Landing Zone English in Bình Định Province to Camp Evans {{as part of}} Operation Checkers. While the {{helicopters}} and men of the Division were soon in position, most of their heavy and support equipment was loaded on trucks {{that would have to}} proceed by convoy up Highway 1. While a new supply port was being constructed on the coast, the Division relied on the Marine supply line at Tân Mỹ Base and supply convoys along Highway 1 from Da Nang. On the night of 31 January, the PAVN/VC launched a mortar attack on Camp Evans which caused an ammunition dump to explode, disabling most of the helicopters of the 229th <b>Assault</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Battalion. Other attacks along Highway 1 damaged or destroyed 20 bridges and 26 culverts between the Hải Vân Pass and Phu Bai and Highway 1 was closed to convoy traffic until early March.|$|E

500|$|The brigade was {{the first}} unit sent into War Zone D to destroy enemy base camps, {{introducing}} the use of small Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols. On 8 November 1965, the 173rd took part in Operation Hump, just north of Biên Hòa {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam. They were ambushed by approximately 1,200 Viet Cong fighters, suffering 48 deaths. The unit fought in the Iron Triangle, a Viet Cong stronghold north of Saigon, seeing many engagements with enemy forces during that time. In January 1966 they launched Operation Marauder, the first U.S. military operation in the Plain of Reeds. They participated in Operation Crimp in 1966, a failed attempt to root out enemy forces from the Cu Chi tunnels. [...] The attached helicopter unit became the Casper Aviation platoon, befitting a separate infantry brigade as the only separate aviation platoon deployed in Vietnam. Casper platoon was part of the HHC 173rd Airborne Brigade and its members wore the brigade patch. The attached <b>Assault</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Company, the 335th AHC, the [...] "Cowboys", deployed with the brigade all over Vietnam into mid-1968 and comprised the Airmobile capability along with the Caspers. Soldiers of the brigade became involved in Operation Attleboro in fall of 1966, an operation that started out as a small search and destroy mission north of Saigon but eventually involved 22,000 troops from 21 battalions. Soldiers of the brigade also took part in smaller humanitarian missions in between major combat operations.|$|E

500|$|On 3 October, TF Ranger {{launched}} its seventh mission, this time into Aidid's stronghold the Bakara Market to capture {{two of his}} key lieutenants. The mission was expected to take {{only one or two}} hours. Helicopters carried an assault and a ground convoy of security teams launched in the late afternoon from the TF Ranger compound at Mogadishu airport. The TF came under increasingly heavy fire, more intense than during previous missions. The assault team captured 24 Somalis including Aidid's lieutenants and were loading them onto the convoy trucks when a MH-60 Blackhawk was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). A small element from the security force, as well as an MH-6 <b>assault</b> <b>helicopter</b> and an MH-60 carrying a fifteen-man combat search and rescue (CSAR) team, rushed to the crash site. The battle became increasingly worse. An RPG struck another MH-60, crashing less than [...] to the south of the first downed helicopter. The task force faced overwhelming Somali mobs that overran the crash sites, causing a dire situation. A Somali mob overran the second site and, despite a heroic defense, killed everyone except the pilot, whom they took prisoner. Two defenders of this crash site, Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart, were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. About this time, the mission's quick reaction force (QRF) also tried to reach the second crash site. This force too was pinned by Somali fire and required the fire support of two AH-6 helicopters before it could break contact and make its way back to the base.|$|E
