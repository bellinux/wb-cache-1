Lee.|$|R

40|$|Front-end {{activities}} largely {{influence the}} outcomes of new product development processes, because {{it is here that}} firms create new ideas, give them direction, and set them in motion. We show that the front end can be understood as comprising three core activities: idea/concept development, idea/concept alignment, and idea/concept legitimization, which allow firms to create corroborated product definitions. The paper provides important implications for managers interested in front-end management, and devote specific attention to the differences between incremental and <b>radical</b> <b>front</b> end development and to the front end in the light of increasingly open innovation processes. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{focus was}} evident in the unveiling of two new and <b>radical</b> <b>front</b> aero designs by both the Honda and McLaren teams. Both teams would be understandably reluctant to release figures to support their reasoning for using such radical winglets, although McLaren's consistent speed throughout the testing is noted by only having out-paced championship rivals Ferrari once. Honda, however, ended up half a second down on the nearest car {{on the final day of}} testing where they unveiled their [...] "elephant ear" [...] winglets. McLaren punctuated their need for aero testing over rain testing by withdrawing on the rained-out Tuesday.|$|R
5000|$|As {{vice-president}} of the Montreal {{council of the}} Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) in 1970, Bourdon endorsed Quebec independence and accused Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau of having imposed the War Measures Act on Quebec during the FLQ Crisis to weaken the constitutional Parti Québécois rather than the <b>radical</b> <b>Front</b> de libération du Québec (FLQ) paramilitary group. He also accused Trudeau of having put Quebec under military occupation with [...] "means of terror incomparably superior {{to those of the}} FLQ." [...] The following year, Bourdon took part in a ten-member citizens commission that reviewed the Canadian governments response to the crisis.|$|R
5000|$|Created {{partially}} {{in response}} to {{the state of the economy}} at the time and the resultant shrinkage of the high-end sports car market, the RX-01 undertook a back-to-basics approach of a compact, simple, fun-to-drive, yet inexpensive sports car much like the first generation RX-7. (By this time, the RX-7 had evolved into an uncompromising [...] "super sports car" [...] boasting ultra high performance with little creature comfort and a high price tag.) The RX-01 boasted a <b>radical</b> <b>front</b> end with a floating bumper/spoiler made possible by its compact rotary engine as well as a claimed true 2+2 seating arrangement.|$|R

50|$|Alarcón {{was born}} in Quito. He {{was head of the}} Congress from 1991 to 1992 and then again from August 1995 to February 1997, when he was made acting {{president}} due to the impeachment of President Abdalá Bucaram. This deepened the political crisis in Ecuador as vice-president Rosalía Arteaga challenged Alarcón's assumption of the presidency. Arteaga then became president for two days but Alarcón was then restored. He gave up the presidency after early elections were held in 1998, in which he did not run. In 1999 he was arrested on corruption charges, but was later released. Alarcón {{is a member of the}} Alfarista <b>Radical</b> <b>Front.</b>|$|R
50|$|Williams had {{finished}} 2003 with arguably the strongest package overall, and great expectation {{was on the}} team to win both titles in 2004, having come so close the previous year. To this end, Head supervised {{the car with the}} aim of being on the pace immediately, whilst his design team came up with a revolutionary aerodynamics package. The car featured a <b>radical</b> <b>front</b> section, nicknamed the 'Walrus nose'. It featured a short, stubby nosecone connected to the front wing by sloping vertical spars which allowed more airflow to the underside of the car. In an effort to maximise the airflow, the front suspension was designed around the twin keel principle, pioneered by Sauber and also used by McLaren and Jordan.|$|R

In 2004, Alternative Ecologists affiliated itself to the Front.|$|R
50|$|ANTARSYA {{was founded}} on 22 March 2009 in Athens by 10 organisations and {{independent}} militants involved in the <b>Radical</b> Left <b>Front</b> (MERA) and United Anti-Capitalist Left (ENANTIA) {{with the exception of}} the Workers Revolutionary Party (ΕΕΚ). These organisations come from different left wing currents ranging from ex-Communist Party (KKE) and KKE Interior members to Maoism and Trotskyism.|$|R
50|$|The Workers Revolutionary Party or EEK (Εργατικό Επαναστατικό Κόμμα, Ergatiko Epanastatiko Komma, EEK) is a Trotskyist {{communist}} {{political party}} in Greece, {{taking part in}} the elections independently, since the departure from <b>Radical</b> Left <b>Front</b> (MERA, ΜΕΡΑ) coalition in spring of 2009.

In 2012, the party participated at the May legislative elections, where it received the 0.03% of the vote.|$|R
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Quebec {{underwent}} profound {{social and economic}} changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement. The <b>radical</b> <b>Front</b> de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis {{with a series of}} bombings and kidnappings in 1970 and the [...] Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990. This {{led to the formation of}} the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West. A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Rendel Constitution, more power was given to the locals, more legislative council seats up for grabs and more locals could vote. The PP were not able to appeal to the electorate, as it had pro-colonial conservative policies. The electorate, mostly working-class Chinese, supported the more <b>radical</b> Labour <b>Front</b> and the PAP. Nevertheless, the PP contested in 22 legislative councillor seats.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, France {{has seen}} a rise of parties that have been branded as ‘populist’ by media and academics. But what is populism, and is it {{necessarily}} a bad thing? Philippe Marlière argues that, in France, the concept of populism is an ambivalent one, often used by those in the mainstream to brand those who disagree as demagogues. Ultimately, its use {{has led to the}} conflation of two very differently oriented parties, the far-right Front National, and the <b>radical</b> left <b>Front</b> de Gauche...|$|R
50|$|The Seguro Obrero Massacre {{took place}} on 5 September 1938, {{in the midst of}} a heated {{three-way}} election campaign between the liberal-conservative Gustavo Ross Santa María, the <b>radical</b> Popular <b>Front's</b> Pedro Aguirre Cerda, and the newly formed Popular Alliance candidate, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. The National Socialist Movement of Chile supported Ibáñez's candidacy, which had been announced on September 4. In order to preempt Ross's victory, the National Socialists mounted a coup d'état that was intended to take down the right wing government of Arturo Alessandri Palma and place Ibáñez in power.|$|R
50|$|In {{the night}} of 2 June 2013, heavy clashes between Syrian rebels and Hezbollah took place near the Lebanese town of Ain el-Jaouze, which {{is close to the}} border area between Lebanon and Syria.

5000|$|Among the French far-right, solidarism {{refers to}} a {{tendency}} which was headed by Jean-Pierre Stirbois and Michel Collinot (French Solidarist Movement). Solidarists support a non-capitalist, non-communist [...] "third way", and are generally opponents {{of the influence of}} both the Soviet Union and the United States. It was recently an influence of the <b>Radical</b> Network. National <b>Front</b> member Roger Holeindre claims to follow this tendency.|$|R
50|$|Two {{movements}} of radical lesbians are known. One was the U.S.-based {{movement of the}} mid to late 1960s. The other was the <b>Radical</b> lesbians movement (<b>Front</b> des lesbiennes Radicales), or FLR, which began in France in 1980 and became organized in 1981 under the name Front des lesbiennes Radicales. An offshoot of the latter movement developed shortly after, in the French-speaking province of Quebec, Canada.|$|R
