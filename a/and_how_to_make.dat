5|$|To {{make her}} {{performances}} {{as a female}} boxer look realistic, Oreiro trained regularly with the renowned boxer Marcela Acuña and her coach Ramón Chaparro. They taught Oreiro how to stand and move in the ring <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> various types of strokes, and she underwent cardiovascular and weight training. Acuña commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers. For this training, Oreiro temporarily gave up her vegetarian diet. Another plot required the characters to fly a Piper Tomahawk airplane and make an emergency landing. This was risky filming, and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it. The scene, {{which was the first}} of its kind in a daily Argentine telenovela, required four professional pilots, five special effects experts, and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside. Arana was advised by the pilot Alberto Di Giorgio.|$|E

25|$|The women's {{house or}} Ena (na sg nek dual net pl in Yup'ik, ena sg enet pl in Cup'ik, ena in Cup'ig) was an {{individual}} or semi-communal smaller sod house. They looked similar in construction to the qasgiqs but were {{only about half the}} size. Women and children lived in houses that served as residences for two to five women and their children. Raising children was the women's responsibility until young boys left the home to join other males in the qasgiq to learn discipline <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living. The ena also served as a school and workshop for young girls, where they could learn the art and craft of skin sewing, food preparation, and other important survival skills.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Dodd´s {{father was}} an {{advanced}} amateur photographer of Irish ancestry, who taught his son the essentials of photography: composition, depth, lighting, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> quality portraits. Dodd in turn, learnt the basic techniques of a dark-room laboratory (such as negative development, enlarging, printing etc.) {{as part of his}} extra-curricular activity while attending Winter Park High School in Orange County, Florida. Dodd became interested in artistic photography through admiring Ansel Adam´s prints at a gallery in Florida. Inspired by punk rock groups like the Sex Pistols and Ramones, Dodd learnt to play the guitar and spent the 1980s playing in punk rock bands in Florida and Atlanta. Soon after, Dodd became interested in Irish music and learnt to play the Celtic harp. In 1992 Dodd founded an ambient Celtic ensemble called Trio Nocturna, which had several sponsored appearances in New Orleans, Chicago and Atlanta. Trio Nocturna gained attention in the Gothic scene, recording three commercial albums named Morphia, Tears of Light and Songs of the Celtic Night.|$|E

25|$|Planometria, or, The Whole Art of Surveying of Land was a {{pamphlet}} written in 1650 by Leybourn and published under the pseudonym Oliver Wallinby. Leybourn expanded {{this into a}} full book, The Compleat Surveyor which {{was first published in}} 1653, by his own press. This was the first book published on the subject that did not contain an extensive argument justifying surveying. The book outlined the various instruments used in surveying, and how they were employed. This book was one of the standard references in the field {{for the remainder of the}} 17th century and into the 18th century. The book instructed property surveyors on the construction of property maps, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the appropriate coloured inks for the maps. At this time, the use of private estates maps was starting to become fashionable, to the extent that some very pleased clients would display the coloured maps for their guests to view. The book also contains instructions on mathematical measures. The section on the use of Gunter's chains as a unit of length shows early use of decimals in surveying. Leybourn would later expand and clairify this in his 1657 work Arithmetick, Vulgar, Decimal and Instramental.|$|E

500|$|Blyton {{cemented}} {{her reputation}} as a children's writer when in 1926 she took over the editing of Sunny Stories, a magazine that typically included the re-telling of legends, myths, stories and other articles for children. That same year she was given her own column in Teachers' World, entitled [...] "From my Window". Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs. They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as Letters from Bobs, and sold ten thousand copies in the first week. Her most popular feature was [...] "Round the Year with Enid Blyton", which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, pond life, how to plant a school garden <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a bird table.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl {{falls in love with}} this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the game for September 2002, a trial version was released. It contained five scenarios of the game's campaign, and two random maps.

It was concluded {{that the best way to}} make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game. Age of Mythology underwent a large amount of beta-testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons Age of Mythology became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a [...] "faceless drone in another building".|$|E
2500|$|The {{band and}} their {{creative}} team focused initial meetings {{on what they}} wanted to communicate to the audience <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them feel. After defining the thematic arc of the show, the stage design began to take shape. Devlin explained the creative team's approach in designing the multifaceted stage: [...] "We wanted to respond to the geometry of an arena: all that oval air, how to energize the whole mass of air in those spaces so that the atmosphere reaches everyone in the room equally." [...] Williams found it beneficial to collaborate with two separate firms, Devlin's company and Stufish, on the stage because of their contrasting work methods. Devlin's team created physical models, while Lipson's team made animations and collaborated with Tait on construction drawings. Fisher was unable to physically attend any meetings after the first one, but did occasionally videoconference with the creative team via Skype. In the final meeting he attended before his death in June 2013, when Bono asked the team to think of an object that could symbolise U2 and be incorporated into the stage design, Fisher suggested a cross; the idea would be implemented into some of the stage's lighting fixtures.|$|E
