5|$|HMS Glorious was {{the second}} of the three s built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord, Lord Fisher, they were {{relatively}} lightly <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> armoured. Glorious was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. She participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later.|$|E

5|$|Iberville had {{approached}} the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the war}} broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense {{at the head of}} the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1945, Lützow joined Galland's Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) at Munich-Riem. JV44 was {{equipped}} with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, an aircraft which was heavily <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> faster than any Allied fighter. Galland hoped that the Me262 would compensate for the numerical superiority of the Allies. Lützow had been released from his position as fighter leader in Italy and Galland appointed him as his adjutant. Lützow was credited with two aerial victories flying the Me262.|$|E

5|$|SMS Kaiser Karl VI ("His Majesty's Ship Kaiser Karl VI") was {{the second}} of three armored cruisers built by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste between June 1896 and May 1900, when she was {{commissioned}} into the fleet. Kaiser Karl VI represented a significant improvement over the preceding designbeing faster and more heavily <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> armored. She {{provided the basis for}} the third design, , which featured further incremental improvements. Having no overseas colonies to patrol, Austria-Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet.|$|E

5|$|Södermanland {{was granted}} its {{coat of arms}} in 1560. According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the arms were created for Gustav Vasa's funeral, and {{the choice of the}} griffin as charge may have been {{influenced}} by the name of Gripsholm (once home of Bo Jonsson Grip). Since 1884, the coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. The same coat of arms was granted to Södermanland county in 1940.

5|$|The Belgian Congo {{remained}} {{loyal to}} the Belgian government in London and contributed significant material and human resources to the Allied cause. Many Belgians were involved in both <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> passive resistance to German forces, although some chose to collaborate with the German forces. Support from far right political factions and sections of the Belgian population allowed the German army to recruit two divisions of the Waffen-SS from Belgium and also facilitated the Nazi persecution of Belgian Jews in which nearly 25,000 were killed.|$|E

5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more heavily <b>armed,</b> <b>and</b> of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{considered}} second-class battleships, lightly constructed, <b>armed,</b> <b>and</b> armoured by British standards; Swiftsure, in fact, suffered from structural weakness while in service and required hull strengthening, although Triumph {{did not have}} such problems. Chile had required the ships {{to fit into the}} graving dock at Talcahuano, so they had to be longer and narrower for their displacement than ships built to British standards. Details in mast and anchor arrangements as well as the arrangement of magazines and shell-handling rooms also were different from British standards.|$|E

5|$|When the DDL {{project began}} in 1966, the ships' {{role was to}} support patrol boats during anti-infiltration {{operations}} and complement the Navy's existing destroyer force. The intention was that the DDLs would be fast, simply <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> smaller than conventional destroyers. It was also hoped that a common DDL hull design {{could be used to}} produce variants optimised for different roles. The RAN and British Royal Navy (RN) held discussions in 1967 on jointly developing DDLs, but the RN withdrew from the project when the Australians insisted on arming the ships with United States-designed weapons.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the battle, they were poorly <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> many were {{equipped}} only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines. They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as M79 and M80 rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle. The capture of JNA barracks somewhat improved the situation as Vukovar had the priority in the supply of arms. It is estimated that the Vukovar battlefield consumed around 55–60 percent of all ammunition available to the Croatian forces.|$|E
