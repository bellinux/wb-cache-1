The latter is obtained {{on the basis of}} the data available to the manufacturer, experience in using similar systems, using statistical methods and technical literature. In practice, the starting point in the process of foreseeing the reliability of any technical system is the assumption of constant failure rates. The system components’ failure rates which are determined in this way represent the so-called nominal values. This value is commonly modified by taking into <b>account</b> <b>operation</b> loads and environment conditions under which the observed system component is supposed to operate. In most cases the quantitative values of these two factors result from the engineering assessment that is based on the data available to the manufacturer or the user and takes into account the inevitable effect of a number of subjective factors.

The paper suggests innovative energy saving directions in traction networks of railways and new circuit solutions accessing traction substations in energy systems networks, ensure energy security of the transportation process. To ensure the energy security of rail transport special schemes were developed to propose the concept of external power traction substations, which would {{increase the number of}} connections to the networks of 220 – 330 kV, as well as the creation of transport and energy corridors, development of its own supply of electric networks of 110 kV substations and mobile RP- 110 kV of next generation. Therefore, the investment program of the structures owned by the Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) need to be synchronized in their technological characteristics, as well as the criteria of reliability and quality of power supply with the same external energy investment programs. It is found that without any load on left or right supplying arm one of two less loaded phases of traction transformer begins generating specific modes in the supplying three-phase line. Thus, modes of mobile substation cause leakage in one of the phases of the supply line of traction transformers of active-capacitive current, and as a result generating energy in the main power line of 154 kV, which is fixed and calculated by electricity meters. For these three phase mode supply network is necessary to use 1 st algorithm, i. e. taking into account the amount of electricity as the energy in all phases. For effective application of reactive power compensation devices in the AC traction power supply systems it is proposed to develop regulatory documentation on necessity of application and the order of choice of parameters and placement of compensation systems taking into <b>account</b> <b>operation</b> mode of power systems and the use of software systems with imitation of instantaneous interrelated schemes of transport loads...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is {{an important}} reason for driver frustration {{which in turn is}} the main cause of human errors and accidents. Statistics reports have shown that over 90 % of accidents are caused by human errors. Therefore, it is vital to improve vehicle controls to ensure adequate safety measures in order to decrease the number of accidents or to reduce the impact of accidents. An application of mathematical control techniques to the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle equipped with an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system is presented. This study is carried out for the detailed understanding of a complex ACC vehicle model under critical transitional manoeuvres (TMs) in order to establish safe inter-vehicle distance with zero range-rate (relative velocity) behind a preceding vehicle. TMs are performed under the influence of internal complexities from vehicle dynamics and within constrained operation boundaries. The constrained boundaries refer to the control input, states, and collision avoidance constraints. The ACC vehicle is based on a nonlinear longitudinal model that includes vehicle inertial and powertrain dynamics. The overall system modelling includes: complex vehicle models, engine maps construction, first-order vehicle modelling, controllers modelling (upper-level and lower-level controllers for ACC vehicles). The upper-level controller computes the desired acceleration commands for the lower-lever controller which then provides the throttle/brake commands for the complex vehicle model. An important aspect {{of this study is to}} compare four control strategies: proportional-integral-derivative; sliding mode; constant-time-gap; and, model predictive control for the upper-level controller analysis using a first-order ACC vehicle model. The first-order model represents the lags in the vehicle actuators and sensor signal processing and it does not consider the dynamic effects of the vehicle’s sub-models. Furthermore, parameter analyses on the complex ACC vehicle for controller and vehicle parameters have been conducted. The comparison analysis of the four control strategies shows that model predictive control (MPC) is the most appropriate control strategy for upper-level control because it solves the optimal control problem on-line, rather than off-line, for the current states of the system using the prediction model, at the same time being able to take into <b>account</b> <b>operation</b> constraints. The analysis shows that the complex ACC vehicle can successfully execute TMs, tracking closely the desired acceleration and obeying the constraints, whereas the constraints are only applied in the MPC controller formulation. It is found that a higher length of the prediction horizon should be used for a closed acceleration tracking. The effect of engine and transmission dynamics on the MPC controller and ACC vehicle performance during the gear shifting is studied. A sensitivity analysis for MPC controller and vehicle parameters indicates that a length of the control horizon that is too high can seriously disturb the vehicle behaviour, and this disturbance can be only removed if a higher value of control input cost weighting is used. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that a mass within the range of 1400 - 2000 kg is suitable for the considered ACC vehicle. It is recommended that a variable headway time should be used for the spacing control between the two vehicles. It is found that the vehicle response is highly sensitive to the control input cost weighting; a lower value (less than one) can lead to a highly unstable vehicle response. It is recommended that the lower-level controller must take into account the road gradient information because the complex ACC vehicle is unable to achieve the control objectives while following on a slope. Based on the results, it is concluded that a first-order ACC vehicle model can be used for the controller design, but it is not sufficient to capture the complex vehicle dynamic response. Therefore, a complex vehicle model should be of use for the detailed ACC vehicle analysis. In this research study the first-order ACC vehicle model is used for the complex vehicle validation, whereas the complex ACC vehicle model can be used for the experimental validation in future work.

40|$|The {{definition}} of Electronic commerce {{is the use}} of electronic transmission mediums to engage in the exchange, including buying and selling, of products and services requiring transportation, either physically or digitally, from location to location. Electronic commerce systems, including mobile e-commerce, are widely used since 1990. The number of world-wide Internet users tripled between 1993 and 1995 to 60 million, and by 2000 there were 250 million users. More than one hundred countries have Internet access. Electronic commerce, especial mobile e-commerce systems, allows their users to access a large set of traditional (for example, voice communications) and contemporary (for example, e-­shop) services without being tethered to one particular physical location. With the increasing use of electronic service systems for security sensitive application (for example, e-shop) that can be expected in the future, the provision of secure services becomes more important. The dynamic mobile environment is incompatible with static security services. Electronic service access across multiple service domains, and the traditional access mechanisms rely on cross-domain authentication using roaming agreements starting home location. Cross-domain authentication involves many complicated authentication activities when the roam path is long. This limits future electronic commerce applications. Normally, there are three participants in an electronic service. These are users, service providers, and services. Some services bind users and service providers as well as services such as flight services; other services do not bind any participants, for instance by using cash in shopping services, everyone can use cash to buy anything in shops. Hence, depending on which parts are bound, there are different kinds of electronic services. However, there is no scheme to provide a solution for all kinds of electronic services. Users have to change service systems if they want to apply different kind of electronic services on the Internet. From the consumer's point of view, users often prefer to have a total solution for all kinds of service problems, some degree of anonymity with no unnecessary cross authentications and a clear statement of account when shopping over the Internet. There are some suggested solutions for electronic service systems, but the solutions are neither total solution for all kinds of services nor have some degree of anonymity with a clear statement of account. In our work, we build a bridge between existing technologies and electronic service theory such as e-payment, security and so on. We aim to provide a foundation for the improvement of technology to aid electronic service application. As validation, several technologies for electronic service system design have been enhanced and improved in this project. To fix the problems mentioned above, we extend our idea to a ticket based access service system. The user in the above electronic service system has to pay when s/he obtains service. S/He can pay by traditional cash (physical cash), check, credit or electronic cash. The best way to pay money for goods or services on the Internet is using electronic cash. Consumers, when shopping over the Internet, often prefer to have a high level of anonymity with important things and a low level with general one. The ideal system needs to provide some degree of anonymity for consumers so that they cannot be traced by banks. There are a number of proposals for electronic cash systems. All of them are either too large to manage or lack flexibility in providing anonymity. Therefore, they are not suitable solutions for electronic payment in the future. We propose a secure, scalable anonymity and practical payment protocol for Internet purchases. The protocol uses electronic cash for payment transactions. In this new protocol, from the viewpoint of banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities. An agent, namely anonymity provider agent provides a higher anonymous certificate and improves the security of the consumers. The agent will certify re-encrypted data after verifying the validity of the content from consumers, but with no private information of the consumers required. With this new method, each consumer can get the required anonymity level. Electronic service systems involve various subsystems such as service systems, payment systems, and management systems. Users and service providers are widely distributed and use heterogeneous catalog systems. They are rapidly increasing in dynamic environments. The management of these service systems will be very complex. Whether systems are successful or not depends on the quality of their management. To simplify the management of e-commerce systems Sandhu 97, we discuss role based access control management. We define roles and permissions in the subsystems. For example, there are roles TELLER, AUDITOR, MANAGER and permissions teller (<b>account</b> <b>operation),</b> audit operation, managerial decision in a bank system. Permissions are assigned to roles such as permission teller is assigned to role TELLER. People (users) employed in the bank are granted roles to perform associated duties. However, there are conflicts between various roles as well as between various permissions. These conflicts may cause serious security problems with the bank system. For instance, if permissions teller and audit operation are assigned to a role, then a person with this role will have too much privilege to break the security of the bank system. Therefore, the organizing of relationships between users and roles, roles and permissions currently requires further development. Role based access control (RBAC) has been widely used in database management and operating systems. In 1993, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed prototype implementations, sponsored external research, and published formal RBAC models. Since then, many RBAC practical applications have been implemented, because RBAC has many advantages such as reducing administration cost and complexity. However, there are some problems which may arise in RBAC management. One is related to authorization granting process. For example, when a role is granted to a user, this role may conflict with other roles of the user or together with this role; the user may have or derive a high level of authority. Another is related to authorization revocation. For instance, when a role is revoked from a user, the user may still have the role. To solve these problems, we present an authorization granting algorithm, and weak revocation and strong revocation algorithms that are based on relational algebra. The algorithms check conflicts and therefore help allocate the roles and permissions without compromising the security in RBAC. We describe the applications of the new algorithms with an anonymity scalable payment scheme. In summary, this thesis has made the following major contributions in electronic service systems: 1. A ticket based global solution for electronic commerce systems; A ticket based solution is designed for different kinds of e-services. Tickets provide a flexible mechanism and users can check charges at anytime. 2. Untraceable electronic cash system; An untraceable e-cash system is developed, in which the bank involvement in the payment transaction between a user and a receiver is eliminated. Users remain anonymous, unless she/he spends a coin more than once. 3. A self-scalable anonymity electronic payment system; In this payment system, from the viewpoint of banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities. Each consumer can get the required anonymity level. 4. Using RBAC to manage electronic payment system; The basic structure of RBAC is reviewed. The challenge problems in the management of RBAC with electronic payment systems are analysed and how to use RBAC to manage electronic payment system is proposed. 5. The investigation of recovery algorithms for conflicting problems in user-role assignments and permission-role assignments. Formal authorization allocation algorithms for role-based access control have developed. The formal approaches are based on relational structure, and relational algebra and are used to check conflicting problems between roles and between permissions...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which creative <b>accounting</b> <b>operations</b> affect the fiscal performance. Governments and especially finance ministers are able to somehow manage reports. What comes immediately to mind in a general sense are the creative <b>accounting</b> <b>operations</b> used to hide deficits. This is certainly true in most instances. However, certain operations may also be used to disguise surpluses and to present a government’s financial performance as being more worrisome than it actually is. Compared to the spending minister or to members of parliament, the finance minister has a specific expertise in financial issues that makes it quite easy for him to resort to such practices. And as opposed to spending ministers, his personal agenda is to avoid (or lower) public deficits and indebtedness by putting operating expenses under pressure and by pressing for higher taxes than otherwise wanted.|$|R
