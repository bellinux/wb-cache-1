50|$|The North Vietnamese Army-NVA {{opened fire}} with a rocket attack that lasted most of the day. The first round took out three men from one gun of the A/1/12 Marines. A/1/12 Marines {{returned}} fire {{and the next day}} moved south {{for the rest of the}} operation. An <b>amphibious</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of A/1/12 Marines on AMTRACS was on 25 May.|$|E
50|$|LtGen Anthony Zinni (Commanding General, I Marine Expeditionary Force) {{was given}} {{command of the}} operation, which was to ensure the safe {{execution}} of an <b>amphibious</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> General Zinni, who served as Director for Operations for UNITAF during Operation Restore Hope in 1992-1993, knew most of the top Somali leaders {{at the time of}} Operation United Shield.|$|E
50|$|While {{maintaining}} the Operation Deny Flight mission, the 16 SOS also deployed {{to other parts}} of the world for 184 days. From 18 September-19 October 1994, it deployed to Cuba in support of Operation Uphold Democracy and provided air support to coalition forces during the ouster of General Raoul Cédras and restoration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti. Additionally, from 30 January −2 March 1995, the 16th SOS returned to Africa in support of Operation United Shield, the withdrawal of UN forces from Mogadishu, Somalia. On the final night of this operation, the gunships provided real time intelligence to ground commanders via armed reconnaissance and surveillance during the U.S. Marine <b>amphibious</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from Mogadishu.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} his tenure, General Chapman {{witnessed}} the III Marine <b>Amphibious</b> Force <b>withdrawal</b> from Vietnam and the strength of the Corps drop from a peak of 289,000 to 198,000. Anticipating an austere budget and fewer Marines, he had earlier made his move for a [...] "hard, lean, fully combat-ready Corps," [...] reduced in size, but not in professionalism. Before his retirement, President Nixon presented Gen Chapman a third award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, December 10, 1971.|$|R
50|$|The CNOA was {{to assert}} the French Navy's {{capability}} to perform <b>amphibious</b> assaults, <b>withdrawals,</b> demonstrations, and raids. This {{would allow the}} French Navy to further integrate into the doctrinal frameworks described by NATO's Allied Tactical Publication 8B (ATP8) and the European Amphibious Initiative. While the CNOA made air capabilities a priority, it also recommended {{an increase in the}} number of vehicles and personnel that could be transported and deployed; the CNOA fixed the aim to project a force comprising four combat companies (1,400 men, 280 vehicles, and 30 helicopters) for ten days, in a 100 kilometre-deep sector; this force should be able to intervene either anywhere within 5000 kilometres of the French metropole, or in support of French oversea territories or allies. As well as joint operations with NATO and EU forces, any proposed ship had to be capable of inter-service operations with the Troupes de Marine brigades of the French Army.|$|R
