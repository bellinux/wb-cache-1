2500|$|Ablutions. [...] The celebrant cleans the chalice <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> {{with water}} and wine. [...] The subdeacon then takes then covers the chalice and paten with the chalice veil and carries them to the {{credence}} table. [...] After the ablutions, the celebrant goes to the Epistle side of the altar and reads the communion antiphon in the low voice.|$|E
2500|$|McGuire {{played before}} the advent of most modern {{protective}} equipment, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> were reportedly [...] "gnarled, broken, bent, split and crooked" [...] {{by the end of his}} career. [...] One account, published in 1901, emphasized the physical beating:"A picture of McGuire's hands would be an interesting and wonderful exhibit. [...] The maimed and misshapen members which he will carry with him after he quits the game and to the grave are mute reminders of many a foul ticked off the bat, a wild thrown ball stopped with the finger tips after a leap into the air, or a low one clawed up out of the roots of the plate, and an occasional one caught full on the end of a digit, splitting the flesh and nail." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the race, Courtney drank a {{glass of}} ice tea that was laced with a drug, {{and was unable to}} race. A little after noon {{on the day of the}} race, Courtney sat down for a meal at a local inn. After the meal, he asked the {{waitress}} for ice tea. The waitress went to make the tea but was stopped by the owner of the inn, who told her he would make the tea humself. Courtney experienced a strange sensation of being too hot, and then, too cold. He went up to his room by himself. Eventually, his throat started to burn <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> became numb and cold. He began to ache and soon began to vomit. Riley was informed of the situation and went to visit Courtney. After the visit and consulting with the doctors treating his opponent, Riley decided that Courtney was in no condition to row that day. Riley did however row the course for time. Even without competition, he was able to do the [...] course in a time of 20 minutes and 47.5 seconds, which was a new record.|$|E

60|$|He bowed, <b>and</b> already <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> {{were on the}} handle. Suddenly {{she called}} to him.|$|R

60|$|St. Vincent's body {{stiffened}} at the words, {{the rational}} gleam {{went out of}} his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> closed spasmodically on Frona's. She looked entreaty at the men, and they hesitated.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned the}} pocket-book around <b>and</b> put <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> first in one pocket and then another.|$|R
