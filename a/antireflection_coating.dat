5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

50|$|The {{availability}} of <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> permitted the Double Gauss {{to rise to}} dominance over the Sonnar. The Sonnar had more popularity before World War II because, before <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating,</b> the Sonnar's three cell with six air-glass surfaces versus the Double Gauss's four and eight made it less vulnerable to flare. Its telephoto effect also made the lens shorter, an important factor for the Leica and Contax 35mm RFs designed to be compact.|$|E

30|$|As a {{preparatory step}} to the {{realization}} of the AMULOR 3 D imager, an experimental test bed has been set up in the ENEA Frascati research center, comprising a couple of tanks (1.56 [*]m and 25 [*]m long, resp.) equipped with an <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> entrance window, and a laboratory prototype of the imager itself, supplemented, in case, by a polarization-sensitive receiving stage.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, the Kodak Ektra (USA) 35mm RF was {{introduced}} {{with the first}} complete <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> lens line for a consumer camera: the Kodak Ektar 35mm f/3.3, 50mm f/3.5, 50mm f/1.9, 90mm f/3.5, 135mm f/3.8 and 153mm f/4.5. World War II interrupted all consumer camera production and coated lenses did not appear in large numbers until the late 1940s. They became standard for high quality cameras by the early 1950s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> {{does not}} relieve {{the need for}} a lens hood (a conical tube slipped, clipped, screwed or bayoneted onto the front of a lens to block {{non-image}} forming rays from entering the lens) because flare can also result from strong stray light reflecting off of other inadequately blacked internal lens and camera components.|$|E
50|$|Such {{coatings}} {{can reduce}} the reflection for ordinary glass from about 4% per surface to around 2%. These were the first type of <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> known, having been discovered by Lord Rayleigh in 1886. He found that old, slightly tarnished pieces of glass transmitted more light than new, clean pieces due to this effect.|$|E
5000|$|MgF2 and, to {{a lesser}} extent, other {{alkaline}} earth difluorides are specialty optical materials. Magnesium difluoride is widely used as an <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> for spectacles and optical equipment.

Half-tone patterns are used to create graded-transmission image plane masks.

40|$|The {{output power}} from two ten-element laser diodes arrays has been {{efficiently}} summed in an external cavity {{to obtain a}} coherent, continuous wave beam. In this technique, laser emission from each front surface <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> diode array is stimulated by injection of emission from a second such array. This method was also applied to single-element diode lasers. The output beam characteristics such as spectral distribution, far-field and near-field beam patterns, and overall efficiency have been measured...|$|R
40|$|An all optical set-reset {{flip flop}} is {{presented}} {{that is based}} on two coupled identical laser diodes. The lasers are coupled so that when one of the lasers lases it quenches lasing in the other laser. The state of the flip flop is determined by which laser is currently lasing. Rate equations are used to model the flip flop and obtain steady state characteristics. The flip flop is experimentally demonstrated by use of <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> laser diodes and free space optics. Comment: 9 pages, 4 postscript figure...|$|R
50|$|As maximum {{aperture}} {{continued to}} increase, the Double Gauss's greater symmetry promised easier aberration correction. This was {{especially important for}} SLRs because, without the parallax error of RFs, they also began offering much closer focusing distances (typically a half meter instead a whole meter). The Double Gauss became the preferred normal lens design in the 1950s with the availability of <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> and new generation extra high refractive index rare earth optical glasses.|$|E
50|$|The {{reflections}} {{inside the}} prism are {{not caused by}} total internal reflection, since the beams are incident at an angle less than the critical angle (the minimum angle for total internal reflection). Instead, the two faces are coated to provide mirror surfaces. The two opposite transmitting faces are often coated with an <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> to reduce spurious reflections. The fifth face of the prism is not used optically but truncates what would otherwise be an awkward angle joining the two mirrored faces.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{noticed by}} Dennis Taylor in 1896 that some lenses with glass {{tarnished}} by age counterintuitively produced brighter images. Investigation {{revealed that the}} oxidation layer suppressed surface reflections by destructive interference. Lenses with glass elements artificially [...] "single-coated" [...] by vacuum deposition of a very thin layer (approximately 130-140 nanometers) of magnesium or calcium fluoride to suppress surface reflections were invented by Alexander Smakula working for Zeiss in 1935 and first sold in 1939. <b>Antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> could cut reflection by two-thirds.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the reflectivity and optical scattering characteristics at 1064 nm of an <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> fused silica {{window of the}} type {{being used in the}} Advanced LIGO gravitational-wave detectors. Reflectivity is measured in the ultra-low range of 5 – 10 ppm (by vendor) and 14 – 30 ppm (by us). Using an angle-resolved scatterometer we measure the sample’s bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) and use this to estimate its transmitted and reflected scatter at roughly 20 – 40 and 1 ppm, respectively, over the range of angles measured. We further inspect the sample’s low backscatter using an imaging scatterometer, measuring an angle resolved BSDF below 10 ^(− 6) [*][*]sr^(− 1) for large angles (10 °– 80 ° from incidence in the plane of the beam). We use the associated images to (partially) isolate scatter from different regions of the sample and find that scattering from the bulk fused silica is on par with backscatter from the <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> optical surfaces. To confirm that the bulk scattering is caused by Rayleigh scattering, we perform a separate experiment measuring the scattering intensity versus input polarization angle. We estimate that 0. 9 – 1. 3 ppm of the backscatter can be accounted for by Rayleigh scattering of the bulk fused silica. These results indicate that modern antireflection coatings have low enough scatter to not limit the total backscattering of thick fused silica optics...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} experimentally that the intrinsic modulation response of injection lasers {{can be modified}} by reducing mirror reflectivities, which leads to suppression of relaxation oscillation resonance and a reduction of nonlinear distortions up to multi-GHz frequencies. A totally flat response with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 5 GHz was obtained using <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> buried heterostructure lasers fabricated on a semi-insulating substrate. Harmonic distortions were below 40 dB within the entire 3 -dB bandwidth. These results are in accord with theoretical predictions based on an analysis which include the effects of superluminescence in the laser cavity...|$|R
50|$|There are {{alternatives}} to traditional types of DFB lasers. Traditionally, DFBs are <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> {{on one side}} of the cavity and coated for high reflectivity on the other side (AR/HR). In this case the grating forms the distributed mirror on the <b>antireflection</b> <b>coated</b> side, while the semiconductor facet on the high reflectivity side forms the other mirror. These lasers generally have higher output power since the light is taken from the AR side, and the HR side prevents power being lost from the back side. Unfortunately, during the manufacturing of the laser and the cleaving of the facets, it is virtually impossible to control at which point in the grating the laser cleaves to form the facet. So sometimes the laser HR facet forms at the crest of the grating, sometimes on the slope. Depending on the phase of the grating and the optical mode, the laser output spectrum can vary. Frequently, the phase of the highly reflective side occurs at a point where two longitudinal modes have the same cavity gain, and thus the laser operates at two modes simultaneously. Thus such AR/HR lasers have to be screened at manufacturing and parts that are multimode or have poor side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) have to be scrapped. Additionally, the phase of the cleave affects the wavelength, and thus controlling the output wavelength of a batch of lasers in manufacturing can be a challenge.|$|R
50|$|A new {{attempt to}} fuse the {{advantages}} of bulk silicon with those of thin-film devices is thin film polycrystalline silicon on glass. These modules are produced by depositing an <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> and doped silicon onto textured glass substrates using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The texture in the glass enhances {{the efficiency of the}} cell by approximately 3% by reducing the amount of incident light reflecting from the solar cell and trapping light inside the solar cell. The silicon film is crystallized by an annealing step, temperatures of 400-600 Celsius, resulting in polycrystalline silicon.|$|E
50|$|An optical coating is {{one or more}} thin {{layers of}} {{material}} deposited on an optical component such as a lens or mirror, which alters {{the way in which}} the optic reflects and transmits light. One type of optical coating is an <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating,</b> which reduces unwanted reflections from surfaces, and is commonly used on spectacle and photographic lenses. Another type is the high-reflector coating which can be used to produce mirrors which reflect greater than 99.99% of the light which falls on them. More complex optical coatings exhibit high reflection over some range of wavelengths, and anti-reflection over another range, allowing the production of dichroic thin-film optical filters.|$|E
5000|$|Lens coating: An <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> {{is applied}} to the {{finished}} lenses. The lenses are first cleaned, and then loaded into a fixture. The fixture, containing a large number of lenses, is placed in the coating machine. After finishing the process the glass lenses are removed from the holder and the holder is cleaned by sand-blasting or other techniques. Usually the optical coating is done by one of two methods: physical vapour deposition (PVD), in which oxide materials evaporate and are deposited on the lens, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Chemical reactions take place in a vacuum and the reaction product is deposited on the lens. The lenses are coated for two reasons: ...|$|E

Our experimental results in combination with an antenna-to-bolometer coupling simulation suggest that HEB mixer can work well at least up to 6 THz, suitable for next generation of high-resolution spectroscopic of the neutral atomic oxygen (OI) line at 4. 7 THz.

A total output power in excess of 70 mW with an average power spectral density of 0. 56 mW/nm and spectral ripple ≤ 1. 2 ± 0. 5 dB is measured from the device. Wall-plug efficiency and output power as high as 14 % and 80 mW, respectively, is demonstrated from this batch of devices.

50|$|And, when {{a colored}} object has both diffuse and {{specular}} reflection, usually only the diffuse component is colored. A cherry reflects diffusely red light, absorbs all other colors {{and has a}} specular reflection which is essentially white (if the incident light is white light). This is quite general, because, except for metals, the reflectivity of most materials depends on their refractive index, which varies little with the wavelength (though it is this variation that causes the chromatic dispersion in a prism), so that all colors are reflected nearly with the same intensity. Reflections from different origin, instead, may be colored: metallic reflections, such as in gold or copper, or interferential reflections: iridescences, peacock feathers, butterfly wings, beetle elytra, or the <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> of a lens.|$|E
50|$|The Lurie-Houghton {{telescope}} is a catadioptric telescope. Lurie modified {{the original design}} by Houghton by adding a diagonal mirror to direct the focused light outside the telescope tube as in a Newtonian telescope. The Houghton design was patented on May 30, 1944. Instead of the fairly hard to make Schimdt and Maksutov corrector lenses, the corrector for the Lurie-Houghton {{is relatively easy to}} make. It consists of two lenses, a positive and a negative, {{at the front of the}} telescope which sets the size of the aperture. All lens and primary mirror surfaces are spheroidal which eases construction. These lenses are relatively thin, though not as thin as the Schmidt corrector.

This power can also be modulated and tuned arbitrarily.

50|$|The {{transmission}} method requires a weak broadband light source that spectrally covers {{the region of}} interest for the gain spectra.

For this method, the device should operate on the fundamental lateral mode and the occurrence of Fabry-Pérot modes should be suppressed by deposition of at least one <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating</b> on the output facet of the device. In comparison to the stripe-length method and the Hakki-Paoli method, the {{transmission method}} provides the most accurate gain data for the widest range of injection currents.

50|$|Parasitic modes {{occur when}} {{reflections}} are generated in directions other than {{along the length}} of the rod, which can use up energy that would otherwise be available to the beam. This can be a particular problem if the barrel of the rod is polished. Cylindrical laser rods support whispering gallery modes due to total internal reflection between the rod and the cooling water, which reflect continuously around the circumference of the rod. Light pipe modes can reflect down the length of the rod in a zig-zag path. If the rod has an <b>antireflection</b> <b>coating,</b> or is immersed in a fluid that matches its refractive index, it can dramatically reduce these parasitic reflections. Likewise, if the barrel of the rod is rough ground (frosted), or grooved, internal reflections can be dispersed.|$|E
