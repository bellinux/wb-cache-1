40|$|The {{influence}} of 1 -dodecylazacycloheptan- 2 -one (<b>Azone)</b> on the in vitro permeation of hairless mouse skin and human epidermis by hydrocortisone was studied {{as a function}} of the amount of <b>Azone</b> solubilized and/or emulsified into aqueous media applied to the membranes using the infinite-dose technique. The permeability-enhancing effect of <b>Azone</b> increases with increasing <b>Azone</b> total concentration until 0. 1 % is reached with mouse skin and 0. 01 % is reached for human epidermis. Thereafter, permeabilities for both tissues drop systematically. The maximally enhanced permeability in mouse skin approached that for mouse skin stripped of its stratum corneum. The peak permeability in human epidermis is an order of magnitude smaller than for mouse skin with the duration of <b>Azone</b> treatment required to achieve the full effect in human epidermis being twice that for mouse skin (≈ 20 h vs ≈ 12 h). Thus, there is a profound difference in Azone's action on these two tissue types. It was also established that the affinity to an enhancer for a permeant drug can significantly offset its ability to enhance permeability. Specifically, hydrocortisone was found to partition significantly into the Azone-rich phase of the emulsion, lowering its concentration (and its thermodynamic activity) in the continuous aqueous phase and thereby reducing its flux through the skin. This physiochemical effect was profound enough to nullify the intrinsic permeability-enhancing effect of <b>Azone</b> as the total <b>Azone</b> concentration was raised to 10 %...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been to provide further {{understanding}} of skin barrier function from a chemical point of view. The main barrier {{is known to be}} located in the outermost layer of the skin, stratum corneum, composed of cornified flattened cells in conjunction with an extracellular lipid-water matrix. From literature it is evident that the lipids of this matrix are arranged as bilayers, aligned parallel to the skin surface, preventing penetration of both polar and non-polar substances. However, the complex mixture of significantly different lipids in skin implies phase-separation to be reasonable expectation. The well-known penetration enhancer Azone® (laurocapram) was used to study the effects on lipid morphology and any transformation into non-lamellar structures was believed to reflect a higher permeability of polar and/or non-polar substances. <b>Azone</b> was added to several different lipid-water systems, some of them chosen because they are previously well characterised while others show a closer resemblance to the actual lipid composition of stratum corneum. The fatty acid and the fatty acid-cholesterol systems showed multiple phase co-existence at body temperature and below. The effects observed from adding penetration enhancers like <b>azone</b> were formation of reversed types of phases in liquid crystals and phase separation into a separate oil phase and water-enriched phases, due to the ability of <b>azone</b> to dissolve protonated fatty acids as well as cholesterol. The presence of cholesterol in fatty acid-soap-water mixtures maintained the lamellar liquid crystal, while <b>azone</b> caused a swelling of the bilayer to a certain level. <b>Azone</b> was observed to solubilize gel phases, but no significant effect on the crystals in pure fatty acid-soap-water mixtures was observed. A thorough investigation on the swelling behaviour of bicontinuous lyotropic mesophases was undertaken and the theory obtained here was applied to SAXD-data from the glycerol monooleate (GMO) -water system, containing <b>azone.</b> The obtained results indicate about 19 % of the weakly polar, and water immiscible, <b>azone</b> to be anchored at the lipid-water interface. This corresponds to an effective surfactant parameter, cpp, of <b>azone</b> well over one (i. e. <b>azone</b> clearly favours reversed types of phases in liquid crystals). These observations clearly indicate that one reason for the enhanced permeability through skin of several substances by adding <b>azone</b> (or other substances such as oleic acid) may be the formation of non-lamellar structures in the extracellular lipid matrix. In addition, the occurrence of multiple phases, both liquid crystalline and gel/crystalline, support the idea of the matrix being non-homogeneous in lipid composition. Phase co-existence has also been observed in skin lipids and in stratum corneum in vitro by others. This domain mosaic organisation of the lipids would also contribute to the barrier efficiency...|$|E

The penetration-enhancing effect of <b>Azone</b> was studied in a vehicle concentration of 5 %, or after pretreating shaven rat skin in vivo, at several time intervals before the in vitro experiment, with a solution containing 1 or 5 % <b>Azone.</b> From the vehicle containing 60 % ethanol, 20 % propylene glycol and 20 % water, the extent of penetration through rat skin was relatively low for the base and even lower for the salt. The introduction of <b>Azone</b> into the vehicle in a final concentration of 5 % resulted in a 6 -fold decrease in penetration for the free base.

40|$|A popular {{approach}} for improving transdermal drug delivery {{involves the use}} of penetration enhancers (sorption promoters or accelerants) which penetrate into skin to reversibly reduce the barrier resistance. The potential mechanisms of action of penetration enhancers include disruption of intercellular lipid and/or keratin domains and tight junctions. This results in enhanced drug partitioning into tissue, altered thermodynamic activity/solubility of drug etc. Synthetic chemicals (solvents, <b>azones,</b> pyrrolidones, surfactants etc.) generally used for this purpose are rapidly losing their value in transdermal patches due to reports of their absorption into the systemic circulation and subsequent possible toxic effect upon long term application. Terpenes are included in the list of Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substances and have low irritancy potential. Their mechanism of percutaneous permeation enhancement involves increasing the solubility of drugs in skin lipids, disruption of lipid/protein organization and/or extraction of skin micro constituents that are responsible for maintenance of barrier status. Hence, they appear to offer great promise for use in transdermal formulations. This article is aimed at reviewing the mechanisms responsible for percutaneous permeation enhancement activity of terpenes, which shall foster their rational use in transdermal formulations...|$|R

Drug permeation from saturated aqueous solutions was monitored before and after accelerant treatment (applied in aqueous and PG vehicles). With ES, the study was repeated with 50 % ethanol/water as donor and receptor phases instead of water. Two percent <b>Azone</b> in PG promoted 5 FU absorption by almost 100 -fold, but 3 % <b>Azone</b> with 0. 1 % Tween 20 in normal saline demonstrated only an eightfold effect. Five percent OA in PG was moderately successful, but 4 % aqueous DCMS enhanced 5 FU permeation 35 -fold initially, but rapidly fell to fourfold. PG itself was ineffective. The accelerants were much less effective in promoting ES absorption; only 5 % OA in PG enhanced steroid permeation by more than tenfold, but this fell with time to threefold due to washout of accelerant (ethanol/water system). The experimental conditions utilized fully hydrated stratum corneum with permeants in saturated solutions; under these already optimized conditions for permeation, accelerants were only marginally effective in enhancing the delivery of the relatively non-polar drug ES.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main problem}} with topical {{application}} of compounds to administer drugs to and regulate drug levels {{in a human}} body, is the barrier formed by the intercellular lipid matrix of the stratum corneum (SC).

SC lipid model studies especially provide a wealth of information with respect to the lipid organization and the importance of certain subclasses of lipids for the structure. Previously, we have shown that electron diffraction (ED) provides detailed information on the lateral lipid packing in both intact SC (G. S. K. Pilgram et al., J. Invest.

In the present study, we used ED to examine the influence of two <b>azones</b> and sebaceous lipids on the lateral phase behavior of lipids isolated from human SC. We established that human SC lipids are arranged in an orthorhombic packing pattern. Upon mixing with the two enhancers the orthorhombic packing pattern was still observed; however, an additional fluid phase became more apparent. In mixtures with sebaceous lipids, the presence of the hexagonal lattice increased. These findings provide a basis for the mechanism by which these enhancers and sebaceous lipids interact with human SC lipids...|$|R

Diodorus related that Pyrrhus defeated the Carthaginian garrison in Heraclea Minoa and seized <b>Azones.</b> Selinus, Halicyae, Segesta and other cities went over to him. He besieged Eryx, which had strong natural defensive features and a large Carthaginian garrison. The siege lasted a long time, but Pyrrhus managed to take the city by storm. He left a garrison there and attacked Iaetia, which was a powerful city in a good strategic position to attack Panormus, which had the best harbour in Sicily. Iaetia surrendered without a fight. Panormus was taken by storm. Pyrrhus was in control of all the Carthaginian dominions except for Lilybaeum. While he was besieging this city, the Carthaginians brought over a big army and large quantities of grain from Africa. They also strengthened the fortifications of the city. Plutarch, whose account of Pyrrhus’ campaign in the Carthaginian territories was brief, just wrote that that Pyrrhus subdued the areas under Carthaginian control and that after seizing Eryx he moved against the Mamertine mercenaries who had seized Messana.

Specifically, the flux of [14 C]benzoic acid across Silastic sheeting as a function of pH was investigated. This isotropic membrane's behavior conformed to expectations drawn from the model in that the un-ionized species penetrated in proportion to benzoic acid's prevailing state of ionization, the membrane being all but impenetrable to the benzoate anion.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the ability and the safety of a series of alkylammonium C 12 -gemini surfactants to act as permeation enhancers for three model drugs, namely lidocaine HCl, caffeine, and ketoprofen. In vitro permeation studies across dermatomed porcine skin were performed over 24 h, after pretreating the skin for 1 h with an enhancer solution 0. 16 M dissolved in propylene glycol. The highest enhancement ratio (enhancement ratio (ER) = 5. 1) was obtained using G 12 - 6 - 12, resulting in a cumulative amount of permeated lidocaine HCl of 156. 5 μg cm− 2. The studies with caffeine and ketoprofen revealed that the most effective gemini surfactant was the one with the shorter spacer, G 12 - 2 - 12. The use of the latter resulted in an ER of 2. 4 and 2. 2 in the passive permeation of caffeine and ketoprofen, respectively. However, <b>Azone</b> was found to be the most effective permeation enhancer for ketoprofen, attaining a total of 138. 4 μg cm− 2 permeated, 2. 7 -fold over controls. This work demonstrates that gemini surfactants are effective in terms of increasing the permeation of drugs, especially in the case of hydrophilic ionized compounds, that do not easily cross the stratum corneum. Skin integrity evaluation studies did not indicate the existence of relevant changes in the skin structure after the use of the permeation enhancers, while the cytotoxicity studies allowed establishing a relative cytotoxicity profile including this class of compounds, single chain surfactants, and <b>Azone.</b> A dependence of the toxicity to HEK and to HDF cell lines on the spacer length of the various gemini molecules was found...|$|E

A test liquid was prepared by extracting 25  mg of a ground part of horse chestnut seed with 1  mL of distilled water in a 1.5 -mL microtube (Violamo, AS ONE Corporation, Osaka, Japan) at 100  °C for 10  min. Briefly, 90 μL extract, 90 μL Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, and 90 μL 10 % sodium carbonate were mixed in the well of a 96 -well microplate (VIORAMO 96 -well plate, <b>Azone,</b> Japan, Round-bottom type). After incubation for 60  min at room temperature, the reaction color was measured with a Sunrise-Thermo microplate reader (Tecan Inc., Salzburg, Austria) at 690  nm. The quantity was expressed proportionally as mg (+)-catechin per 100  g powder (mg/ 100  g dry weight: “mg catechin eq./ 100 gDW”) [8].|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the stratum corneum {{as a barrier to}} drug transport has {{led to the development of}} a variety of chemical permeation enhancers to increase the potential systemic ap-plication of transdermal drug delivery, such as <b>Azone</b> and its analogues, pyrrolidones, polyunsaturated fatty acids, alka-nols, non-ionic surfactants and cyclodextrin. 1 — 3) All the above enhancers have been reported to increase significantly the number of candidates suitable for transdermal delivery. Despite the large number of different chemical entities iden-tified, few is available in the market place due to various lim-itations such as skin irritation. 1) So, the search for new en-hancers with excellent characteristics has been continuing in the last two decades.

40|$|Halobetasol {{propionate}} (HB) is {{a potent}} synthetic corticosteroid used against inflammatory skin diseases, such as dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis, among others. The {{aim of this study}} is to define how the presence of different skin penetration enhancers (nonane, menthone, limonene, <b>azone,</b> carene, decanol, linoleic acid and cetiol) affects the penetration and retention in skin of HB. To determine drug penetration through skin, 5 % of each promoter was used in an ex vivo system with human skin on Franz cells. The results showed that the highest permeation occurs in the presence of menthone, followed by nonane. Permeation parameters were determined. The in vivo test was assessed, and the formulation containing HB-menthone presented better anti-inflammatory efficacy. These results are useful to generate a specific treatment according to each patient’s needs, and the inflammatory characteristics of the disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{permeability}} coefficient of 5 -fluorouracil through human abdominal and hairless mouse skins {{was used as}} an indicator of the relative effects of 12 -h pretreatment of the skins with either penetration-enhancer mixtures [including laurocapram (<b>Azone),</b> decylmethylsulfoxide, oleic acid, and propylene glycol] or saline (control). After treatment with saline, fluxes of 5 -fluorouracil through the two skin types were similar, but the mouse skin showed exaggerated responses to all the penetration-enhancer formulations. There was no consistent relationship between enhancer effects on the two skin types, and we conclude that the hairless mouse model should not be used to predict the effects of penetration enhancers in human skin. After treatment with saline, hairless mouse skin sharply increased in permeability after approximately 50 h hydration, suggesting that the stratum corneum had started to disrupt, whereas the flux through human skin remained unchanged...|$|E

In vitro permeation experiments using skin samples from excised from pig showed that the samples of 7 -metoxytacrine dispersed in TRIS-buffer and propylene glycol yields average fluxes of substantially lower values than the permeation of 7 -metoxytacrine from isopropyl myristate vehicle. It was also shown to affect the enhancing transkarbam 12 and both from hydrophilic and lipophilic of the environment. But the acceleration effect of pyrrolidone has not been proved. <b>Azone</b> and transkarbam 12 appears as promising permeation enhancers from isopropyl myristate donor vehicle. In the case of permeation from TRIS-buffer and propylene glycol mixture only transkarbam 12 appears to be suitable accelerant.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if transdermal penetration of fenoterol, a β-agonist drug, could be enhanced and controlled by formulation modification and formulation of transdermal patches. Pre-formulation studies were performed to determine the feasibility of a transdermal dosage form of fenoterol. Penetration of fenoterol was determined using the hairless guinea pig skin with unjacketed Franz diffusion cell. Transdermal patches were formulated using drug in-adhesive technique. Several enhancers were investigated for fenoterol skin penetration. Transcutol–oleic acid co-solvent gives the highest drug flux among all tested liquid formulations. Pretreatment of the skin with oleic acid 2 h before patch application significantly increases drug diffusion. Cis-oleic acid gives best results compared to oleic acid. <b>Azone</b> derivative (1 -dodecyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone) gives the highest drug diffusion amongst all tested enhancers. Results of this study show the feasibility of using fenoterol formulated in transdermal delivery system in the treatment of chronic asthma to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduce the inter-subject variability...|$|E
