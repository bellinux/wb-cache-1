5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients.</b> White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E

After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

Throughout the entire process, temperature must be consistently monitored to make sure <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> are being added and absorbed properly. Air is then removed in order to prevent oxidation, maintain proper colouring and inhibit the growth of any unwanted bacteria. Before being packaged, the ketchup is heated to approx.190°F (88°C) to prevent contamination.|$|E

500|$|This {{severe weather}} {{outbreak}} {{can be traced}} back to a powerful, slow-moving low pressure area with a warm front to the north over Nebraska and Missouri. On May 4, the low stalled over the High Plains and additional moisture coming from the Gulf of Mexico moved in behind the warm front and increased amounts of instability across much of the region, with CAPE values as high as 5,500 J/kg. In addition, the dry line, which marks a divided line between the dry and humid air mass, was positioned over the southern High Plains. [...] This allowed for the initiation of scattered supercells on May 4.
