5|$|After {{entering}} NSS, {{the pair}} learned that Seung-hee was their undercover scout agent. While the duo was surprised <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> hurt, Hyun-jun was angered the most {{as he felt}} his heart was toyed with. During a team celebration dinner, Hyun-jun confronted her alone and the two embraced the passion they have for one another. Afterward, the two maintained a secret romantic relationship without the knowledge of anyone.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms had a {{great impact}} on the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede's {{surface is}} a mix of two types of terrain: very old, highly cratered, dark regions <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> younger (but still ancient), lighter regions marked with an {{extensive}} array of grooves and ridges. The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface, contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its {{induction}} pharmacokinetics, methoxyflurane {{has very}} slow <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> unpredictable emergence characteristics. During initial clinical studies in 1961, {{the average time}} to emergence after discontinuation of methoxyflurane was 59minutes after administration of methoxyflurane for an average duration of 87minutes. The longest time to emergence was 285minutes, after 165minutes of methoxyflurane administration.|$|E

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} {{are located on}} both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> larger. The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) of T.tabacinus are {{club-shaped}} {{and measure}} 23.5–37.0 by 8.5–13.0μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} inner surface of the tubes) are 45.0–60.0 by 6.5–12.5μm, lanceolate (lance-shaped) to narrowly fusoid-ventricose (enlarged in the middle <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> spindle-shaped). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the outer edges of the tubes) are absent. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) form the reticulations on the stem; they are usually club-shaped and measure 21.0–40.5 by 6.5–10.5μm.|$|E
5|$|The {{dictator}} had maius imperium {{and total}} authority {{to command the}} state, however, since the dictator generally tried to maintain order, this did not conflict with {{the responsibilities of the}} other magistrates, who continued to function during a dictatorship. The magister equitum had similar plenary authority, with parallel <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> subordinate authority to the dictator.|$|E

5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{begins with}} and is regularly visited by a broad, ceremonial <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> pompous melody (D), played on brass and woodwind. In between these formal-sounding statements are a cheerful cornet solo and various elaborations and {{variations on the}} Kijé theme, which together give the movement a celebratory feel, both boisterous and sentimental.|$|E
5|$|The {{service is}} {{typically}} used for valuable <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> time-sensitive cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is heavy {{enough to make}} the cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery and spare parts (in both directions), as well as high-end groceries and consumer goods (primarily toward China). While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also make it possible to send less-than-container shipments.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is dark purplish brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 7.5–9.5 by 5.5–6.5 by 4.5–5.5μm, averaging 8.7 by 6.0 by 5.3μm. Its shape in face view is ovate (egg-shaped) to roughly rhomboid, while {{viewed from the}} side it appears elliptical. The spore wall is brown, smooth, about 0.8–1μm thick, and has a germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> club-shaped, tapering slightly to the base; they are clamped, and measure 25–31 by 7–8.5μm.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} {{numerous}} common names, including the grey-necked rockfowl, grey-necked picathartes, bare-headed rockfowl, red-headed rockfowl, blue-headed picathartes, and grey-necked bald crow. Rockfowl is {{a reference to}} the species' habit of building mud nests on rock surfaces and caves. Picathartes refers to the species' scientific name. Bald crow is a reference to its featherless head <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> crow-like appearance, especially in its beak.|$|E
5|$|Van Dormael's films, while few, {{have strong}} common themes between them. They make {{distinctive}} use of naive voiceover {{and examine the}} world from an innocent perspective (the young Thomas in Toto le héros, the mentally handicapped protagonist of Le huitième jour, and the unborn child of Mr. Nobody). These characters views are often colorful, imaginative, <b>and</b> <b>somewhat</b> removed from reality, with slight elements of surreal imagery used to illustrate their active imaginations.|$|E
