50|$|Arsthinol (INN) is an {{antiprotozoal}} agent. It was synthesized for {{the first}} time in 1949 by Ernst A.H. Friedheim by complexation of <b>acetarsol</b> with 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (British anti-Lewisite) and has been demonstrated to be effective against amoebiasis and yaws. It was marketed few years later by Endo Products (Balarsen, Tablets, 0.1 g).Among trivalent organoarsenicals, arthinol was considered as very well tolerated. Recently, it was studied for its anticancer activity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} arsthinol, a trivalent organoarsenic compound (dithiarsolane), {{has been active in}} vitro on leukemia cell lines and offers a better therapeutic index than arsenic trioxide, as estimated by the ratio LD 50 /IC 50. To complete our understanding of its urinary excretion, a sensitive method using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used. Mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of arsthinol at 0. 2 mmol/kg of body weight. The amount of total arsenic in tissues and body fluids was determined by a colorimetric method and urine metabolites were analyzed on a C 18 Acclaim PepMap 100 A column by LC-MS. Our results showed that only three arsenic species (<b>acetarsol,</b> <b>acetarsol</b> oxide and arsthinol) were detected in the first 24 -h urine. Overall, this study confirms that the hydrolysis of dithiarsolanes to arsenoxides (i. e. <b>acetarsol</b> oxide) can be followed by an oxidation in arsonic acids (i. e. <b>acetarsol).</b> All these compounds are excreted in the urine...|$|E
40|$|In a {{prospective}} open study, 10 patients with intractable proctitis {{were treated with}} <b>acetarsol</b> suppositories (250 mg b. d. for 4 weeks) and were monitored clinically, biochemically and toxicologically. Proctitis resolved symptomatically and sigmoidoscopically within 2 weeks in nine patients; one patient was unaffected. The only side-effect was of transient thrombocytosis in a single patient. Maximal blood and urinary arsenic concentrations occurred after 1 week's treatment with a total inorganic arsenic in the hazardous range in six patients; subsequent concentrations fell despite continuing therapy and at 4 weeks potentially hazardous values persisted in only two patients. Continued renal excretion and diminished absorption across an improved rectal mucosa {{is thought to be}} responsible for this paradox. Arsenic levels fell rapidly when <b>acetarsol</b> was withdrawn and were indistinguishable from pretreatment values within 4 weeks. Short-term <b>acetarsol</b> therapy offers a useful additional measure when local steroids have failed to control ulcerative proctitis; it appears to be safe and formal controlled comparisons with other therapeutic options are therefore legitimate...|$|E
40|$|Many {{preparations}} {{have been}} used for the local treatment of trichomonas vaginitis and the immedi-ate response to many of them has been satisfactory. Unfortunately, recurrence of infection has occurred in a high proportion of the cases and the problem of satisfactory treatment remains unsolved. Local application of the pentavalent arsenical " <b>acetarsol</b> " is accepted by most clinicians as the treatment of choice. This type of therapy is, however, contra-indicated if the patient has in the past shown sensitivity to an arsenical preparation. Long-continued use of <b>acetarsol</b> has occasionally resulted in arsenical dermatitis, a serious complication which inevitably recurs if an arsenical is used again. Under these circumstances an alternative form of local treatment has to be found. PREVIOUS STUDIE...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{treatment}} of 151 cases of vaginitis in patients attending a leukorrhea clinic were studied. The incidence {{of each type}} of vaginitis is recorded. Analysis of results {{of treatment}} with six compounds currently used in the therapy of vaginitis indicated that <b>acetarsol</b> or pimaricin compounds, with their broader spectra of activity, appeared to be most useful, prior to establishment of a definite diagnosis by means of cultures. Chlordantoin is an effective antifungal agent and {{is associated with a}} high percentage of “culture cures”. Resistant cases should be investigated for diabetes mellitus, and many are aided by a low carbohydrate diet. Metronidazole was used only for resistant cases of trichomoniasis, with a cure rate of over 80 % when both partners were treated simultaneously. Triple-sulfa vaginal cream was effective in over 80 % of patients with nonspecific vaginitis; no cases of resistant bacterial infections were encountered. Dienestrol cream was effective in relieving the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the success of}} the south Powys hydatid control programme by analysis of trends in cystic disease in humans and sheep and dog infestation. DESIGN [...] A review of hospital admissions for human hydatid disease in 1984 - 90, abattoir prevalence surveys of hydatid cysts in adult sheep, arecoline <b>acetarsol</b> and coproantigen surveys of prevalence of Echinococcus infestation in dogs. SETTING [...] All hospitals in England and Wales, three abattoirs, and dog populations in mid ands south east Wales. SUBJECTS [...] Residents of England and Wales admitted to hospital between 1984 and 1990 with a new diagnosis of human hydatid disease (International Classification of Diseases (ICD), ninth revision, code 122) acquired in the United Kingdom. RESULTS [...] The average annual incidence of human hydatid disease in Powys, mid-Wales, fell from 3. 9 x 10 (- 5) in 1974 - 83 to 2. 3 x 10 (- 5) in 1984 - 90. Age specific incidence rates in Wales declined over this period only in children, and no cases occurred in children (< 15 years) in Powys. Two Welsh children who lived in Gwent and mid-Glamorgan were infected. Prevalence of hydatid cysts in old sheep from south Wales declined during the control period, but in 1993 prevalence of cysts was 13 %. Prevalence of E granulosus infestation was zero in the control area in 1993, but it was 2. 4 % in Powys dogs outside the control area in 1989 and 9. 2 % in dogs in Gwent in 1991. CONCLUSIONS [...] Human hydatid disease has been successfully controlled in south Powys but cystic echinococcosis is still endemic in sheep in mid-Wales, and there is a focus of infection in humans, sheep, and dogs in the bordering areas of Gwent and mid-Glamorgan. There is considerable potential for an upsurge in human cases if control measures are relaxed...|$|E
