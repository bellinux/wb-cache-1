5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. <b>Artists</b> <b>can</b> pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn <b>artists</b> <b>can</b> also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E
5|$|In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each {{crew member}} {{controls}} {{a character in}} real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured {{from the perspectives of}} one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, <b>artists</b> <b>can</b> then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.|$|E

50|$|As {{the canvas}} rotates, {{centrifugal}} forces draw the wet paint outwards, creating intricate designs. The <b>artist</b> <b>can</b> drip more paint onto the canvas {{while it is}} spinning, thus layering paints {{on top of each}} other, creating different effects. Using different colors, a skilled spin <b>artist</b> <b>can</b> blend colors together into subtle designs. At any point during this process, the <b>artist</b> <b>can</b> stop the spinning platform to view the canvas. Since the canvas is usually rotating at a high rate, it is difficult if not impossible to view the image on the canvas until the platform has stopped spinning, thus creating a sense of surprise and uncertainty during the creation process.|$|R

25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and {{is the result of}} proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus. Some studies have shown that vibrato {{is the result of a}} neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge. Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful <b>artists</b> <b>can</b> sing a deep, rich vibrato.|$|E

As a result of this exposure, Mr. Malena, as he is called, is now appearing on major label releases such as, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Keyshia Cole, Jamie Foxx, among others. Each quarter, members vote for the best video performances. The top performers are then flown to Los Angeles to compete in front of a panel of celebrity judges. The winner gets a demo deal with Darkchild Productions.|$|E
25|$|Long {{discussed}} {{but so far}} unresolved is {{the question}} of how many artists participated in producing the Gigantomachy. Just as disputed {{is the extent to which}} the character of individual <b>artists</b> <b>can</b> be identified in this work of art. There is agreement that at least the basic design of the frieze was the work of a single artist. In view of its consistency down to the level of details, the plan must have been worked out to its smallest elements; nothing had been left to chance. Already in the arrangement of the fighting groups it can be noted that each group is unique and, for example, that the hairstyle and the footwear of the goddesses always differ. Each of the pairs of fighters is individually arranged. Thus, the figures in themselves reveal their distinctive character rather than this being the result of the artists’ personal styles.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 2000s {{a number}} of {{software-based}} virtual studio environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, can create high quality music using {{little more than a}} single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation, and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. <b>Artists</b> <b>can</b> now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as Max/Msp and Reaktor and freeware packages such as Pure Data, SuperCollider, and ChucK. In some sense, as a result of technological innovation, the DIY mentality that was once a core part of dance music culture is seeing a resurgence.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Change" [...] speak of {{overcoming}} obstacles and achieving triumph, while instilling hope in oneself. It {{centers around the}} concept of surpassing others' expectations and the limitations they set out. The song turns the notion of fearlessness into a movement that is not specified. Dave Heaton of PopMatters noted the lyric [...] "I believe in whatever you do" [...] meant Swift was unconcerned with {{the specifics of the}} cause. He presumed it was a universal message or was about changing the traditions of country music sound and defying the expectations of what country <b>artists</b> <b>can</b> achieve with their careers. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone believed the lyrics addressed political issues.|$|E
500|$|In Western movies, the characters' gun belts {{are often}} worn {{low on the}} hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol's trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw <b>artists</b> <b>can</b> be {{distinguished}} from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and waistbands. Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback. Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback. The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the [...] "Gun that Won the West", it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for [...] "express messengers" [...] and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who {{were in charge of}} overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment.|$|E
500|$|The Shin Megami Tensei and Persona art styles {{have been}} defined by two {{different}} artists: Kazuma Kaneko and Shigenori Soejima. Kaneko {{had a long}} history with the series, having done some work on the original Megami Tensei titles. His first prominent work for the series was on Shin Megami Tensei, who worked on both the sprite art and promotional artwork for the game's characters and demons. He was also responsible for suggesting many of the game's darker features, defining the series' eventual identity. Before designing each demon, Kaneko looks up his chosen subject to get their mythological background, and uses that in their design. Many of Kaneko's demon designs were influenced by both creatures and deities from world mythology, and monsters from popular culture like Godzilla. Alongside working on Shin Megami Tensei II, If... and Nocturne, he also did character designs for the first three Persona games. Kaneko's style has been described as [...] "cold [...] stoic", evolving into that state over time to keep the artwork {{as close as possible to}} the in-game render. He states that he mainly does line drawings for the artwork. He starts his artwork with pencil, and then scans them onto a computer so other <b>artists</b> <b>can</b> work on them digitally.|$|E

25|$|An artist {{may prefer}} a medium that stays fluid for some time, may want one that dries hard, or may want a medium that remains {{somewhat}} sticky. If the medium dries hard the <b>artist</b> <b>can</b> build up layers of color, which will fuse {{together in a}} single firing. This can create unusual intensity or depth of color. If the medium remains sticky the <b>artist</b> <b>can</b> add to the design by dusting more color onto the surface, or can dust on an overglaze powder to create a high gloss surface.|$|R
