5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using <b>a</b> <b>wrench,</b> then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took <b>a</b> <b>wrench</b> from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with <b>a</b> <b>wrench.</b> Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
50|$|The {{pneumatic}} {{torque wrench}} is sometimes confused with <b>a</b> standard impact <b>wrench,</b> {{due to their}} similar appearance. <b>A</b> pneumatic torque <b>wrench</b> is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the Hammers of <b>an</b> impacting <b>wrench.</b> <b>A</b> pneumatic torque <b>wrench</b> has very little vibration, and excellent repeatability and accuracy.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> spoke <b>wrench</b> or spoke key is <b>a</b> small <b>wrench</b> or tool used {{to adjust}} {{the tension in the}} spokes of a bicycle wheel, sulky wheel, {{wheelchair}} wheel, or similar wheel. <b>A</b> spoke <b>wrench</b> is sometimes called <b>a</b> nipple <b>wrench,</b> as it is the spoke nipple - not the spoke - that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> basin <b>wrench,</b> {{sometimes}} called <b>a</b> sink <b>wrench,</b> is <b>a</b> plumbing tool {{that is used}} in confined spaces to turn fasteners that would be difficult or impossible to reach with <b>a</b> plumber <b>wrench</b> or other types of wrenches. For example, the threaded nuts used to secure faucets to sinks are often located in deeply recessed places {{that can only be}} accessed with <b>a</b> basin <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} <b>a</b> <b>wrench.</b> Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they need to move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E
25|$|For example, if {{a person}} places a force of 10N at the {{terminal}} end of <b>a</b> <b>wrench</b> that is 0.5m long (or a force of 10N exactly 0.5m from the twist point of <b>a</b> <b>wrench</b> of any length), the torque will be 5N.m – assuming that the person moves the wrench by applying force in the plane of movement and perpendicular to the wrench.|$|E

25|$|The Type 36 is {{a direct}} clone of the M3A1, {{manufactured}} in 1947 at the Shenyang Arsenal in Mukden. It resembles a M3A1, except {{that it has no}} flats to allow the use of <b>a</b> <b>wrench</b> for easy removal and it has no oil bottle trap in the pistol grip. Its parts are not interchangeable with the M3A1.|$|E
50|$|An {{eccentric}} {{toothed gear}} {{is mounted on}} a hexagonal shaft. The wrench is introduced inside the pipe (especially a close nipple, which has threading its entire length, and therefore no surface for <b>an</b> outside <b>wrench).</b> <b>As</b> the <b>wrench</b> is turned, the eccentric gear is forced to grip {{the inside of the}} pipe. As with <b>a</b> regular pipe <b>wrench,</b> the mechanism is such that the grip on the pipe increases with the torque applied on the wrench.|$|R

25|$|Projecting to {{the rear}} was a {{one-piece}} wire stock made from a formed steel rod that telescoped into tubes {{on both sides of}} the receiver.

Monica uses a sword and a magical bracelet. Combat is composed entirely of real time hack and slash.|$|E
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} {{free-floating}} barrel (the barrel does not contact the handguard). The barrel is {{fastened to the}} receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with <b>a</b> <b>wrench.</b> The barrel is produced using a cold hammer forging process and features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate.
