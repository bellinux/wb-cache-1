25|$|Into this {{national}} mood of resentment fell <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> {{would have a}} significant impact on the Philippine ROTC program. Mark Welson Chua, a student of the University of Santo Tomas and a member of the UST ROTC unit, was found dead, his body floating in the Pasig River on 18 March 2001. Prior to his death, he and another student had reported an account of alleged corruption within the UST ROTC unit to the school's student publication. The National Bureau of Investigation would later conclude that members of the UST ROTC unit were responsible for Chua's death. One of the suspects would be sentenced to death three years later.|$|E
25|$|Of Mice and Men is <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> {{was written}} as a play in 1937. The {{story is about}} two {{traveling}} ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn {{enough money to buy}} their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with The Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, and The Pearl, Of Mice and Men is one of Steinbeck's best known works. It was made into a movie three times, in 1939 starring Burgess Meredith, Lon Chaney Jr., and Betty Field, in 1982 starring Randy Quaid, Robert Blake and Ted Neeley, and in 1992 starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.|$|E

500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Johnson's {{next play}} was much later, Medea in 1730, and his last was Caelia, or, The Perjur'd Lover, which was <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> failed {{so badly that}} it was {{withdrawn}} early. [...] In the preface to Medea, Johnson replied to Pope, admitting that Pope was a better poet but complaining of the pettiness shown by Pope's treatment of those who offended him. [...] It is possible that during these decades Johnson was already engaged in other business. [...] He ran a tavern in Bow Street, Covent Garden. [...] He died in 1748.|$|E

[...] In 2002, after many years of not playing Yale regularly, Princeton decided to re-establish the tradition and challenge Yale to an annual match each spring. The following year, Yale accepted Princeton's request by creating a trophy in memory of Rob Koranda.

This is simply not good enough. The IOC say to have a minute's silence to commemorate these victims of terrorism would be a 'political gesture' but surely not having a minute's silence is, in itself, the political gesture. This {{is not about the}} nationality of the victims – they were Olympians." [...] Roger Evans AM seconded the motion and said, [...] "The IOC needs to show some political courage and allow the commemoration of <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> affected their guests during their event in their venue forty years ago. This important decision should not be dictated by a small number of their members." ...|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{question}} of Goren's radicalism remains controversial. One widely-repeated story about Goren claims that {{shortly after the}} Israeli capture of the Temple Mount, the rabbi either argued that Israel should destroy the al Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock, or simply {{said that it would}} have been a [...] "good thing" [...] if they had been accidentally destroyed. The charge, made by General Narkiss, an eyewitness, in an interview with Haaretz [...] that Rabbi Goren calling for the destruction of the mosques has been used to claim there is a Jewish extremism comparable to Islamic extremism. Goren's close assistant Rabbi Menachem Ha-Cohen who was with Rabbi Goren throughout that historic day denied ever hearing Goren make such a remark. Goren himself personally denied this charge several times. However Goren did make a speech later that year to a military convention, recorded and later broadcast on Israel's army radio in which he said of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque that: ‘Certainly we should have blown it up. It is <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> we did not do so.’ ...|$|E

However, Hewitt was to serve in opposition only briefly before his retirement on 31 July 1976. Hewitt was not able to enjoy retirement however as he died a few months later on 22 November 1976. On his death the new Premier Neville Wran said of Hewitt during his condolence motion in the Legislative Assembly: [...] "He was a down-to-earth man and one who was well regarded, not only within the business world but also within the trade-union movement. Mac was a practical and realistic man. [...] It is <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> Mac Hewitt's death came so soon after his retirement from the Legislative Council. He had earned his retirement. He had served his State and the Parliament and he had looked forward to many years in comfortable retirement - a retirement he had so justly earned." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Conservative Party {{would have}} to, preferably {{at the next}} election, ask: [...] "Do you intend still to control the laws which you obey, the taxes you pay and the {{policies}} of your government?" [...] Five days after this speech, in an interview for The Daily Telegraph, Thatcher praised Powell: [...] "I have always read Enoch Powell's speeches and articles very carefully.... I always think it was <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> he left. He is a very, very able politician. I say that {{even though he has}} sometimes said vitriolic things against me". On the day of the Mid-Staffordshire by-election, Powell claimed that the government should admit that the community charge was [...] "a disaster" [...] and that what mattered most to the people of Mid-Staffordshire was the question of who should govern Britain and that only the Conservative Party was advocating that the British should govern themselves. Thatcher had been labelled [...] "dictatorial" [...] for wanting to [...] "go it alone" [...] in Europe: [...] "Well, I do not mind somebody being dictatorial in defending my own rights and those of my fellow countrymen... lose self-government, and I have lost everything, and for good". This was the first election since 1970 that Powell was advocating a vote for the Conservative Party. However, the Labour Party won the seat from the Conservative Party, mainly because of the community charge.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a strange}} world into {{which he had been}} {{permitted}} to see, unscrupulous, pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire economic struggle; there were allusions he did not understand, incidents that conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of dubious enlightenment.

Sometimes, however, <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that {{we are no longer}} the actors but the spectators of the play.
