The play was a one time event of adapted stories of children's first-hand experiences in South Africa being re-interpreted by and performed by various actors.|$|E
5|$|The {{action at}} Plaman Mapu {{was also a}} key factor in turning the tide of {{political}} opinion against the increasingly beleaguered Sukarno. Defeat in what was intended to be a highly publicised victory helped to break the fracturing patience of the army generals on the right and unite them against what they now saw to be the destructive force of Sukarno and the Communist Party. Tensions between the army and the Communists, already high, peaked on 30 September, when elements of the army, likely Communist, kidnapped and murdered six high-ranking army generals whom they accused of planning a CIA-sponsored coup against the President. Army Reserve Commander Suharto at Sukarno's behest took control of the army and crushed the revolt, but the damage had been done. The army blamed the revolt on the Communists, <b>and</b> <b>excited</b> an anti-leftist fervour among the populace that contributed to the subsequent anti-Communist Purge, where high-ranking members were executed along with hundreds of thousands of suspected collaborators with millions imprisoned. This move almost eliminated the Communists from power and left Sukarno alone and isolated.|$|E
5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued <b>and</b> <b>excited</b> by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E

25|$|As {{ionizing}} radiation moves through matter its energy is deposited through {{interactions with the}} electrons of the absorber. The result of an interaction between the radiation and the absorbing species is removal of an electron from an atom or molecular bond to form radicals <b>and</b> <b>excited</b> species. The radical species then proceed to react with each other or with other molecules in their vicinity. It is the reactions of the radical species {{that are responsible for}} the changes observed following irradiation of a chemical system.|$|E
25|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} typical line shape for {{electronic}} transitions of individual chromophores in a solid matrix. The zero-phonon line {{is located at}} a frequency ω’ determined by the intrinsic difference in energy levels between ground <b>and</b> <b>excited</b> state {{as well as by}} the local environment. The phonon sideband is shifted to a higher frequency in absorption and to a lower frequency in fluorescence. The frequency gap Δ between the zero-phonon line and the peak of the phonon side band is determined by Franck–Condon principles.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} stimulated {{emission}} occurs {{is proportional to the}} number of atoms N2 in the excited state, and the radiation density of the light. The base probability of a photon causing stimulated emission in a single excited atom was shown by Albert Einstein to be exactly equal to the probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom in the ground state. Therefore, when the numbers of atoms in the ground <b>and</b> <b>excited</b> states are equal, the rate of stimulated emission is equal to the rate of absorption for a given radiation density.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{from the}} {{descriptions}} of absorption and stimulated emission above that the rates of these two processes are proportional {{to the number of}} atoms in the ground <b>and</b> <b>excited</b> states, N1 and N2, respectively. If the ground state has a higher population than the excited state (N1 > N2), then the absorption process dominates, and there is a net attenuation of photons. If the populations of the two states are the same (N1 = N2), the rate of absorption of light exactly balances the rate of emission; the medium is then said to be optically transparent.|$|E

With the opening up of the Quebec Central Railway in 1876, mining entrepreneurs, such as Andrew Stuart Johnson established the asbestos industry in the province. The 50 ton output of the mines in 1878 rose to over 10,000 tons in the 1890s with the adoption of machine technologies and expanded production. For a long time, the world's largest asbestos mine was the Jeffrey mine in the town of Asbestos, Quebec.|$|E
