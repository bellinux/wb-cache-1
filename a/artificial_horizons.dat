25|$|The F-102 {{received}} several major modifications during its operational lifetime, with most airframes being retrofitted with infrared search/tracking systems, radar warning receivers, transponders, backup <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> and {{improvements to the}} fire control system. A proposed close-support version (never built) would have incorporated, in addition, an internal Gatling gun, an extra two hardpoints for bombs (in addition to the two underwing pylons for drop tanks that were fitted to all production F-102s), bigger internal fuel tanks, and an in-flight-refueling probe.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding equipment, the Air Corps had in its {{inventory}} 274 Directional gyros and 460 <b>Artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> {{but very}} few of these were mounted in aircraft.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was on initial climb-out following take-off; as it entered clouds both <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> failed, so {{the crew had}} no visual reference. The aircraft banked to the left, dived and crashed into a house 7 km from Vnukovo International Airport.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Leeds Bradford {{airport at}} 16:47 hours UTC departure from runway 14, and was observed immediately to veer off the ATC instructed flight path; {{one minute and}} 50 second into the fight, the first officer reported problems with the <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> in the plane and asked to return to Leeds Bradford.|$|E
50|$|On 31 March 1991, Vickers Viscount HK-1708 of Intercontinental de Aviación {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair {{while on a}} flight from El Dorado International Airport to Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport.

50|$|Given that Elton's {{quadrant}} {{was roughly}} {{as complex as}} an octant in construction, there would not likely be a significant advantage in price. The octant was an easier instrument to use and Hadley had supported the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> on the octant {{in the form of}} spirit levels. This would have given no advantage to Elton's instrument. In addition, there were many other instruments competing for the attention of navigators in this period. In the end, the Hadley octant and later sextant took precedence as instruments for navigators.|$|E
50|$|On 31 March 1991, a Vickers Viscount (registration HK-1708) of Intercontinental de Aviación made an {{emergency}} landing at the airport after experiencing an instrument failure during a cargo flight from El Dorado International Airport in Bogota to Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport on the Caribbean island of San Andrés. While cruising at 16000 ft both <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> failed during turbulence {{and control of the}} aircraft was only regained at 4000 ft. Inspection after landing revealed structural damage beyond economic repair, probably caused by a gear collapse suffered previously on 14 February 1988.|$|E
5000|$|Butler and Knight {{contend that}} henges, which exist only in Britain, {{would have been}} the world's first star observatories. Circular mounds would have had <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> and inner ditches, and when filled with water, would have {{provided}} a [...] "foolproof way of identifying a perfect level". In the case of Stonehenge, it was possible for its builders to have marked the 366 Megalithic yards of its circumference by woodposts, thus creating one of the first geometric divisions of the heavens, with one degree for each day of the year, and observe the movement of stars.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft sextants are {{now out of}} production, but {{had special}} features. Most had <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> to permit taking a sight through a flush {{overhead}} window. Some also had mechanical averagers to make hundreds of measurements per sight for compensation of random accelerations in the artificial horizon's fluid. Older aircraft sextants had two visual paths, one standard and the other designed for use in open-cockpit aircraft that let one view from directly over the sextant in one's lap. More modern aircraft sextants were periscopic with only a small projection above the fuselage. With these, the navigator pre-computed his sight and then noted the difference in observed versus predicted height {{of the body to}} determine his position.|$|E
50|$|The F-102 {{received}} several major modifications during its operational lifetime, with most airframes being retrofitted with infrared search/tracking systems, radar warning receivers, transponders, backup <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> and {{improvements to the}} fire control system. A proposed close-support version (never built) would have incorporated, in addition, an internal Gatling gun, an extra two hardpoints for bombs (in addition to the two underwing pylons for drop tanks that were fitted to all production F-102s), bigger internal fuel tanks, and an in-flight-refueling probe.To train F-102A pilots, the TF-102A trainer was developed, with 111 eventually manufactured. The aircraft was designed with side-by-side seating to facilitate pilot training, a popular concept in the 1950s (also used with the American Cessna T-37, British Hawker Hunter T.7 and English Electric Lightning T.4, among others). This required a redesign of the cockpit and nose incorporating a set of vortex generators {{on the top of}} the cockpit to prevent flow separation under certain circumstances, and repositioning of the intake ducts. Despite the many changes, the aircraft was combat-capable, although this variant was predictably slower, reaching only subsonic speeds in level flight.|$|E
5000|$|Latitude was {{measured}} in the past either by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon (the [...] "noon sight"), or by measuring the altitudes of any other celestial body when crossing the meridian (reaching its maximum altitude when due north or south), and frequently by measuring the altitude of Polaris, the north star (assuming it is sufficiently visible above the horizon, which {{it is not in}} the Southern Hemisphere). Polaris always stays within 1 degree of the celestial north pole. If a navigator measures the angle to Polaris and finds it to be 10 degrees from the horizon, then he is about 10 degrees north of the equator. This approximate latitude is then corrected using simple tables or almanac corrections to determine a latitude theoretically accurate to within a fraction of a mile. Angles are measured from the horizon because locating the point directly overhead, the zenith, is not normally possible. When haze obscures the horizon, navigators use <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> which are horizontal mirrors of pans of reflective fluid, especially mercury historically. In the latter case, the angle between the reflected image in the mirror and the actual image of the object in the sky is exactly twice the required altitude.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} actual flight operations to evaluate an audio <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> display that imposed aircraft attitude information on pilot-selected music. The first experiment examined a pilot's ability to identify, with vision obscured, a change in aircraft roll or pitch, with and without the audio <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> display. The {{results suggest that the}} audio horizon display improves the accuracy of attitude identification overall, but differentially affects response time across conditions. In the second experiment, subject pilots performed recoveries from displaced aircraft attitudes using either standard visual instruments, or, with vision obscured, the audio <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> display. The results suggest that subjects were able to maneuver the aircraft to within its safety envelope. Overall, pilots were able to benefit from the display, suggesting that such a display could help to improve overall safety in general aviation...|$|R

40|$|Review of {{a program}} for the {{development}} of advanced fluidic components and the application of these components to general aviation instrumentation and control. The major project in this category has been the development of a simple, reliable, two-axis autopilot for light aircraft, using a fluidic inertial rate sensor for stability and roll attitude control, and a simple magnetometer for azimuth reference. This autopilot has been succesfully flight-tested. Fluidic hardware developed for this autopilot is described, and projected improvements and extensions are discussed. Application of fluidic components to such flight instruments as turn coordinators, <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> and true airspeed indicators is explored...|$|E
40|$|In 1817, F. Bohnenberger {{presented}} an apparatus {{consisting of a}} fast spinning rotor with cardanic suspension. His invention {{formed the basis for}} L. Foucault’s epochal studies on gyroscopic sensors {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. The development of instruments like the artificial horizon and the directional gyro is a direct result of this work. Later on, gyro technology led also to stabilized platforms forming the early variants of inertial navigation systems. Foucault’s initial intention of using Bohnenberger’s invention as a sensor was the provision of a device offering an inertial direction reference for surveying and navigation. Due to technical limitations, a gyro is, however, suitable for such a task during only a limited period of time. To enable a long-term usage, additional, complementary measurements are required. An artificial horizon therefore includes levelling sensors, and a directional gyro is typically coupled with a magnetic compass. On the other hand, the main feature of integrated navigation systems is the fusion of data from dis-similar signal sources. Thus, <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> and directional gyros represent elementary forms of such systems. Modern integrated navigation systems of high performance consist of the combination of inertial strapdown systems (being the successor of stabilized platforms) and GPS receivers. In photogrammetry, they have become an essential tool for direct georeferencing. Nevertheless, their system structure is still traceable to the early gyro instruments mentioned. This classical system design being outlined in the following opens perspectives for new developments...|$|E
