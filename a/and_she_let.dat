25|$|The {{following}} year, {{a former}} servant came {{by the house}} and covertly informed them that a refractory priest would be presiding at a secret Mass at a farm in Marsyllis, about ten miles (15km) away. This was the Abbé Andrew Fournet, the underground pastor of Maillé, who would give Bichier a new direction in her life, answering her longings. The following week she set out at night on a donkey, led by the same former servant, {{to take part in}} the service. After a journey of three hours, they arrived at the site. After the Mass, Fournet began to hear the confessions of the people. As Bichier approached him, the peasants gave way to her, an aristocrat. Fournet challenged Bichier over her presumption <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him hear the confessions of the entire congregation, going last just as the sun was rising.|$|E
60|$|He came {{round to}} her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him give her his first kiss.|$|E
60|$|He {{put out his}} hand, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him press her {{poor little}} chill fingers; but she said no good-bye.|$|E
6000|$|First <b>she</b> <b>let</b> {{the black}} pass by, <b>And</b> syne <b>she</b> <b>let</b> the brown; But quickly {{she ran to}} the milk-white steed, And pu'd the rider down, ...|$|R
500|$|Before {{the episode}} aired, a {{photograph}} depicting Tony and Ziva dancing while in Germany was released and promoted, and Glasberg commented, [...] "This {{is a very}} personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> herself melt into his arms. I think it's a moment that our Tiva fans will truly enjoy." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{behalf of}} the clan, Markussi {{formally}} asks Sedna for forgiveness, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> the animals return. Croolik's crow offers his services to Markussi. When he declines, the crow flies away; in the last shot it is seen carrying one of the twin amulets, which lights {{up in the same}} way as it did when Putulik was possessed.|$|R
60|$|Ethel had {{not thought}} {{of this as a}} {{convenience}} of the connection, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> Meta kiss her, and owned that it was very nice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I could not, Seti, {{seeing that}} another was present with you whom you refused to dismiss," [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> her eyes rest on me.|$|E
6000|$|A dark-eyed, slender young knight, {{in bright}} armour, drew towards Mabel, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him take her hand; {{but she was}} intent on {{something}} else, and exclaimed-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never! George {{knows he}} can't have {{one without the}} other, and has not {{suggested}} {{such a thing as}} parting us. There is always room in my house for Becky, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> me do as she would if she was in my place," [...] answered Bess, with a look which her friend answered by a smile.|$|R
60|$|Dola. Her soul's too great, {{after such}} injuries, To say <b>she</b> loves; <b>and</b> yet <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> you see it. Her modesty and silence plead her cause.|$|R
2500|$|Bonie {{confirmed}} to police {{that he had}} an ongoing dispute with Moore over her rent. He said she had been a problematic tenant. [...] "She seems to have a drug problem <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> different men into her apartment {{at all hours of the}} night," [...] he told detectives. Soon after her disappearance, he threw out her remaining belongings and rented the house to a new tenant.|$|R
60|$|This was a transgression, {{but it was}} {{one that}} she could pardon. The man's taste was defective, but he had charm <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him lead her into {{intimate}} personal talk.|$|E
60|$|Now her fair {{face that}} had been pale became stained with red <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> her eyes fall {{as though she were}} searching for {{something}} among the rushes that strewed the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Imogene huskily, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> an {{interval}} {{that was long}} to them both elapse before she said anything more. [...] "Have I always done what you thought best, Mrs. Bowen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “They take Mrs. Harry to the inn, nearly {{opposite}} the rocks; she bolts straight up-stairs {{to look out}} of the window, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> out a great cry when she sees the wreck. She won’t rest till she gets on board to her Harry. Cloete soothes her all he can. [...] . All right; you try to eat a mouthful, and {{we will go to}} make inquiries.|$|R
6000|$|There cam' a {{knock to}} her bower-door, [...] <b>And</b> blythe <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him in; It was her brother frae the wars, [...] She lo'ed abune her kin.|$|R
6000|$|Tom wetted {{the end of}} a {{towel and}} began wiping her face, grimy with blood <b>and</b> tears. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> him do it, just moaning amid her sobs: ...|$|R
60|$|Louise {{stared at}} him, {{and if their}} {{acquaintance}} {{had been a little}} older, she might have asked him to come off. As it was she could not speak, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him go on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' thought Mrs. Henley, 'these {{young men}} always hang together;' <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him escape without further question. But, when {{he emerged from}} the house, Guy was already out of sight, {{and he could not}} succeed in finding him.|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed to}} take {{pleasure}} in recalling his defects, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him ramble on; women who are neither psychological puzzles nor interesting personalities {{have a way of}} listening patiently whilst a tortured soul eases its burden by contemplating its own martyrdom.|$|E
6000|$|DOLABELLA. Her soul's too great, {{after such}} injuries, [...] To say <b>she</b> loves; <b>and</b> yet <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> you see it. [...] Her modesty and silence plead her cause.|$|R
6000|$|But it was {{not till}} the moon had risen that the sister came, <b>and</b> as <b>she</b> <b>let</b> down her bucket into the well, the leaves seemed to whisper 'Lyma! Lyma!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but the three-thousand-year gag did not work! She spotted you, cher ami, on the instant. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> me {{take her}} with my kodak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Flora, [...] "you didn't know {{my friends}} {{much better than}} you know me! Mabel's my friend <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> her lover go away. I think it hurt Bob {{when he found out}} what you had done; but has he turned from you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Isabel's at home," [...] {{said the}} girl, who appeared, {{like so many}} people in time of war, to be of a simple, plain-spoken nature; [...] "you'll find her in the garden." [...] <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> the old lady out through a French window.|$|E
60|$|After {{that she}} always wore them--pink and {{primrose}} {{and blue and}} white; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> Jims wreathe flowers in her splendid hair. He had quite a knack of it. She never wore any jewelry except, always, a little gold ring with a design of two clasped hands.|$|E
50|$|Princess Bubblegum summons Finn and Jake and {{explains}} that, {{due to her}} recent brush with death, she has become aware of her own mortality. Reasoning that she {{may not always be}} around for her subjects, she reveals that she has created a candy sphinx named Goliad, from her own DNA. Finn and Jake insist that Bubblegum let them teach it about the world {{and what it means to}} be a leader, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> them, exhausted from her work.|$|R
50|$|At {{this time}} Aak-syu {{has become a}} dance hostess at Bat-je-sing Dancery. One day she runs up against Dang-zai, a {{wandering}} girl, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> Dang-zai live in her room. She never thinks that Gwok-man {{is in the same}} apartment. One day Aak-syu's maid is assaulted by a rogue, Aak-syu herself is beaten for helping her. But later Aak-syu sings in an impromptu, and attracts a plutocrat's attention. The plutocrat wants to marry her, but is refused.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is too much!' said Lord Martindale. 'Arthur, go, {{and tell}} her {{it is high time}} to go home, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> must <b>let</b> the poor child off.' ...|$|R
60|$|He never exactly {{knew what}} he had said to her; but for the two days {{that he was able to}} remain, she wished for him to sit with her as much as possible, though often in silence; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him bring her the English chaplain.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't that alone; {{everything}} indicates it. She {{would hardly}} {{let go of}} him with her eyes. I wish," [...] sighed Mrs. March, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> her head droop upon her hand a moment, [...] "I could be as sure of him as I am of her." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} the {{supremacy}} which the turn of affairs had given her, Juliet Bingham looked far from satisfied, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> Langbourne go {{with a sense of}} inconclusiveness which showed in the parting inclination towards him; she kept the effect of this after he turned from her.|$|E
50|$|Arriving at Patti's {{apartment}} after midnight, {{she tells}} them she will have the baby and wants nothing from Billy. Then she shuts herself in her bedroom. Billy begs Eddie {{to speak to her}} <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> him in. After talking about each other's lonely lives, he divorced <b>and</b> <b>she</b> preferring freedom, tenderly they make love. Billy looks in and sees he is no longer wanted. As he prepares to drive Eddie home, Patti takes a photograph of him to give to the child one day. When Eddie asks, Patti says he can call again.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few moments}} Suzanne covered {{her face with her}} hands, <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>let</b> them fall again he saw that her {{beautiful}} eyes shone like the large stars at night, <b>and</b> that, although <b>she</b> was troubled, her trouble made her happy.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was all so}} understandable--looked at in {{the proper}} light. It was all so {{impossible}} to explain. <b>And</b> why had <b>she</b> <b>let</b> it happen? Why had <b>she</b> <b>let</b> it happen? ...|$|R
