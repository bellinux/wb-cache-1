5|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} by Brown & Kempf in 1968 {{based on two}} workers collected in a Berlese sample of humus in El Salvador. Due to morphological similarities, they considered it a very primitive ant <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> {{what was then a}} myrmicine tribe, the Agroecomyrmecini, together with ants known from Early Eocene Baltic amber (Agroecomyrmex) and late Eocene Florissant shale (Eulithomyrmex).|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the banded houndshark was authored by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, based on a dried specimen from Japan, in their 1838–41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They gave it the specific epithet scyllium, derived from the Ancient Greek skylion ("dogfish"), <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the genus Triakis. Within the genus, it {{is placed in the}} subgenus Triakis along with the leopard shark (T. (Triakis) semifasciata).|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E

5|$|The Duke and Duchess of York (later George V and Queen Mary) visited New Zealand in 1901. At an {{official}} Māori welcome in Rotorua, a guide took a huia tail feather {{from her hair}} <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the band of the Duke's hat as a token of respect. Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in their hats. The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £1, making each bird worth £12, and some feathers sold {{for as much as}} £5. Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery. Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901, and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant {{was first}} {{described}} in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Ponera metallica {{based on two}} syntypes; a worker and a queen he collected in Adelaide, South Australia. These specimens were later reviewed in 1958 with the designation of a lectotype from the syntypes, but it is unclear which specimen was designated. The material is currently housed in the Natural History Museum in London. In 1862 Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr moved the species from the genus Ponera <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Rhytidoponera as Ectatomma (Rhytidoponera) metallicum, {{which at the time}} was a newly erected subgenus of Ectatomma. Mayr's original reclassification was short-lived as in 1863 he moved the ant from Rhytidoponera to Ectatomma. In 1897 Italian entomologist Carlo Emery named the ant Rhytidoponera metallica and in 1911 designated it as the type species of Chalcoponera, a subgenus of Rhytidoponera; the ant was, however, mistakenly identified as the type species of Rhytidoponera by some scientists.|$|E

Sure enough, the carabao ate it, but his stomach couldn't handle the spoiled food, so he defecated, leaving behind him a mound of feces, until he had emptied his stomach of the food.

The Gospel of John refers to strips of linen used by Joseph of Arimathea and states that Apostle Peter found {{multiple}} pieces of burial cloth after the tomb was found open, strips of linen cloth for the body and a separate cloth for the head. The Gospel of the Hebrews, a 2nd-century manuscript, states that Jesus gave the linen cloth to the servant of the priest.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, {{despite the}} {{popularity}} of the Ku Klux Klan and high numbers of lynchings throughout Texas, Waco's authorities attempted to respond to the NAACP's campaign and institute more protections for African Americans or others threatened with mob violence and lynching. In 1923, Waco's Sheriff Leslie Stegall protected Roy Mitchell, an African American coerced into confessing to multiple murders, from mob lynching. Mitchell was the last Texan to be publicly executed in Texas, and also the last to be hanged before the introduction of the electric chair. In the same year, the Texas Legislature created the Tenth Civil Court of Appeals <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Waco; it is now known as the 10th Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Longo {{obtained}} {{as a gift}} {{a painting}} portraying Our Lady of the Rosary, with Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena. Sister M. Concetta de Litala of the Monastery of the Rosary at Porta Medina had been holding it for the Dominican priest Alberto Radente. Radente had acquired it from a junk-shop dealer in Naples for a very small sum. The painting was in bad condition and Longo wrote of his immediate distaste of the poor artistic quality {{when he first saw}} it. However, he accepted the gift to conserve funds and to not insult the Sister Concetta. Longo raised funds to restore the image <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the church in an effort to encourage pilgrimages.|$|E
25|$|Vasari {{mentions}} {{an important}} event in Giorgione's life, {{and one which}} influenced his work, his meeting with Leonardo da Vinci {{on the occasion of}} the Tuscan master's visit to Venice in 1500. All accounts agree in representing Giorgione as a person of distinguished and romantic charm, a great lover and a musician, given to express in his art the sensuous and imaginative grace, touched with poetic melancholy, of the Venetian existence of his time. They represent him further as having made in Venetian painting an advance analogous to that made in Tuscan painting by Leonardo more than twenty years before; that is, as having released the art from the last shackles of archaic rigidity <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> possession of full freedom and the full mastery of its means.|$|E

25|$|Drosera meristocaulis was {{discovered}} during a 1953 to 1954 expedition to Pico da Neblina {{led by the}} New York Botanical Garden. It was subsequently described in 1957 by Bassett Maguire and John Julius Wurdack in Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden. Because of the isolated habitat in which D.meristocaulis is found, very few specimens of this species have been collected. After the initial description, a second herbarium collection was made in 1985. When Maguire and Wurdack described the new species, they recognized how unique it was <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> its own section, Drosera sect. Meristocaulis, which they authored in the same publication. In {{a review of the}} taxonomy of the genus in 1996, botanist Jan Schlauer elevated the section to subgenus rank because of the species' unique, relict characteristics.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, a four ton {{monument}} {{was erected}} {{at the site}} of where the mass execution of the thirty-eight Dakota took place in 1862. In 1971, the City of Mankato, Minnesota removed the monument <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the city storage until the mid-1990s, when it disappeared, possibly abandoned to individuals within the Dakota Tribal Government. In 1992, the City purchased the site and created Reconciliation Park. There is no mention of the execution, but several stone statues in and around the park serve as a memorial. The annual Mankato Pow-wow, held in September, commemorates the lives of the executed men, but also seeks to reconcile the American and Dakota communities. The Birch Coulee Pow-wow, held on Labor Day weekend, honors the lives of those who were hanged.|$|E
25|$|While much of {{the debate}} focused on the law's precise language, there was {{considerable}} opposition in the Senate, almost entirely from Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge and Hiram Johnson, the former speaking in defense of free speech and the latter assailing the administration for failing to use the laws already in place. Former President Theodore Roosevelt voiced opposition as well. President Wilson and his Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory viewed the bill as a political compromise. They hoped to avoid hearings that would embarrass the administration for its failure to prosecute offensive speech. They also feared other proposals that would have withdrawn prosecutorial authority from the Justice Department <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the War Department, creating a sort of civilian court-martial process of questionable constitutionality. The final vote for passage was 48 to 26 in the Senate and 293 to 1 in the House of Representatives, with the sole dissenting vote in the House cast by Meyer London of New York.|$|E
