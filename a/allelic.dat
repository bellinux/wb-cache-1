5|$|After a B cell {{produces}} a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a {{process known as}} <b>allelic</b> exclusion) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} <b>allelic</b> drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of <b>allelic</b> variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{juvenile}} myoclonic epilepsy and EA5 are <b>allelic</b> {{and produce}} proteins with similar dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|With MLST, this {{technique}} of typing uses fragments of several housekeeping genes known as aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tip, and yqiL. These sequences are then assigned a number which give to {{a string of}} several numbers that serve as the <b>allelic</b> profile. Although {{this is a common}} method, a limitation about this method is the maintenance of the microarray which detects newly <b>allelic</b> profiles, making it a costly and time-consuming experiment.|$|E
25|$|The CX3CR1 <b>allelic</b> {{variants}} {{have also}} been shown to {{have an effect on the}} disorder's progression and life expectancy.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} levels of <b>allelic</b> {{diversity}} found within its genes, MHC has also attracted the attention of many evolutionary biologists.|$|E
25|$|The {{detection}} limit of CAPP-Seq {{is affected by}} three main areas: the input amount of ctDNA molecules, sample cross-contamination, potential <b>allelic</b> bias in the capture reagent, and PCR or sequencing errors. CtDNA is able to be detected at a lower limit of 0.025% fractional abundance in the blood. Sample cross-contamination {{was found to be}} a very small contribution and reports have shown minimal <b>allelic</b> bias towards capture of reference alleles in PBLs (peripheral blood lymphocytes). PCR and sequencing errors are also minimal.|$|E
25|$|Type D Niemann–Pick {{has only}} {{been found in the}} French Canadian {{population}} of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, and is now known to be <b>allelic</b> with Niemann–Pick type C.|$|E
25|$|The PAH gene {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 12 in the bands 12q22-q24.1. More than 400 disease-causing mutations {{have been found in}} the PAH gene. This is an example of <b>allelic</b> genetic heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{studies by}} Miriam Murphy, David Croke, and other {{researchers}} identified certain genetic diseases such as galactosemia that are {{more common in the}} Irish Traveller population, involving identifiable <b>allelic</b> mutations that are rarer among the rest of the community.|$|E
25|$|Each {{phenotype}} {{is based}} upon the <b>allelic</b> variation within the individual genotype. However, several genetic events can influence a same phenotypic trait, and establishing genotype-to-phenotype relationships can thus be far from consensual with many enzymatic patterns. For instance, the influence of the CYP2D6*1/*4 <b>allelic</b> variant on the clinical outcome in patients treated with Tamoxifen remains debated today. In oncology, genes coding for DPD, UGT1A1, TPMT, CDA involved in the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU/capecitabine, irinotecan, 6-mercaptopurine and gemcitabine/cytarabine, respectively, have all been described as being highly polymorphic. A strong body of evidence suggests that patients affected by these genetic polymorphisms will experience severe/lethal toxicities upon drug intake, and that pre-therapeutic screening does help {{to reduce the risk of}} treatment-related toxicities through adaptive dosing strategies.|$|E
25|$|MHC <b>allelic</b> {{diversity}} {{has challenged}} evolutionary biologists for explanation. Most posit balancing selection (see polymorphism (biology)), which is any natural selection process whereby no single allele is absolutely most fit, such as frequency-dependent selection and heterozygote advantage. Recent models suggest {{a high number}} of alleles is implausible via heterozygote advantage alone.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} in the earlier part of this article, sexual reproduction is conventionally explained as an adaptation for producing genetic variation through <b>allelic</b> recombination. As acknowledged above, however, serious problems with this explanation have led many biologists {{to conclude that the}} benefit of sex is a major unsolved problem in evolutionary biology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the view}} of the repair and {{complementation}} hypothesis, the removal of DNA damage by recombinational repair produces a new, less deleterious form of informational noise, <b>allelic</b> recombination, as a by-product. This lesser informational noise generates genetic variation, viewed by some as the major effect of sex, as discussed in the earlier parts of this article.|$|E
25|$|The {{founder effect}} {{occurs when a}} small group from one {{population}} splits off and forms a new population, often through geographic isolation. This new population's <b>allelic</b> frequency is probably different from the original population's, and will change how common certain alleles are in the populations. The founders of the population will determine the genetic makeup, and potentially the survival, of the new population for generations.|$|E
25|$|Broad antigen {{types are}} still useful, such as typing very diverse populations with many {{unidentified}} HLA alleles (Africa, Arabia, Southeastern Iran and Pakistan, India). Africa, Southern Iran, and Arabia show {{the difficulty in}} typing areas that were settled earlier. <b>Allelic</b> diversity makes it necessary to use broad antigen typing followed by gene sequencing because there is {{an increased risk of}} misidentifying by serotyping techniques.|$|E
25|$|Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified {{fragment}} length polymorphism {{was also}} {{put into practice}} during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used PCR to amplify DNA samples. It relied on variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a polyacrylamide gel using an <b>allelic</b> ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by silver staining the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause <b>allelic</b> dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together {{at the top of}} the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of phylogenetic trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.|$|E
25|$|Genetics {{research}} {{relating to}} EEC has {{made great strides}} in recent years, but many findings are currently being debated in the literature. Chromosome 19, within the region of D19S894 and D19S416 has been postulated as the locus for the abnormalities found in EEC syndrome. This is supported by reports (though conflicting) regarding an association of cleft lip +/- palate on locus 19q, which suggests that EEC could be an <b>allelic</b> variant.|$|E
25|$|Genetic drift is a {{cause of}} <b>allelic</b> {{frequency}} change within populations of a species. Alleles are different variations of specific genes. They determine things like hair color, skin tone, eye color and blood type; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between individuals. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles {{of the same size}} and weight but of different colors from a brown paper bag. In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The <b>allelic</b> frequency of a population is the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{evolutionary}} synthesis {{is based}} on the concept that populations of organisms have significant genetic variation caused by mutation and by the recombination of genes during sexual reproduction. It defines evolution as the change in <b>allelic</b> frequencies within a population caused by genetic drift, gene flow between sub populations, and natural selection. Natural selection is emphasised as the most important mechanism of evolution; large changes are the result of the gradual accumulation of small changes over long periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Giardia {{had been}} {{assumed to be}} primitively asexual and with no means of {{transferring}} DNA between nuclei. These assumptions made {{it very difficult to}} explain the remarkably low level of <b>allelic</b> heterozygosity (< 0.01%) in the genome isolate, WB. However, all those assumptions of asexuality are now in doubt, with population genetics providing evidence for recombination and the identification of meiotic genes, evidence for recombination among isolates and the evidence for exchange of genetic material between nuclei during the process of encystation.|$|E
25|$|Microsatellites were popularized in {{population}} genetics during the 1990s because as PCR became ubiquitous in laboratories researchers {{were able to}} design primers and amplify sets of microsatellites at low cost. Their uses are wide-ranging. A microsatellite with a neutral evolutionary history makes it applicable for measuring or inferring bottlenecks, local adaptation, the <b>allelic</b> fixation index (FST), population size, and gene flow. As next generation sequencing becomes more affordable the use of microsatellites has decreased, however they remain a crucial tool in the field.|$|E
25|$|Diploid Male Decline: Studies {{have shown}} that populations of E. imperialis have unusually high {{frequency}} of diploid males induced by chronically low N (population size), most likely due to the long-ranged dispersed nature of being a non-social bee. Population size fluctuates dramatically over time, and male reproductive success is strongly affected by the complex chemical fragrances they collect from flowers, both of which considerably reduce N. Therefore, the high frequency of diploid males for E. imperialis is a sensitive indicator for genetic diversity and <b>allelic</b> loss.|$|E
25|$|A {{child who}} was {{eventually}} diagnosed with cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts was first described in the literature in 1987. The disorder was suspected of being <b>allelic</b> with either the Revesz syndrome or leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts. However, Revesz syndrome, a severe variant of dyskeratosis congenita, was later shown to result from heterozygous dominant mutations in the TINF2 gene, which encodes TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2, {{a major component of}} the telomere protecting shelterin complex, and individuals with the leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts phenotype have not had mutations in the CTC1 gene.|$|E
25|$|Geneticists have {{identified}} more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability. Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed some {{correlation between the}} timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with {{the timing of the}}ir domestication. Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the <b>allelic</b> variation in pigs. Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{scholars}} to perform genetic studies was Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza. He used classical genetic markers to analyse DNA by proxy. This method studies differences in the frequencies of particular <b>allelic</b> traits, namely polymorphisms from proteins found within human blood (such as the ABO blood groups, Rhesus blood antigens, HLA loci, immunoglobulins, G6PD isoenzymes, among others). Subsequently his team calculated genetic distance between populations, {{based on the principle}} that two populations that share similar frequencies of a trait are more closely related than populations that have more divergent frequencies of the trait.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies of}} {{colorectal}} tumours found that <b>allelic</b> deletions of segments of chromosome 18q {{occur in a}} very high percentage of colorectal cancers. DCC was initially cloned out {{of the region and}} put forth as a putative tumour suppressor gene, though nothing was known about its function at the time. The DCC gene was examined for the genetic changes found with most other tumour suppressor genes, but it was found to have a comparatively low frequency of somatic mutation. Several years later DCC was shown to encode a transmembrane receptor protein that mediated the effects of netrin-1 on axon outgrowth.|$|E
25|$|First, optimal oligo {{length for}} the {{transfected}} linear DNA should be between 60 and 90 base pairs. This guideline {{is based on}} previous observations that this length has the highest <b>allelic</b> replacement efficiency. Longer oligos are prone to forming hairpin structures that are not only inhibitory, but also are more expensive to synthesize. Shorter oligos have lower hybridization energies, resulting in decreased stability of the oligo to the chromosomal target. Of this sequence, at least 15 base pairs should be homologous to the target sequence at both the 5’ and 3’ ends to provide sufficient oligo annealing.|$|E
25|$|Diploid organisms contain {{two copies}} of each gene. If these are {{different}} (heterozygous / heteroallelic), the two different copies of the allele may {{interact with each other}} to cause epistasis. This is sometimes called <b>allelic</b> complementation, or interallelic complementation. It may be caused by several mechanisms, for example transvection, where an enhancer from one allele acts in trans to activate transcription from the promoter of the second allele. Alternately, trans-splicing of two non-functional RNA molecules may produce a single, functional RNA. Similarly, at the protein level, proteins that function as dimers may form a heterodimer composed of one protein from each alternate gene and may display different properties to the homodimer of one or both variants.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s and {{the first}} several years of this millenium, {{microsatellites}} were the workhorse genetic markers for genome-wide scans to locate any gene responsible for a given phenotype or disease, using segregation observations across generations of a sampled pedigree. Although the rise of higher throughput and cost-effective single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platforms led to {{the era of the}} SNP for genome scans, microsatellites remain highly informative measures of genomic variation for linkage and association studies. Their continued advantage lies in their greater <b>allelic</b> diversity than biallelic SNPs, thus microsatellites can differentiate alleles within a SNP-defined linkage disequilibrium block of interest. Thus, microsatellites have successfully led to discoveries of type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2) and prostate cancer genes (the 8q21 region).|$|E
25|$|Studies of the {{variable}} positions of DP, DR, and DQ reveal that peptide antigen contact residues on class II molecules {{are most frequently}} the site of variation in the protein primary structure. Therefore, {{through a combination of}} intense <b>allelic</b> variation and/or subunit pairing, the class II 'peptide' receptors are capable of binding an almost endless variation of peptides of 9 amino acids or longer in length, protecting interbreeding subpopulations from nascent or epidemic diseases. Individuals in a population frequently have different haplotypes, and this results in many combinations, even in small groups. This diversity enhances the survival of such groups, and thwarts evolution of epitopes in pathogens, which would otherwise be able to be shielded from the immune system.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} by linkage {{analysis}} or direct mutation screening is clinically available; however, genetic heterogeneity {{is a significant}} complication to molecular genetic testing. Sometimes a relatively large number of affected family members need to be tested {{in order to establish}} which one of the two possible genes is responsible within each family. The large size and complexity of PKD1 and PKD2 genes, as well as marked <b>allelic</b> heterogeneity, present obstacles to molecular testing by direct DNA analysis. The sensitivity of testing is nearly 100% for all patients with ADPKD who are age 30 years or older and for younger patients with PKD1 mutations; these criteria are only 67% sensitive for patients with PKD2 mutations who are younger than age 30 years.|$|E
25|$|Populations of P. dominula contain {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} genetic diversity and these variations are most likely due to different dispersal events. Through genetic observations of diverse regional P. dominula populations, an <b>allelic</b> richness and distribution of private alleles was shown in the introduced population, {{as well as the}} oldest population (Massachusetts) had the lowest level of genetic variation. Various dispersion mechanisms existed amongst the P. dominula species and its origin might not be confined to a single regional area. Furthermore, the genetics of Southern Californian population differed from those of both Eastern and Northern California, suggesting the source of the Southern Californian population may be from either an unsampled area with the introduced range or from a different geographic area from within the native range.|$|E
25|$|In {{the genome}} of an organism, each gene {{is located at}} a {{specific}} place called the locus for that gene. <b>Allelic</b> variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. hair colour, eye colour). However, most alleles {{do not have an}} observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When a population is split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. Random fluctuation of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift. By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate how long ago the two populations were separated.|$|E
25|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of vernalization before flowering. This decision is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals. In Arabidopsis thaliana it is known that genes like CONSTANS (CO), FRIGIDA, Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) integrate the environmental signals and initiate the flower development pathway. <b>Allelic</b> variation in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes that grow in the cold temperate regions require prolonged vernalization before they flower, while the tropical varieties and common lab strains, do not. Much of this variation is due to mutations in the FLC and FRIGIDA genes, rendering them non-functional.|$|E
