40|$|Runge-Kutta {{methods for}} the time {{integration}} of the equations of motion in structural dynamics are presented. The methods belong to a class called SDIRK (singly-diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta) methods. The computational cost needed per step is comparable to Newmark methods with ff damping.

First we show that a parity check collection that corrects all correctable erasure patterns of size m for the r-th order Hamming code (i. e, the Hamming code with codimension <b>r)</b> provides for <b>all</b> codes of codimension $r$ a corresponding ``generic'' parity check collection with this property.

Independent phase sets were developed using SHARP and improved by solvent flipping with SOLOMON using molecular envelopes derived from experimental densities for, respectively, peak-wavelength SAD data from four different crystals, MAD data and their M(S) IRAS combinations with native data. Hendrickson-Lattman phase-probability coefficients from each phase set were used in BUSTER to drive maximum-likelihood refinements of well defined parts of the previously refined room-temperature 2. 9 A structure. Maximum-entropy completion followed by manual rebuilding was then used to generate {{a model for the}} missing segments, bound ligand and solvent molecules.
