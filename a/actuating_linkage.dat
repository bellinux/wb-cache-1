40|$|The {{kinematic}} {{analysis of}} an articulated twin-body, four-wheel, robotic vehicle is pre-sented. Polaris, a research platform and contending robotic {{vehicle in the}} Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) at Virginia Tech, was redesigned in 2006 to improve the mobility of the vehicle by incorporating an innovative four-bar linkage that connects the two bodies. The new linkage design minimizes vehicle off-tracking by allowing the rear wheels to closely track {{the path of the}} front wheels. This thesis will outline the theo-retical kinematic model of the four-bar linkage as applied to a twin-bodied, differentially driven vehicle. The kinematic model is validated through computer simulation as well as experimentation on a fully operational robotic vehicle. The kinematic model presented here outlines the foundations for an autonomous, four-wheel drive, multi-body control system and opens avenues for dynamically controlling the tracking of the vehicle’s rear body with an <b>actuated</b> <b>linkage</b> configuration.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the design of}} a parallel spring-loaded <b>actuated</b> <b>linkage</b> intended for dynamically dexterous legged robotics applications. Targeted at toe placement in the sagittal plane, the mechanism applies two direct-drive brushless dc motors to a symmetric five bar linkage arranged to power free tangential motion and compliant radial motion associated with running, leaping, and related agile locomotion behaviors. Whereas traditional leg design typically decouples the consideration of motor sizing, kinematics and compliance, we examine their conjoined influence on three key characteristics of the legged locomotion cycle: transducing battery energy to body energy during stance; mitigating collision losses upon toe touchdown; and storing and harvesting prior body energy in the spring during stance. This analysis leads to an unconventional design whose “knee” joint rides above the “hip” joint. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting mechanism can deliver more than half again as much kinetic energy to the body (or more than double the kinetic energy if the full workspace is used), and offers a five-fold increase in energy storage and collision efficiency relative to the conventional design...|$|R

40|$|Control moment gyros (CMGs) are an {{energy-efficient}} {{means of}} reactionless actuation. CMGs operate by gimbaling a high-speed rotor {{to change the}} momentum of a base body. We investigate a robotic <b>linkage</b> <b>actuated</b> by scissored-pair CMGs. Scissored pairs constrain the output torque from the CMGs to act along the joint axis, eliminating undesirable gyroscopic reaction torques. This work compares the energy required to <b>actuate</b> a robotic <b>linkage</b> with either CMGs or direct drive motors. We show that the CMG power {{is equal to the}} direct-drive power for a large range of gimbal inertias and peak gimbal angles. The transverse rate does not independently affect this result. We find that the scissored pair’s peak gimbal rate is a ratio of body acceleration to body rate. The equations of motion for an n-link robot with CMGs are presented in a recursive form for easy implementation in software. The results for a one-link robot extend easily to two-link robots with orthogonal joint axes when the peak body rate and peak gimbal angle are adjusted to account for the influence of neighboring links. CMGs surprisingly outperform direct drive for a two-link robot with parallel joint axes when the joints rotate with opposite sign, as in reaching tasks; although the reverse is true when the joints act in unison. These differences arise because CMGs produce body torques with a zero-torque boundary condition at the joint, whereas direct drive produces joint torques. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{butterfly}} valve is <b>actuated</b> through hydraulic <b>linkages.</b> This {{consists of a}} hydraulic pressure pump which {{is connected to the}} {{butterfly valve}}. This pump controls the operation of butterfly valve in following manner:When brakes are applied by the driver, the cylinder reduces its pressure so that the valve closes and restricts the path of exhaust gases. In this position the butterfly valve remains perpendicular to the flow of exhaust gases and thus creates back pressure on the engine. The butterfly valve has one to three holes in it so {{that there is not a}} complete blockage of the exhaust pipe. This assures the avoidance of damage due to high pressure. When the brakes are released by the driver, the cylinder generates pressure so that butterfly valve is opened and allows the exhaust gases to flow into the exhaust pipe. In this position the butterfly valve remains parallel to the path of exhaust gases and thus releases the pressure on the engine and allows its speed to increase.|$|R

This is a Fierce-Arrow Model 80 body and is longer with larger side windows than that of the Buick body. The rear freight compartment was shortened eight inches to allow for the longer body and avoid altering the frame and drive shafts. This is its current configuration as displayed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H steering system {{plays an important role}} in realizing accurate steering control for an automatically guided agricultural vehicle. E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control valve, steering <b>actuating</b> cylinders, steering <b>linkage,</b> and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the zero lapped valve, and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the dynamic modeling and efficient modal {{control of a}} planar parallel manipulator (PPM) with three flexible <b>linkages</b> <b>actuated</b> by linear ultrasonic motors (LUSM). To achieve active vibration control, multiple lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers are mounted on the flexible links as vibration sensors and actuators. Based on Lagrange’s equations, the dynamic model of the flexible links is derived with the dynamics of PZT actuators incorporated. Using the assumed mode method (AMM), the elastic motion of the flexible links are discretized under the assumptions of pinned-free boundary conditions, and the assumed mode shapes are validated through experimental modal test. Efficient modal control (EMC), in which the feedback forces in different modes are determined according to the vibration amplitude or energy of their own, is employed to control the PZT actuators to realize active vibration suppression. Modal filters are developed to extract the modal displacements and velocities from the vibration sensors. Numerical simulation and vibration control experiments are conducted to verify the proposed dynamic model and controller. The {{results show that the}} EMC method has the capability of suppressing multimode vibration simultaneously, and both the structural and residual vibrations of the flexible links are effectively suppressed using EMC approach...|$|R

These advantages may not be important in high-performance applications where part throttle operation is irrelevant, and the primaries and secondaries may all open at once, for simplicity and reliability; also, V-configuration engines, with two cylinder banks fed by a single carburetor, may be configured with two identical barrels, each supplying one cylinder bank. In the widely seen V8 and 4-barrel carburetor combination, there are often two primary and two secondary barrels.|$|R

40|$|In July 2008, a {{self-employed}} construction contractor (the victim) sustained fatal injuries when he {{was crushed}} against the cab of a dump truck by the dump body at a residential construction site. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim was using the dump truck to deliver soil to the site and then grading the soil with a backhoe. The victim worked alone and there was no witness to the incident. The incident was initially reported by the property owner who arrived on site at approximately 5 : 00 PM and found both the dump truck and the backhoe idling. The property owner saw that the victim was crushed between the back of the cab and the front of the dump body that was in the down position. With the dump body down, the width of the space was 7 inches. The dump body movement was controlled by a dump lever located inside the cab.

40|$|Subject-specific {{musculoskeletal}} modeling can {{be applied}} to study musculoskeletal disorders, allowing inclusion of personalized anatomy and properties. Independent of the tools used for model creation, there are unavoidable uncertainties associated with parameter identification, whose effect on model predictions is still not fully understood. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze the sensitivity of subject-specific model predictions (i. e., joint angles, joint moments, muscle and joint contact forces) during walking to the uncertainties in the identification of body landmark positions, maximum muscle tension and musculotendon geometry. To this aim, we created an MRI-based musculoskeletal model of the lower limbs, defined as a 7 -segment, 10 -degree-of-freedom articulated <b>linkage,</b> <b>actuated</b> by 84 musculotendon units. We then performed a Monte-Carlo probabilistic analysis perturbing model parameters according to their uncertainty, and solving a typical inverse dynamics and static optimization problem using 500 models that included the different sets of perturbed variable values. Model creation and gait simulations were performed by using freely available software that we developed to standardize the process of model creation, integrate with OpenSim and create probabilistic simulations of movement. The uncertainties in input variables had a moderate effect on model predictions, as muscle and joint contact forces showed maximum standard deviation of 0. 3 times body-weight and maximum range of 2. 1 times body-weight. In addition, the output variables significantly correlated with few input variables (up to 7 out of 312) across the gait cycle, including the geometry definition of larger muscles and the maximum muscle tension in limited gait portions. Although we found subject-specific models not markedly sensitive to parameter identification, researchers should be aware of the model precision in relation to the intended application. In fact, force predictions could be affected by an uncertainty in the same order of magnitude of its value, although this condition has low probability to occur. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Feedback {{linearization}} is {{an effective}} controller-design methodology for nonlinear systems where {{it is difficult to}} obtain a finite number of operating points to linearize the system for designing well-known linear robust controllers. Feedback linearization becomes one of very limited methodologies {{that can be used for}} control of such systems. Traditional implementations of feedback linearization technique are not robust, which means this control methodology does not account for system uncertainties. The reason being that the control law methodology assumes accurate knowledge of nonlinear dynamics of the system. Recently, in [1] a new methodology was proposed which adds robustness to feedback linearization. The methodology uses sensitivity dynamics-based control synthesis. The methodology was demonstrated on a simple proof-of-concept single actuator mass-spring-damper model. This research is focused on application of robust feedback linearization technique to real life complex hydraulically actuated physical systems. In particular, the methodology is applied to the problem of controlling mechanical linkage configuration in excavator machines. The problem addressed is controlling of bucket angle of excavator such that the bucket is always kept parallel to ground irrespective of boom motion to avoid spilling of the load. The dynamics of systems such as excavator <b>linkage</b> <b>actuated</b> by hydraulic actuator are often complex and application of robust feedback linearization (RFL) methodology gets tedious and cumbersome. The work in this thesis is intended for demonstrating the applicability of RFL methodology for such complex systems and also to lay foundation for development of an automated user-friendly toolbox to enable easy use of such control technique in day-to-day practice. The uncertain parameter considered in the development in this thesis is the bulk modulus of the system as it is the most common uncertainty in the system. The modeling process also considers portability of models from some known commercial software tools such as SimHydraulics and SimMechanics.

40|$|Special-purpose robot hands (end effectors) {{now under}} {{development}} {{are intended to}} enable robots to traverse cliffs much as human climbers do. Potential applications for robots having this capability include scientific exploration (both on Earth and other rocky bodies in space), military reconnaissance, and outdoor search and rescue operations. Until now, enabling robots to traverse cliffs has been considered too difficult a task because of the perceived need of prohibitively sophisticated planning algorithms as well as end effectors as dexterous as human hands. The present end effectors are being designed to enable robots to attach themselves to typical rock-face features with less planning and simpler end effectors. This advance {{is based on the}} emulation of the equipment used by human climbers rather than the emulation of the human hand. Climbing-aid equipment, specifically cams, aid hooks, and cam hooks, are used by sport climbers when a quick ascent of a cliff is desired (see Figure 1). Currently two different end-effector designs have been created. The first, denoted the simple hook emulator, consists of three "fingers" arranged around a central "palm. " Each finger emulates the function of a particular type of climbing hook (aid hook, wide cam hook, and a narrow cam hook). These fingers are connected to the palm via a mechanical <b>linkage</b> <b>actuated</b> with a leadscrew/nut. This mechanism allows the fingers to be extended or retracted. The second design, denoted the advanced hook emulator (see Figure 2), shares these features, but it incorporates an aid hook and a cam hook into each finger. The spring-loading of the aid hook allows the passive selection of the type of hook used. The end effectors can be used in several different modes. In the aid-hook mode, the aid hook on one of the fingers locks onto a horizontal ledge while the other two fingers act to stabilize the end effector against the cliff face. In the cam-hook mode, the broad, flat tip of the cam hook is inserted into a non-horizontal crack in the cliff face. A subsequent transfer of weight onto the end effector causes the tip to rotate within the crack, creating a passive, self-locking action of the hook relative to the crack. In the advanced hook emulator, the aid hook is pushed into its retracted position by contact with the cliff face as the cam hook tip is inserted into the crack. When a cliff face contains relatively large pockets or cracks, another type of passive self-locking can be used. Emulating the function of the piece of climbing equipment called a "cam" (note: not the same as a "cam hook"; see Figure 1), the fingers can be fully retracted and the entire end effector inserted into the feature. The fingers are then extended as far as the feature allows. Any weight then transferred to the end effector will tend to extend the fingers further due to frictional force, passively increasing the grip on the feature. In addition to the climbing modes, these end effectors can be used to walk on (either on the palm or the fingertips) and to grasp objects by fully extending the fingers...|$|R
