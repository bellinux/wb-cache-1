5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, the Goat Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for temperatures of two metal surfaces in sliding contact. Considerable fluctuations are observed. It is suggested that temperature gradients, set up by irregular heating at the surface, cause local thermal expansion at the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> thus perpetuating the irregular contact conditions. The system {{is limited by the}} wear at the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> which eventually reduces the level <b>of</b> the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> to that <b>of</b> the surrounding surface. Subsequent cooling causes contraction and produces depressions which correspond to the wear volume during the cycle. Further experiments to confirm this explanation show good agreement...|$|R

30|$|The vehicle {{travelling}} {{at a fixed}} speed, {{stressed by}} the road roughness that meets along its route in the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between tire and road profile, generates the actions that result in a vertical oscillating motion of the vehicle with respect to its suspension system.|$|R
25|$|The van der Waals {{force of}} {{adhesion}} is also {{dependent on the}} surface topography. If there are surface asperities, or protuberances, that result in a greater total <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between two particles or between a particle and a wall, this increases the van der Waals force of attraction {{as well as the}} tendency for mechanical interlocking.|$|E
25|$|When the {{surfaces}} are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes {{a very poor}} approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even {{when there is no}} normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.|$|E

30|$|In all {{of these}} works, the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> real <b>contact</b> between a smooth elastic solid surface and a hard {{substrate}} with randomly rough surface has been studied. As stated earlier, however, there are essentially no surfaces which are smooth on atomic scales. Here, the elastic solid is assumed to have a rough surface as well, {{and the effect of}} roughness on the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> real <b>contact</b> and the interfacial separation is studied. The contacts are assumed to be frictionless and non-adhesive, and the roughness of both surfaces is assumed to be random. An extended version of Persson’s model <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> mechanics is used to investigate the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> real <b>contact,</b> as well as the interfacial separation between two surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The several {{subspecies}} make up {{two large}} groups and {{three to five}} small or monotypic ones.

25|$|Classical contact {{mechanics}} is most notably associated with Heinrich Hertz. In 1882, Hertz solved the contact problem of two elastic bodies with curved surfaces. This still-relevant classical solution provides {{a foundation for}} modern problems in {{contact mechanics}}. For example, in mechanical engineering and tribology, Hertzian contact stress is {{a description of the}} stress within mating parts. The Hertzian contact stress usually refers to the stress close to the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between two spheres of different radii.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} sign is {{in there}} because we {{are concerned with the}} faster moving liquid (top in figure), which is being slowed by the slower liquid (bottom in figure). By Newton's third law of motion, the force on the slower liquid is equal and opposite (no negative sign) to the force on the faster liquid. This equation assumes that the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> is so large that we can ignore any effects from the edges and that the fluids behave as Newtonian fluids.|$|E
25|$|As the hyphae of the Hartig net region {{become more}} densely packed, they press against the cell {{walls of the}} phytobiont’s root cells. Often the fungal and plant cell walls become almost indistinguishable where they meet, thus forming a {{homogenous}} interfacial matrix through which nutrients can easily disperse. The tips of the branched hyphae contain dense cytoplasm with {{a high concentration of}} mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. This arrangement is stretched in the direction of hyphal growth indicating that the transfer of nutrients between fungus and plant is localized in this <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> ATPase activity in both fungal and plant plasma membranes at the Hartig net indicate a cooperatively bidirectional nutrient exchange.|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of changing immigration policy over the past 50 years, contemporary Australia has a culturally diverse population. Focusing on Brisbane, one of Australia's smaller immigrant-receiving cities but where some 19 per cent {{of the population is}} born overseas, this study examines attitudes to and perceptions of culturally different ethnic (non-Anglo) immigrant groups. Emphasis is placed on patterns of tolerance and intolerance for the city as a whole, both in <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and in <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> minimal <b>contact.</b> Findings show that variations in attitudes vary somewhat from commonly accepted socioeconomic and age-based correlations (the lower the status or the older people are the less tolerant), depending on the particular mix of ethnic birthplace groups present. They also show levels <b>of</b> intolerance in <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> minimal <b>contact,</b> which is implicitly attributed to mass media influences. In light of these findings, a concluding plea is made for anti-intolerance strategies to be developed for cities that pay regard to the geography of attitude-forming contexts. 19 page(s...|$|R

25|$|In {{order for}} the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, {{splitting}} the seed coat. However, {{the nature of the}} seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.|$|E
25|$|A large camp {{had been}} set up to house the workers near this area and Mulholland used his spare time {{becoming}} familiar with the area's geological features. In the area, which later the dam would be situated, he found the mid and upper portion of the western hillside consisted mainly of a reddish colored conglomerate and sandstone formation that had small strings of gypsum interspersed within it. Below the red conglomerate, down the remaining portion of the western hillside, crossing the canyon floor and up the eastern wall, a drastically different rock composition prevailed. These areas were made up of mica schist that was severely laminated, cross-faulted in many areas and interspersed with talc. Although later many geologists disagreed on the exact location of the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between the two formations, a majority opinion placed it at the inactive San Francisquito Fault line.|$|E
25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E

40|$|The ultrastructural {{morphology}} of platelet-polymorph (platelet-polymorphonuclear leukocyte) rosettes {{was investigated}} in EDTA-anticoagulated blood obtained from two patients who exhibited the phenomenon of platelet satellitism. Most of the platelet profiles were attached to the polymorph surface by broad <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> Examination <b>of</b> these broad <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> at high magnification revealed an intercellular material of low electron density. This material appeared to form strands, which bridged the intercellular space and spanned the entire area formed by the apposing plasma membranes. Phagocytosis of entire platelets was only observed in 1 case. The platelet profiles that participated in rosette formation revealed {{a large number of}} glycogen particles, compared with unattached platelets. Ultrastructural examination of "stress" platelets obtained from five normal subjects treated with steroids similarly showed a large number of glycogen particles, although no rosette formation or phagocytosis of platelets was observed. The etiology of platelet satellitism is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Adherens {{junctions}} are sites <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between {{epithelial cells}} in which adhesion is mediated by homophilic interactions of classical cadherins that {{are linked to}} the cytoskeleton via catenins. E-cadherin constitutes the major adhesion molecule in adherens junctions of keratinocytes (KC) and mediates the binding of Langerhans cells to KC in[*]vitro. To characterize structures responsible for E-cadherin-mediated binding of Langerhans cells, we utilized Langerhans cells-like fetal skin-derived dendritic cells (FSDDC) capable of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Confocal microscopy of FSDDC aggregates demonstrated colocalization of E-cadherin and catenins to <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> cell–cell <b>contact.</b> Immunopreciptiation confirmed a physical association of E-cadherin with intracellular catenins (α-, β-, γ-catenin/plakoglobin and p 120 CAS). Transmission electron microscopy of FSDDC aggregates revealed structures with features of adherens junctions in <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> cell–cell <b>contact,</b> and post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy localized β-catenin to these regions. To characterize junctions that accounted for the adhesion of Langerhans cells-like dendritic cells and KC, disaggregated FSDDC were cocultured with primary murine KC. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of cocultures demonstrated FSDDC-KC contacts that were analogous to those seen in FSDDC aggregates. Confocal microscopy demonstrated focal accumulations of E-cadherin and colocalization <b>of</b> β-catenin in <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between KC and immature (Langerhans cell-like) dendritic cells, but not in <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between KC and mature (lymph node dendritic cell-like) dendritic cells. E-cadherin in Langerhans cells appears to be localized in structures that resemble adherens junctions formed by nonpolarized epithelial cells. Loss of ability to form or maintain these structures after the induction of Langerhans cells activation/maturation likely results in the attenuation of Langerhans cells–KC adhesion that preceeds Langerhans cells emigration from the epidermis...|$|R
