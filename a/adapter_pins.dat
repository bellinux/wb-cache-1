5000|$|In the ADP-MAA <b>adapter,</b> <b>pins</b> 2 and 3 ("ID2" [...] and [...] "ID1") are {{directly}} connected to GND, whereas pin 1 ("ID3") is pulled low via a 470 kÎ© resistor.|$|E

50|$|The {{differences}} are primarily in features. The Unisite, {{less than a}} year of entering production, was revised {{in the form of a}} new DIP module, referred to as the 'Site48.' This <b>adapter</b> had 48 <b>pins</b> in its DIP socket, and remained the standard for many years. Its successor, the Site48-HS, is functionally identical, but utilizes solid-state switching for the socket pins instead of the electromechanical relays in earlier adapters such as the 2900 and 39xx series.|$|R
50|$|The T89 {{cartridge}} converter is a 60 to 72 <b>pin</b> <b>adapter</b> {{that allows}} NES owners to plug a 60-pin Famicom game into a 72-pin-based NES. The cartridge required {{the user to}} have the Famicom cartridge label to face the back as otherwise it would cause damage to the cart and/or system. There is a fabric tab on the convert to allow the easy removal of the convert from the original front-loading NES and the subsequent top loader (although the cartridge was easy to access, the converter {{would sit in the}} cartridge slot of the second model in a near flush like state, thus leaving the adaptor difficult to remove).|$|R
40|$|Remote DMA (RDMA) enables high {{performance}} networks to reduce data copying between an application and {{the operating system}} (OS). However RDMA operations in some {{high performance}} networks require communication memory explicitly registered with the network <b>adapter</b> and <b>pinned</b> by the OS. Memory registration and pinning limits {{the flexibility of the}} memory system and reduces the amount of memory that user processes can allocate. These issues become more significant on multicore platforms, since registered memory demand grows linearly with the number of processor cores. In this paper we propose a new memory registration/deregistration strategy to reduce registered memory on multicore architectures for HPC applications. We hide the cost of dynamic memory management by offloading all dynamic memory registration and deregistration requests to a dedicated memory management helper thread. We investigate design policies and performance implications of the helper thread approach. We evaluate our framework with the NAS parallel benchmarks, for which our registration scheme significantly reduces the registered memory (23. 62 % on average and up to 49. 39 %) and avoids memory registration/deregistration costs for reused communication memory. We show that our system enables the execution of problem sizes that could not complete under existing memory registration strategies...|$|R
50|$|Released on December 26, 2008, the XGS AVR 8-Bit and XGS PIC 16-Bit {{development}} {{systems are}} embedded system development kits, {{meant to be}} very competitive entry/midrange development kits for their respective microcontrollers. The systems were designed together and so share {{much of the same}} design other than the main processor. The video signal is generated in software like the XGS Micro and Pico Editions; however, there is color helper hardware to generate the colorburst part of the video signal. The audio signal is also generated directly by the microcontroller. For input, like the XGS Micro, two DB-9 ports and a PS/2 port are supplied. However, instead of being compatible with Atari joysticks, the DB-9 ports are compatible with Nintendo gamepads (though directly connecting an NES or SNES controller would require a <b>pin</b> <b>adapter).</b> Unlike the prior XGS and Hydra systems, programming is primarily in C/C++, utilizing system-specific libraries, though assembly programming and a custom written XGS Basic are also available. The XGS Basic code runs on both systems without modification. Unlike the XGS Micro Edition, code cannot be edited on the system itself - a PC is required. The XGS AVR 8-Bit processor is an Atmel MEGA AVR 644P with 64K FLASH and 4K SRAM running at over 28 MIPS. The XGS PIC 16-Bit processor is a PIC24 with 256K FLASH and 16K SRAM running at over 40 MIPS.|$|R
