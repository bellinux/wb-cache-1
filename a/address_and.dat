40|$|Abstract—Geographic-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing {{has been}} {{discussed}} {{for more than twenty}} years. In this paper, we clarify the purpose of fitting geographic information into <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing, and further propose a new geographic-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing scheme. Our contribution lies in three aspects. First, we classify previous geographic-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing proposals into three categories. Second, we propose a new scheme: ISP-Separated Geographic-Based <b>Addressing</b> <b>and</b> Routing (ISPSG). Third, we evaluate ISPSG through simulation based on real Internet data. The experiment result shows that ISPSG shrinks Default Free Zone routing table size by 69 %- 87 %. Comparing with other proposals, ISPSG is the only one which can support Provider-Independent address, prevent inflation of inter-domain routing table, and support routing policies.

40|$|The {{designers}} of communication networks are {{being challenged by}} {{the emergence of a new}} class of <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing scheme referred to as content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing. This new approach differs from traditional unicast and multicast schemes in that it performs routing based on the data being transported in a message rather than on any specialized <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing information attached to, or otherwise associated with, the message. An example of an application for content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing is an event notification service, which is a general-purpose facility for asynchronously and implicitly conveying information from generators of events to any and all parties expressing interest in those events. In order to implement content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing, we can adopt well-known and successful network architectures and protocols, provided that we understand how to map the core concepts and functionalities of content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing onto [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Barkley {{supported}} Franklin D.

Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the keynote <b>address</b> <b>and</b> temporary chairmanship of the 1932 Democratic National Convention if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley's re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22, 1932. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled the Wilson administration and denounced {{more than a decade}} of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal prohibition. According to Libbey, the remark was not a repudiation of his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express their will on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.|$|E

5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union <b>Address</b> <b>and</b> served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E

Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
