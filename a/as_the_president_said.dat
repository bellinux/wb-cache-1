5000|$|As all the Marine Band directors, Scala {{maintained}} a very strict {{relationship with the}} various American Presidents, that the Band accompanied during their official visits. Scala became Band Director during the President Buchanan mandate. In particular, Scala directed the band during the whole War of Secession, during which he developed a very strict and strong relationship with president Abraham Lincoln, {{to which he had}} already dedicated a special concert in his honor the same night of his election. During the Civil War, president Lincoln maintained that the Marine Band continued to regularly offer its concerts in the front lawn of the White House, even if when President's son died, they were moved to the Lafayette Square in sign of respect. Scala was with Lincoln in Gettysburg on November 19, 1863 for the inauguration of the National Cemetery when Lincoln pronounced his famous address, and he was with him on the White House lawn on April 9, 1865, when the news about the surrounding of the Confederate Army arrived. Under Lincoln's request, the band played the tune [...] "Dixie", because - <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>said</b> from his balcony - [...] "now it is of the Nation's". Eleven days after, the band expressed country's mourning while accompanying Lincoln's coffin during his funeral.|$|E

5000|$|... ¡El pueblo quiere saber de qué se trata! (The {{people want}} to know what is going on!) is an {{anonymous}} Spanish-language phrase from Argentina. It was first used during the May Revolution, the event that began the Argentine War of Independence. An open cabildo deposed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and ordered the establishment of a government junta, but the cabildo appointed <b>the</b> viceroy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of <b>said</b> junta. A huge demonstration forced the cabildo to undo the appointment, and establish instead a junta with members selected by the people.|$|R
5000|$|Harvard ROTC {{was one of}} {{the first}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) units in the country, founded in 1916. [...] The {{original}} program was led by Captain Constant Cordier. By the fall of 1952 forty percent of the incoming freshmen class at Harvard University enrolled in programs that led to a ROTC commission. Harvard has the third most graduates who have received the Medal of Honor. With eighteen recipients, only West Point and the US Naval Academy have more. [...] In 1969, in the middle of sometimes violent protests over the Vietnam War, Harvard downgraded the status of ROTC to an extracurricular activity. The cited reason was over academic standards on coursework. [...] The military’s official departure from Harvard began in the years that followed. [...] For the next several decades Harvard’s connection to ROTC was by allowing their students to take ROTC courses at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By 1994, in the midst of the controversy over the Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (DADT) law on homosexuality, Harvard committed to upholding ROTC ties, but only through indirect alumni contributions. This compromise prevented all ties from being severed as was recommended in the 1992 faculty committee report. [...] Harvard University President Drew Faust promised a return of ROTC to campus, once DADT was repealed, in a speech with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mike Mullen at the Kennedy School of Government on 17 November 2010. In December 2010 Congress passed a bill to repeal President Bill Clinton’s 1993 DADT Policy. On March 4, 2011, Harvard University President Drew Faust signed an agreement with Navy Secretary Ray Mabus formally recognizing the return of Naval ROTC to Harvard’s campus. According to the agreement's terms, a Director of Naval ROTC would be appointed, and Harvard would provide funding for the program. The Navy agreement was structured to go into effect when the repeal of DADT was implemented, and was followed by a similar agreement with the Army. [...] President Barack Obama, who in his 2011 State of the Union address called on all universities to open their doors to ROTC, responded through his spokesman by saying: [...] With our nation at war, this sends a powerful message that Americans stand united and that our colleges, society and armed forces are stronger when we honor the contributions of all our citizens, especially our troops and military families who sacrifice for our freedoms. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>said</b> in the State of the Union, it is time to move forward as one nation.

2500|$|On 24 November 2015, {{speaking}} {{shortly after}} the shootdown of a Russian Su-24 by Turkey, Russian president Vladimir Putin characterised {{the role played by}} Turkey in <b>the</b> Syrian conflict <b>as</b> that of [...] "the accomplices of terrorists." [...] Russia′s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov noted that the Turkish plan to create a buffer zone in the area where Syrian Turkmen lived in northern Syria stemmed from Ankara's wish to protect local terrorist infrastructure: [...] "According to the latest information, the area which our Turkish colleagues deem to be populated by Syrian Turkmen not only accommodates several hundreds, or thousands, of militants - citizens of <b>the</b> Russian Federation, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] <b>president</b> <b>said</b> yesterday, who present a direct threat to our security, security of our people but also, according to the available information, that area accommodates infrastructures of the militants, including arms and ammo depots, command centers, and logistics centers." [...] Several Turkish and Western analysts, while not questioning that ISIS oil was being imported into Turkey, argued that Moscow′s accusations of the Turkish government in this regard were not well-founded.|$|R

For nearly three decades, Iran and Sudan enjoyed a close relationship.Sudan decided to expel all Iranian (groups) just hours before joining a Saudi military operation in Yemen in March 2015 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Sudanese <b>President</b> is <b>said</b> to be calculating in favour of his fragile economy {{in addition to the}} trauma and horror struck the Sudanese society seeing its best and brightest joining ISIS this March, generating a huge public alarm about regional security.

6000|$|Why do we quote {{all these}} old monkish and neoplatonic legends? For some the {{evidence}} is obviously nil; to other anecdotes many witnesses bear testimony; but then, we know that an infectious schwarmerei can persuade people that the lion now removed from Northumberland House wagged his tail. The fact {{is that there is}} really matter for science in all these anecdotes, and the question to be asked is this--How does it happen that in ages and societies so distant and so various identical stories are current? What is the pressure that makes neoplatonic gossips of the fourth century circulate <b>the</b> same marvels <b>as</b> spiritualist gossips of the nineteenth? How does it happen that the mediaeval saint, the Indian medicine-man, the Siberian shaman (a suggestive term), have nearly identical wonders attributed to them? If people wanted merely to tell [...] "a good square lie," [...] <b>as</b> <b>the</b> American slang has it, invention {{does not seem to have}} such pitifully narrow boundaries. It appears to follow that there are contagious nervous illusions, about which science has not said the last word. We believe that the life of children, with its innocent mixture of dreams and waking, facts and fancies, could supply odd parallels to the stories we have been treated to. And as we are on the subject, we should like, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> late <b>President</b> Lincoln <b>said,</b> to tell a little story. It occurred to a learned divine to meet a pupil, who ought by rights to have been in the University of Oxford, walking in Regent Street. The youth glided past like a ghost, and was lost in the crowd; next day his puzzled preceptor received a note, dated on the previous day from Oxford, telling how the pupil had met the teacher by the Isis, and on inquiry had heard he was in London. Here is a case of levitation--of double levitation, and we leave it to be explained by the followers of Abaris and of Mr. Home.|$|R
