40|$|ABSTRACT: February 1999 will {{be known}} in Swiss natural {{disaster}} history for its record quantities of snow, for more than 1300 harmful avalanches, 17 deaths, cut-off valleys, blocked transport routes, and for total damage costs of over 600 million Swiss francs. Three intensive snow fall periods accompanied by stormy north-westerly winds brought over 5 m of new snow within one month to the northern side of the Swiss Alps. This amount of new snow in 30 days has a periodicity of approximately 80 - 100 years in the central {{northern part of the}} Swiss Alps and 40 - 50 years in the other parts of the Swiss Alps. A com-parable catastrophic avalanche I?eriod of similar size dates happened only in 1951, where 98 people were killed. The avalanche winter 1951 was the beginning of modern avalanche defense measures for the next five decades in terms of paravalanche constructions, avalanche hazard mapping, avalanche warning and silvicultural measures to maintain the protection forest. Considering the growth in public and private in-vestments in mountainous areas, the enormous increase in mobility of the people and the exponentially rising communication needs over the last fifty years, these large investments in <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> measures over the last 50 years have paid off. The paper presents an overview on the weather, snow and avalanche conditions, the direct and indirect damages caused by avalanches and discusses the ef-fectiveness of the integral <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> measures. Finally the necessary improvements for a fu-ture integral avalanche risk management are pointed out...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Snow {{avalanches}} {{are relatively}} dry and dense granular flows {{for which the}} Savage-Hutter (SH) equations have been demonstrated to be an adequate mathematical model. We review these equations and point out for which cases the equations have been tested against laboratory experiments. Since the equations are scale invariant and because agreement with experiments is good, laboratory experiments {{can be used to}} test realistic flows. This is detailed in this paper. We demonstrate how shocks are formed when dilatational flow states merge into compacting states and show that shock formation is an essential mechanism in flows against obstructions. We finally apply the theory of similitude to the design of a projected <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> structure of the Schneefernerhaus at the Zugspitze. ...|$|R

30|$|Health {{and safety}} {{considerations}} are always important {{during and after}} partial harvesting operations due to concerns about the stability of branches and retained trees (Schaetzl et al. 1989). The presence of dead branches or forked trunks leads to safety concerns, but can {{be taken into account}} when selecting residual trees. Past scarring, possibly during earlier harvest operations, can also provide indications of possible trunk rot and thus the likelihood of tree fall (Matlack et al. 1993). Training can also reduce workplace safety risks. For example, the injury rate dropped - rather than increased - when variable retention harvesting replaced clearcutting in coastal British Columbia, because of strong organizational focus on worker safety. In contrast, at a larger scale, forests with continuous cover are preferred because of their safety benefits for <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> (Bebi et al. 2009) and protection from landslides (Dhakal and Sidle 2003; Noguchi et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the instrumentation related to velocity and pressure measurements recently {{set up in}} the <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> system of Taconnaz.

The Taconnaz avalanche path (Chamonix, France) is characterized by remarkable dimensions. The passive protection system has been recently improved in the framework of an expertise conducted by Irstea (formerly Cemagref). The new defence structures, retarding mounds in particular, have been equipped with sensors in order to measure the local velocity in the vicinity of those obstacles as well as the impact pressure stemming from snow avalanches, in the framework of the Alcotra DYNAVAL Interreg project.

40|$|Questions on optimum {{protection}} measures {{have always been}} bound to economic considerations. This involves a comprehensive investigation {{and analysis of the}} effect of <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> measures with an appropriate concept of risk, including the avalanche danger area and use of the area. Technical and economic methods and analysis are applied in methodical procedures in order to arrive at an assessment model for <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> projects. From the technical point of view, the application of general risk analysis methodology and its adaptation to specific circumstances related to avalanche hazards are in the foreground. The quantitative risk magnitudes are supplemented by the aspects of risk awareness, in particular of risk acceptance and risk aversion. The avalanche risk of specific protection projects in the sense of an expected annual value of damage is calculated as part of the total potential damage. The result of this risk analysis is shown in a quantitative risk- diagram with the outset risk without safety measures, the remaining risk and the risk reduction. By comparing the annual costs for measures and the expected risk reduction, it is possible to make comparisons between measures with a short-term and long-term effect. The targeted project selection for this paper takes the expected variability of the efficiency into account {{in order to be able}} to de-fine the economical limits. It is also possible to deduce marginal costs which, in the past, were applied to prevent a statistical death occurrence. 1 METHODS OF QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 1. 1 Risk concept and avalanche risk A risk situation can be related to a single person (individual), to the danger area of an avalanche or to other limiting factors (collective, perimeter). The analysis of a risk situation (Kaplan/Garrick 1981) should provide ans-wers to three questions: What (kind of damage) can occur?(Scenario, S) How often will this damage occur?(Probability, P(s)) What is the extent of this damage?(Extent, As) In general, the risk of a scenario can be written (e. g. Starr 1969, Rowe 1977) as a risk value Rs given by the multi-plication of probability of damage P(s) and amount of damage As cased with the basic risk formula...|$|R

Structural panels comprised of honeycomb fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminations were evaluated under blast and fragmentation to examine their value as quickly maneuverable prefabricated structures. The structural panels were evaluated in three test configurations: first as wall panels subjected to blast only, second as overhead <b>protection</b> <b>roof</b> panels subjected to blast, and third as protective wall panels subjected to fragmentation from nearby detonation of a mortar. Four wall panels were tested in this study, each with a different thickness and inner core configuration, under blast loading. Another four wall panels were tested under fragmentation loading. Two panels of similar core configuration but different overall thicknesses were evaluated during the overhead <b>protection</b> <b>roof</b> panel experiment. Static resistance functions were developed using a combination of analytical and laboratory testing in order to obtain the panels response using a single-degree of freedom (SDOF) dynamic analysis. Engineering analytical models were able to predict the panels responses under live explosive blast testing. The roof panels provided a significant level of protection under blast loading, but the wall panels subjected to blast and fragmentation effects did not perform as desired. Additional evaluation and optimization of the roof panels is deemed necessary to fully determine their potential use for maneuverable prefabricated structures...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{wire rope}} nets have become common as <b>protection</b> measure against <b>avalanches</b> in Europe by {{preventing}} a release in the potential starting zone. A novel approach that has gained much ground through new {{research is to}} retard the movement of an avalanche {{after it has been}} initiated, that is in its path or run out zone. Such systems have the potential to be more cost efficient than traditional structures such as <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> dams, saving both time and space of installation. In Lech (Vorarlberg- Austria) a Snowcatcher prototype was installed and instrumented with several load measuring pins, which record the dynamic loads caused by an avalanche. 24 avalanche events in 4 years were detected. In addition to the field tests, scaled granular experi-ments were performed in the laboratory. These tests show that the Snowcatcher leads to a significant reduction of avalanche velocities. Subsequently the calculated Froude numbers decrease, indicating less destructive power of the avalanche. As well, the spreading of the avalanche in the deposition zone decreases downslope of the Snowcatcher. Key words: snow net, protection measure, granular experimen...|$|R
50|$|Blons, {{as other}} high Großer Walsertal communities, was {{primarily}} dependent on animal husbandry. The cows deprecated the mountain forests on Mont Calv, which serve as natural <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection.</b> As Eugenio {{says in the}} movie, there had been destructive avalanches there in the past (1497, 1689, 1717, 1806, 1808, and 1853). As depicted in the movie, winter was unusually mild {{until the end of}} 1953. But then snow came around New Years. In the morning of January eleventh, the first avalanche hit, followed in the evening by a second, burying and killing residents and destroying many buildings. Survivors struggled alone to find anyone buried in the snow but still alive, until the next day, when help came from neighboring St. Gerold. A total of fifty-six people perished in the town, while an additional thirty-one people died in nearby places, with a total of 125 in the Vorarlberg. In the movie, a helicopter is used to try to rescue Eugenio, as a nod to this catastrophe seeing the first use of such aircraft in European rescue operations. The assistance of French and American rescue personnel is also reflected in the movie.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} said that runout {{distance}} depends on altitude, aspect and angle, but theclimate is of great importance. The arctic dessert with drifting snow creates dense windpackedslabs over weaker layers of depth hoar. The long runout data has been collectedand analyzed into a calibrated α - β model. Calibration of the α - β-model has been conducted to get the best fit to the observed Svalbard avalanches. The runout distance depends also of the topography of the avalanche path, the inclination and size of the release area. Different avalanche runout models are used to calculate runout distance for possible release areas around Lunckefjell. The parameters used in the models are collected formfield investigations and snow pit investigations in the respective slopes. Evaluation of the runout distance and speed profile is important for hazard mapping and further design of <b>avalanche</b> <b>protections.</b> It is concluded from this study that the planned localization of mining infrastructure in the area around Marthabreen should be located differently than planned today.

40|$|Avalanches pose a {{significant}} problem in most mountain regions of Russia. The constant growth of economic activity, and therefore the increased avalanche hazard, in the North Caucasus region lead to demand {{for the development of}} large-scale avalanche risk assessment methods. Such methods are needed for the determination of appropriate <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> measures as well as for economic assessments. The requirement of natural hazard risk assessments is determined by the Federal Law of the Russian Federation (Federal Law 21. 12. 1994  N  68 -FZ, 2016). However, Russian guidelines (SNIP 11 - 02 - 96, 2013; SNIP 22 - 02 - 2003, 2012) are not clearly presented concerning avalanche risk assessment calculations. Thus, we discuss these problems by presenting a new avalanche risk assessment approach, with the example of developing but poorly researched ski resort areas. The suggested method includes the formulas to calculate collective and individual avalanche risk. The results of risk analysis are shown in quantitative data {{that can be used to}} determine levels of avalanche risk (appropriate, acceptable and inappropriate) and to suggest methods to decrease the individual risk to an acceptable level or better. The analysis makes it possible to compare risk quantitative data obtained from different regions, analyze them and evaluate the economic feasibility of protection measures...|$|R
