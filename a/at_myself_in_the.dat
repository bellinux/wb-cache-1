500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I be able to look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E

40|$|As {{an artist}} and musician, ‘place’ has always been entwined in my {{creative}} work and thinking. This arts-based autoethnography (Manovski, 2014), and music-based research (Leavy, 2015) draws deep connections between being an artist, researcher and educator <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> conceptual and physical local landscapes I move through. Situated in local places this research explores the dynamic overlaps (Yunkaporta, 2009) found across cultures, places, time and space. In response to this sense of place this thesis presents an intertextual artistic and scholarly celebration of this Wurundjeri landscape—this southern place—while critically gazing <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> relation to land, people, climates, skies, waterways, and animals as I co-create with, and in ‘the south’ (Connell, 2007 b).

6000|$|There may be tides in {{the affairs}} of men which taken at the flood... and so on. Personally I am still on the look out for that {{important}} turn. I am, however, afraid that most of us are fated to flounder for ever in the dead water of a pool whose shores are arid indeed.

I was to go up for my fellowship within a week, and was expected by my tutor and my college generally to distinguish myself. At last, wearied out, I flung my book down, and, going to the mantelpiece, took down a pipe and filled it. There was a candle burning on the mantelpiece, and a long, narrow glass {{at the back of}} it; and as I was in the act of lighting the pipe I caught sight of my own countenance in the glass, and paused to reflect.

60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} {{occurred}} an illness to a certain good and great man. I read in my daily paper that the whole nation was plunged in grief. People dining in public restaurants, on being told the news by the waiter, dropped their heads upon the table and sobbed. Strangers, meeting in the street, flung their arms about one another and cried like little children. I was abroad at the time, but {{on the point of}} returning home. I almost felt ashamed to go. I looked <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, and was shocked at my own appearance: it was that {{of a man who had}} not been in trouble for weeks. I felt that to burst upon this grief-stricken nation with a countenance such as mine would be to add to their sorrow. It was borne in upon me that I must have a shallow, egotistical nature. I had had luck with a play in America, and for the life of me I could not look grief- stricken. There were moments when, if I was not keeping a watch over myself, I found myself whistling.|$|E
