"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Sulfur is a central element in deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems, and many thermophiles isolated from these environments have sulfur-based metabolisms. However, it is not known what role organic sulfur compounds might play in deep-sea vent microbial ecology. Geochemical models are used to predict fluid compositions resulting from mixing of end-member hydrothermal fluids from the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) with bottom seawater. These fluid compositions combined with estimated activities of dimethylsulfide and methanethiol are used to evaluate the potential for organic sulfur-based metabolisms under hydrothermal conditions. The transition temperature at which aerobic <b>metabolisms</b> outcompete <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolisms</b> varies (from ~ 75 ˚C to > 200 ˚C) with end-member vent fluid chemistry. Aerobic respiration has the highest energy yields (> 575 kJ/mol C) at lower temperatures, while <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolisms</b> such as sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are favored at higher temperatures (~ 100 ˚C to 200 ˚C). Enrichment cultures targeting organic sulfur-based metabolisms inoculated with ELSC chimney slurries were successfully established. The cultures contained species of Thermococcales, ε-Proteobacteria, Thermales, and Aquificales as well as 2 novel bacterial sequences. These data suggest that organic sulfur-based metabolisms may be viable within deep-sea hydrothermal vents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Iron {{homeostasis}} of Shewanella oneidensis, a γ-proteobacterium possessing {{high iron}} content, is regulated by a global transcription factor Fur. However, knowledge is incomplete about other biological pathways that respond {{to changes in}} iron concentration, as well as details of the responses. In this work, we integrate physiological, transcriptomics and genetic approaches to delineate the iron response of S. oneidensis. Results We show that the iron response in S. oneidensis is a rapid process. Temporal gene expression profiles were examined for iron depletion and repletion, and a gene co-expression network was reconstructed. Modules of iron acquisition systems, <b>anaerobic</b> energy <b>metabolism</b> and protein degradation were the most noteworthy in the gene network. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that genes {{in each of the}} modules might be regulated by DNA-binding proteins Fur, CRP and RpoH, respectively. Closer inspection of these modules revealed a transcriptional regulator (SO 2426) involved in iron acquisition and ten transcriptional factors involved in <b>anaerobic</b> energy <b>metabolism.</b> Selected genes in the network were analyzed by genetic studies. Disruption of genes encoding a putative alcaligin biosynthesis protein (SO 3032) and a gene previously implicated in protein degradation (SO 2017) led to severe growth deficiency under iron depletion conditions. Disruption of a novel transcriptional factor (SO 1415) caused deficiency in both anaerobic iron reduction and growth with thiosulfate or TMAO as an electronic acceptor, suggesting that SO 1415 is required for specific branches of <b>anaerobic</b> energy <b>metabolism</b> pathways. Conclusion Using a reconstructed gene network, we identified major biological pathways that were differentially expressed during iron depletion and repletion. Genetic studies not only demonstrated the importance of iron acquisition and protein degradation for iron depletion, but also characterized a novel transcriptional factor (SO 1415) with a role in <b>anaerobic</b> energy <b>metabolism.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{conjugate}} base of oxalic acid is the hydrogenoxalate anion, and its {{conjugate base}} (oxalate) is a competitive inhibitor of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. LDH catalyses {{the conversion of}} pyruvate to lactic acid (end product of the fermentation (anaerobic) process) oxidising the coenzyme NADH to NAD+ and H+ concurrently. Restoring NAD+ levels {{is essential to the}} continuation of anaerobic energy metabolism through glycolysis. As cancer cells preferentially use <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism</b> (see Warburg effect) inhibition of LDH has been shown to inhibit tumor formation and growth, thus is an interesting potential course of cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|A fish’s hypoxia {{tolerance}} {{can also}} be represented {{as the amount of}} time it can spend at a particular hypoxic PO2 before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the PO2 at which it loses equilibrium when PO2 is decreased from normoxia to anoxia at some set rate (called PO2-of-LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower PO2-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced hypoxia tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall hypoxia tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to hypoxia tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism</b> and metabolic suppression.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, {{the result}} of a rapidly {{functioning}} neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms. Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism</b> in the muscle.|$|E

25|$|One {{physiological}} {{stimulus to}} epinephrine secretion is exercise. This was first demonstrated using the denervated pupil {{of a cat}} as an assay, later confirmed using a biological assay on urine samples. Biochemical methods for measuring catecholamines in plasma were published from 1950 onwards. Although much valuable work has been published using fluorimetric assays to measure total catecholamine concentrations, the method is too non-specific and insensitive to accurately determine the very small quantities of epinephrine in plasma. The development of extraction methods and enzyme-isotope derivate radio-enzymatic assays (REA) transformed the analysis down to a sensitivity of 1 pg for epinephrine. Early REA plasma assays indicated that epinephrine and total catecholamines rise late in exercise, mostly when <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism</b> commences.|$|E
25|$|Potassium cyanide is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of cellular respiration, acting on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, hence blocking oxidative phosphorylation. This prevents the body from oxidizing food to produce useful energy. Lactic acidosis then occurs {{as a consequence of}} <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Initially, acute cyanide poisoning causes a red or ruddy complexion in the victim because the tissues are not able to use the oxygen in the blood. The effects of potassium and sodium cyanide are identical, and symptoms of poisoning typically occur within a few minutes of ingesting the substance: the person loses consciousness, and brain death eventually follows. During this period the victim may suffer convulsions. Death is caused by cerebral hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, vigorously {{contracting}} skeletal muscles (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do {{not receive}} enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism,</b> converting glucose to lactate. The liver regenerates the glucose, using a process called gluconeogenesis. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three {{times the amount of}} energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the Cori cycle.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{evidence}} for early {{life and its}} initial evolution on Earth is linked intimately with the geological evolution of the early Earth. The environment of the early Earth would be considered extreme by modern standards: hot (50 – 80 °C), volcanically and hydrothermally active, anoxic, high UV flux, and a high flux of extraterrestrial impacts. Habitats for life were more limited until continent-building processes resulted {{in the formation of}} stable cratons with wide, shallow, continental platforms in the Mid-Late Archaean. Unfortunately there are no records of the first appearance of life and the earliest isotopic indications of the existence of organisms fractionating carbon in ∼ 3. 8 Ga rocks from the Isua greenstone belt in Greenland are tenuous. Well-preserved microfossils and microbial mats (in the form of tabular and domical stromatolites) occur in 3. 5 – 3. 3 Ga, Early Archaean, sedimentary formations from the Barberton (South Africa) and Pilbara (Australia) greenstone belts. They document life forms that show a relatively advanced level of evolution. Microfossil morphology includes filamentous, coccoid, rod and vibroid shapes. Colonial microorganisms formed biofilms and microbial mats at the surfaces of volcaniclastic and chemical sediments, some of which created (small) macroscopic microbialites such as stromatolites. Anoxygenic photosynthesis may already have developed. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotopes ratios are in the range of those for organisms with <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolisms,</b> such as methanogenesis, sulphate reduction and photosynthesis. Life was apparently distributed widely in shallow-water to littoral environments, including exposed, evaporitic basins and regions of hydrothermal activity. Biomass in the early Archaean was restricted owing to the limited amount of energy that could be produced by <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolisms.</b> Microfossils resembling oxygenic photosynthesisers, such as cyanobacteria, probably first occurred in the later part of the Mid Archaean (∼ 2. 9 Ga), concurrent with the tectonic development of suitable shallow shelf environments.

Metabolism may predate the origin of life, which may have evolved from the chemical conditions in the earliest oceans. Reconstructions in laboratories show {{that some of these}} reactions can produce RNA, and some others resemble two essential reaction cascades of metabolism: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, that provide essential precursors for nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids. A study at the University of Düsseldorf created phylogenic trees based upon 6 million genes from bacteria and archaea, and identified 355 protein families that were probably present in LUCA. They were based upon an <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism</b> fixing carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It suggests that LUCA evolved in an environment rich in hydrogen, carbon dioxide and iron.

25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} <b>anaerobic</b> <b>metabolism</b> within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E

40|$|Under {{anaerobic}} conditions, {{the rate}} of metabolism of lactate by starved resting cells of Veillonella dispar ATCC 17745 was very low. Because pyruvate was metabolized well by the starved cells, oxidation of lac-tate to pyruvate, {{which is the first}} step of the lactate metabolism, must have been limited in the cells. In the starved cells, the levels of the metabolic intermediates, oxalacetate orfumarate, ofwhich reductions to malate or to succinate could be coupled with lactate oxidation to pyruvate and initiate lactate metabolism, were quite low, suggesting that these had been reduced during the starvation steps under strictly anaerobic conditions. Thus, the starved cells were unable to start the <b>anaerobic</b> lactate <b>metabolism</b> because of shortage of such reducible substrates.

Fe-S clusters contain iron ions both in the ferrous and ferric states and sulfur atoms as sulfide ions. The three systems, nif, isc, and suf, use homologous enzymes for the production of sulfide ions of the Fe-S cluster. One of the main functions of Fe-S clusters in proteins is electron transport. A large number of proteins use Fe in Fe-S clusters as a Lewis acid to perform nonredox catalysis. Among them, one of the most extensively studied is mitochondrial aconitase, which uses a [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster to catalyze the conversion of citrate into isocitrate.
