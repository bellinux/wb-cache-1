5|$|An {{individual}} {{identified as}} Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by the annals {{may have been}} Ragnall's son, though no name is given. In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> was killed by Matudán, Overking of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the Annals of Ulster call him a king. The Annals of the Four Masters also suggests {{he and his fellow}} plunderers came from an island.|$|E
5|$|Ian Garrad, {{impatient}} to establish whether the conversion was feasible, commissioned racing driver and fabricator Ken Miles to build another prototype {{as quickly as}} he could. Miles was provided with a budget of $800, a Series II Alpine, a Ford V8 engine and a 2-speed automatic transmission, and in about <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> had a running V8 conversion, thus proving the concept.|$|E

5|$|Cameron began acting at age nine, and {{his first}} job was in an {{advertisement}} for a breakfast cereal. His first starring role was at age 13, in the television series Two Marriages. At this age, he appeared in several television shows and films. He became famous in 1985 after being cast as Mike Seaver in the ABC television sitcom Growing Pains. In the series, Mike would eventually have a girlfriend named Kate MacDonald, played by Chelsea Noble, Cameron's future wife. Cameron subsequently became a teen heartthrob in the late 1980s, while appearing {{on the covers of}} several teen magazines, including Tiger Beat, Teen Beat, 16 and others. At the time, he was making $50,000 <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> was also in a 60-second Pepsi commercial during Super Bowl XXIV.|$|E
5|$|Chandru keeps {{following}} Rekha; one {{day when}} she goes to visit her friend, he makes her unconscious and takes her away to a bungalow in Ooty. When she regains consciousness, he tells {{her that he had}} purchased this house in Ooty only for her, and again asks her to marry him. When Rekha refuses and begs to be freed, he asks her to stay for at least a month so that she can understand him better, and then reduces it to <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> makes all the arrangements to ensure that she cannot escape. Rekha later slams Chandru with a spade and runs away. However, he catches and imprisons her in the garage of his house, but is hospitalised for his injury.|$|E

5|$|Hart {{was made}} {{commander}} of the 2nd Infantry Brigade when the 4th Brigade was disbanded in February 1918. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while {{it was on the}} front line. His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, just two weeks after taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery barrage on his headquarters. The barrage, using a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas shells, also incapacitated most of his staff. Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Étaples. After recovering his sight, which took about <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>he</b> was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce.|$|E
5|$|He shot 70 films {{over the}} sixteen {{years of his}} career, working with such {{prominent}} directors as William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, Michael Curtiz, Archie Mayo, and William Dieterle. He {{was a member of}} the American Society of Cinematographers by 1921, and he was also one of the inaugural members of the International Photographers branch of I.A.T.S.E. (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees). In October 1932, at the height of his career, he suddenly fell ill after wrapping a film. Hospitalized, his condition quickly worsened and within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> was dead of an infection to the brain.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Bean left Brook Comprehensive School with O Levels in Art and English. After {{a job at}} a {{supermarket}} and another for the local council, he started working for his father's firm with a day release at Rotherham College of Arts and Technology to take a welding course. While there, he stumbled into an art class and decided to pursue his interest in art. After attending courses at two other colleges, one for half a day and the other for less than <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>he</b> returned to Rotherham College, where he subsequently enrolled in a drama course. After some college plays and one at Rotherham Civic Theatre, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), starting a seven-term course in January 1981.|$|E

5|$|In July 1912, Barrymore went to Los Angeles, {{where he}} {{appeared}} in three short-running plays at the Belasco Theatre. He returned to New York in October, where he took the lead role in 72 performances of the comedy The Affairs of Anatol at the Little Theatre. Although the critical response was lukewarm, Barrymore's salary for the play was $600 <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> began the following year by appearing in a short run of A Thief for a Night in McVicker's Theatre, Chicago, before returning to New York, and the Thirty-Ninth St. Theatre, for a two-month run in Believe Me Xantippe.|$|E
5|$|In June 1933 Massey {{became an}} {{independent}} lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast. He {{was the only}} member of the department until R. A. Buckingham arrived in 1934. Despite having to give nine lectures <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>he</b> found time to write his second book, Negative Ions (1938), and began working on upper atmospheric physics. Frustrated with the tiresome and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50. This was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium, and the photo-ionisation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

However, three days later, he conceded all six goals in a 6–0 defeat at home to Southampton; he allowed Adam Lallana's 20-yard shot underneath his body for the second goal, and he was rounded by Lee Barnard for the sixth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not cut back on her performance schedule; he felt she was too busy, {{to the point of}} forgetting their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{signed for}} Rangers in July 1995, for a club record fee of £4.3million, on wages of £15,000 <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> made an {{immediate}} impact; {{in the fifth}} league {{game of the season}} in the Old Firm match at Celtic Park he scored a goal after running almost the full length of the pitch. On 30 December, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne was booked by referee Dougie Smith after he picked Smith's yellow card up from the ground and jokingly 'booked' the referee. Rangers {{went on to win the}} league in the 1995–96 season, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen at Ibrox Stadium; Gascoigne scored a hat-trick during the game. Rangers won the double as they also won the Scottish Cup by knocking out Keith, Clyde, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Celtic, before beating Heart of Midlothian 5–1 in the final at Hampden Park. He scored 19 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions, and was named as both PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year and SFWA Footballer of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. Gumball debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work. The game did not become popular and its copies became rare.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Stojanović was {{contracted}} to the Prijedor {{branch of the}} state railway company to provide healthcare for its employees. In 1936, he was {{contracted to}} an iron ore mining company in Ljubija, a town near Prijedor, and would visit the mining company clinic twice <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> also taught hygiene at the gymnasium in Prijedor. Together with other intellectuals from the town, he gave lectures to the miners at their club in Ljubija. His lectures were usually about medical issues, but he also described {{the economic and social}} position of workers in more advanced countries. He socialised with the miners and treated their family members for free. He was very active socially, and also participated in sports. In 1932, he founded the tennis club of Prijedor, which continues to bear his name. Stojanović once bought new kit for all members of the Rudar Ljubija football club. His contracts with the railway company and the mining company were both terminated in 1939. The railway employees protested in Prijedor, and Stojanović's contract with that company was subsequently renewed.|$|E
5|$|McCann {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 24 August 1914 at Morphettville, South Australia. He was allotted to the South Australian-raised 10th Battalion, part of the 3rd Brigade, as a private with the regimental number 405. Within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> had been {{promoted}} to sergeant. The battalion embarked for overseas in October, and sailed via Albany, Western Australia, to Egypt, arriving in early December. While the force was training in Egypt he was appointed as a platoon sergeant in the battalion's D Company. After completing training, the 3rd Brigade was designated as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915, {{and so was the}} first brigade ashore about 4:30 am. Four days later McCann was appointed as company sergeant major. During that period, the 10th Battalion suffered casualties of 13 officers and 453 men. On 19 May the battalion helped fight off a concerted Turkish counter-attack against the landing force, after which it settled into a routine of rotating through various positions in the line. Due to his outstanding service during the period 6 May to 28 June McCann was mentioned several times in Australian and New Zealand Army Corps routine orders. In July, McCann and most of the battalion had a three day rest on the island of Imbros, but were quickly back in the trenches at Anzac. McCann was commissioned in the rank of second lieutenant on 4 August, by which time nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 November. McCann remained at Anzac, serving as battalion intelligence and signalling officer, until the unit was withdrawn to the island of Lemnos in late November, followed by evacuation to Egypt the following month.|$|E
