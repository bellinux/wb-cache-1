40|$|Colletotrichum {{species are}} {{well-known}} causal agent <b>of</b> <b>anthracnose.</b> A {{study was conducted}} to determine the identity of Colletotrichum associated with <b>anthracnose</b> <b>of</b> mango (Mangifera indica) fruits. Thirty five Colletotrichum isolates were isolated from <b>anthracnose</b> lesion <b>of</b> two mango cultivars, Chokanan and Harum Manis. Based on the conidial morphology, two morphotypes (I and II) of C. gleosporioides were identified. Based on BLAST search of ITS regions and β-tubulin sequences, majority of the isolates showed 99 - 100 % similarity with Colletotrichum sp. from mango and other hosts and three isolates, 100 % similarity with C. asianum. From phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood method of combined datasets, the isolates from mango formed three clades, which corresponded to C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. asianum. Therefore, the present study showed that the isolates associated with <b>anthracnose</b> <b>of</b> mango belong to C. gleosporioides sensu lato and C. asianum...|$|R
50|$|Colletotrichum Cereale is a {{plant disease}} (fungus) {{that has been}} found to cause crown rot <b>anthracnose</b> <b>of</b> turf grass most {{commonly}} occurring on golf courses (NC State 2012). Anthracnose can occur as both a foliar blight and basal rot (Penn State 2010). This disease attacks the crowns of plants, which is different than other <b>anthracnose</b> diseases. <b>Anthracnose</b> <b>of</b> turfgrass can be a foliar disease or in this case a basal rot of the lower portion of the plant. It attacks different species of turfgrass throughout the world most commonly annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass (Crouch, Clarke 2012).|$|R
