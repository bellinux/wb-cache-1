Yet little is known about how individual <b>tourists</b> <b>experience</b> the weather and how it affects the subjective perception of their holidays. The weather appears to have a prominent place in language and the use of the weather in narratives of tourists can provide insight into how the weather <b>affects</b> <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences.</b> Based on a qualitative analysis of online travel blogs written by Dutch tourists, 16 weather themes could be distinguished, representing how the weather was narrated about by tourists. Moreover, different impact themes emerged describing how the weather impacted the tourists: tourists revealed positive, negative or neutral evaluations about the weather impacts. The findings of this study can be used for future research on tourist behaviour and how specific weather types and impacts influence the decision making of tourists in terms of itineraries and activities...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} the way {{by which the}} anthropology of the senses and perceptions <b>affects</b> <b>tourist’s</b> <b>experience.</b> By utilizing the concept of authenticity {{and the way it}} is outlined by its existential value (Wang 1999), or as process of authentication (Van de Port 2004; Cohen & Cohen 2012), my aim is to show how it is negotiated and mediated with, amongst other, through the senses. In the specific field of tourism, although anthropology nowadays strives to regain more room to analyse the other senses, the one most linked to the <b>tourist’s</b> <b>experience</b> is sight. It is considered in this context as a set of gazes that the tourist imposes or is subjected to in his relationship with the Other, employing the camera as a medium that, as Sontag and Barthes affirm, is a weapon by which the gaze is limited, oriented and negotiated...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire for}} {{authenticity}} {{has been recognized}} {{to be one of}} the main factors <b>affecting</b> <b>tourist</b> behavior and <b>experience.</b> It is not, however, the only variable. Circulation and access, topics that belong to the hereto-limited genre of sociology known as “mobilities,” also <b>affect</b> how <b>tourists</b> behave and <b>experience</b> a <b>tourist</b> environment. Indeed, the circulation of tourists and access to tourist sites, which are influenced by the built environment, the limitations of physical infrastructure, and tourist resources, impact how <b>tourists</b> interact and <b>experience</b> space, and thereby fundamentally affect their behavior and experience. Through critical reexamination of secondary literature, assessment of primary sources such as guidebooks, tourist websites, and city maps, and site analysis, I compare the tourist environment that constitutes Berlin’s central district, Mitte, with two sites in Berlin’s periphery, the Soviet War Memorial and Cemetery in Treptower Park and the former Stasi prison memorial in Hohenschönhausen, through the perspective of accessibility and circulation. This includes a visual analysis of the movement from the center into the periphery to more fully understand how circulation and access affect the experience of these sites and, more broadly, the tourist environment of the periphery. This exploration of the two distinct tourist environments present in Berlin, that of the central tourist enclave and that of the city’s periphery, reveals advantages and disadvantages that traditional tourist studies would not and demonstrates the significance of studying how tourists circulate, access, and ultimately interact with tourist sites and the built environment to developing our understanding of <b>tourist</b> <b>experience...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the age of}} {{experience}} economy, high quality <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> is what <b>tourists</b> are seeking for. <b>Tourist</b> <b>experience</b> management gradually becomes an important content and a new focus in tourism management.

This paper explores one aspect of this exchange, the idea of time in travel, and finds that the volunteer <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> is particularly influenced by cultural time differences.

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{creating}} unique and memorable experiences for consumers has become of primary importance for tourism research and practice. The way contemporary <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> are created has however undergone a fundamental change. Experiences are transforming as consumers are increasingly empowered to co-create their own experiences. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have represented a catalyst {{of change that}} has opened unprecedented possibilities for <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> creation and enhancement. While the literature has recognised these paradigm shifts within the service-dominant logic and the services marketing and management discipline, a holistic understanding of this phenomenon is still missing to date. This doctoral study therefore aims to explore how the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> can be enhanced by ICTs through company-consumer experience co-creation, throughout all stages of the travel process, i. e. pre/during/post travel. This thesis integrates the three theoretical streams of <b>tourist</b> <b>experience,</b> co-creation and ICTs to explore, conceptualise and develop the Technology Enhanced <b>Tourist</b> <b>Experience</b> concept. A comprehensive qualitative mixed methods strategy comprising three main research phases was adopted, consisting of a) a qualitative content analysis, b) a multiple case study and c) semi-structured consumer in-depth interviews to triangulate the findings and allow for a holistic knowledge development. The most significant findings contribute to knowledge by offering a) a comprehensive understanding of the granular elements of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience,</b> b) both a company and consumer actor perspective on experience co-creation, c) a detailed enhancement process of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> through ICTs and d) a holistic model depicting the twelve distinct factors of the Technology Enhanced <b>Tourist</b> <b>Experience.</b> This study makes an original contribution to the services marketing and management discipline on a wider level and the three theoretical streams in specific. This thesis is significant and original {{in that it is}} the first study to explore the Technology Enhanced <b>Tourist</b> <b>Experience</b> and to create a theoretical foundation of this concept. The strength of this work thus lies in developing several conceptualisations and models that advance the service-dominant logic and provide critical strategic implications for services marketing and management practice.

The study seeks to investigate a possible gap in academic research. Although the links between air travel and the tourism industry are discussed in academic research, {{the potential impact of}} flying on the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> is not analysed in detail, either regarding budget travel or full service carriers.

This fieldwork is linked with theories and interpretations outlined in academic literature and research. Although this does not directly investigate our set question, useful insight is still provided regarding a number of different aspects on budget air travel, including relevant business models, pricing strategies and market segmentation. The study will also investigate the concept of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience,</b> including how it is defined within the industry, what factors make up this concept and how they are influenced.

40|$|Given the {{scarcity}} of research ascertaining the relationship between tourists' foodservice experiences and holiday satisfaction {{and its implications for}} destinations, this study primarily set out to provide guidelines on ways in which tourists' foodservice experiences and holiday satisfaction can be assessed and enhanced. The present study consisted of three interdependent phases, and questionnaire-based surveys were employed to test the research hypotheses. A combination of different qualitative techniques was utilised in order to shortlist the relevant attributes to be included in each research instrument. These instruments were then subjected to further tests in order to ensure their adequacy and appropriateness. The first research phase ascertained the relative validity and reliability of the existing satisfaction measurement frameworks and was implemented in a chain restaurant in Sheffield. This phase aimed to identify the most reliable and valid operational framework to be utilised in the subsequent phases of the research. The second phase explored tourist satisfaction dimensions and ascertained the relative contribution of each dimension, particularly that of the foodservice experience, to holiday satisfaction and future behavioural intentions among visitors to South West Turkey. The final phase specifically examined what matters most in tourists' foodservice evaluations, and explored whether different dining segments developed their satisfaction and behavioural intention judgements based on different service attributes in non-fast-food restaurants situated in South West Turkey. The results of the first phase indicated that a more direct measure of perceived performance might be a better predictor of customer satisfaction than more complex composite measures of disconfirmation of expectations. The perceived-performance only model, out-performed the disparity models, which involved a comparison between a predetermined standard and the perceived performance (the Expectancy Disconfirmation Paradigm), and the multiplication models, where performance was weighted by the attribute importance, in predicting customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions. The results of the second phase revealed that tourist satisfaction was multidimensional. Among the identified holiday components, tourists' impressions of foodservice experiences were found to be an important factor in tourists' holiday satisfaction and behavioural intention judgements. While positive tourists' impressions of foodservice experiences were found to enhance holiday satisfaction, the negative impressions were found to have potential to override well-executed quality in other areas. The results of the final phase demonstrated that there were numerous factors <b>affecting</b> <b>tourist</b> foodservice <b>experiences</b> and that {{the manner in which the}} restaurant product is delivered was found to account for the greatest impact on tourist dining satisfaction and return intentions. Analysing the benefits sought from non-fast food resort restaurants by tourists, the research identified five distinct dining segments, including: the Value-Seekers, the Service-Seekers, the Adventurous Food-Seekers, the Healthy Food- Seekers, and the Atmosphere-Seekers. These segments were found to develop their satisfaction and return intention judgements based on different restaurant attributes. Overall, the study findings provided strong support for the research hypotheses and showed that <b>tourist</b> foodservice <b>experiences</b> may lay the foundation for, and shape the nature of <b>tourist</b> holiday <b>experience.</b> Marketing and management implications of the study findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are provided. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> offer {{anomalous}} {{and complex}} interactions between tourists and tourism places. The study {{of these experiences}} {{is the focus of}} this doctoral dissertation, which aims to explore subjective aspects of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience.</b> This exploration involves the conceptualisation of <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> {{and the development of a}} multi-phased research design that captures the perceptions of momentary in situ experiences and examines how these perceptions change over time. The dissertation addresses under studied areas in tourism and answers calls for research into immediate conscious <b>experiences</b> and <b>tourist</b> centred methodology. This investigation into <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> involves 21 participants who took an educational trip to Peru, capturing experiential data using both in situ research methods and recollection methods. The findings and discussion focus on three areas: The mechanics of the primary research method, the experience of a World Heritage Site, and mobile <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> along the Inca Trail. The first empirical study investigates the use of the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) in capturing momentary data on <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences.</b> This doctoral research involves the adaptation of ESM to be both a predominantly qualitative method and a mobile digital method on smartphones. The analysis of the operational aspects of ESM looks specifically at issues of participant burden, reactivity, and the use of smartphones as a research tool. Findings reveal complicated relationships between the research process and the data collected. In sampling participants throughout the trip, there is limited evidence of participant burden. There is also evidence of reactivity in momentary data, but this is argued to be beneficial in capturing subjective perceptions due to improved self-awareness in participants. The use of smartphones in data collection presents challenges and opportunities in ESM design. Evidence that participants humanize this data collection tool emerges from the momentary data and is discussed. The second empirical study examines the experience of the World Heritage Site of Machu Picchu, addressing gaps in research on <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> at protected sites of global significance. The data reveal that, though this site is protected for its cultural, architectural, and natural significance, social relationships emerge as a strong memorable element of the site visit. Analysis of the photographic data, capturing visual in situ experiences, demonstrates a relationship between the number of photographs taken and memories of the site. The momentary and memorable experiences of Machu Picchu are found to be influenced by the method of site arrival, where those who arrive via the Inca Trail show a more intimate connection with the World Heritage Site. Stemming from the findings related to site arrival, the final empirical study examines the experience of hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu within the context of mobility and mobile practices in tourism. In the momentary and memorable data on the hiking experience, what emerges is an emphasis on self-identity and the encounter of corporeal self through pain and physical struggle. This is prominent in momentary perceptions and short term memory but fades in the long term memory data, where the destination of the hike is emphasized. The importance of pain within this mobile hiking experience is highlighted. Overall, this doctoral thesis advances knowledge on the complexities involved in subjective <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> through the examination of educational tourists in Peru. The major contributions of this thesis to the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> knowledge base are in the capture and examination of momentary in situ experiences. The design and adaptation of ESM advances theory on experience sampling procedures and addresses issues of mobility in tourism research designs. The multi-phased research approach to data collection captures detailed and dynamic meanings in the moment, which become more generalized over time. This research highlights the challenges and importance in capturing momentary data to better understand holistic <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> and provides future research recommendations related to <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> theory and methodology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract As the {{environmental}} consequences of urbanization {{and climate change}} become apparent in coastal communities, it has become important to understand how residents of these communities experience and approach their changing environments. This becomes especially significant in places where nature-based livelihoods constitute {{a major part of}} the economy. This thesis focuses on the city of Tarpon Springs, located along the Gulf of Mexico in Florida, where sea sponge fishing is an important contributor to the local economy while also being central to place-based tourist and ethnic identities. It seeks to understand how environmental changes in the sea sponge economy will affect the coastal economy of Tarpon Springs. Based on interviews conducted with people closely connected with the sponge fishing economy, including sponge fishers and shops selling sponges, the thesis delves into (i) local perspectives on changing environmental conditions, (ii) how such changes will impact the future of sponge fishing and (iii) the extent to which local governmental support has been sought by sponge fishers and shops. Sponge fishing in Tarpon Springs is connected to its Greek identity so changes in the sponge economy could potentially <b>affect</b> whether <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> which highlight Greek identity linked to sponge fishing continue to be connected to an actual Greek economic presence or reflect nostalgia for a Greek past. The interview responses showed concerns about declining sponge hauls which were connected to more immediate experiences of environmental change and pollution, including red tide events and phosphate runoff. Respondents also reflected on how climate change will exacerbate such environmental issues through rising water temperatures. Respondents viewed Tarpon Springs as a community with a strong Greek identity and sponge shop owners especially seemed to be dependent on links with an active sponge fishing economy to enhance the value of their sponges for tourists. In terms of government support, those involved in the sponge economy had very little interaction with city officials and did not seem keen to enhance such interactions. This thesis thus reveals that the economy of Tarpon Springs continues to be shaped by sponge fishing livelihoods that are directly dependent on nature. However, it seems that concerns related to environmental change remain within the local community and are not being voiced through more public forums, such as through active engagement with local government. The future of Tarpon Springs and its sponge fishing economy therefore remains uncertain, even as local participants in the sponge economy continue to work towards maintaining their unique identity...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{experience}} economy the unique experiential value of cultural heritage products comes to the forefront of cultural tourism development and is the main value proposition for emerging destinations, including South Africa. As South Africa’s democracy divedends had paid out by 1998, South African Tourism was left with an array of dormant cultural heritage resources (still) unable to turn them into meaningful <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences.</b> The reason is lack of understanding of <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> as opposed to tourist consumption. Consumer segmentation and marketing mantra of telling and selling simply does not work on <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> arising from consumption of cultural heritage products. Two propositions underline this type of experience: attractions cannot speak for themselves and we tell the story to sell the experience. The art of telling the story converges on both sides of experiential paradigm (tourist and attraction) thus telling is selling principle is a point of sale for cultural heritage products. Unpacking this principle in creating unique experiential value of cultural heritage products is the main theoretical contribution of this paper to South African cultural tourism discourse.

The importance of stories as a core element in human cognition and social interaction has long been recognised by psychologists (Schank & Abelson, 1977), sociologists (Durkheim et al., 1995) and anthropologists (Holloway, 1997). In tourism research, however, much of the existing focus has been on narratives in general with only a few researchers explicitly analysing tourist stories (Hsu et al., 2009). This chapter argues that stories and themes are critical elements in understanding <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences</b> and that we need to develop integrative conceptual frameworks in order to better understand the nature of <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences.</b> The overall aim of the chapter is to integrate concepts and issues from research into both the role of stories and themes in tourism and factors contributing to positive tourist evaluations, in order to improve our understanding of <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences.</b> The chapter will follow an approach suggested by Fournier (1998) for understanding brand relationships in marketing and Gorke (2001) for analysing entertainment as public communication. After defining key terms, this chapter will identify major themes and concepts in existing research into stories and themes in tourism and major findings from, and theoretical approaches to, research,into <b>tourist</b> <b>experiences.</b> The chapter will then highlight the convergence between these two areas before suggesting how stories and themes might fit within a systems model of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience.</b> This systems model will then be used to highlight areas for further research as well as suggesting some practical implications...|$|R

The study results will also help explain the contradicting findings in existing studies about negative emotions...|$|R

The title of this series can be interpreted as the location where the artist works, {{the subject matter of the}} paintings, the medium used or the objects themselves. I will discuss how these works have evolved from paintings that focus on the process of producing them, to more content-rich paintings that take a postmodern look at the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience,</b> then move on to the final series that inexorably links process and content to a special subset of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to offer an {{analysis}} of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> through a focus on &# 039;epiphany&# 039;, which is conceptualized as an interactional moment that creates change and transformation in self-identity. We suggest that an epiphany in tourism can be understood by analysing its links with the philosophical concepts of existential authenticity, the Other and the unknown. In the experience of the unknown, the traveller becomes more conscious of authentic modes of existence. This analysis explores the theoretical boundaries of the <b>tourist</b> <b>experience</b> by focusing on the construction of self-identity and subjectivity through the process of travel...|$|R
