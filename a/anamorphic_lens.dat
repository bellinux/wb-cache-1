5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> on the printer, the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E
5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens,</b> which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|E
5|$|Jailhouse Rock was Presley's third {{film and}} his first for MGM. It was filmed at the MGM studios in Culver City, California. Filmed in black-and-white, the film was the first {{production}} that MGM filmed with the recently developed 35mm <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> by Panavision. The film was originally titled The Hard Way, which was changed to Jailhouse Kid before MGM finally settled on Jailhouse Rock. It was not listed with the studio's planned releases for the year, which it published in Variety magazine, because {{it was based on}} an original story by Nedrick Young, a blacklisted writer. In addition, the studio traditionally did not produce any original scripts that were not adaptations of already-successful works such as books or theater plays. During the production of the movie, Pandro Berman's attention was centered on another of his productions, the 1958 film The Brothers Karamazov. He let the head of the studio, Benny Thau, and Abe Lastfogel, president of the William Morris Agency, decide the cast. Richard Thorpe, who had the reputation of quickly finishing his projects, was chosen to direct the film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anamorphic</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are used}} principally in {{cinematography}} to produce wide-screen films where the projected image has a substantially different ratio of height to width than the image recorded {{on the film}} plane. This is achieved {{by the use of}} a specialised lens design which compresses the image laterally at the recording stage and the film is then projected through a similar lens in the cinema to recreate the wide-screen effect. Although in some cases the anamorphic effect is achieved by using an anamorphising attachment as a supplementary element on the front of a normal lens, most films shot in anamorphic formats use specially designed <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lenses,</b> such as the Hawk lenses made by Vantage Film or Panavision's <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lenses.</b> These lenses incorporate one or more aspheric elements in their design.|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E
25|$|Under Natan's leadership, the {{anamorphic}} film camera lens was developed. The <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> {{was not only}} a major advance in film technology, but helped Hollywood survive {{during the early years of}} television.|$|E
25|$|Natan also {{invested}} heavily into {{research and development}} to expand Pathe's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into sound film. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, Pathé-Revue and Actualités Féminines, to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of Henri Chrétien, who developed the <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> (a technology which later {{led to the creation}} of CinemaScope and other widescreen film formats common today).|$|E

50|$|The {{proposal}} {{also points}} out that the 2.00:1 aspect ratio can be achieved using standard spherical lenses, forgoing the need for <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lenses,</b> which are more expensive, slower (require more light) with less photographic depth of field than their spherical counterparts (which are higher quality, smaller, faster (require less light), with fewer aberrations (imperfections) associated with them.

500|$|Gottschalk {{learned from}} one of his vendors that Bausch & Lomb, whom Fox had {{contracted}} to manufacture CinemaScope lenses, was having difficulty filling the lens orders for theatrical anamorphic projection equipment. He teamed up with William Mann, who provided optical manufacturing capability, and Walter Wallin, an optical physicist who was an acquaintance of Mann's. The <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> design they selected was prismatic rather than the cylindrical design of the Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lens. This design meant the <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> extension factor—how much the image is horizontally unsqueezed—could be manually shifted, useful for projectionists switching between nonanamorphic ("flat" [...] or [...] "spherical") trailers and an anamorphic feature. The result was the anamorphosing system, designed by Wallin, used in the Panatar lens; the patent for the system was filed on August 11, 1954, and awarded five years later.|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer John McPherson also {{supervised}} the underwater unit, which was headed by Pete Romano. Whereas underwater photography was normally filmed with an <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens,</b> requiring overhead lighting, Romano filmed these [...] "sequences with Zeiss, a 35 mm super-speed lens, {{which allows the}} natural ambiance to come through on film." [...] Additional underwater photography was completed in a water tank, measuring [...] by [...] across, and [...] in depth, [...] in Universal Studio's Stage 27. Also, a replica of Nassau's Clifton Bay and its skyline was created on the man-made Falls Lake on the studio backlot.|$|E
500|$|Singer and Sigel {{credited}} Road to Perdition as {{a visual}} influence. Though Sigel shot the first X-Men in anamorphic format, he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, [...] "If you think about it, every <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it. They'll never {{be as good as}} the spherical lenses that they emulate." [...] Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL, as well as an Aaton 35mm. Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films, while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments.|$|E

500|$|The early scene {{involving}} Bond and Jaws {{in which}} Bond is {{pushed out of}} the aircraft without a parachute took weeks of planning and preparation. The skydiving sequence was coordinated by Don Calvedt {{under the supervision of}} second unit director John Glen. As Calvedt and skydiving champion B.J. Worth developed the equipment for the scene, which included a [...] parachute pack that could be concealed beneath the suit to give the impression of the missing parachute, and equipment to prevent the freefalling cameraman from suffering whiplash while opening his parachute, they brought in stuntman Jake Lombard to test it all. Lombard eventually played Bond in the scene, with Worth as the pilot from which Bond takes a parachute, and Ron Luginbill as Jaws. Both Lombard and Worth would become regular members of the stunt team for aerial sequences in later Bond films. When the stuntmen opened their parachutes {{at the end of every}} shoot, custom-sewn velcro costume seams would separate to allow the hidden parachutes to open. The skydiver cinematographer used a lightweight Panavision experimental plastic <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens,</b> bought from an old pawn shop in Paris, which he had adapted, and attached to his helmet to shoot the entire sequence. The scene took a total of 88 skydives by the stuntmen to be completed. The only scenes shot in studio were close-ups of Roger Moore and Richard Kiel.|$|E
500|$|Robert Gottschalk founded Panavision in late 1953, in {{partnership}} with Richard Moore, Meredith Nicholson, Harry Eller, Walter Wallin, and William Mann; the company was formally incorporated in 1954. Panavision was established principally for the manufacture of anamorphic projection lenses to meet the growing demands of theaters showing CinemaScope films. At the time of Panavision's formation, Gottschalk owned a camera shop in Westwood Village, California, where many of his customers were cinematographers. [...] A few years earlier, he and Moore—who worked {{with him in the}} camera shop—were experimenting with underwater photography; Gottschalk became interested in the technology of anamorphic lenses, which allowed him to get a wider field of view from his underwater camera housing. The technology was created during World War I to increase the field of view on tank periscopes; the periscope image was horizontally [...] "squeezed" [...] by the <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens.</b> After it was unsqueezed by a complementary anamorphic optical element, the tank operator could see double the horizontal field of view without significant distortion. Gottschalk and Moore bought some of these lenses from C. P. Goerz, a New York optics company, for use in their underwater photography. As widescreen filmmaking became popular, Gottschalk saw an opportunity to provide anamorphic lenses to the film industry—first for projectors, and then for cameras. Nicholson, a friend of Moore, started working as a cameraman on early tests of anamorphic photography.|$|E
500|$|Since 1954, Panavision {{had been}} working on a new {{widescreen}} process commissioned by MGM. The resulting system used a 65mm film camera in conjunction with the APO Panatar lens, which was an integrated <b>anamorphic</b> <b>lens</b> (as opposed to a standard prime lens with an anamorphoser mounted on it). This created a 1.25x anamorphic squeeze factor. Movies using the process had an astounding potential aspect ratio of 2.76:1 when exhibited with 70mm anamorphic projection prints. Introduced as MGM Camera 65, the system was used on just a few films, the first of which was Raintree County (1956). However, the film was released only in 35mm anamorphic prints because the circuit of 70mm theaters was booked with Around the World in Eighty Days (1956), shot with the competing, nonanamorphic Todd-AO system. [...] In January 1959, the posters for the 70mm release of Disney's Sleeping Beauty carried the notation [...] "Process lenses by Panavision" [...] next to the Super Technirama 70 logo. [...] The first film to be presented in 70mm anamorphic—Ben-Hur—was released by MGM in 1959 under the trade name MGM Camera 65. Panavision also developed a nonanamorphic widescreen process called Super Panavision 70, which was essentially identical to Todd-AO. Super Panavision made its screen debut in 1959 with The Big Fisherman, released by Disney's Buena Vista division.|$|E

It was unveiled on YouTube on November 20, 2014, {{three weeks after the}} physical single's release date, and a week after the music video for [...] "Hasu no Hana". This was because the band were not able to complete either video in time for the single's physical release. The band enlisted Tanaka for the video, as he had only worked on catchy, comical songs with the band previously. They believed that having him work on a serious song would create an interesting video. The video was primarily shot on a simple sound-stage consisting of two walls and filled with household items, though additional outdoor scenes were shot on {{the street in front of}} a building in the Saga area of Koto, Tokyo, owned by the yūgen gaisha Kosuga.
