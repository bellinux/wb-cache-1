Changing demographic patterns, however, mirror those {{in the general population}} with increased longevity leading to higher numbers of people developing cancer in the future. Little is known about the service and support needs of this group, but there is a precedent to understand their experiences to inform research and service development if appropriately tailored approaches are to be adopted. This article outlines a project that sought to develop <b>an</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>forum</b> of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by cancer, to inform the development of a research agenda. The process of this work is described alongside a critical appraisal of the tensions in involving people with intellectual disabilities as advisors on cancer research and practice.

40|$|Pharmaco{{economics}} is {{a branch}} of health economics related to the most economical and efficient use of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacoeconomic research identifies, measures and compares the costs and outcomes (clinical, economic and humanistic) of pharmaceutical products and services. Pharmacoeconomic evaluation can {{play a significant role}} in the efficient allocation of resources in healthcare systems with constrained budgets. Countries are trying to control the rising costs of health care in their aging population. They are all asking the same question: Is the new drug good value for money; and if so, what is the society willing to pay for it? This article reviews the importance of, and the need for, adaptation of pharmacoeconomic analysis to the conditions in Saudi Arabia. It will shed some light on the important steps for converting the concept into practice, including the need for identifying the willing-to-pay (WTP) or the threshold cutoff, the existence of a real cost for each utility, the nonexistence of <b>an</b> pharmacoeconomic <b>advisory</b> <b>forum,</b> pharmaceutical budget allocation, and the impact of pharmaceutical marketing. It will also provide recommendations for easing any challenges that might jeopardize the conduct of such analysis in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
