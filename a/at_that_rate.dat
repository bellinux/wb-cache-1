In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>rate</b> of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Henry Newbolt, the {{official}} historian, wrote {{that before the}} raid two submarines entered or left the Flanders bases each day and continued <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>rate</b> during the week after the raid. The block ships were in the wrong position when sunk and only managed to obstruct the canal for a few days. The Germans removed two piers in the western bank of the canal near the block ships and dredged a channel through the silt near the sterns of the block ships. The Germans were then able to move submarines along the channel past the block ships at high tide. The average was maintained until June, when the rate fell to about one submarine per day, to an extent due to a bombardment of Zeebrugge on 9 June. After the damage was repaired, the rate of U-boat traffic {{did not return to}} the pre-raid level. Newbolt considered that this was caused by the recall of some U-boats to Germany in June, after reports that operations in the Dover Straits had become too dangerous. The usual remedy of increased destroyer raids was not possible, because of the difficulty in using Zeebrugge as a harbour.|$|E

500|$|Adams' art {{style is}} {{noted for its}} high level of detail, {{and he has a}} {{reputation}} of being a [...] "tight" [...] penciller. He states that he works at a slow pace, which limits the amount of work he does. When he penciled Fantastic Four #347–349 in 1990 for regular writer/illustrator Walter Simonson, who needed a break in order to catch up on his own work on that title, Adams managed to pencil the first two issues in five weeks and four weeks, respectively, but was considerably late on the third. In 1997 Adams stated that he could produce a page of either pencils or inks in a day. In a 2007 interview, he stated he tends to produce ⅔ to ¾ of a page a day, and can also ink <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>rate,</b> but can do up to two pages in a day if he is under pressure, as when he produced Cloak and Dagger #9 (1986) in 22 days, for example. Another example is the 1989 one-shot , which due to changing deadlines, he completed at a quicker pace. Adams singles out one page of that book that he drew a half-hour as his personal record for speed, but decries its poor quality. Adams is also noted for the humor in his work, as with, for example, the extraneous characters he places in cameo appearances in the backgrounds of his comics, as when he drew Gumby in the panels of Longshot, or the forms in which he depicted the shapeshifting alien Warlock in his The New Mutants work.|$|E
