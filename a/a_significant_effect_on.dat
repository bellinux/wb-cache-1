However, there were also reports of people stealing bodies to receive the payment. The federal government provided about US$12million to the state, as well as tax deductions for monetary donations. Former Union Minister Rangaiah Naidu opined that the state government overinflated the damage estimates to qualify for additional aid, in part due to the government spending annual disaster subsidies for salaries. The World Bank credited the government's experience with disasters as saving lives, although the response to the disaster was largely in repairing damage, rather than mitigating against future storms.
