There's so much variety with her and it's been such a journey with her.|$|E

25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Liz Lemon having a dream {{in which she}} is married to Jack Donaghy and is giving birth to their child. Since its beginning, the series has {{occasionally}} hinted at a romantic relationship between Liz and Jack. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, {{and in the same}} episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, series creator Tina Fey said that one of the plots the show will never do is have Liz and Jack get together. [...] "Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together." [...] Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook up; he responded [...] "I sincerely doubt it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> show is better off that way. Once they cross that line, all the tension goes out of those relationships. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work." ...|$|E
500|$|In an 18 August 2006 Science Friday interview, Mike Brown {{expressed}} {{doubt that}} a scientific definition was even necessary.

500|$|Mitch Pileggi was {{disappointed}} {{in the fact that}} the episode featured his character, Walter Skinner, getting beat up, something which had occurred in multiple episodes already by this point: [...] "I was feeling a little uncomfortable with him getting his ass kicked so much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> fans were, too." [...] Dave Grohl, the lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters and former drummer for Nirvana, made a small cameo, along with his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood, in the episode during the scene wherein Modell sneaks into the FBI building. Grohl, who has an active interest in UFO lore, called the episode [...] "his acting debut".|$|E
500|$|The album's title {{comes from}} a lyric on the album's final song, [...] "Home". Grohl stated that as he {{struggled}} to think of a title given the musical variety of the album, even considering the title [...] "The One With That Song On It", he looked at the song lyrics and after reading the ones from [...] "Home" [...] Grohl [...] "thought it was nice because it's open to interpretation and it's a beautiful title <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> album is beautiful in its diversity and its melody and its musicality – it goes from delicate acoustic moments to the heaviest shit we’ve ever done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by the [...] "special relationship" [...] that was developing between Geri Halliwell and Rowe. Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting: [...] "When he [...] and Geri started making eyes at each other I knew what was going on, even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me." [...] Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: [...] "I don't {{want to get into the}} side of things. They were very close. They clicked. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> lyrics in [...] "2 Become 1" [...] came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together." ...|$|E

500|$|In the episode, it is {{revealed}} that Jack Donaghy accidentally married Liz Lemon {{instead of his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net, while Avery wore a black cocktail dress. As {{a result of what}} Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. The two decide to get a divorce, however, they use their marriage to get the upper hand over one another. Ultimately, Jack and Liz decide to stop their feud and get a divorce. Since beginning, the series has occasionally hinted at a romantic relationship between the two characters. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, Fey said that one of the plots that 30 Rock will never do is have Liz and Jack get together. [...] "Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together."

500|$|The album artwork for Mediocre {{meant to}} emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sariñana elaborated, [...] "The cover is a take {{on the idea that}} women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and {{embroidering}} perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> public gets that, but there are some people out there who like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Short Story About Love" [...] was co-written by {{executive}} producer J.H. Wyman and co-producer Graham Roland. Wyman {{stated that the}} episode had [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "romantic" [...] themes, and as the title indicated, was [...] "all about motivation. Love is a great motivator, for good and evil." [...] He and fellow executive producer Jeff Pinkner believed the episode was [...] "kind of like a perfect version of what a Fringe show is," [...] because it depicted [...] "fringy" [...] elements {{in the form of}} killings while using love and relationships as central plot drivers. Wyman added that it was a [...] "culmination of what I could describe as — it’s a direction where we’ve been heading <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> fans will be really happy and satisfied." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{just shot}} a Beyoncé video at the {{beginning}} of this last week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, which was fun, and I hadn't done a video since 2009. It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} is of German origin, their music {{is based on the}} American style of death metal. Drummer Lille Gruber explained, [...] "Blues and rock music was {{developed}} in the U.S., that means it all goes back to this country. The roots are there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best musicians will always be there." [...] When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between Psalms of the Moribund and Prelude to the Tragedy, Gruber stated, [...] "We got our own style on Psalms to the Moribund where Prelude to the Tragedy had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized. Psalms of the Moribund splits in two extremes, it went more chunky, brutal, thick and deep, {{but at the same time}} that math-approach and the technicality went up a lot!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to a 2005 interview, the {{organization}} has never received negative feedback from a game composer or game publisher, and Lloyd stated, [...] "Like all communities surrounding fan works, we're out, first and foremost, to honor that which we love, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> concept and goals have been well received all around." [...] Several professional video game composers have positively commented about OC ReMix, such as Tommy Tallarico, Jeremy Soule, George [...] "The Fat Man" [...] Sanger, Hiroki Kikuta, Alexander Brandon, Barry Leitch, Nicholas Varley, and David Wise. OverClocked ReMix has also been praised for its work by non-composer industry figures including Doom lead designer John Romero and Contra 4 associate producer Tomm Hulett, who stated he hoped the game's music, scored by Jake [...] "virt" [...] Kaufman, would be arranged for OC ReMix in the future.|$|E

500|$|Nazi pledges of nondiscrimination {{in sports}} proved {{inconsistent}} with their actions, {{such as the}} expulsion of Jews from sports clubs, and in September 1934, Brundage sailed for Germany to see for himself. He met with government officials and others, although he {{was not allowed to}} meet with Jewish sports leaders alone. When he returned, he reported, [...] "I was given positive assurance in writing... {{that there will be no}} discrimination against Jews. You can't ask more than that <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> guarantee will be fulfilled." [...] Brundage's trip only increased the controversy over the question of US participation, with New York Congressman Emanuel Celler stating that Brundage [...] "had prejudged the situation before he sailed from America". Nevertheless, on September 26, 1934, after hearing a report from Brundage on conditions in Germany, the AOC voted to send a US team to Berlin.|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|Mason said {{he hoped}} that his storyline would [...] "draw in viewers in a {{responsible}} way" [...] and the feedback would stay positive. Mason added {{that he would like}} to see Chris happy in the future and hopes the viewers will warm to him. He added [...] "I know it's quite a sensitive topic, but I think the difference between his and the last encounters they've had is that we're looking more in-depth into more than just a [...] "gay kiss". We go more into the relationships, how it affects people around". Steele backed this up, saying [...] "We wanted gay to be part of Chris's character, not Chris to be the gay character. He's not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like to play up. He's on the basketball team, he's had a girlfriend for a time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|E
