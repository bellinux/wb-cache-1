He has the power of absorbing and redirecting kinetic and radiated energy. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner said Bacon was considered for Shaw for being an actor who could convey a villain [...] "with different shades, that's not always clear that he's the bad guy". Vaughn added that Bacon [...] "had that bravado that Shaw needed", while stating that the actor was his top choice along with Colin Firth. Bacon accepted the role as he was a fan of Vaughn's Kick-Ass, and liked both the character of Shaw and the script, which he described as [...] "a fresh look at the franchise, but also the comic book movies in general". The actor considered that Shaw was a sociopath to whom [...] "the morality of the world did not apply", with producer Simon Kinberg adding that Bacon portrayed him as [...] "somebody, who in his mind, is the hero of the movie". Bacon also said that, [...] "aside from the kind of evil side, I portrayed him <b>as</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hugh Hefner type". Vaughn discarded Shaw's look from the comics as he felt he would [...] "look like an Austin Powers villain".|$|E

It's a really quick record, but I like that element to it. I like the sparseness of the songs {{and the way that}} Brendan pulled us together and made us play as good as we could." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that [...] "prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun." [...] Vedder stated, [...] "The new record feels good so far—really strong and uptempo, stuff we can sink our teeth into", and added that the band's live performances inspired the album's sound: [...] "At one of our gigs, without flashpots and electricity, there's only so much room for those difficult listening songs. That's one reason we kept the arrangements lean." [...] The singer cited Guided by Voices as a reference in creating the shorter and faster songs of Backspacer. Gossard said that Backspacer is [...] "what we could have done for the last five records, in terms of re-engaging with the roots of why this band works", and that [...] "there's plenty of ballads, too... and there's some shifts in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relating—I think this record's got a chance to sound significantly different." [...] Ament said, [...] "There's a couple of great things that Ed brought in that could be real departures for us. Whatever wave Ed caught with [...] Into the Wild has taken him to different places." ...|$|E

If a code was just an ethical reminder, its content and design should not matter; all code variants should be equally effective. But we presumed that codes, which are made easier to learn, are formulated more clearly, or provide a limited discretion, lead to a more ethical intention. To test this hypothesis, we regressed unethical behavioral intention on a code’s design, frequency and specificity compliance training, and control variables (Table  3).|$|R
