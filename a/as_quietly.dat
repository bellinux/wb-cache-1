5|$|The {{enhanced}} {{police presence}} {{throughout the city}} during the strike helped to keep the calm, and the restrained approach of the police officers generally won praise from all sides, {{even though many of}} the policemen were seen as sympathetic to the striking white workers. The administration of Philadelphia's Republican mayor Bernard Samuel was also seen <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> sympathetic to the strikers. Throughout the strike, Mayor Samuel, who was {{also a member of the}} PTC board of directors, avoided any attempts of mediation. He refused to call a meeting of the PTC board of directors or to discuss the crisis with the TWU leaders. The mayor denied police protection to the two TWU officials who were willing to travel throughout the city and advocate an end to the strike. Samuel also refused to grant air time to War Production Board representatives who wanted to make a radio plea to end the strike. On August 2, the mayor declined, without an explanation, the NAACP request for permission to send two sound-trucks into black neighborhoods to broadcast appeals for calm. The city's black population felt disappointed and disenchanted with the actions of the local administration.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of the New Madrid Bend rose dramatically when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi. To avoid losing the garrison and its equipment, General Beauregard ordered that the position be abandoned <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> as possible. The process began on February 24, when the first members of the Columbus garrison arrived at Island No. 10. Two days later, its new commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, arrived, and immediately set to work to strengthen the position from Battery No. 1 to Point Pleasant.|$|E

25|$|Dismuke's battery {{probably}} {{first became}} associated with heavy artillery at Columbus, Kentucky {{in the winter}} of 1862. While initially serving as the first major Confederate bastion on the Mississippi River, Columbus became untendable when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi. To avoid losing the garrison and its equipment, General Beauregard ordered that the position be abandoned <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> as possible. The process began on February 24, when the first members of the Columbus garrison arrived at Island No. 10. Two days later, its new commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, arrived, and immediately set to work to strengthen the position McCown, was able to transform the island and nearby mainland into a formidable obstacle for any fleet attempting to pass. By the middle of March, five batteries containing 24 guns had been built on the shore above the island; 19 guns were in five batteries on the island itself; and the floating battery New Orleans, with nine guns, was moored at the west end of the island. McCown was eventually replaced in command at the island by Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall.|$|E

500|$|Accounts {{at the end}} of the 20th century {{focused on}} the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, {{following}} Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the [...] "medical stigmatization" [...] he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was [...] "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> as possible." [...] Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was [...] "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{played a}} very {{active role in the}} Dianetics boom, writing, lecturing and {{training}} auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal charisma. Jack Horner, who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950, later said, [...] "He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to hear every word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom." [...] Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how, at a dinner party, he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives [...] "all sat <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs." [...] As Atack comments, he was [...] "a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him". Christopher Evans described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to Dianetics and Scientology: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Vietnam War {{provided}} the next significant {{test for the}} Air National Guard. However, for largely domestic political reasons, President Lyndon B. Johnson chose not to mobilize most of the nation's reserve forces before 1968. [...] His reasons for not mobilizing reserve forces were many. Primarily, {{he did not believe}} that the war in Vietnam justified the dramatic act of mobilizing Reserve and National Guard forces. [...] He accepted the need to fight the war, but he wanted to prosecute it <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> as possible, not attracting too much attention at home and risk jeopardizing his domestic programs. He also wanted to avoid drawing the Communist Chinese into the war or the attention of the Soviet Union, the latter which might view the mobilization of Reserve and National Guard units as [...] "escalatory" [...] within a larger Cold War context. [...] Moreover, recalling Reservists' complaints of inactivity following the Berlin mobilization of 1961, he was also reluctant to recall Reservists and National Guardsmen without the assurance that their employment would significantly affect the course of the war, an assurance no official in his administration could provide. [...] As a result, even though still populated by many World War II and Korean War combat veterans, the Reserves and the National Guard acquired ill-deserved reputations during this period as havens for relatively affluent, young white men with no prior active duty military service to serve as officers or enlisted personnel as a means to avoid the draft into the active duty U.S. Army in an enlisted status.|$|E
