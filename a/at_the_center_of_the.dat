5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E

5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of human behavior as a result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrative, around which all other elements revolve.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun is {{the core}} region, a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.|$|E

Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bomb's spherical plutonium pit. The urchin ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.|$|E

5|$|On June 8, 1844, after fierce {{partisan}} struggles, the Senate {{rejected the}} Tyler–Texas treaty {{by a vote}} of 35–16, a margin of more than two-to-one. The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted largely in favor (15–8). Nevertheless, the disclosure of the treaty placed the issue of Texas annexation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1844 general election.|$|E

These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E
