In radio studios, DJs use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate acoustic feedback while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.|$|E

50|$|Ultrasone AG {{was founded}} in 1991 with the stated {{objective}} to manufacture advanced headphones {{with an emphasis on}} the professional <b>audio</b> <b>sector.</b> A feature of many Ultrasone headphones is a proprietary surround-sound simulacrum technology called S-Logic. The process uses decentralized transducer positioning to spread sound over the outer ear in an attempt to mimic sound heard over speakers. Traditional headphones shoot the sound directly into the ear.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{long-term}} spectral contours {{of a large}} dataset of popular commercial recordings were analyzed. The aim was to analyze overall trends, as well as yearly and genre-specific ones. A novel method for averaging spectral distributions is proposed, which yields results that are prone to comparison. With it, {{we found out that}} there is a consistent leaning towards a target equalization curve that stems from practices in the music industry, but also to some extent mimics natural, acoustic spectra of ensembles. For as long as spectral analysis has been a viable tool in the commercial <b>sectors,</b> <b>audio</b> engineers have looked at integrated spectral responses as possible answers for audio quality. Michael Paul Stavrou [1] states that, while at Abbey Road, he lost endless afternoons hopelessly chasing the illusive hit song characteristic in technical parameters and Neil Dorf-sman [2] acknowledges that, while many sound en-gineers would not admit to doing it, he feels tha...|$|R

50|$|Headphones may be {{used with}} {{stationary}} CD and DVD players, home theater, personal computers, or portable devices (e.g., digital audio player/MP3 player, mobile phone). Cordless headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as FM, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a Silent disco or Silent Gig.In the professional <b>audio</b> <b>sector,</b> headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a DJ mixer, and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} impact of the post- 2014 podcast {{resurgence}} on nonfictional audio storytelling formats. The empirical study comprises themed commentary by five significant US, European and Australian editors who commission and produce audio documentaries and features for broadcast and/or podcast. The article provides insights into the changing role played by public broadcasters, the growth of independent podcast networks and the perceived differences between radio and podcasting as a mode of delivering and receiving audio content. Of particular significance is the belief of senior commissioning editors that podcasting is fomenting a new, more informal, genre of audio narrative feature centred on a strong relationship between host and listener, with content that is 2 ̆ 7 talkier 2 ̆ 7 and less crafted. The US <b>audio</b> storytelling podcast <b>sector</b> is growing fast, and much of it has links to a public media ethos, but how to resource it without compromising its editorial independence remains unresolved...|$|R
40|$|Businesses today face {{particularly}} intense competitive pressures. The {{demand for}} customised solutions, fast delivery and high quality is growing rapidly, and {{all in a}} global marketplace which is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Consequently, much {{attention has been paid}} to those firms which have succeeded in this environment in order to discover what contributes to their comparatives. One of the ways in which firms can meet the challenges of this new competitive environment is through innovation. In particular, the way in which innovation is organised within the firm has been regarded as important in contributing to competitiveness. It has also been argued that firms may benefit from collaborating with other firms in the innovation process and that a location close to other firms in the same sector and suppliers may help firms to innovate more efficiently, as suggested by the proponents of industrial districts and milieu theories. By using the example of the successful UK high fidelity <b>audio</b> manufacturing <b>sector,</b> this study aims to discover the significance of these different factors. The results of this study suggest that innovation is the most widespread response to the pressures faced by firms and in order to innovate it was found that several factors were of great importance. Firstly, the abilities of certain key individuals and the accumulation of know-how and expertise within the firm wre crucial. This provided firms with the technological expertise necessary to exploit technological and market opportunities. Secondly, certain types of collaboration were important. For example, there was widespread vertical collaboration with suppliers in the innovation process. However, horizontal linkages with other hi-fi firms and vertical collaboration with users, universities and various business services were much less common. Thirdly, it was evident that the location of hi-fi firms was important but in a rather different way and at a different scale to examples of agglomeration elsewhere. It was more useful to view the UK as a whole as being an important place for hi-fi production in the global economy. Finally, these findings have various implications for government support of innovation. In particular it is important that more support is given to innovation projects in single firms and those developing incremental innovations. It is also imperative that there is greater investment in education and training in order that the UK possesses a workforce with the ability to develop new ideas and exploit opportunities for innovation. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a series of}} persuasive {{arguments}} have been developed that describe the growth of new industrial spaces. This new geography of production is seen to stem from the attempts of companies {{to respond to a}} new, more flexible, marketplace by becoming more vertically disintegrated through a reliance on a series of dense transactional supply and innovation linkages with spatially proximate firms. To date, much of the debate about these processes has rested on an empirical base which is rather limited in both its spatial and sectoral coverage. In this paper the debate is added to through reference to a recent survey of the UK high-fidelity <b>audio</b> <b>sector.</b> The impact of changing market demand and competitive pressures on the sector is outlined. The responses of firms to these pressures have resulted in a series of changes to corporate organisational structures. These changes are presented {{in the form of a}} broad-based sectoral analysis. In the concluding sections of the paper the possible spatial ramifications of the findings are dealt with. It is shown that many recent theoretical assertions do not accurately describe and predict the processes of change presently characterising the sector. ...|$|E
