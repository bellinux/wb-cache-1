Before the American Civil War, Southern defenders of African American slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North. The United States abolished slavery after the Civil War, but labor union activists found the metaphor useful.

2500|$|Frances Burney began {{composing}} small {{letters and}} stories {{almost as soon}} as she learned the alphabet.

The Burney family had many close friends, one of which was a writer called Samuel Crisp, nicknamed [...] "Daddy Crisp". He was almost like a second father to Frances, and was a strong influence on her early years of writing. Burney scholar Margaret Anne Doody has investigated conflicts within the Burney family that affected Burney's writing and her personal life. Doody alleged that one strain was an incestuous relationship between her brother James and their half-sister Sarah in 1798–1803, but there is no direct evidence for this <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to square with Frances's affection and financial assistance to Sarah in later life.|$|E

[...] Though praised, La Basoche could not fill the large house, and losses were mounting. [...] Carte had commissioned new operas from Cowen, Herman Bemberg, Hamish MacCunn and Goring Thomas. [...] Although Bemberg's opera Elaine was finished, and Cowen's Signa would be completed in March, Carte evidently had decided that producing these would be impracticable or too expensive and that he could not make a success of the new house.
