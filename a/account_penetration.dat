40|$|Younger adults {{make up a}} disproportionately {{large share}} of {{unbanked}} adults worldwide. Data from the Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database show that 44 percent of youth (ages 18 – 25) have an account at a formal financial institution, compared with 55 percent of older adults (ages 26 – 64). Just 18 percent of youth report having saved formally in the past year, and 6 percent having borrowed formally. The age gap in <b>account</b> <b>penetration</b> persists across regions and across income, gender, and education groups within economies. The Global Findex database {{can be used to}} track the effects of youth-specific financial inclusion policies worldwide and develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how younger adults save, borrow, make payments, and manage risk. Harnessing the productive capabilities of youth—who make up about 20 percent of all adults around the world—will prove critical in advancing economic growth, particularly in devel-oping economies. Yet in the developing world about 62 percent of youth remain outside the formal financial system, which limits their ability to invest in education, start a business, or manage day-to-day risk. Across both high-income and developing economies youth (ages 18 – 25) are significantly less likely than older adults (ages 26 – 64) to have a formal account, even when other personal characteristics—such as income, gender, and education—are controlled for. 1 Increasing young people’s access to financial services can increase their human capital investment, as evidenced by recent research in the United States exploring the effect of credit offered to youth under government programs. 2 Lack of systematic data on the unique financial needs of youth and their use of financial services has hindered the provision of youth-specific financial services in many econo-mies. The Global Findex database provides such indicators, measuring how people in 148 economies around the world save, borrow, make payments, and manage risk.

40|$|In {{this project}} {{quantitative}} structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were developed for several toxicological endpoints, including chemical cytotoxicity and acute toxicity, and biokinetic parameters related to penetration of chemical compounds through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). QSARs are computer-based mathematical models, which give {{information about the}} intrinsic properties of compounds (such as potential biological effects) {{on the basis of}} their chemical structure alone. For the regulatory assessment of chemicals and chemical products, the proposed new EU legislation called REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) foresees that there will be an increased use of QSARs as an alternative approach to (animal) testing. In this project, QSARs were developed for compound penetration through the BBB in vivo and through several membrane models in vitro, taking into <b>account</b> <b>penetration</b> by both passive diffusion and active transport. The classification of compounds as low or high BBB penetrators was explored and a simple classification QSAR model based on compound lipophilicity and H-bonding ability was obtained. The BBB transport of compounds known to interact with the P-glycoprotein (one of the BBB efflux transport systems) was modelled by 3 D-QSAR analysis, using hydrophobic and electrostatic molecular fields. Toxicities to a broad range of biological systems were also investigated, including unicellular organisms like bacteria and algae, isolated human and rodent cells, and in vivo toxicity to Daphnia, fish, rodents and humans. Similarities between the toxic effects for some of these systems were identified. Baseline toxicity effects (relationships between compound toxicity and lipophilicity) attributed to non-polar narcotics were investigated and separate QSARs were obtained for compounds acting by different mechanisms of toxic action or belonging to different chemical types. Classification QSAR models were obtained applying the EU classification scheme for chemical toxicity. The project also includes an investigation of the feasibility of predicting in vivo human toxicity by combining in vitro data and molecular descriptors. The QSAR models developed contributed to a mechanistic understanding of the investigated biological effects. Some of the models could be applied in integrated testing strategies for the assessment of regulatory endpoints based on alternative (non-animal) methods. JRC.

Outdoor-to-indoor propagation (building penetration) is automatically taken into account as a "by-product. " The transmission model requires no information about each building's interior other than a specific attenuation factor that describes the global behavior of the field inside the building. This coefficient can be determined for individual buildings by measuring the excess loss associated with the propagation path through the building. It is shown, however, that no large errors are to be expected if all buildings are characterized by the average of the empirical values obtained in this study, at 1. 9 GHz.

Some models consider the behavior of individual drivers under the influence of vehicles in their proximity (microscopic models) or the collective flow of vehicles (macroscopic models) or the platoon of vehicles (mesoscopic models). Within the framework of this study, a simulator is developed with driver and FSRACC models. Both driver and FSRACC simulators are merged.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} study of the {{behaviour}} and ionization properties of three narrow Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) at λλ 5797, 6379 and 6613 ˚A. In all three DIBs substructures have recently been detected, indicating large gaseous molecular carriers. Studying DIBs in regions with drastically different physical properties in terms of UV flux and density enables us to monitor the behaviour of the carriers and hence to constrain their nature. We observed these three DIBs along 40 different lines-of-sight (35 program stars and 5 standard stars) consisting of HII regions, dark clouds, molecular clouds and reflection nebulae. The DIB variations at low reddening are explained by a new model of photoionization equilibrium of the DIB carriers. This model takes into <b>account</b> the <b>penetration</b> depth of UV ionizing photons throughout the cloud. The slope of the variation of DIB strength as a function of reddening thus allows us to estimate the effective ionization potentials of the carriers. Following this new analysis, the carriers of the λ 5797 and λ 6613 ˚A DIBs would have ionization potentials above 10 eV, reminiscent of large PAHs or fullerenes which have a single positive charge. The estimated ionization potential (7 – 9 eV) of the λ 6379 ˚A DIB seems to indicate a large neutral carrier.

One great method that has shown its potential in our better understanding of such a complicated biological problem is mathematical modeling [1]. Tumor immune models have existed since the early 1990 s. Researchers have proposed various modeling approaches using ordinary and delayed differential equations [2 – 5]. A good summary of early works of tumor immune dynamics can be found in [6]. A detailed review of non-spatial models described by ODEs is published by Eftimie [7]. A simple but classical mathematical model of a cell mediated response to a growing tumor cell is proposed and analyzed by Kuznetsov and Taylor [8]; it takes into <b>account</b> the <b>penetration</b> of tumor cells by effector cells as well as the inactivation of effector cells.

Then time delay was considered in the simplified model, and a state of the returning tumor was observed.

40|$|After the {{explosion}} of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, large volumes of crude oil were washed onto and embedded in the sandy beaches and sublittoral sands of the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Some of this oil was mechanically or chemically dispersed before reaching the shore. With a set of laboratory-column experiments we show that the addition of chemical dispersants (Corexit 9500 A) increases the mobility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in saturated permeable sediments by up to two orders of magnitude. Distribution and concentrations of PAHs, measured in the solid phase and effluent water of the columns using GC/MS, revealed that the mobility of the PAHs depended on their hydrophobicity and was species specific also in the presence of dispersant. Deepest penetration was observed for acenaphthylene and phenanthrene. Flushing of the columns with seawater after percolation of the oiled water resulted in enhanced movement by remobilization of retained PAHs. An in-situ benthic chamber experiment demonstrated that aromatic hydrocarbons are transported into permeable sublittoral sediment, emphasizing the relevance of our laboratory column experiments in natural settings. We conclude that the addition of dispersants permits crude oil components to penetrate faster and deeper into permeable saturated sands, where anaerobic conditions may slow degradation of these compounds, thus extending the persistence of potentially harmful PAHs in the marine environment.
