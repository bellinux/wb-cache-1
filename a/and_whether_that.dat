25|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon (because {{that was where}} Reagan was living at the time), and that court ended up dismissing the action. Eitel appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which, in 1997, reinstated the case and allowed the Justice Department to join Eitel as a plaintiff in the suit. At this time, the case was also transferred to District Court in Arizona. Eitel and the Justice Department, however, disagreed over the allegations of CIA involvement, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> should {{be a factor in}} the suit. The DoJ filed motions in 1998 to drop several of the defendants, provoking a sharp disagreement between Eitel and the Department, and resulting in Eitel's accusation that the DoJ was covering up covert activities and evidence.|$|E

Robert Christgau of the Village Voice rated Slay Tracks an A-, and selected it as his fourth favorite EP of 1990. Spins review said: [...] "a long stream of noise water is omitted by Pavement. ...

[...] A reviewer for Option praised the band's lo-fi characteristics and attitude, calling the EP [...] "loose and intentionally lo-fi," [...] and saying [...] "let's hope this Pavement stays cracked." [...] College Music Journals review was also favorable, noting [...] "You're Killing Me" [...] and [...] "She Believes" [...] as highlights, and calling the EP a [...] "deep, intoxicating breath of homemade music from people with tongues in their cheeks and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin engine feedback and fuzz hits dead center with naive [...] melodic balance, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> is in spite of or because of the sloppy, one-take feel is inconsequential." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, in {{the later}} case of Shankar Alan, Judicial Commissioner Menon took an {{opposing}} view, holding that [...] "there are indeed some important differences between [...] ". First, he considered that there are material differences between {{the perspective of the}} inquiry, accepting that the real likelihood of bias test directs the inquiry at whether the court thinks there is a real likelihood or danger of bias, while the reasonable suspicion test considers it {{from the perspective of the}} public. He also considered that even with the rider that [...] "likelihood" [...] is to be equated with [...] "possibility", there is still a significant difference between the court inquiring whether it thinks there is a sufficient (or real) possibility that the tribunal or court was biased on the one hand, and, on the other, whether a lay person might reasonably entertain such an apprehension, even if the court was satisfied that there was in fact no such danger. Secondly, there is also a difference in relation to the substance of the inquiry. The real likelihood test is concerned with the degree of possibility that there was bias even if it was unconscious. In contrast, the reasonable suspicion test is concerned with how it appears to the relevant observer <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> observer could reasonably entertain a suspicion or apprehension of bias even if the court was satisfied that there was no possibility of bias in fact.|$|E
2500|$|The regimes' {{strategy}} was to grant applications selectively and with long delays {{in a process that}} was designed to be demeaning, frustrating and leading to years of applicants waiting for a leaving date that would never arrive. [...] In addition, while waiting, applicants were subject to baleful discrimination, faced workplace firing or demotion, were denied university access and were forced to relinquish their passports resulting in the denial of travel rights even within their country of residence. [...] In 1984, twenty-five Czechoslovakians occupied a West German embassy in Prague demanding asylum in the west while seven East Germans did so in the library of the United States Berlin embassy. [...] The authorities relented, and that year witnessed a huge rise in legal emigration, with applications swelling to 57,600, 29,800 of which were granted. [...] Small groups of organized applicants had already held vigils calling for legal emigration since the late 1970s. [...] The movement and application figures grew by the late 1980s as the east-west prosperity gap widened resulting in West German citizenship looking more attractive, while authorities were at a loss how to address the application rise. [...] Increasing visa grants in the late 1980s accompanying a 1988 decision to prioritize those for citizens who engaged in protests provided incentives to further expand the movement. [...] The East German SED party conceded that [...] "he emigration problem is confronting us with a fundamental problem of 's development" [...] and this challenge [...] "threatens to undermine beliefs in the correctness of the party's policies." [...] The move accompanied a growing dissolving of confidence that the problems facing socialism could ever be solved <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> system was the future.|$|E
2500|$|A Massachusetts law {{enacted in}} 1913 invalidated the {{marriage}} of non-residents if the marriage was invalid in the state where they lived. Historians and legal scholars believe it originated in an upsurge of anti-miscegenation sentiment associated with the notoriety of champion boxer Jack Johnson's marriages to white women. Though moribund for decades, {{it was used to}} prevent same-sex couples who were residents of other states from marrying in Massachusetts. As the date neared for the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the governor and some town clerks disputed how <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> law should be enforced, and Romney had used the state's authority to block the same-sex marriages of non-residents from being properly recorded. He told a news conference: [...] "We certainly won't record on our public health records marriages that are on the face of them not consistent with the law". The clerks soon relented under orders from the Attorney General. In June 2004, GLAD brought a lawsuit, Cote-Whitacre v. Department of Public Health, on behalf of several out-of-state same-sex couples and several town clerks who objected to being forced to discriminate in denying licenses to such couples. The SJC upheld the law on March 30, 2006, though it allowed that residents of states like New York and Vermont, which did not explicitly exclude same-sex couples from marriage, might pursue the case further. On September 29, 2006, Superior Court Justice Connolly determined that same-sex couples who reside in Rhode Island can marry in Massachusetts after finding [...] "that same-sex marriage is ... not prohibited in Rhode Island". In May 2007, Judge Connolly declared valid the marriages of several same-sex couples, residents of New York, who married in Massachusetts before July 6, 2006, when a New York court issued a ruling that same-sex marriage was not legal there, New York's first explicit prohibition on same-sex marriage. In July 2007, the DPH ruled that same-sex couples from New Mexico, where whether the law prohibits same-sex marriage is disputed, can obtain marriage licenses in Massachusetts.|$|E
