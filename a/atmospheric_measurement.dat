5000|$|The top-down, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>measurement</b> {{approach}} involves {{satellite data}} and in-situ measurements {{of carbon dioxide}} concentrations, as well as atmospheric models that model atmospheric transport of carbon dioxide. These have limited ability to determine carbon dioxide emissions at highly resolved spatial scales and can typically not represent finer scales than a 1 km grid. The models also must resolve the fluxes of carbon dioxide from anthropogenic sources like fossil fuel burning, and from natural interactions like terrestrial ecosystems and the ocean.

It is a statistical method used in meteorology and other applications (micrometeorology, oceanography, hydrology, agricultural sciences, industrial and regulatory applications, etc.) to determine exchange rates of trace gases over natural ecosystems and agricultural fields, and to quantify gas emissions rates from other land and water areas. It is frequently used to estimate momentum, heat, water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane fluxes.|$|E

Working closely with the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, he initiated and led scientifically the SCIAMACHY project, {{which resulted in the}} satellite based measurements of the instruments Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on ESA ERS-2 (1995-2011), SCIAMACHY on ESA Envisat (2002 -2012), GOME-2 on EUMETSAT Metop Series (2006-2022), and the concepts GeoSCIA/GeoTROPE, now developed as European Union Copernicus Programme Sentinel 4, and CarbonSat/CarbonSat Constellation.|$|E
5000|$|Ocean {{heat flux}} is a {{turbulent}} and complex system which utilizes <b>atmospheric</b> <b>measurement</b> {{techniques such as}} eddy covariance to measure {{the rate of heat}} transfer expressed in the unit of joules or watts per second. Heat flux is the difference in temperature between two points through which the heat passes. Most of the Earth's heat storage is within its seas with smaller fractions of the heat transfer in processes such as evaporation, radiation, diffusion, or absorption into the sea floor. The majority of the ocean heat flux is through advection or the movement of the ocean's currents. For example, the majority of the warm water movement in the south Atlantic is thought to have originated in the Indian Ocean. Another example of advection is the nonequatorial Pacific heating which results from subsurface processes related to atmospheric anticlines. [...] Recent warming observations of Antarctic Bottom Water in the Southern Ocean is of concern to ocean scientists because bottom water changes will effect currents, nutrients, and biota elsewhere. The international awareness of global warming has focused scientific research on this topic since the 1988 creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Improved ocean observation, instrumentation, theory, and funding has increased scientific reporting on regional and global issues related to heat.|$|E
