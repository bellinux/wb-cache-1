5|$|Following {{the flight}} of their monarch, the Pergamese fleet withdrew north. However, having been bested by the Rhodians on the allied right wing, the Macedonian left wing {{disengaged}} <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> to join its victorious right flank. The withdrawal of the Macedonian left permitted the Rhodians to sail unmolested back into Chios' harbour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the troops}} of Urquiza and Eugenio Garzón had {{surrounded}} {{the army of}} Oribe near Montevideo. Their forces numbered roughly 15,000 men, almost double Oribe's 8,500. Realising that the Brazilians were approaching and knowing {{that there was no}} hope of victory, Oribe orderered his troops to surrender without a fight on 19 October, <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> into seclusion on his farm in Paso del Molino.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October, French troops {{backed by}} tanks, {{artillery}} and aerial support launched an operation to surround and eliminate al-Kharrat's rebels in the al-Zur forest. Al-Kharrat's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al-Malihah. Positioned among the trees, the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops. The latter {{were unable to}} lure the rebels out <b>and</b> <b>retreated.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prince Eugène de Beauharnais {{advanced}} his corps against Borodino, rushing {{the village}} and capturing it from the Russian Guard Jägers.

General Delzons was posted to Borodino to prevent the Russians retaking it.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a pivotal {{moment in the}} Southern campaign. The {{surprising}} victory of the American patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of rebel defeats {{at the hands of}} Lord Cornwallis, and greatly raised the Patriots' morale. With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed, Cornwallis was forced to abandon his plan to invade North Carolina <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> into South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the Muslim army once again sought refuge in Mineo, where Theodotus {{blockaded}} them and soon reduced them {{to the point of}} eating their horses and even dogs.

5|$|During {{the last}} week of the war, Johnson's {{squadron}} flew patrols over Berlin and Kiel as German resistance crumbled. During a flight over central Germany looking for jet fighters, Johnson's squadron attacked Luftwaffe airfields. On one sortie, his unit strafed and destroyed 11 Bf 109s that were preparing to take off. On another sortie, an enemy transport was sighted, but took evasive action <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> back to German held territory but Johnson's pilots shot it down. On another occasion, Johnson intercepted a flight of four Fw 190s. The German fighters, however, waggled their wings to signal non-hostile intent and Johnson's unit escorted them to an RAF airfield.|$|E
5|$|Mannerheim {{decided to}} strike first at Tampere. He {{launched}} {{the attack on}} 16 March at Längelmäki, 65km north-east of the town. At the same time, the White Army began advancing along a northern and north-western frontline, through Vilppula–Kuru–Kyröskoski–Suodenniemi. Many Red Guard units collapsed <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> in panic {{under the weight of}} the assault, while some detachments defended their posts relentlessly, and were able to slow the advance of the White Guards, who were unaccustomed to offensive warfare. Eventually, the Whites lay siege to Tampere. They cut off the Reds southward connection in Lempäälä on 24 March and westward in Siuro (Nokia, Finland) and Ylöjärvi on 25 March.|$|E
5|$|North Korean troops, {{hampered}} by supply shortages and massive losses, continually staged attacks on UN forces {{in an attempt}} to penetrate the perimeter and collapse the line. However, the UN used the port to amass an overwhelming advantage in troops, equipment, and logistics, and its navy and air forces remained unchallenged by the North Koreans during the fight. After six weeks, the North Korean force collapsed <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15. The battle would be the furthest the North Korean troops would advance in the war, as subsequent fighting ground the war into a stalemate.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December, von Frank {{informed}} Potiorek that {{he considered}} it impossible for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much longer. As a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces {{in the city to}} withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> back into Austria-Hungary under the cover of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube.

5|$|On 18 August, Admiral Scheer {{attempted}} {{a repeat of}} the 31 May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers— and —supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Kaiser, would trail behind and provide cover. The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just eleven weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> to German ports.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1868, {{parties of}} Paraguayans in canoes camouflaged by foliage and brush boarded Brazilian ironclads {{anchored}} in Tayí. The imperiled vessels dispatched a boat to warn Inhaúma, who was aboard the flagship Brasil downriver at Elisiário Port. By {{the time he}} arrived, the Brazilians had locked themselves inside their ships and the Paraguayans had taken control of the decks. Inhaúma ordered the Brasil and two other vessels to open fire, decimating the Paraguayans and saving the ironclads. A day later he was raised from baron to viscount by Pedro II. On 25 July, the allies occupied Humaitá after the Paraguayans had abandoned it <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> further upriver.|$|E

5|$|On 8 July 1644, the Earl of Essex sent a Parliamentarian force, led by Colonel Sir Robert Pye with Lieutenant Colonel Robert Blake as {{his second}} in command, to reclaim Taunton. They took the town without a fight, and {{surrounded}} the castle. The Royalist forces under Major William Reeve that were garrisoned at Taunton Castle surrendered <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> to Bridgwater. Pye left Taunton {{shortly after the}} capture, leaving Blake to hold the town. Blake had an army of about 1,000 men, and was charged with trying to blockade the roads to support the Earl of Essex's campaign in Devon and Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, 1898, American {{troops that}} were {{pursuing}} units retreating from Coamo encountered heavy resistance in Aibonito <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> after six of their soldiers were injured. They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. In the subsequent crossfire, confused soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and five American officers were gravely injured, which prompted a retreat order. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting {{on behalf of}} the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, Arnold {{drew the}} British fleet to a {{position}} he had carefully chosen to limit their advantages. In the battle that followed, many of the American ships were damaged or destroyed. That night, Arnold sneaked the American fleet past the British one, beginning a retreat toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga. Unfavorable weather hampered the American retreat, {{and more of the}} fleet was either captured or grounded and burned before it could reach Crown Point. Upon reaching Crown Point Arnold had the fort's buildings burned <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> to Ticonderoga.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan. They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and probably never got closer than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E
5|$|Shelby and his Overmountain Men crossed {{back over}} the Appalachian Mountains <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> back into the {{territory}} of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present day Elizabethton, Tennessee, and by the next month on September 25, 1780, Colonels Shelby, John Sevier, and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Kościuszko Uprising began in March 1794, Zajączek joined Kościuszko in Luborzyca on 2 April. Zajączek {{was given the}} command of the Lesser Poland Division, and on 4 April he took part in battle of Racławice, which {{concluded}} with a major Polish victory. On 6 April {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant general. Over the next few weeks Zajączek accompanied Kościuszko and his staff. On 8 June he was defeated at the battle of Chełm <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> toward Lublin. He lost support among the troops, and faced a mutiny, eventually quelled by Kościuszko, on 10 June. In mid June Zajączek's forces merged with those of Kościuszko. He commanded the forces in the inconclusive battle of Gołków on 9–10 July, and soon after {{he was one of the}} Polish commanders of the defense of Warsaw that lasted from mid July until early September. In the following few weeks Zajączek became one of the members of the Supreme National Council, and a president of its Criminal Court. He was a commander of the defense of Warsaw during the disastrous battle of Praga of 4 November. During the battle Zajączek was wounded <b>and</b> <b>retreated</b> from the battle even before the conflict was over. He has been criticised for his insufficient preparation for the defense of Warsaw against Russian invasion, and for poor leadership during the battle. Zajączek escaped to Polish Galicia where he was interned by Austrians. He was released one year later, moving to Paris.|$|E
