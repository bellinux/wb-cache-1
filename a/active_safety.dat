40|$|<b>Active</b> {{pedestrian}} <b>safety</b> {{systems can}} help to significantly increase pedestrian road safety, but must be tested very carefully before used in series application. Since there is usually a very small {{amount of time to}} prevent the collision, the activation of an emergency brake is always a critical decision. On the other hand, of course, false triggerings must be prevented. Aiming to increase pedestrian and vehicle safety, this thesis presents a novel approach for the test of <b>active</b> pedestrian <b>safety</b> systems. From the question "What is needed to test and compare future <b>active</b> pedestrian <b>safety</b> systems?" are resulting the following questions: 1. What are the significant characteristics of real pedestrians? 2. How can this features be mapped to a test system? This thesis presents characteristic features of pedestrians from the perspective of automotive surround sensors and introduces a novel test system approach including a realistic pedestrian dummy which is able to replicate those characteristics. Furthermore it introduces a novel <b>active</b> pedestrian <b>safety</b> test methodology, based on the variation of target characteristics, environmental conditions and driver behaviour. The proposed pedestrian dummy was set up in real size and tested on the test track in vehicle tests. A video of the described test and the novel pedestrian dummy can be seen here: [URL]...|$|R

25|$|EyeSight is Subaru's <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> {{system that}} uses twin CCD cameras, {{simulating}} stereoscopic vision. It {{was first introduced}} in Japan only as Active Driving Assist (ADA) in 1999. When activated, it actively monitors the road through the windshield-mounted cameras, and can react to driving conditions and possibly avert collisions. Models equipped with EyeSight earned the highest possible rating in the IIHS front crash safety test. Unlike other manufacturers offering stereoscopic cameras for drivers-asset purposes, the Eyesight system's cameras are not bonded to the windshield. Thus, if the windshield is dirty on the inside, it may affect the system's performance.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the presence and quality of <b>active</b> transportation <b>safety</b> features in Canadian school environments that relate to pedestrian and bicycle safety. Variations in these features and associated traffic concerns as perceived by school administrators were examined by geographic status and school type. The study was based on schools that participated in 2009 / 2010 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. ArcGIS software version 10 and Google Earth were used to assess the presence and quality of ten different <b>active</b> transportation <b>safety</b> features. Findings suggest that there are crosswalks and good sidewalk coverage in the environments surrounding most Canadian schools, but a dearth of bicycle lanes and other traffic calming measures (e. g., speed bumps, traffic chokers). Significant urban/rural inequities exist with a greater prevalence of sidewalk coverage, crosswalks, traffic medians, and speed bumps in urban areas. With the exception of bicycle lanes, the <b>active</b> transportation <b>safety</b> features that were present were generally rated as high quality.

2500|$|Current <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> {{technology}} {{relies on}} vehicle-based radar and vision systems. [...] For example, this technology can reduce rear-end collisions by tracking obstructions in front or behind the vehicle, automatically applying brakes when needed. This technology is somewhat limited {{in that it}} senses only the distance and speed of vehicles within the direct line of sight of cameras and the sensing range of radars. It is almost completely ineffective for angled and left-turn collisions [...] It may even cause a motorist to lose control of the vehicle {{in the event of}} an impending head-on collision. [...] The rear-end collisions covered by today's technology are typically less severe than angle, left-turn, or head-on collisions. Existing technology is therefore inadequate for the overall needs of the roadway system.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Mitsubishi {{released}} the Diamante (Sigma) in Japan. It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (<b>active)</b> <b>safety</b> function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E
