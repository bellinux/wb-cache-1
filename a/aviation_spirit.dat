Antiknock agents allow {{the use of}} higher compression ratios for greater efficiency and peak power. Adding varying amounts of additives like low percentage TEL or high percentage ethanol to gasoline, allowed easy, inexpensive control of octane ratings. TEL offered the business advantage of being commercially profitable because it could be patented. <b>Aviation</b> <b>spirits</b> with TEL used in WWII reached 150 octane to enable supercharged engines such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon to reach high horse power ratings at altitude. In military aviation, TEL manipulation allowed a range of different fuels to be tailored for particular flight conditions.|$|R

50|$|Radar was {{no longer}} a new-fangled {{invention}} to be regarded with suspicion, but a valuable weapon. Faith in its efficacy grew rapidly, sometimes to limitsbeyond its deserving. It was well known to the radiophysicists that the air warning set did not, because of the interference of radio waves reflected from the earth, cover regions near the ground. Had the Japanese known this, they could, by flying at low level, have come quite close to the target beforetheir presence was detected. Fortunately for Britain, even the German pilots did not know of this trick early in the war. The German pilots did learn it later, and long after the Darwin raids passed the trick on to the Japanese just as their air strength was nearly exhausted. The Americans failed to intercept during the next five raids and on 2 April the Shell oil refineries in Harvey Street were struck by bomb splinters, causing 136 000 litres of <b>aviation</b> <b>spirit</b> to be lost. Two days later, however, the Kittyhawks were ready and waiting when seven bombers and six fighters attacked the civil airfield at Darwin. The 9th Fighter Squadron destroyed five bombers and two Zeros, losing only one of its own aircraft and damaging two. This engagement, needless to say, did much to restore confidence within the beleaguered community. Second Lieutenants John Landers and Andrew Reynolds both managed to destroy two aircraft each during this encounter.|$|E
40|$|The {{emissions}} {{produced by}} gas turbine engines driven by catalytic com-bustion can contain signi 5 cantly {{lower levels of}} noxious gases than those exhausted from conventional flame $red engines. The research reported here has demonstrated that eficient power generation, combined with minimum noxious emission, {{can be achieved by}} utilising metal supported platinum catalyst combustion systems specijcally designed to ensure maximum compatibility with the engine models they are to power. A number of important applications for these systems are suggested. Catalytic combustion, that is flameless combustion promoted by a catalyst, can take place with a variety of fuels ranging from high octane <b>aviation</b> <b>spirit</b> or propane gas to low BTU waste gases or residue oils. Applications for this type of combustion have been sought, and studied, at Johnson Mattheyâ€™s labora-tories for more than a decade. These studies have included flameless heaters, which are used for a variety of agricultural, industrial and recreational purposes (I), and particu-larly Honeycat 03 systems for the combustion of organic fumes which would otherwise cause atmospheric pollution (2). More recently the application of this principal to the production of heat from waste gases has been investigated. Another recent development of importance has been the successful application of catalytic combustion to direct power produc-tion, for example by gas turbine engines.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (International Trade)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This thesis {{identifies}} realistic export {{opportunities for}} South African {{products in the}} rest of the world and specifically {{in the rest of}} the African continent. The method chosen to achieve this goal is the Decision Support Model (DSM) developed by Cuyvers et al (1995) and Cuyvers (1997) that was specifically designed to assist export promotion institutions in planning and assessing their export promotion activities. This model is positioned into the international market selection literature and four main refinements to the DSM methodology are introduced to address the limitations of the model and to make it more applicable for the South African international trade conditions. The refined model is then applied to identify productâ€“country combinations with the largest export potential for South Africa {{in the rest of the}} world and in the rest of the African continent specifically. The refinements to the DSM filtering process introduced in this study contribute to the effective use and application of the DSM results by South African exporters and more focused export promotion activities by South African export promotion organisations. The four refinements include (i) running the DSM on a HS 6 â€“digit level, (ii) introducing a method to calculate the potential export value of each identified export opportunity in order to prioritise between the productâ€“country combinations identified as realistic export opportunities, (iii) taking the production capacity of South Africa into consideration in order to identify export opportunities that can be pursued immediately due to the country's existing revealed comparative advantage in the production and exportation of these products and (iv) developing a market accessibility index per productâ€“country combination from a South African point of view on a HS 6 â€“digit level in order to make filter 3. 2 (barriers to trade) of the DSM applicable for South African conditions. The results of the application of the refined DSM to identify export opportunities for South Africa in the rest of the world include the top 50 worldwide export opportunities. There are 17 countries in which the top 50 worldwide productâ€“country combinations identified as export opportunities for South Africa are located. These include the United States, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Germany, Israel, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Singapore, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brazil. Mineral products (coal, copper and aviation spirit); transportation products (1500 - 3000 cc automobile engines and diesel powered trucks); stone/glass (diamonds, platinum and rhodium) and metals (aluminium, iron/steel structures, nickel) are the product classifications within the top 50 worldwide productâ€“country combinations that hold the largest worldwide export potential for South Africa. In terms of the productâ€“country combinations with the highest export potential for South Africa in the rest of the African continent, there are 18 countries in which the top 50 productâ€“country combinations for South Africa in the rest of the African continent are located. These include Nigeria, Namibia, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt, Zambia, Tunisia, Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mauritius, Tanzania, Senegal, Mozambique, Algeria, Malawi and Cote d'Ivoire. The products with the highest potential export values in the top 50 productâ€“country combinations for South Africa in Africa include mineral products (<b>aviation</b> <b>spirit,</b> iron ore, sulphur and coal) and transportation products (1500 - 3000 cc automobile engines and diesel powered trucks weighing less than 5 tons).
