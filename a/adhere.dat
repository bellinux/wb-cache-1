40|$|AbstractBecause {{inhibition}} of integrin signaling induces apoptosis, we investigated whether keratinocytes expressing β 1 and α 6 β 4 integrins (enriched for stem cells) are protected from cell death. Keratinocytes rapidly <b>adhering</b> to type IV collagen expressed {{highest levels of}} β 1 and α 6 β 4 and of the anti-apoptotic stem cell marker p 63. Apoptotic cells were significantly higher in slowly <b>adhering</b> than in rapidly <b>adhering</b> keratinocytes. Anti-β 1 integrin caused {{a significant increase in}} apoptotic cells, while it decreased Bcl- 2 levels in stem keratinocytes. Bax and Bad proteins were higher in slowly <b>adhering</b> than in rapidly <b>adhering</b> cells. By contrast, Bcl- 2, Bcl-x and Mcl- 1 proteins were highest in rapidly <b>adhering</b> keratinocytes and nearly absent in slowly <b>adhering</b> cells. After addition of anti-β 1 integrin, the apoptotic rate was significantly higher in HaCaT cells not expressing Bcl- 2 than in controls. These results indicate that keratinocytes enriched for stem cells are protected from apoptosis via β 1 integrin, in a Bcl- 2 dependent manner...|$|R
