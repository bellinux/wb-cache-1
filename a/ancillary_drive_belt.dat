40|$|In {{this design}} project an elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> system is {{optimized}} using an algorithm of automated optional design, AOD. First, some basic background information on AOD and elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> systems is reviewed. An elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> system configuration is defined, mathematically formulated, and optimized. The mathematical formulation, including {{a set of}} constraints, is completely derived. It is set up to be as general as possible so {{that it may be}} applied {{to a wide variety of}} different problems. In several places the formulation uses the recommendations of an elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> manufacturer for a good design. A sample design problem is optimized using the A 0 D-P 519 RE algorithm of AOD. The following optimization studies are carried out: 1. Minimization of bearing load 2. Maximization of power transmission 3 Minimization of power requirement Standard belt material compounds and thicknesses are considered. To illustrate the usefulness of algorithms of AOD, an existing hand calculation design method for elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> systems is demonstrated. These two techniques are then compared as design optimization tools. It is shown that an algorithm of AOD is superior for this purpose. At the conclusion of this project several detailed discussions regarding the work and results are presented. The AOD search process, derivation of the final equation set, significance of the results, and other items are analyzed. A set of final design recommendations for the sample problem are given and a list of conclusions is presented...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide belt {{conveyors}} {{are used to}} transport {{a great variety of}} bulk solid materials. The desire to carry higher tonnages over longer distances and more diverse routes, while keeping exploitation costs as low as possible, has fuelled many technological advances. An interesting development in the recent past is the distribution of drive power along the path of a belt conveyor, which has resulted in the multiple <b>driven</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor. The main idea behind this study is based on finding the right balance between the locally applied drive power and the occurring resistances in such a multiple <b>driven</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor system, so the belt tension stays within the safety margins in a controlled manner. Existing sub models describing belt dynamics, mechanical resistances and the transfer of drive force onto the belt are investigated, and expanded if necessary, so they can be combined to create a complete model of a distributed <b>driven</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor. The combined model serves as a base to test existing design rules used for conventional single <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> conveyors and to investigate what modifications are required in the multiple drive case.

40|$|Belts are {{components}} of the mechanical systems of rotation commonly used for mechanical power transmission and changes in rotational speeds in the shafts. Various failures of the <b>drive</b> <b>belts</b> (foot shear, tooth wear, hollowed teeth, back cracks) are common in rotating machines and can cause economic losses. To increase efficiency, reliability and safety of the machines the use of new fault diagnosis techniques of belts, identification and classification is required.
