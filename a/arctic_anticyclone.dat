40|$|Vertical and {{horizontal}} distributions of ozone, extinction due to aerosol light scattering, condensation nucleus concentrations, aerosol spectra, and meteorological parameters were {{measured with a}} NOAA WP- 3 D research aircraft over the Alaskan Arctic in March 1983. Multiple layers of haze, varying in thickness from a few 10 's to 100 's of meters, were observed throughout the troposphere. A maximum concentration of aerosols was located between 600 and 800 mb. Distribution of the haze layers was associated with distinct meteorological boundaries. The characteristics of the haze changed in response to stages in the progression of a major Arctic haze episode. On March 17, 1983, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>anticyclone</b> was penetrated and its meteorological and aerosol properties determined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Atmospheric and oceanic {{variability}} in the Arctic shows the existence of several oscillatory modes. The decadal-scale mode associated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and a low-frequency oscillation (LFO) with an approximate time scale of 60 - 80 years, dominate. Both modes were positive in the 1990 s, signifying a prolonged phase of anomalously low at-mospheric sea level pressure and above normal surface air temperature in the central Arctic. Consistent with an enhanced cyclonic component, the <b>arctic</b> <b>anticyclone</b> was weakened and vorticity of winds became positive. The rapid reduction of arctic ice thickness in the 1990 s may be one manifestation of the intense atmosphere and ice cyclonic circulation regime due to the synchronous actions of the AO and LFO. Our {{results suggest that the}} decadal AO and multidecadal LFO drive large amplitude natural {{variability in}} the Arctic making detection of possible long-term trends induced by greenhouse gas warming most difficult...|$|E
30|$|In the {{typification}} of Dzerdzeyevskiy {{the terms}} “zonal” and “meridional” are used. Meridional are northern (movement of <b>arctic</b> <b>anticyclones</b> {{and distribution of}} their ridges to the south) and southern (movement of cyclones from low to high latitudes). Terms “ latitudinal” and “longitudinal” are the analogs of these terms {{in relation to the}} sectors of the Hemisphere and their parts, i.e. all types of ECM, depending on the distribution are subdivided into respective groups.|$|R
5000|$|Climate {{formation}} in Azerbaijan {{is influenced by}} various air masses. Cold air masses, such as the Kara and Scandinavian <b>arctic</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> the temperate Siberian anticyclones, and the maritime Azores maximum influence the climate. Likewise, tropical hot air masses (subtropical anticyclone and southern cyclones), as well as Central Asian anticyclones and local weather conditions, have influence. These air masses enter the country in different ways thanks to its varied geography. Thus, although they do not prevent the hot masses entering Azerbaijan from the south, cold continental and maritime air masses cause changes in properties of those hot air masses, and influence {{the dynamics of the}} atmosphere [...]|$|R
50|$|The climate varies between polar and {{moderate}} continental with frequent fogs and clouds. Winds are predominantly southwestern in winter with speeds of 4-8 m/s. They bring cold {{air from the}} south, establishing the temperature of about −15 °C (February) {{over most of the}} sea. The northern part is warmer at about −9 °C, sometimes reaching −6 °C, due to the warm air masses from the Atlantic. <b>Arctic</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> however, change winds to the northeastern ones, bringing much colder weather with temperatures of about −25 °C. Summers are cold, cloudy and relatively humid, with northeastern winds and frequent rains. Average July temperatures are 8-10 °C. Occasional southeastern winds bring warm air from Europe, raising the temperature to 17-19 °C and sometimes even to 30 °C. Annual precipitations increase from 282 mm in the north 529 in the south.|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{coherent}} vortices near the extratropical tropopause, even with regard to basic facts about their frequency of occurrence, longevity, and structure. This study addresses these issues through an objective census of observed tropopause vortices. The authors test a hypothesis regarding vortex-merger asymmetry where cyclone pairs are repelled and anticyclone pairs are attracted by divergent flow due to frontogenesis. Emphasis is placed on arctic vortices, where jet stream influences are weaker, in order to facilitate comparisons with earlier idealized numerical simulations. Results show that arctic cyclones are more numerous, persistent, and stronger than <b>arctic</b> <b>anticyclones.</b> An average of 15 cyclonic vortices and 11 anticyclonic vortices are observed per month, with maximum frequency of occurrence for cyclones (anticyclones) during winter (summer). There are are about 47 % more cyclones than anticyclones that survive at least 4 days, and for longer lifetimes, 1 -day survival probabilities are nearly constant at 65 % for cyclones, and 55 % for anticyclones. Mean tropopause potential-temperature amplitude is 13 K for cyclones and 11 K for anticyclones, with cyclones exhibiting a greater tail toward larger values. An analysis of close-proximity vortex pairs reveals divergence between cyclones and convergence be-tween anticyclones. This result agrees qualitatively with previous idealized numerical simulations, although it is unclear to what extent the divergent circulations regulate vortex asymmetries. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Beaufort Anticyclone is the {{dominate}} pressure feature {{over the}} Arctic Ocean in all seasons {{and has a}} large influence on the surface wind regime and sea-ice motion. Sea level pressure (SLP) from the NCAR/NCEP Reanalysis is {{used to create a}} vorticity metric to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Beaufort Anticyclone from 1948 - 2008. Vorticity averaged over the Beaufort Anticyclone region correlated with Northern Hemisphere SLP show areas of strongest relationship south of Alaska and north of Siberia. These two areas are also present in SLP composite maps created using the vorticity timeseries. The spatial characteristics are investigated further by creating a timeseries of rapid change events. SLP maps of these events reveal similar features south of Alaska and north of Siberia. Temporal characteristics are investigated using running means and spectral analysis, which show an annual cycle. Teleconnection patterns have been shown to have an influence over the <b>Arctic.</b> The Beaufort <b>Anticyclone</b> vorticity metric is correlated with teleconnection index values; the Pacific Ocean patterns show a larger influence than the Atlantic patterns, contrary to past studies that show the Arctic Oscillation as a main driver over the Arctic. A significant correlation is found with the Pacific North American pattern in all seasons except summer. The El Ni??o Southern Oscillation shows a significant correlation in winter, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation shows a significant correlation in winter and spring...|$|R
