The source emits radiation, which then interact with electrons in the material and lose energy and/or are redirected (scattered). Radiation that loses sufficient energy or is scattered away from the detector is not counted. The denser the material, the higher the probability of interaction and the lower the detector count.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} crabs within mangrove ecosystems, but tested methods of enumeration are virtually non-existent. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the accuracy of quick, non-invasive methods for estimating the population density of three species of mangrove crabs in East Africa: Uca annulipes, Sesarma guttatum and Neosarmatium meinerti. Methods employed depended on the behaviour and habitat of each species. Counts of U. annulipes and N. meinerti individuals that were active on the surface (visual counts) and burrow counts (of U. annulipes) were compared to <b>actual</b> <b>densities.</b> <b>Actual</b> <b>densities</b> were determined by excavation of U. annulipes, and by multiplying counts of N. meinerti burrows by the mean number of crabs per burrow. Visual counts of marked individuals of S. guttatum were compared to known densities of marked crabs. For N. meinerti two visual counting methods were tested: (1) instant counts - crabs were counted every 5 min during 0. 5 h and the highest count taken; and (2) continuous counts - all burrows were tagged, and those from which a crab emerged during 0. 5 h were totalled. For U. annulipes on Inhaca Island (Mozambique) visual counts underestimated excavated numbers by 27 %, whereas burrow counts overestimated numbers by 46 %. These values were similar for both sexes, and on both spring and neap tides. Burrow counts and visual counts estimated absolute numbers of U. annulipes with equal consistency. At Mida Creek (Kenya) visual counts underestimated U. annulipes numbers by 37 %, again with no differences between spring and neap tides. In Zanzibar 81 % of N. meinerti burrows contained a crab. The instant visual count underestimated N. meinerti numbers by 41 %, the continuous count, by 12 %. Visual counts of S. guttatum in Zanzibar (Tanzania) underestimated crab numbers by 49 %.

50|$|Indicated {{airspeed}} (IAS) is the airspeed read {{directly from}} the airspeed indicator (ASI) on an aircraft, driven by the pitot-static system. It uses the difference between total pressure and static pressure, provided by that system, to either mechanically or electronically measure dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure includes terms for both density and airspeed. Since the airspeed indicator cannot know density, it is by design calibrated to assume the sea level standard atmospheric density when calculating airspeed. Since the <b>actual</b> <b>density</b> will vary considerably from this assumed value as the aircraft changes altitude, IAS varies considerably from true airspeed (TAS), the relative velocity between the aircraft and the surrounding air mass.
