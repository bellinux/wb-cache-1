However, feeding {{seems to be}} essential to complete the entire molting process in larvae of Ucides cordatus (LINNAEUS, 1763). In order to verify the necessity of food and the efficiency of different diets on molting between initial zoea stages, five triplicate treatments with live food were employed in laboratory experiments: Thalassiosira weissflogii, Skeletonema costatum, Dunaliella viridis, Artemia sp. and Artemia sp. with Thalassiosira weissflogii (treatments: Tw; Sc, Dv, A e ATw, respectively). In all treatments, success in molting to zoea II stage was accomplished (17 %, 18. 3 %, 27 %, 58 %, and 80 % for Dv, A, Sc, Tw and ATw, respectively). Treatments with microalgae (T. weissflogii, 58 % and Artemia sp. with T. weissflogiiI, 80 %) were suitable to supply zoea larvae nutritional requirements showing to be an <b>adequated</b> source of food in this larval stage.

5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is <b>adequate.</b> This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the <b>adequate</b> replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
