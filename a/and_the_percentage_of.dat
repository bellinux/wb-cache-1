The Office for National Statistics estimated that during the period of April 2001 to March 2002, the average gross weekly income of households was £430 (£22,421 per year).|$|E
5|$|Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, {{meaning that}} they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to {{applications}} in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.|$|E

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 {{years for}} females, and 80.2 years for males. Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality {{is expected to}} decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country, and natural births account for {{a significant proportion of}} population growth. Consequently, the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger. By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%.

5|$|Overall, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was Paramount's fourth highest-grossing film of 2013, {{following}} new graphic {{novel and}} franchise entries: World War Z, Star Trek Into Darkness, and , respectively.

5|$|The Turks {{began to}} apply {{restrictions}} on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, {{in response to}} the start of the First Aliyah earlier that year. Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and notable classes, in 1901 the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman central government) gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914. At the same time, with growing distrust of the Young Turks – Turkish nationalists who had taken control of the Empire in 1908 – and the Second Aliyah, Arab nationalism was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic. Historians do not know whether these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.|$|E

Sélestat has {{a significant proportion of}} people between 15 and 44 (42.7%, compared to 38.9% for all of France) because it attracts a large number of young actives and couples starting a family. As other towns in the region, such as Saverne, Haguenau and Molsheim, it welcomes young adults and encourages them to settle in the surrounding villages.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E

40|$|Cytokines {{function}} at the cellular, microenvironmental level, but human cytokine assessment is most commonly {{done at the}} macro level, by measuring serum cytokines. The relationships between serum and cellular cytokines, if there are any, are undefined. In a study of hospitalized patients in Malawi, we compared cytometrically assessed, cell-specific cytokine data to serum interleukin 2 (IL- 2), IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels in 16 children and 71 (IL- 2, - 4, - 6, - 10) or 159 (IL- 8, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) adults, using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Pearson's (rp) and Spearman's (rs) rank correlations. For the entire study group, correlations between identical serum and cellular cytokines mainly involved IL- 8 and IFN-γ, were few, and were weakly positive (r < 0. 40). Blood culture-positive persons had <b>the</b> most <b>and</b> strongest correlations, including those between serum IL- 2 levels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> lymphocytes spontaneously making IL- 2 (rs = + 0. 74), serum IL- 8 levels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> lymphocytes spontaneously making IL- 8 (rp = + 0. 66), and serum IL- 10 levels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> CD 8 + T cells making TNF-α (rp = + 0. 89). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive persons had the next largest number of correlations, including several serum IL- 8 level correlations, correlation of serum IL- 10 levels with <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> lymphocytes producing induced IL- 10 (rs = + 0. 36), and correlation of serum IFN-γ levels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> lymphocytes spontaneously making both IL- 6 <b>and</b> IFN-γ in <b>the</b> same cell (rp = + 0. 59). HIV-negative, malaria smear-positive, and pediatric patients had few significant correlations; for <b>the</b> second <b>and</b> third of these subgroups, serum IL- 8 level was correlated with <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> CD 8 − T cells producing induced IL- 8 (rs = + 0. 40 and rs = + 0. 56, respectively). Thus, the strength of associations between serum and cellular cytokines varied with {{the presence or absence}} of bloodstream infection, HIV status, and perhaps other factors we did not assess. These results strongly suggest that serum cytokines at best only weakly reflect peripheral blood cell cytokine production and balances...|$|R
40|$|Flow cytometric {{studies suggest}} that {{platelets}} are activated in ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
