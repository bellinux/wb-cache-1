Knee disarticulation which leaves the femur and patella untouched offers many advantages. The surgical technique is simple and non-traumatic since no bone or muscle tissue is to be dissected. The thigh muscles are completely preserved and thus there is no muscular imbalance. The stump permits total end bearing and its bulbous shape permits easy and firm attachment of the prosthesis.

5000|$|The first {{microprocessor-controlled}} prosthetic knees {{became available}} in the early 1990s. The Intelligent Prosthesis was the first commercially available microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee. It was released by Chas. A.

[...] An improved version was released in 1995 by the name Intelligent Prosthesis Plus. Blatchford released another prosthesis, the Adaptive Prosthesis, in 1998. The Adaptive Prosthesis utilized hydraulic controls, pneumatic controls, and a microprocessor to provide the amputee with a gait that was more responsive to changes in walking speed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the knee component of <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> greatly affects the gait of the user. Recently, the intelligent knee joint that can adapt itself to the change of walking speed has been developed. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> that is able to be automatically adapted to various gates by using simple and passive control units at the knee joint. In this paper, control of the knee joint in swing phase of the gate cycle is analytically investigated by using a simplified dynamic model of a lower limb. As the result, it was clarified that the control of viscosity of the knee was more effective to change the pace than the control of inertia of the shank and the friction force.

40|$|We {{quantify}} how the hip energetics {{and knee}} torque required for an <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> user {{to walk with}} the kinematics of able-bodied humans vary with the inertial properties of the prosthesis. We also select and optimize passive mechanical components for a prosthetic knee to accurately reproduce the required knee torque. Previous theoretical studies have typically investigated the effects of prosthesis inertial properties on energetic parameters by modifying both mass and mass distribution of the prosthesis and computing kinetic and energetic parameters only during swing. Using inverse dynamics, we determined the effects of independently modifying mass and mass distribution of the prosthesis, and we computed parameters during both stance and swing. Results showed that reducing prosthesis mass significantly affected hip energetics, whereas reducing mass distribution did not. Reducing prosthesis mass to 25 % {{of the mass of}} a physiological leg decreased peak stance hip power by 26 %, average swing hip power by 74 %, and absolute hip work over the gait cycle by 22 %. Previous studies have also typically optimized prosthetic knee components to reproduce the knee torque generated by able-bodied humans walking with normative kinematics. However, because the prosthetic leg of an <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> user weighs significantly less than a physiological leg, the knee torque required for <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> users to walk with these kinematics may be significantly different. Again using inverse dynamics, it was found that changes in prosthesis mass and mass distribution significantly affected this required torque. Reducing the mass of the prosthesis to 25 % of the mass of the physiological leg increased peak stance torque by 43 % and decreased peak swing torque by 76 %. The knee power required for an <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> user to walk with the kinematics of able-bodied humans was analyzed to select passive mechanical components for the prosthetic knee. The coefficients of the components were then optimized to replicate the torque required to walk with the kinematics of able-bodied humans. A prosthetic knee containing a single linear spring and two constant-force dampers was found to accurately replicate the targeted torque (R[superscript 2]= 0. 90 for a typical prosthesis). Optimal spring coefficients were found to be relatively insensitive to mass alterations of the prosthetic leg, but optimal damping coefficients were sensitive. In particular, as the masses of the segments of the prosthetic leg were altered between 25 % and 100 % of able-bodied values, the optimal damping coefficient of the second damper varied by 330 %, with foot mass alterations having the greatest effect on its value.

40|$|Conventional <b>above-knee</b> <b>prostheses</b> {{are unable}} to replace normal leg {{function}} {{due to the lack}} of adaptive control. Computer-controlled prostheses offer the possibility to implement such adaptive control. For a particular locomotion mode, control algorithms can generate appropriate damping profiles as a function of selected sensory inputs and stored information on normal walking. However, it is essential in such systems that the locomotor modes can be determined accurately from the inputs of the control system. Recognition of the intent to change from one mode to another is also a necessity because the control system has to account for such transitions. The possibility of using EMG signals from hip muscles and muscle residuals of the stump for this purpose is investigated. The modes tested are level walking, ramp ascent and ramp descent with slopes of 6 degrees and 9 degrees. EMG activity curves for three muscles: gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae, are presented for the different modes. The results are obtained from two reference groups of 12 normal individuals and from a prosthetic patient. The results show the possibility of discriminating between modes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyse the flexion angles of the ski boot, ankle and knee joints of an <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and to compare them with an intact leg and a control group of skiers. One subject with an above-knee {{amputation}} of the right leg and eight healthy subjects simulated the movement of a skiing turn by performing two-leg squats in laboratory conditions. By adding additional loads in proportion to body weight (BW; + 1 / 3 BW, + 2 / 3 BW, + 3 / 3 BW), various skiing regimes were simulated. Change of Flexion Angle (CoFA) and Range of Motion (RoM) in the ski boot, ankle and knee joints were calculated and compared. An average RoM in the skiing boot on the side of prosthesis (4. 4 ± 1. 1 °) was significantly lower compared to an intact leg (5. 9 ± 1. 8 °) and the control group (6. 5 ± 2. 3 °). In the ankle joint, the average RoM was determined to be 13. 2 ± 2. 9 ° in the prosthesis, 12. 7 ± 2. 8 ° in an intact leg and 14. 8 ± 3. 6 in the control group. However, the RoM of the knee joint in the prosthesis (42. 2 ± 4. 2 °) was significantly larger than that of the intact leg (34. 7 ± 4. 4 °). The average RoM of the knee joint in the control group was 47. 8 ± 5. 4 °. The influences of additional loads on the kinematics of the lower extremities were different on the side of the prosthesis and on the intact leg.

40|$|The {{shortcomings}} of conventional <b>above-knee</b> <b>prostheses</b> {{are due to}} their lack of adaptive control. Implementation of a microcomputer controlling the knee joint in a passive way has been suggested to enhance the patient's gait comfort, safety and cosmesis. This approach {{was used in the}} design of a new prosthetic system for the above-knee amputee, and tested on one patient. The knee joint of a conventional, modular prosthesis was replaced by a knee joint mechanism, equipped with a controllable brake on the knee joint axis. Sensors and a microcomputer were added, keeping the system self-contained. The modularity of the design permits the use of an alternative, external, PC-based control unit, emulating the self-contained one, and offering extended data monitoring and storage facilities. For both units an operating environment was written, including sensor/actuator interfacing and the implementation of a real-time interrupt, executing the control algorithm. A double finite state approach was used {{in the design of the}} control algorithm. On a higher level, the mode identification algorithm reveals the patient's intent. Within a specific mode (lower level), the relevant mode control algorithm looks for the current phase within the gait cycle. Within a particular phase, a specific simple control action with the brake replaces normal knee muscle activity. Tests were carried out with one prosthetic patient using a basic control algorithm for level walking, allowing controlled knee flexion during stance phase. The technical feasibility of such a concept is illustrated by the test results, even though only flexion during early stance phase was controlled during the trials.

Various types of components {{have been designed to}} compensate their performance. Among various prosthetic components, the knee joint has great influence on the function. Two types of knee joints (3 R 15, 3 R 20) have been used broadly for <b>above-knee</b> <b>prostheses.</b> However, there is not enough research to highlight the influence of these joints on the gait {{performance of}} the subjects.

The walking speed of the subjects with 3 R 20 was 66. 7 m/min compared to 30. 4 m/min (P-value = 0. 045).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: There are {{excellent}} arguments {{in favor of}} the preferential use of prosthetic grafts above the knee for the treatment of infrainguinal occlusive disease. This approach has been popularized {{on the basis of the}} seemingly acceptable results when using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). However, in many centers, knitted Dacron polyester has been used in these patients, and there are several studies that show equivalent and, in some, superior results with Dacron when compared with PTFE. The purpose of this study was to examine these results in a definitive way. Methods: A randomized prospective trial in eight clinical academic centers in the United States and Canada was initiated in 1991. Two hundred forty-four patients eligible for such a study, by virtue of criteria extant in each institution at the time, were centrally randomized. They underwent placement of either a knitted Dacron polyester graft impregnated with collagen or a thin-wall expanded reenforced PTFE graft to the above-knee popliteal artery, usually from the common femoral artery. They were frequently observed by protocol for as long as 5 years by a physical examination noninvasive hemodynamic study, including duplex scanning in many instances. Continuing patency was noted, as were other potential adverse outcome events. The data were analyzed by the log-rank test for cumulative patency and expressed as Kaplan-Meier curves. Data were further analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: There were no differences in graft groups in demographic or comorbid factors. The procedural mortality rate was zero, and the morbidity rate was low (6. 5 %). The long-term patient survival rate was excellent (77 % at 3 years). At the end of these years, no statistical significance in primary or secondary patency rates was observed between the two grafts (primary patency rate, 62 % ± 14. 4 % for Dacron; 57 % ± 15. 5 % for PTFE). No unexpected adverse outcomes on limb status were noted. Patency rates in both graft groups were inferior in patients who received small grafts (5 to 6 mm vs 7 to 8 mm; hazards ratio, 4. 15) and younger (< 65 years) smoking patients. Conclusions: The fact that these two prosthetic grafts performed in equivalent fashion in a controlled, well-conducted prospective study is not surprising in spite of the previous work that suggested differences. If the preferential use of synthetic bypass grafts above the knee is to be used, it should be restricted to older nonsmokers with favorable anatomy. In that instance, the choice of graft material will depend on handling characteristics and cost. <b>Above-knee</b> <b>prostheses</b> should be only selectively used in younger, smoking patients, and graft size should be carefully considered in patients who undergo this operation.

Based on the models, control parameters that govern damping force and displacement of the dampers are identified. Parameters of the dampers are determined through optimization that minimizes the error between the prosthesis knee angle trajectories and a desired knee angle trajectory for normal level ground walking from experimental data. Experimental data of thigh and hip motions are introduced as inputs into a dynamic system to determine sets of control parameters. Furthermore, input thigh motion is also deviated to evaluate robustness of the controllers in real application. Comparison of the desired knee angle trajectory {{with those of the}} knee angle trajectories obtained from control parameters is done with respect to maximum achievable knee flexion angle, duration of swing phase, shank velocity at the end of swing phase and mean angle difference. Evaluation results of the dampers show a better competence of MR damper over hydraulic damper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Since {{the time}} of Descartes the machine-like control of {{movement}} in animals and the animal-like control of movement in automata has fascinated and inspired scientists, engineers and philosophers alike. In 1966, Drs. Rajko Tomović and Robert McGhee proposed {{the concept of a}} “cybernetic actuator, ” a new type of control system which “possesses the property of producing continuous controlled motion from an input which may assume only four distinct states ” [1]. The specific application at the time was an artificial limb prosthesis. Signals from sensors monitoring joint angle and ground contact were to be continuously compared to a set of threshold values corresponding to specific moments in the step cycle. The binary signals (above or below threshold) were listed in a look-up chart which associated sensory combinations with actuator states. It was proposed that this system would provide all of the known state transitions required of an <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> In this and later papers Tomović was careful to point out the differences between such “artificial reflex control ” systems and neural control systems in animals [2]. Nonetheless {{in the last few years}} it has become commonplace to see the control of locomotion and other rhythmical behaviors described in terms of “sensory rules, ” that is in terms of finite state systems. With the advent of neural nets and fuzzy logic control, robotic devices are taking on more and more of the features of biological control systems. In turn, neurophysiologists borrow more and more from the concepts and mechanisms of modern control theory. The influence of Tomovic’s simple but powerful idea continues to spread.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was used to}} investigate the dynamic behaviour of an <b>above-knee</b> (AK) <b>prosthesis</b> in the swing phase and to analyse the influence of mass and mass distribution on the maximal stump load and the required energy. The model consists of a bondgraph model of the prosthesis and a “walking” model which predicts the walking velocity, step length and the femoral trajectory. Equipment was developed to measure the inertial properties {{of the components of}} the prosthesis. Through computer simulation, stickdiagrams of the swing phase and graphs of the variation with time of the hip and stump forces were obtained. It was found that for a normal AK prosthesis with a knee-lock mechanism the axial stump load is greatest at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the swing phase. At a walking velocity of 5 km/hr the maximum axial stump load amounts to 2. 1 times the static weight of the prosthesis. The maximum axial stump force appeared to be almost directly proportional to the total mass of the prosthesis but independent of the mass distribution. The required energy also increased with the mass of the prosthesis but is' dependent on mass distribution. Because of their comparable weights the influence of the shoe is almost equal to the influence of the prosthetic foot. Thus lightweight shoes should be used with lightweight prosthetic feet in order to add to their advantages...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanically}} controlled prosthesis {{is designed}} and developed {{to enhance the}} controllability of the conventional passive type prosthesis within an affordable price. Unlike to the typical mechanical prosthesis, the new design has made the prosthesis to follow the residual limb movements without having any intricate guiding arrangement. A gear based knee joint has made the prosthesis to move according to the residual limb movement. A spring based ankle joint, on the other hand, helped the amputee to overcome the difficulties in producing required flexion and extension in their prosthetic feet. It also expedited the energy storing and returning quality of the prosthetic ankle. A torsion spring has enabled the ankle joint to rotate in a controlled way to any desired angle without demanding any additional setup. The gear based knee joint is designed to improve the performance of mechanical type <b>above-knee</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The gear set with some bracing, and bracket arrangement is used to enable the prosthesis to follow the residual limb movement. The proposed design of the ankle joint would enable the mechanical type ankle joint to overcome the limitation of stability, flexion and extension within an affordable price. This would enhance the range of motion of the mechanical type prosthesis without incorporating any expensive electronic devices into the ankle joint. Unlike the typical mechanical prosthesis, the new design would allow the prosthesis to bend forward and backward to any desired angle with enough stability. The pattern of the prosthetic gait cycle shows that the spring based ankle joint could imitate {{the movement of the}} prosthesis closely to the biological limb. The motion analysis and finite-element analysis (FEA) of knee joint and ankle joints components were carried out to assess the feasibility of the design. The FEA results were then compared with the real data obtained from the healthy subject. Stability analysis under disturbance and gait analysis during walking with the prosthesis was carried out to test the performance of the prosthesis. According to the simulation results, the patterns of kinematic and kinetic parameters profiles have shown a great resemblance with that of the gait cycle of a healthy biological limb. The factor of safety obtained from the stress analysis results of FEA was 3. 5 and 4. 9 for knee joint and ankle joint components respectively, which indicated to no possibility of design failure. From the performance analysis results, though the exact shape and amplitude of the motion analysis results were deviated 0. 5 to 14 times than the healthy gait cycle data, the trend of the curves were still in good agreement. At dynamic platform setting, the overall postural stability was found to improve by 3. 3 to 5 times, and fall risk was observed to increase by 1. 2 to 3. 3 times while using prosthesis; whereas at static platform setting, the postural stability and fall risk performances were found to decline by 1. 3 times and by 1. 8 times respectively. Finally, the cost of quasi-active type above knee prosthesis designed for a lower limb amputee was found considerably cheap and thus affordable for mass proportion of amputee...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two years there has been im petus towards the use of the {{flexible}} socket in terface in above knee prosthetics. For our pur poses here, it is widely accepted that the flex ible socket is of multiple benefit to the patient. We will concentrate on discussing the different systems available. The history of flexible sockets dates back a number of years. The article by Charles Pri-tham, C. P. O., et. al. "Experience with the Scandinavian Flexible Socket " 1 0 provides a concise summary of this train of development. At the present time, there are numerous flex ible socket systems being used in the United States and throughout the world. These sockets differ in design in two major areas: flexible socket interface and the outer hard socket. The flexible socket is currently being used with three types of support mechanisms: 1. Total hard socket as the support 2. Hard socket with strategic fenestrations 3. True frame design The prosthesis discussed by R. Volkert in the article, "Frame type Socket for Lower Limb Prosthesis" 1 2 is constructed with a frame outer socket and an elastic stocking interface. This system can accommodate stump volume changes, therefore, it appears to be most useful with early amputees. The TC Couple Socket 6 <b>above-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> used a polyethylene flexible inter face and an external polypropylene socket. There are no fenestrations in the outer socket, so it doesn't have some of the benefits of sen sory feedback as a fenestrated outer socket would. The advantage of this system is its light weight polypropylene outer socket. Work done at the Institute of Rehabilitatio...|$|E
