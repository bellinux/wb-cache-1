5|$|Well-known {{species such}} as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, {{thresher}} shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators—organisms {{at the top of}} their underwater food chain. Many shark populations <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> human activities.|$|E
5|$|Death Valley National Park is {{a popular}} {{location}} for stargazing as it {{has one of the}} darkest night skies in the United States. Despite its remote location, air quality and night visibility <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> civilization. In particular, light pollution is introduced by nearby Las Vegas. The darkest skies are, in general, located in the northwest of the park.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids have {{breeding}} {{populations of}} over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited {{several species of}} fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat degradation. It {{requires}} open {{habitat for}} germination, but {{this kind of}} habitat <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced flora. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced grazing animals.|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{firewood}} harvesting, {{which has}} caused habitat destruction in the area. It may also <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> mining operations.|$|R
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat. In New Mexico it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{oil and gas}} development and {{the changes that have}} occurred on the land due to overgrazing, such as erosion and introduced species of plants. In Texas, the plant grows on roadsides and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> roadway maintenance.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} storm petrel <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> human activities. One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel, {{is thought to}} have gone extinct. The {{principal}} threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators like rats and feral cats.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{deforestation}} and {{the wildlife}} trade, {{which includes the}} exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced species. The Guadalupe storm petrel was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E
25|$|In Utah, its habitat <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{commercial}} development, {{whereas the}} Grand Canyon population <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam which can sweep the snail and its habitat downstream.|$|R
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> livestock, which {{relish the}} semi-succulent leaves. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{recreational}} {{activity in the}} habitat.|$|R
50|$|Schizolaena parviflora <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{deforestation}} due to shifting {{patterns of}} agriculture. The species <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> timber harvesting and wildfires.|$|R
5|$|The Southern California DPS, {{which was}} listed as {{endangered}} in 2011, has been affected by habitat loss due to dams, confinement of streams in concrete channels, water pollution, groundwater pumping, urban heat island effects, and other byproducts of urbanization. Steelhead in the Kamchatka Peninsula <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> over-harvest, particularly from poaching and potential development, and {{are listed in the}} Red Data Book of Russia that documents rare and endangered species.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. The rise {{in demand for}} shark products increases pressure on fisheries. Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual. A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara Sphenodon punctatus {{has been}} {{protected}} by law since 1895. A second species, S. guntheri, was recognised in 1989 but since 2009 {{it has been}} reclassified as a subspecies. Tuatara, like many of New Zealand's native animals, <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss and introduced predators, such as the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). They were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32offshore islands, until the first mainland release into the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Sanctuary in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat, mainly {{due to the}} presence of feral pigs and non-native plants. Some of the plant's habitat is on military territory and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> military activity.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> overexploitation.|$|R
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss. This species {{is listed as}} Near Threatened because it occupies a small range, in which it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> hunting and limited habitat loss and degradation.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range.|$|E
5|$|While a small {{minority}} of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity. Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi. Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species, but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic. One species of roach, Simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|While {{some species}} of procellariid have populations that {{number in the}} millions, many species are much less common and several are {{threatened}} with extinction. Human activities have caused dramatic declines {{in the numbers of}} some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the IUCN 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered. Procellariids <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced species on their breeding grounds, marine fisheries, pollution, exploitation and possibly by climate change.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat destruction.|$|R
50|$|Water quality <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> development.|$|R
50|$|Troides darsius <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> deforestation.|$|R
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss}} of old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} inhabits rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{granitic}} gneiss rocks {{throughout the}} entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and the dunes form rich ecosystems, but <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports. Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of Póvoa de Varzim, where fishing activities occur. Alive or dead discarded fish while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city's waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships or fishing boats can explain these events.|$|E
50|$|This rare plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{wildfire}} suppression; {{it would}} be more common if its habitat were allowed its natural fire regime. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> mining operations.|$|R
50|$|A. daryi <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> urban sprawl.|$|R
50|$|A. marchi <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss.|$|R
5|$|The {{species are}} native to meadows and woods in {{southern}} Europe and North Africa with {{a center of}} diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> increasing urbanisation and tourism.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
