40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} flight tests of aircraft control system SPS- 1. The described control {{system has been}} created as a system improving <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>handling</b> qualities. During tests several control algorithms were tested. Pilots rated <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>handling</b> qualities and were ordered to point control system they liked the most. Additionally original methodology allowing to rate and compare <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>handling</b> qualities was tested. It used pilot’s workload factor and control’s precision to rate <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>handling</b> qualities. Key words: handling qualities, control system, aviation. 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to get acquainted with the ways how to improve the safety {{management}} system during cargo <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling.</b> The first chapter is dedicated to general information about air cargo transportation. This includes the history or types of cargo <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling,</b> but also the means of handling. The second part is focused on detailed description of cargo <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling,</b> including a description of activities that are performed before and after handling. The following part of this paper covers a theoretical interpretation of safety, safety indicators and legislative provisions related to the safety of cargo <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling.</b> The fourth part of this paper analyzes the fault trees of events which might occur during handling. The factors found by this analysis are compared with safety reports of FedEx. Based on the comparison, there is a proposal on how to improve the safety management in this transportation company...|$|R

50|$|An Aircraft Handler is {{a member}} of the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Handling</b> branch in the Royal Navy of the UK Armed Forces. Aircraft Handlers are {{responsible}} for the safe movement, launching (taking off) and recovering (landing) of all aircraft onboard ships within the Royal Navy and some of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. They are also responsible for aircraft crash rescue fire fighting duties on board Royal Navy ships and at Royal Naval Air Stations. The <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Handling</b> branch of the Fleet Air Arm in the Royal Navy was formed in 1945. Beforehand the duties of Aircraft Handlers were performed by members of other branches of the Royal Navy, many of whom transferred to the new branch upon its formation.|$|R
