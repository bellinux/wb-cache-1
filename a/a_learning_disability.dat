25|$|Due to {{impaired}} balance, patients {{suffering from}} ataxic cerebral palsy often walk {{with their feet}} unusually far apart (a wide gait).

25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{individuals}} with autism regarding learning {{is in the}} imitation of skills. This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills. Individuals with autism tend {{to be dependent on}} the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge. As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.|$|E
25|$|Amusia has {{recently}} been classified as <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> that affects musical abilities. Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques.

Research {{has been shown that}} amusia may be related to an increase in size of the cerebral cortex, which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and epilepsy are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.|$|E

25|$|In April 1997, he {{committed}} {{to play at}} UCLA, where {{he was expected to}} team with fellow incoming freshman Baron Davis, another top recruit from Los Angeles, who signed days later. Cotton's admission was contingent on earning a qualifying score on the SAT, which he had not received in two attempts. On his third try, he scored 900, which surpassed the NCAA minimum of 700 for incoming freshman, but the NCAA invalidated his score. Cotton had been diagnosed with <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> auditory learning, in which he comprehended better by listening than by seeing. The Educational Testing Service (ETS), which publishes and oversees the SAT, confirmed the diagnosis, and allowed him to take the test with extra time and larger font text. The NCAA, however, had stricter criteria than the ETS, and disagreed that he was entitled to take the non-standard test. Cotton denied any wrongdoing, and felt he was being targeted by the NCAA. Earlier, the NCAA had investigated a Ford sport-utility vehicle driven by Cotton, which they suspected was provided to him as an incentive to sign with UCLA. However, the NCAA absolved him of violating his amateur status based on documents provided by his parents.|$|E
25|$|Martha Nussbaum {{discusses}} how {{education is}} one of the fertile functions that is important {{for the development of a}} person and their ability to achieve a multitude of other capabilities within society. Autism causes many symptoms that interfere with a child’s ability to receive a proper education such as deficits in imitation, observational learning, and receptive and expressive communication. Of all disabilities affecting the population, autism ranks third lowest in acceptance into a postsecondary education institution. In a study funded by the National Institute of Health, Shattuck et al. found that only 35% of autistics are enrolled in a 2 or 4 year college within the first two years after leaving high school compared to 40% of children who have <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability.</b> Due to the growing need for a college education to obtain a job, this statistic shows how autistics are at a disadvantage in gaining many of the capabilities that Nussbaum discusses and makes education more than just a type of therapy for those with autism. According to the study by Shattuck, only 55% of children with autism participated in any paid employment within the first two years after high school. Furthermore, those with autism that come from low income families tend to have lower success in postsecondary schooling. Due to these issues, education has become more than just an issue of therapy for those with autism but also a social issue.|$|E
