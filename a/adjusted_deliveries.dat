However, it is not clear whether similar effects of epidural analgesia on the progression of labor, modes of delivery, and perinatal outcomes exist between nulliparous and multiparous women. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze all deliveries after 37 weeks of gestation, with the exclusion of pregnancies complicated by multiple gestations and fetal anomalies and deliveries without trials of labor; these criteria produced a study population of n= 16, 852. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to control for confounders. In total, 7260 of 10, 175 (71. 4 %) nulliparous and 2987 of 6677 (44. 7 %) multiparous parturients were administered epidural analgesia. The independent factors for intrapartum epidural analgesia included a low prepregnancy body mass index, genetic amniocentesis, group B streptococcal colonization of the genito-rectal tract, and augmentation and induction of labor. In the nulliparous women, epidural analgesia was a significant risk factor for operative vaginal <b>delivery</b> (<b>adjusted</b> odds ratio [OR] 2. 14, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 80 - 2. 54); however, it was a protective factor against Caesarean <b>delivery</b> (<b>adjusted</b> OR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 69).

50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan blade pitch adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by <b>adjusting</b> fuel <b>delivery</b> to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive torque), select takeoff (coarse) pitch, feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|R

40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore and {{describe}} patients’ and healthcare providers’ experiences of the causes, management and interaction {{in the care of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Method: The thesis is based on four studies. Studies I and II contain data from an epidemiologic project involving patients who were recently diagnosed with RA. The patients answered an open-ended question about their conception of the cause of their RA (Study I). Qualitative data from 38 patients were analysed using the phenomenographic approach in order to identify variation in conceptions. The results of Study I formed the basis for categorizing the conceptions of 785 patients in the search for patterns of background factors (Study II). Study III aimed to explore how patients experienced their management of RA in everyday life. Data were collected by interviews with 16 patients and analysed according to Grounded Theory (GT). In study IV, the aim was to explore healthcare providers’ experiences of their interaction with patients’ management of RA. Data were collected by interviews with 18 providers representing different professions and analysed using GT. Findings:  Patients’ conceptions of the cause of their RA revealed new aspects from the patient perspective that can complement pathogenetic models. Two descriptive categories emerged: consequences beyond personal control and overloaded circumstances, which included six categories of conceptions (Study I). The most common conceptions of the cause of RA were unexpected effects of events followed by work and family-related stress (Study II). Background factors that influenced the conceptions of the cause were age, sex and educational level. Patient management of RA involved using personal resources together with grasping for support from others in their striving for a good life. When linking these aspects together, four ways of management emerged: mastering, struggling, relying and being resigned (Study III). Healthcare providers’ experiences of their interaction with patients’ management shed light upon the important issue of delivering knowledge and advice. The providers’ attitudes constituted one cornerstone and patients’ responses the other. The providers reported that the interaction led to different outcomes: completed <b>delivery,</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>delivery</b> and failed delivery. Conclusions: The findings contribute new knowledge from both patients’ and healthcare providers’ perspectives, which could be used to develop a more person-centred approach in rheumatology care. Person-centred care involves taking patients’ beliefs and values into account in addition to creating a trusting relationship between patient and provider. A successful person-centred approach requires an organisation that supports the person-centred framework...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Higher Education Leadership)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. Adult {{learners}} {{are returning}} to higher education to pursue their higher education aspirations in increasing numbers (Pusser et al., 2007). For many adult learners, the pursuit of their educational aspirations {{is just one of}} several activities that compete for their time. Families, jobs, hobbies, friends and other obligations place burdens on the time and resources of adult learners and often create conflicting demands. Even with the realization that a higher education degree is frequently a good investment, many adult learners can lose sight of this goal. To accommodate and increase the persistence to graduation of this growing group of nontraditional learners, institutions of higher learning need to evaluate their approaches to support and invest in structured, systematic approaches to supporting this significant body of students (Engstrom & Tinto, 2008). The degree to which students believe they matter to someone else (whether right or wrong) and that others care about them and appreciate them is referred to as ???Mattering??? (Schlossberg et al., 1989). The literature has shown that incrementally <b>adjusting</b> the <b>delivery</b> and accessibility of services to improve the perception of mattering for adult services may positively affect retention and persistence to graduation. There are two main research questions addressed in this study: 1. 	What is the perception of availability of student support services by adult students at Sacramento State? 2. 	What is the perception of mattering by adult students at Sacramento State? Methodology The sample for this study consisted of 75 respondents from a pool of 400 students who were randomly selected adult undergraduate students over the age of 25 attending classes full-time at Sacramento State. A quantitative method of study was utilized using a digital survey instrument. The survey instrument contained questions from the Mattering in Higher Education (MHE) survey and was administered with permission from the Office of the Vice President for Center for Lifelong Learning, American Council on Education. The goal of this nationally-normed survey instrument was to measure the perception of mattering for adult students at Sacramento State with the hope that {{the results of the study}} would provide the university with information that can be used to improve the retention and persistence of adult students. Conclusions and Recommendations Studies have shown that students who feel they are cared about and connected to a campus have higher retention (Astin, 1993). If the student perceives a sense of connection or significance, this student will have a higher rank in mattering. If the perceptions are those of disconnection or insignificance, the sense of marginality exists (Schlossberg, 1989). After analyzing the data, the participants of this study perceived that they did not matter in two of five dimensions to Sacramento State as a function of the services and service availability. The lack of accessible student services may unfortunately send the message to typical adult students that their support needs are not as important or that they do not matter to Sacramento State. Although the focus of this study is not on retention, a summary of Tinto???s (1975) principles of effective retention provides a framework for understanding the role institutions play in helping students succeed. Adult student persistence will benefit from universities that consider their administrative, academic, and financial interactions. Schlossberg (1989) wrote that institutions that focus on mattering and greater student involvement will be more successful in creating campuses where students are motivated to learn, where their retention is high, and ultimately, where their institutional loyalty for the short- and long-term is ensured. Sacramento State University has the opportunity and the duty to consider its adult learners??? perception of mattering. Reflecting on these perceptions and conducting a review of the services that affect the adult learners??? perception of mattering will position Sacramento State to <b>adjust</b> <b>delivery</b> and accessibility of critical support services.

Students felt that two things were vital for a good lecture: (1) that the lecturer goes beyond what is written in the lecture notes; (2) that the lecture is interactive, by which students meant that the lecturer asks if students understand concepts and <b>adjusts</b> the <b>delivery</b> accordingly, and also the lecturer answers the students' questions. The students in the focus groups also discussed what makes for a bad lectures: (1) lecturers reading straight from slides; (2) lecturers who 'blame the students', by saying that students don't work hard enough and are too lazy to turn up to lectures; and (3) lecturers who cover the material too slowly or too quickly. The most prominent reason given for not attending lectures was the timetabling of lectures {{in such a way}} that students had too few classes in one day to make the sojourn to university worthwhile. Any university seeking to improve attendance at lectures should perhaps look as much to improving its timetabling practices as it does to improving the practices of its individual lecturers. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVETo {{define the}} frequency, risk factors, and {{outcomes}} of massive transfusion in obstetrics. METHODSThe State Inpatient Dataset for New York (199822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2007) {{was used to}} identify all delivery hospitalizations for hospitals that reported at least one delivery-related transfusion per year. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed {{to examine the relationship}} between maternal age, race, and relevant clinical variables and the risk of massive blood transfusion defined as 10 or more units of blood recorded. RESULTSMassive blood transfusion complicated 6 of every 10, 000 deliveries with cases observed even in the smallest facilities. Risk factors with the strongest independent associations with massive blood transfusion included abnormal placentation (1. 6 / 10, 000 <b>deliveries,</b> <b>adjusted</b> odds ratio [OR] 18. 5, 95...|$|R
5000|$|Uzbekistan dominates {{southern}} Kyrgyzstan both {{economically and}} politically, {{based on the}} large Uzbek population in that region of Kyrgyzstan and on economic and geographic conditions. Much of Kyrgyzstan depends entirely on Uzbekistan for natural gas; on several occasions, Karimov has achieved political ends by shutting pipelines or by <b>adjusting</b> terms of <b>delivery.</b> [...] In a number of television appearances broadcast in the Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces of Kyrgyzstan, Karimov has addressed Akayev with considerable condescension; Akayev, in turn, has been highly deferential to his much stronger neighbor. Although Uzbekistan has not shown overt expansionist tendencies, the Kyrgyz government is {{acutely aware of the}} implications of Karimov's assertions that he is responsible for the well-being of all Uzbeks, regardless of their nation of residence.|$|R
