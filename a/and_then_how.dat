25|$|Fitzsimmons {{spent the}} next two years {{fighting}} non-title bouts and exhibitions until giving Hall a chance at the title in 1893. He retained the crown by a knockout in round four. He spent the rest of that year doing exhibitions, and on 2 June, he had scheduled a two-way exhibition where he would demonstrate in public how to hit the boxing bag <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>how</b> to box against a real opponent. Reportedly, two freak accidents happened that day: Fitzsimmons hit the bag so hard that it broke, and then his opponent of that day allegedly slipped, getting hit in the head and the boxing exhibition was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>how</b> to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement.

They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering. Grohl {{said it was}} done that way because he felt digital recording {{was getting out of}} control: [...] "when I listen to music these days, and I hear Pro Tools and drums that sound like a machine- it kinda sucks the life out of music." [...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>how</b> someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E
2500|$|History is {{the unifying}} {{conceptual}} framework, because {{history is the}} study of everything that has occurred before the present. [...] A skillful teacher also uses the historical context to show how each stage of development naturally poses questions <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>how</b> advances answer them, helping to understand human motives and activity in each field. [...] The question-answer approach is called the [...] "dialectic method," [...] and permits history to be taught Socratically as well.|$|E

2500|$|For the score, Giacchino felt no {{pressure}} to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and [...] "in fact they {{encouraged me to}} go in my direction, so there were never any handcuffs put on me." [...] In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key [...] "was getting inside of him—not worrying {{so much about the}} magic stuff, more just thinking about who he was as a person, what he lost <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>how</b> that loss affected him. For me it's a very sad story, {{and a lot of the}} music has this very melancholy feel to it." [...] To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a [...] "mystical mood", Giacchino used a harpsichord and an electric sitar.|$|E
2500|$|As explained, REBT is a {{therapeutic}} system of both theory and practices; generally {{one of the}} goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to [...] "un-upset" [...] themselves <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>how</b> to empower themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.|$|E
2500|$|The American Teaching System is one {{learning}} {{method for}} competitors {{with cerebral palsy}} in this classification. Skiers first learn about their equipment, and {{how to put it}} on, before learning how to position their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>how</b> to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. [...] This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns. Skiers with cerebral palsy in this classification have difficulty walking in ski boots, and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. To go up hill, skiers often point their weaker side upwards.|$|E
