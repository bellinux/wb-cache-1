5|$|Because {{species of}} aetosaurs {{typically}} have restricted fossil ranges and <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> in the strata {{they are found}} in, they are useful in biochronology. Osteoderms {{are the most common}} remains associated with aetosaurs, so a single identifiable scute can accurately date the layer it is found in.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of dugong {{predation}} {{was identified}} {{in one study}} that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks. To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks <b>are</b> <b>abundant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Field {{observations}} {{suggest that}} the mushroom associates mycorrhizally with the plant Castanopsis fissa, a deciduous tree found only in the southern provinces of China, such as Guangdong, Yunnan and Hunan.

5|$|On the {{submarine}} {{portion of the}} island, many marine species are found. Starfish <b>are</b> <b>abundant,</b> as are sea urchins and limpets. The rocks are covered in algae, and seaweed covers much of {{the submarine}} slopes of the volcano, with its densest cover between 10 and 20metres (33 to 66ft) below sea level.|$|E
5|$|Several {{colorful}} oxides of manganese, {{for example}} manganese dioxide, <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> in nature {{have been used}} as pigments since the Stone Age. The cave paintings in Gargas that are 30,000 to 24,000 years old contain manganese pigments.|$|E
5|$|Sheep graze the island’s rough {{pastures}} {{and there is}} a population of rabbits, introduced by shepherds after the 1912 evacuation.

5|$|The east {{district}} of Gyeongju, Gampo-eup town, is {{adjacent to the}} sea, so fresh seafood and jeotgal (fermented salted seafood) <b>are</b> <b>abundant.</b> There are over 240 seafood restaurants in Gampo Harbor offering various dishes made with seafood caught in the sea, such as hoe (raw fish dishes), jeonboktang (an abalone soup), grilled seafood and others.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their {{armoured}} plates are often preserved and <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, {{the presence of}} particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they <b>are</b> <b>abundant.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> {{throughout}} the world and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found {{throughout the}} continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.|$|E
5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the red fox. The red fox will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals <b>are</b> <b>abundant.</b> Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E

5|$|Free cobalt (the native metal) is {{not found}} on Earth because of {{oxygen in the}} {{atmosphere}} and chlorine in the ocean. Oxygen and chlorine <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent the formation of native metal cobalt. Except as recently delivered in meteoric iron, pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on Earth (see below). Though the element is of medium abundance, natural compounds of cobalt are numerous. Small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, koalas are {{unevenly}} distributed and uncommon {{except in}} the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere. In South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced. Koalas {{can be found in}} habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool temperate. In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.|$|E
5|$|Inorganic {{elements}} play critical {{roles in}} metabolism; some <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> (e.g. sodium and potassium) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammal's mass {{is made up}} of the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur. Organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.|$|E

30|$|Scutellospora {{accounted}} {{only for}} 13 %, Gigaspora for 12.7 %, and Entrophospora about 4 % {{of the total}} spore density (Table  2). Glomus <b>was</b> the most <b>abundant</b> {{due to the fact}} that it is also sporageous, while Entrophospora was found to <b>be</b> the least <b>abundant</b> genus because it is sensitive to disturbances. In line with this, Glomus <b>was</b> <b>abundant</b> in Boswellia papyrifera-dominated woodlands of northern Ethiopia [8]. Likewise, Wubet et al. [37] reported that Glomus <b>was</b> <b>abundant</b> in indigenous trees in dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia.|$|R
5|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the city {{includes}} urbanized coyotes and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern gray squirrel, and other rodents <b>are</b> <b>abundant,</b> as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon. Large bird species <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally {{be seen on the}} MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.|$|E
