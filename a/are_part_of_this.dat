5|$|Cultural activities, {{including}} the annual religious festivals, in Puri are: The Puri Beach Festival held from 5 to 9 November every year, and the Shreekshetra Utsav held from 20 December to 2 January every year. The cultural programmes include unique sand art, display {{of local and}} traditional handicrafts and food festival. In addition, cultural programmes are held for two hours on every second Saturday of the month at the district Collector's Conference Hall near Sea Beach Police Station. Odissi dance, Odissi music and folk dances <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> event. Odissi dance is the cultural heritage of Puri. This dance form originated in Puri from the dances performed by Devadasis (Maharis) attached to the Jagannatha Temple who performed dances in the Nata mandapa of the temple to please the deities. Though the devadasi practice has been discontinued, the dance form has become modern and classical and is widely popular; many of the Odissi virtuoso artists and gurus (teachers) are from Puri. Some of the famous Odissi dancers are Kelucharan Mohapatra, Mayadhar Raut, Sonal Mansingh, Sanjukta Panigrahi and many more.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E

25|$|First, {{the first}} {{internal}} rebellion, led by Mauregato (783-788), occurred during those years.

25|$|The {{conclusions}} to {{be drawn}} from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the neo-platonist account of Plotinus, the cosmos has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source. Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via Averroes, came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the renaissance, and they remain important in Iranian philosophy.|$|E

500|$|The International Raëlian Movement envisions {{having an}} {{entrance}} with an aseptic chamber {{leading to a}} conference room for twenty-one {{people as well as}} a dining room of the same capacity. [...] In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy. [...] The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be {{in the center of a}} large park and protected from trespassing by a wall—a maximum of two stories—to surround the entire complex's circumference. [...] Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area. [...] The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance. [...] The landing pad for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4" [...] on its terrace. [...] The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only. [...] The seven rooms directly underneath the landing pad would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick metal door. [...] Finally, the International Raëlian Movement wants to avoid military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy. [...] Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> vision. A nearby replica of the Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials open to the public is expected to show visitors what it is like inside the real one.|$|E
