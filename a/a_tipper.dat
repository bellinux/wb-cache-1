The drum is struck with the other arm (usually the right) and is played either with the bare hand or with <b>a</b> <b>tipper.</b> There are numerous playing styles, mostly named after the region of Ireland in which they originated. The most common is Kerry style, which uses a two-headed tipper; the West Limerick style uses only one end of the tipper.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{musician}} Ronan Nolan, {{former editor}} of Irish Music magazine, the bodhrán evolved in the mid-19th century from the tambourine, which can be heard on some Irish music recordings {{dating back to the}} 1920s and viewed in a pre-Famine painting. However, in remote parts of the south-west, the [...] "poor man's tambourine" [...] – made from farm implements and without the cymbals – was in popular use among mummers, or wren boys. A large oil painting on canvas by Daniel Maclise (1806–1870) depicts a large Halloween house party in which a bodhrán features clearly. That painting, produced c. 1842, shows a flautist accompanied by a tambourine player who, in an Arabic style in contrast to standard bodhrán technique, used his fingers rather than <b>a</b> <b>tipper.</b> It is known that by the early 20th century, home-made frame drums were constructed using willow branches as frames, leather as drumheads, and pennies as jingles. In photographs from the 1940s and videos from the 1950s, jingles remained part of the bodhrán construction like a tambourine, yet were played with cipín, also known in English as [...] "tipper".|$|E

5000|$|While touring {{across the}} United States in 2003 with the Fuel cars, Tipper began {{composing}} tracks {{for what would}} become his first album intended entirely as a surround sound listening experience. Surrounded was released in 2004 by fledgling 5.1 venture MyUtopia Recordings. Eventually nominated as Best Album Intended for Surround Sound this downtempo album also marked <b>a</b> turn in <b>Tipper's</b> musical output away from the NuSkool genre which he was more widely associated with. It was during this period that digital music sales and/or reproduction usurped the music industry, and ultimately Fuel Records (UK) met its demise. <b>As</b> <b>Tipper</b> toured and performed his album in 5.1 wherever possible, Richie re-focused his talents towards advanced automobile parts, and Tipper set off on a non-stop touring schedule for two years, with London only a temporary base between tours. Constantly seen living out of his suitcase, and keeping his [...] "studio" [...] in his backpack, earned him the temporary moniker The Global Nomad.|$|R

5000|$|A {{dump truck}} (known in the UK as a dumper/tipper truck) is a truck used for {{transporting}} loose material (such as sand, gravel, or demolition waste) for construction.

40|$|It {{has been}} over fifty years since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission held that insider trading on material, nonpublic {{information}} is illegal, and despite {{the passage of the}} Insider Trading Sanctions Act in 1984, Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act in 1988, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, there is still no clear definition of “material, nonpublic information. ” This Article argues that the ambiguity of what constitutes illegal insider information enables corporate insiders to engage in profitable transactions without legal consequences. Furthermore, we argue and provide evidence that the necessity of showing <b>a</b> <b>tipper’s</b> personal benefit creates evidentiary difficulties, which, along with the ambiguity of “material, nonpublic information,” has made the recent increased penalties against insider traders ineffective. In response, this Article proposes a new evidentiary standard that is simple, easy to implement, and difficult to circumvent by insiders...|$|R

50|$|At {{approximately}} 06:30 UTC <b>a</b> <b>Tipper</b> lorry delivering quarry stone (ballast for track formation) {{had delivered}} its stone {{adjacent to the}} tracks along a railway access road but had not lowered his rear tipping body.

This blocked all four lines. The Network Rail Employee who had been supervising the delivery made an emergency call to the Signaller at Leicester power signal box and asked for all train movements to be stopped in the area. The lorry driver immediately notified the police who also told Network Rail.|$|E
50|$|Modern stockThe initial {{basis of}} freight stock has been {{supplemented}} {{in recent years}} by a series of flatbed runners (both four-wheelers and longer bogie stock), a large second hand four-wheeled brake van and <b>a</b> <b>tipper</b> wagon, the latter not being used in regular operation. As part of the Steam 125 railway celebrations that took place in 1998 the railway played host to its most unusual visitor, a hand made rail bike from Dr Karl Pischl in Austria. This unusual home-made vehicle was effectively a four-wheeled bicycle on flanged wheels. To replace a variety of four-wheel wagons that were time-expired, a new bogie works van was delivered to the line in 2011 for use by permanent way crews. This features an open wagon and covered accommodation area.|$|E
