5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 1, {{hurricane}} warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida's heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed the insured losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of}} emergency, Kennedy Space Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida's history. The state education system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida told <b>all</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a week and a half. Most schools were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week.|$|E

25|$|Until the {{establishment}} of the Students' Union in 1966, there were three main student organisations at Queen's. The first of these was the Students' Representative Council which was located on University Square and was responsible for representing <b>all</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> the University's management. There were also two other groups who served a more social function in student life, the Students' Union Society was based in the Union building and was for male students only, while the Women Students' Hall provided some of the same services to female students and was located on University Square. In 1966 these three were merged to form Queen's University Belfast Students' Union.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, schools were also built in Saint Bernard, and these forced <b>all</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> speak only English. Teachers punished anyone who spoke the native {{language}}. Hispanics were even forced {{not to speak}} Spanish in public. All this caused use of the Spanish language (which had been spoken in the area since the 18th century) to drop precipitously among the younger people of the St. Bernard community. In the 1960s several Isleño men fought in the Vietnam War. In 2005, many Isleños were evacuated before the landing of Hurricane Katrina, although some refused to leave their homes. Consequently, five hundred people {{lost their lives in}} Saint Bernard.|$|E

25|$|University {{housing is}} {{guaranteed}} to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories. Freshmen and sophomores must live in residential colleges, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen {{have been given the}} option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost <b>all</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational eating clubs, which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.|$|E
