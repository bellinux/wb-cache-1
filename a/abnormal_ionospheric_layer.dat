50|$|The {{time delay}} between {{transmission}} and reception is translated into effective <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer</b> altitude. Vertical incident sounding uses a collocated {{transmitter and receiver}} and involves directing a range of frequencies vertically to the ionosphere and measuring {{the values of the}} reflected returned signals to determine the effective ionosphere layer altitude. This technique is also used to determine the critical frequency. Oblique sounders use a transmitter at one end of a given propagation path, and a synchronized receiver, usually with an oscilloscope-type display (ionogram), at the other end. The transmitter emits a stepped- or swept-frequency signal which is displayed or measured at the receiver. The measurement converts time delay to effective altitude of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer.</b> The ionogram display shows the effective altitude of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer</b> as a function of frequency.|$|R
40|$|A {{correction}} {{methodology for}} distortions induced by ionospheric scintillation on fully polarimetric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) data is proposed. The correction is based on deriving the phase distortion induced by the ionosphere from Faraday rotation estimates. The estimated phase distortion is then used for correction. In order to compensate the phase and time-Doppler history distortions, the correction has to be performed at the slant range of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer,</b> i. e., on partially focused single-look complex data. Accordingly, {{the performance of the}} proposed correction methodology depends, among other factors, on knowledge of the altitude of the effective <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer</b> (assuming the thin <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer</b> model). Its estimation from the SAR data itself is therefore also addressed. The methodology was applied and validated on simulated P-band data for various ionospheric conditions and on real L-band data acquired by the Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) ...|$|R

40|$|We generalize the {{fundamental}} {{principle of the}} radio-occultation method for studying the atmospheres and ionospheres of planets and the Earth. The criterion containing the necessary and sufficient condition under which the tangential point, at which the refractive-index gradient is normal to the ray trajectory coincides with the radio-ray perigee, is obtained. The method for determining the location and parameters of <b>ionospheric</b> and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layers,</b> {{which is based on}} the relationship between the amplitudes and phases of the analytic functions determined from variations in the phase path (eikonal) and intensity of the radio-occultation signal, is proposed. This method yields qualitative and quantitative estimations {{of the value of the}} spatial displacement of the <b>ionospheric</b> or <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer</b> with respect to the radio-ray perigee and allows one to determine the altitude and inclination of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layer.</b> The developed method is, in particular, required for determining the location and inclination of the wind-shear region and the direction of propagation of internal waves in the ionosphere and the atmosphere. This method is simpler and more accurate than the back-propagation, radio-holographic method which was previously used for determining the location of the ionospheric irregularities...|$|R

5000|$|If [...] the {{material}} is a good insulator (or dielectric) or a poor conductor and substantially transmit waves that are incident upon it. Virtually no RF power is absorbed but some can be reflected at its boundaries depending on its relative permittivity {{compared to that of}} free space, which is unity. This uses the concept of intrinsic impedance, which is described below. There are few large physical objects that are also good insulators, with the interesting exception of fresh water icebergs but these do not usually feature in most urban environments. However large volumes of gas generally behave as dielectrics. Examples of these are regions of the Earths atmosphere, which gradually reduce in density at increasing altitudes up to 10 to 20 km. At greater altitudes from about 50 km to 200 km various <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layers</b> also behave like dielectrics and are heavily dependent on the influence of the Sun. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>layers</b> are not gases but plasmas.|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of ELF (of {{the order of}} 10 Hz) currents and electromagnetic fields in the off-equatorial E-region (90 - 120 km) of the Earth's ionosphere and their subsequent penetration into the deeper <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layers</b> is studied theoretically and numerically. These ELF currents and fields are generated by the interaction of an electromagnetic pulse with the E-region at its lower boundary located at 90 km above the Earth's surface. The wave penetration (with a typical wavelength {{of the order of}} 10 km) of the generated ELF currents and fields into the deeper <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layers</b> up to 120 km takes place due to the dominance of the Hall conductivity over the Pederson conductivity in the region between 90 - 120 km and penetration becomes diffusive above 120 km. During night time, the increase in the wave speed due to the reduced conductivities leads to the deeper penetration. As the angle between Earth's magnetic field and horizontal is increased (going away from the equator), the currents and fields penetrate deeper into the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>layers</b> with increased wavelength, the magnitudes of horizontal (east-west) and vertical currents decrease near the boundary and the vertical electric field decreases drastically. The horizontal (east-west) current integrated along vertical is fitted with a current distribution which can be replaced by a line current raised above its actual height by the half width of the current distribution for the purpose of the calculation of its radiation. The maximum of the total east-west current (310 Amps) remains same for various simulation parameters due to the magnetic shielding...|$|R
