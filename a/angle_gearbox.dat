50|$|Finally, (as {{described}} {{within the}} abstract for US Patent 5257535), if the mechanical system involves a right <b>angle</b> <b>gearbox,</b> then the axial reaction force {{experienced by the}} inputting shaft/pinion {{can be related to}} the torque experienced by the output shaft(s). The axial input stress must first be calibrated against the output torque. The input stress can be easily measured via strain gauge measurement of the input pinion bearing housing. The output torque is easily measured using a static torque meter.|$|E
30|$|As already discussed, gearbox torques are {{normally}} calculated based on dynamometer measurements {{that provide the}} variations of polished rod loads and positions. Modern dynamometer systems register these data in function of time but give no information on the crank angles valid at the measured times. This circumstance, however, prohibits a direct calculation of gearbox torques because all torque components depend on the crank angle, θ. Rod torque changes with the torque factor that varies with the crank angle; counterbalance torque is a direct function of crank angle, see Eqs.  1 – 3. Inertial torques are found from the acceleration patterns of different components of the pumping unit, these also change with the variation of the time history of crank <b>angle.</b> <b>Gearbox</b> torque components, therefore, can only be calculated if the change of crank angle with time, θ(t), is determined from dynamometer measurements.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} applied modern design {{principles to}} a shunter {{designed for the}} UK market; the locomotive has swing arm/coil spring suspension, with vertical hydraulic damping, and pneumatic brakes. The transmission is via a hydrodymamic converter and cardan drive shafts to right <b>angled</b> <b>gearbox</b> drives on each axle.|$|R
50|$|A dog-leg gearbox is {{a manual}} {{transmission}} shift pattern distinguished by an up-over-up shift between {{first and second}} gear. The layout derives its name from a dog's hind leg, with its sharp <b>angles.</b> Dog leg <b>gearboxes</b> have fallen out of fashion primarily because most manual performance cars now have six-speed gearboxes, which are unsuited to the dog-leg layout.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{driveline}} modelling. The modelling is done in MathModelica. Components from the free standard Modelica library have been used when appropriate. The remaining components have either been defined by mathematical equations only or by using mathematical equations together with standard components. The main work has been put into modeling and verifying the clutch, manual gearbox, final drive, shafts, brake and wheel. To this, models of engine, driver, chassis and air drag have been connected and simulated during different driving cycles. The vehicle model is moving in longitudinal motion. The results shows the expected behaviours, however since no measurements has been available {{it is hard to}} say how near the truth the model is, just that the qualitative behaviour is correct.
