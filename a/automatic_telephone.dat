25|$|The Panel Machine Switching System is {{an early}} type of <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> {{exchange}} for urban service, introduced in the Bell System in the 1920s.

Both systems had many features in common.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of inland radar coverage, 1st AA Division's Chief Signals Officer, Lt-Col G.C. Wickens, devised a system of 14 fixed base-lines of sound {{locators}} to detect night raids approaching the IAZ. These were linked by <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> equipment to the Brompton operations room, where the angular plots were resolved to indicate grid squares where the HAA guns in range could fire an unseen barrage. This 'Fixed Azimuth' system came into action in June 1940, {{in time for the}} opening of the night Blitz on London. It was later replaced as searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} controls, {{a stepping}} switch, {{also known as}} a stepping relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to {{one of a number of}} possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a Strowger switch). As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.|$|E

25|$|Following Finland's trade {{agreement}} with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia. However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Opposition to the {{government}} {{came to a head}} March 2 when Conservative leader Bennett first spoke. [...] Bennett was renowned as one of the province's finest orators, and his five-hour speech earned plaudits even from the Liberal Edmonton Bulletin, which praised its [...] "splendor in diction [...] the physical endurance of the orator" [...] and called it a [...] "high water mark for parliamentary debate in Alberta". [...] Bennett lashed out at {{the government}}'s handling of the A file, accusing it of culpable negligence in failing to properly oversee the company's activities. [...] He claimed to have been approached directly by [...] "great financial interests" [...] intent on preventing his participation in the debate. [...] He argued that the discrepancy in the sale price of the bonds and what the government had received for them meant that Clarke and his associates had realized a profit of between $200,000 and $300,000 at the government's expense. [...] He closed with an accusation that Cross had sent an emissary to a telephone company that wanted to install an <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> system in Calgary agreeing to reverse his opposition to the deal in exchange for a $12,000 contribution to Cross's campaign fund. [...] These charges, corroborated by Cushing but hotly denied by Cross, were not related to the A affair, but were designed to damage the credibility of the government's de facto house leader {{on the eve of the}} vote on the Woolf-McDougall amendment. [...] The government side adopted similar tactics: Agriculture Minister Duncan Marshall accused Boyle of being motivated by bitterness over having been denied the solicitorship of the A Boyle admitted that he had applied for this position, but denied an accusation from Peace River MLA James Cornwall that he had requested Cornwall's assistance in lobbying for it.|$|E

Sisal was introduced to Haiti, and sugar and cotton became significant exports. However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture had limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was employed at seasonal work in the more established sugar industries of Cuba and the Dominican Republic. An estimated 30,000–40,000 Haitian laborers, known as braceros, went annually to the Oriente Province of Cuba between 1913 and 1931. Most Haitians continued to resent the loss of sovereignty. At the forefront of opposition among the educated elite was L'Union Patriotique, which established ties with opponents of the occupation in the US itself, in particular the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
