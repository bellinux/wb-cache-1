40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that tobacco industry campaign contributions influence state legislators' behavior. METHODS: Multivariate simultaneous equations regression was used to analyze data on tobacco industry campaign contributions to state legislators and legislators' tobacco control policy scores in 6 states. Campaign contributions were obtained from disclosure statements available in the specific state agency that gathers such information in each state. Tobacco policy scores were derived from a survey of key informants working on tobacco issues in each state. RESULTS: As tobacco industry contributions increase, a legislator's tobacco policy score tends to decrease (i. e., become more pro-tobacco industry). A more pro-tobacco position was associated with larger contributions from the industry. These results were significant even <b>after</b> <b>controls</b> <b>for</b> partisanship, majority party status, and leadership effects. In California, campaign contributions were still significantly related to tobacco policy scores <b>after</b> <b>controls</b> <b>for</b> constituent attitudes and legislators' personal characteristics.

We investigate why managers choose to provide attributions with their forecasts and whether the attributions are related to security price reactions to management earnings forecasts. Using a sample of 951 management earnings forecasts issued from 1993 to 1996, we find that attributions are more likely for larger firms, less likely for firms in regulated industries, less likely for forecasts issued over longer horizons, more likely for bad news forecasts, and more likely for forecasts that are maximum type.

40|$|Background: Antropometric {{measures}} with biochemical indicators {{have been}} used as screening tools for metabolic abnormalities in adolescents and adults. A few studies have assessed the relation of EWET (Enlarge waist Elevated triglyceride) phenotype with diabetes, especially among individuals with first relative history of diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the association of EWET phenotype with diabetes among individuals with family history of diabetes. Methods: Antropometric and biochemical measurments were evaluated in a population - based cross - sectional study of 332 male and 991 female Isfahani adults aged 35 - 55 year. The EWET phenotype was defined as serum trigcylglycerol concentrations ≥ 150 mg/dl and concurrent waist circumference (WC) ≥ 88 cm in females and ≥ 102 cm in males. Results: The prevalence of EWET phenotype was respectively 9. 6 % and 23. 6 % among male and female. Individuals with the phenotype had significantly higher BMI and WHR (waist to hip ratio) as compared to other groups. <b>After</b> <b>control</b> <b>for</b> age and physical activity, male with EWET phenotype {{were significantly more likely to}} have high serum triglyceride levels (p < 0. 001), cholesterol (p < 0. 001).
