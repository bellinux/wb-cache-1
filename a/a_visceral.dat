With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

Emily had <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> need {{of her home}} and the countryside that surrounded it, and to leave it would cause her to languish and wither. Charlotte and Anne, being more realistic, did not hesitate in finding work and from April 1839 to December 1841 the two sisters had several posts as governesses. Not staying long with each family, their employment would last for some months or a single season. However, Anne did stay with the Robinsons in Thorp Green where things went well, from May 1840 to June 1845.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Spark In The Dark was {{published}} by Thin Man Press. This first collection of Constable's poetry ranges from satirical Burlesques to lyrical Spirit Songs. In Mrs God the poet draws on his Welsh Borders upbringing in a “burlesque” that comically subverts {{the image of a}} Divine patriarch. The book also features two experimental prose-poems. Winchester Cathedral:Time Out Of Mind, written during an Arts Council residency at Winchester Cathedral, evokes the misadventures of a medieval monk troubled by visions of the future. Wennefer is “a cautionary tale”, <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> retelling of the Isis-Osiris myth set in south London club culture.|$|E
25|$|Though {{government}} had {{been dominated by}} the Conservative Party {{for more than a}} decade, the new century saw much favourable legislation enacted in Ireland's interest. An electoral swing to the Liberal Party in the 1906 general election renewed Redmond's opportunities for working with government policy. The Liberals, however, did not yet back his party's demands for full Home Rule, which contributed to a renewal of agrarian radicalism in the ranch wars of 1906–1910. Redmond's low-key and conciliatory style of leadership gave the impression of weakness but reflected the problem of keeping together a factionalised party. He grew in stature after 1906 and especially after 1910. As far as Redmond was concerned, the Home Rule movement was interested in promoting Irish nationality within the British Empire, {{but it was also a}} movement with <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> antipathy to the English and their colonies.|$|E
25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E

25|$|Identity fusion, a {{psychological}} construct rooted in social psychology and cognitive anthropology, {{is a form}} of alignment with groups in which members experience <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> sense of oneness with the group. The construct relies on a distinction between the personal self and the social self. The personal self refers to the characteristics that make someone a unique person (e.g., tall, old, intelligent), while the social self pertains to the characteristics that align the person with groups (e.g., American, fraternity brother, student council member, etc.). As the name suggests, identity fusion involves the union of the personal and social selves. When fusion occurs, both the personal and social selves remain salient and influential but the boundaries between them become highly permeable. In addition, the theory proposes that fused persons come to regard other group members as “family” and develop strong relational ties to them as well as ties to the collective. Therefore, fused persons are not just bound to the collective; they are tied to the individual members of the collective.|$|E
25|$|The player {{may only}} wield two melee weapons and two {{secondary}} weapons at one time. Most melee weapons, called Trick Weapons, can transform into an alternate state; each state encourages {{a different approach}} to combat. For example, the Hunter Axe in its initial state is wielded with one hand and can be used to quickly dispatch enemies in cramped areas, but when transformed into its secondary state, it becomes an extended two handed weapon more suited for crowd control. With most Trick Weapons, one state is usually a slower, bigger weapon, that deals heavier damage per hit, while the other state is smaller, faster, and deals its damage in hit streaks. The player's main secondary weapon is a firearm; the firearm, usually a pistol, {{can be used in a}} traditional sense, as well as a way to stun enemies. When an enemy is stunned, the player can perform <b>a</b> <b>Visceral</b> attack; Visceral attacks cause a large amount of damage in one hit and can also be performed after the player strikes an enemy from behind with a charged attack. Other secondary weapons include a torch, cannon, and wooden shield, while other main melee weapons include a hammer, sword, two-handed gun, which serves as the melee and ranged weapon, and a whip. The player can carry other offensive weapons, such as molotovs, throwing knives, and pebbles.|$|E

500|$|Thousands of Nazis, {{including}} former SS members such as Trawniki guard Jakob Reimer and Circassian collaborator Tscherim Soobzokov, {{fled to the}} United States {{under the guise of}} refugees, sometimes using forged documents. Other SS men, such as Soobzokov, SD officer Wilhelm Höttl, Eichmann aide Otto von Bolschwing, and accused war criminal Theodor Saevecke, were employed by American intelligence agencies against the Soviets. As CIA officer Harry Rositzke noted, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> business of using any bastard so long as he was anti-Communist...

500|$|Despite the {{designation}} [...] "possible", someone with <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> AVM {{and a family}} history but no nosebleeds or telangiectasias is still extremely likely to have HHT, because these AVMs are very uncommon in the general population.

Music critic Jim Fusilli writes that Simone's music is still relevant today: [...] "it didn't adhere to ephemeral trends, it isn't a relic of a bygone era; her vocal delivery and technical skills as a pianist still dazzle; and her emotional performances have <b>a</b> <b>visceral</b> impact.|$|E

Falk honored Quest creator Doug Wildey by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny in the episode [...] "Nuclear Netherworld", as well as homage to William Hanna's birthstate of New Mexico where Jonny's grandfather resides. The team created Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to retcon the telefilms, feeling that Jade would never get married.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{solid and}} hollow visceral {{abdominal}} injuries {{have been associated}} with the use of seat belts in children involved in motor vehicle crashes. The relationship between the types of restraint used and the pattern of abdominal injury is unknown. METHODS: A probability sample of restrained children involved in crashes was enrolled in an ongoing crash surveillance system (1998 through 2002) linking insurance claims data to telephone survey and crash investigation data. Significant abdominal injuries were considered when the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score was > or = 2 and were defined as hollow visceral (HV; intestine, bladder), or solid visceral (liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney). Restraint type was categorized as optimal restraint (OR) or suboptimal restraint (S-OR) based on the child's age and size. RESULTS: For the 33 months of review, interviews were obtained for 13, 558 restrained children aged 0 to 15 years, of which, 56 % were OR (n = 7, 591) and 44 % were S-OR (n = 5, 967). A significant abdominal injury was recorded in 78 children. <b>A</b> hollow <b>visceral</b> injury was recorded in 38 (9 OR and 29 S-OR), and <b>a</b> solid <b>visceral</b> injury in 32 (18 OR and 14 S-OR). Both hollow and solid visceral injuries were present in 8 children (2 OR and 6 S-OR). Suboptimally restrained children had a higher risk for hollow visceral injury when compared with optimally restrained children (Odds Ratio, 4. 14 [95 % Confidence Interval 1. 33 to 13. 22, P <. 01]). CONCLUSIONS: Among restrained children with intraabdominal injuries, those who were suboptimally restrained were 4 times more likely to have <b>a</b> hollow <b>visceral</b> than <b>a</b> solid <b>visceral</b> injury when compared with those who were optimally restrained. This suggests that the mechanism of injury for hollow viscus may be directly related to the improper positioning of the restraint...|$|R
