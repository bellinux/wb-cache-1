Other vegetables such as carrots, sweet potato, tomatoes, and zucchini may be added. Spicing may be enhanced to include paprika, peppercorns, and even tomato sauce. For additional flavor and browning, some cooks add unpeeled onions or {{a small amount of}} sugar caramelized in oil. Some are known to <b>add</b> <b>also</b> beer or whiskey for extra flavor.|$|E
25|$|Trained in the 1970s in Neuro-Linguistic Programming by Richard Bandler (Hartmann is {{licensed}} by Bandler's Society of NLP as both an NLP Practitioner and an NLP Trainer, and Bandler wrote the foreword to his book Healing ADD), Hartmann popularized {{some of its}} concepts in Cracking the Code (2007), which argues that Newt Gingrich and Frank Luntz made use {{of them in the}} 1980s and 1990s for Republican Party causes and advocates using them to advance liberalism. His book Healing <b>ADD</b> <b>also</b> leans heavily on NLP techniques. Co-authored with Lamar Waldron, Hartmann's Ultimate Sacrifice released in 2005 states that the Mafia ordered the assassination of John F. Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA agent and patsy.|$|E
2500|$|The Maturidi school, {{the second}} largest school of Sunni theology, posits the {{existence}} of a form of natural law. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi stated that the human mind could know of the existence of God and the major forms of 'good' and 'evil' without the help of revelation. Al-Maturidi gives the example of stealing, which is known to be evil by reason alone due to man's working hard for his property. Killing, fornication, and (for certain Muslims) drinking alcohol were all 'evils' the human mind could know of according to al-Maturidi. The concept of Istislah in Islamic law bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West, as exemplified by Thomas Aquinas. However, whereas natural law deems good what is self-evidently good, according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person, istislah calls good whatever is connected to one of five [...] "basic goods". Al-Ghazali abstracted these [...] "basic goods" [...] from the legal precepts in the Qur'an and Sunnah: they are religion, life, reason, lineage and property. Some <b>add</b> <b>also</b> [...] "honour". Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya also posited that human reason could discern between 'great sins' and good deeds.|$|E

He is also, to my certain knowledge, joined in whatever societies--all of them illegal--are being formed in the country; and he is a man, therefore, not to be trusted.

Grace has now a sincere reverence and respect for England, feelings that in many particulars are sustained by the facts, and will be permanent; but, in some things, observation, as it usually happens with the young and sanguine, will expose the mistakes into which she has been led by enthusiasm and the imagination. As she knows other countries better, she will come to regard her own with more favourable and discriminating eyes, losing her sensitiveness on account of peculiarities she now esteems, and taking new views of things.

60|$|The bailiff and his {{immediate}} friends, the prisoners, {{and the family}} of the headsman, with a sufficient number of the guards, were among those who remained. The bustling Peterchen had lost some of his desire to take his place at the banquet, in the difficulties of the question which had arisen, and in the certainty that nothing material, in the way of gastronomy, would be attempted until he appeared. We should do injustice to his heart, did we not <b>add,</b> <b>also,</b> that he had troublesome qualms of conscience, which intuitively admonished him that the world had dealt hardly with the family of Balthazar. There remained the party of Maso, too, to dispose of, and his character of an upright as well as of a firm magistrate to maintain. As the crowd diminished, however, he and those near him descended from their high places, and mixed with the few who occupied the still guarded area in front of the stage.|$|E
6000|$|I {{fear that}} I shall have set my readers very much against Marian Leslie;--much {{more so than}} I would wish to do. As a rule they will not know how {{thoroughly}} flirting is an institution in the West Indies--practised by all young ladies, and laid aside by them when they marry, exactly as their young-lady names and young-lady habits of various kinds are laid aside. All I would say of Marian Leslie is this, that she understood the working of the institution more thoroughly than others did. And I must <b>add</b> <b>also</b> in her favour {{that she did not}} keep her flirting for sly corners, nor did her admirers keep their distance till mamma was out of the way. It mattered not to her who was present. Had she been called on to make one at a synod of the clergy of the island, she would have flirted with the bishop before all his priests. And there have been bishops in the colony who would not have gainsayed her! ...|$|E
60|$|The card sent to Dr. and Mrs. Stanhope {{and family}} had been so sent in an {{envelope}} having on the cover Mr. Slope's name. The signora soon learnt that Mrs. Proudie was not yet at the palace and that the chaplain was managing everything. It was much more in her line to apply to him than to the lady, and she accordingly wrote him the prettiest little billet in the world. In five lines she explained everything, declared how impossible it was for her not to be desirous to make the acquaintance of such persons as the Bishop of Barchester and his wife, and she might <b>add</b> <b>also</b> of Mr. Slope, depicted her own grievous state, and concluded by being assured that Mrs. Proudie would forgive her extreme hardihood in petitioning {{to be allowed to}} be carried to a sofa. She then enclosed one of her beautiful cards. In return she received as polite an answer from Mr. Slope--a sofa should be kept in the large drawing-room, immediately {{at the top of the}} grand stairs, especially for her use.|$|E

"Mysa," [...] he said gravely, [...] "this is a {{great thing}} that you ask; there is no disguising that your {{presence}} will add greatly to our difficulties, will <b>add</b> <b>also</b> to our perils, and may render it impossible for me to carry out your father's wishes and to conduct Chebron to a land where he will be beyond the persecution of Egypt. Such an enterprise must be undertaken in no light spirit. If you go you must be prepared to face death in all forms--by hunger and thirst and the weapons of the wild natives. It may even be that your lot may be that of slavery among them. It is a terrible journey for men, more terrible still for women; still, if you are resolved, resolved with the strength and mind of a woman and not of a child, that after having once turned your back upon Egypt you will never repent the step you have taken or wish to return, but will be steadfast under all the trials that may befall us, then I say that you shall share our lot." ...|$|E
60|$|Appearing, as I do, the {{advocate}} of Republicanism, let me not be misunderstood. I am well aware, from {{the abuse of}} the executive power in States, {{that there is not}} a single European nation but what affords a melancholy proof that if, at this moment, the original authority of the people should be restored, all that could be expected from such restoration would in the beginning be but a change of tyranny. Considering the nature of a Republic in reference to the present condition of Europe, your Lordship stops here; but a philosopher will extend his views much farther: having dried up the source from which flows the corruption of the public opinion, he will be sensible that the stream will go on gradually refining itself. I must <b>add</b> <b>also,</b> that the coercive power is of necessity so strong in all the old governments, that a people could not at first make an abuse of that liberty which a legitimate Republic supposes. The animal just released from its stall will exhaust the overflow of its spirits in a round of wanton vagaries; but it will soon return to itself, and enjoy its freedom in moderate and regular delight.|$|E

[...] "Such a position in life as that which you have proposed to bestow upon my child would be to her, as regards human affairs, great elevation. And from what I have heard,--I may be permitted to <b>add</b> <b>also</b> from what I now learn by personal experience,--such a marriage would be laden with fair promise of future happiness. But if you ask my mind, I think that my child is not free to make it. You, sir, have many relatives, who are not in love, as you are, all of whom would be affected by the stain of my disgrace. You have a daughter, to whom all your solicitude is due. No one should go to your house as your second wife who cannot feel that she will serve your child. My daughter would feel that she was bringing an injury upon the babe. I cannot bid her do this,--and I will not. Nor do I believe that she would do so if I bade her."

60|$|To {{begin with}} the aristocracies best known to most of us, the noble {{families}} of modern and mediæval Europe sprang, as a whole, from the Teutonic invasion of the Roman Empire. In Italy, it was the Lombards and the Goths who formed {{the bulk of the}} great ruling families; all the well-known aristocratic names of mediæval Italy are without exception Teutonic. In Gaul it was the rude Frank who gave the aristocratic element to the mixed nationality, while it was the civilised and cultivated Romano-Celtic provincial who became, by fate, the mere roturier. The great revolution, it has been well said, was, ethnically speaking, nothing more than the revolt of the Celtic against the Teutonic fraction; and, one might <b>add</b> <b>also,</b> the revolt of the civilised Romanised serf against the barbaric seigneur. In Spain, the hidalgo is just the hi d'al Go, the son of the Goth, the descendant of those rude Visigothic conquerors who broke down the old civilisation of Iberian and Romanised Hispania. And so on throughout. All over Europe, if you care to look close, you will find the aristocrat was the son of the intrusive barbarian; the democrat was the son of the old civilised and educated autochthonous people.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is highly}} {{singular}} that political economists should not [...] yet have perceived, {{if not the}} moral, at least the [...] passionate element, to be an inextricable quantity in every [...] calculation.

[...] And [...] this the more, because in his first definition of labour he [...] includes {{in the idea of}} it [...] "all feelings of a disagreeable [...] kind connected with the employment of one's thoughts in a [...] particular occupation." [...] True; but why not also, [...] "feelings of [...] an agreeable kind?" [...] It can hardly be supposed that the [...] feelings which retard labour are more essentially a part of [...] the labour than those which accelerate it.
