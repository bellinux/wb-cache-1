40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the land use {{development}} in the cadastral area Žabčice since the mid of the 20 th century. Žabčice lies in South Moravia at a distance of less than 25  km south from Brno and its land area is 817  ha. This selected cadastre is part of University Agricultural Enterprise (UAE) Žabčice area and has been chosen because of the relevance for the MUAF in Brno. Dominant activity in this cadastral area is agriculture. The land use was evaluated from 1950 ’s to the present time. According to availability of suitable map underlays three basic time profiles (1953, 1990 and 2007) were chosen. For evaluation of land use development following materials were used: archival aerial photographs, ortophotos, basic and cadastral maps, archival documents. Field survey of selected area was also necessary. Thirteen land use categories have been identified as an outcome of interpretation of maps. These categories were compared by methods of comparative measurement of areas. The area of particular land use categories in landscape with regard to land area of whole model <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>hectares</b> and further their percentage representation were found out. Data processing and all analyses were done in GIS environment (software ArcGIS 9. 1). In 2007 (compared with 1953) forest area had increased by about 1  %, orchards by 2  %, vineyards by 12  % and the increase of built-up and other areas by 8  % was also evident. The area of following categories decreased: arable land by 21  %, TTP by 2  %, garden by 1  %. The most significant trend in the cadastral Žabčice is decrease of arable land area recorded during the whole period. Other trends are following: the increase of vineyard areas, smaller increase of the orchard area and increase of built-up and other areas.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation of productivity and technical progress based on DEA applied to complete panel data (intertemporal-DEA). Instead of assuming unchanged technology, this paper presents a formulation of technical change that allows the decomposition of productivity scores obtained using intertemporal-DEA. The assumption here is that the technology level in period t for each country is the maximum productivity index obtained until this period. The model assumes that improvements over earlier productivity levels are due to technical progress and that productivity scores below the earlier maximum productivity level are due to inefficiency. The methodology is applied to the analysis of agricultural productivity in the European Union regions in the 1985 - 97 period. The major source of data is Cronos in Eurostat. This database is used to obtain the disaggregated outputs, intermediate inputs, and depreciation, in current and constant 1990 prices, and labor in annual work units. Capital is measured by depreciation. Land is agricultural <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>hectares.</b> Outputs are aggregated in two categories: crops and animal products. Intermediate inputs are grouped into two major categories: feedstuffs and other materials. Aggregation uses national price indices and regional production structures, using the translog price formula. All output, intermediate input and depreciation data, originally reported in local currencies was converted into ECUs, using the 1990 exchange rates. The discriminatory power of the analysis is higher than those with only contemporary analysis of technical efficiency, giving less than 10 % of observations in the reference set. Further discrimination is explored using super-efficiency analysis. Radial efficiency measures give only a particular form of inefficiency that can be explained by a proportional contraction in input usage. The paper studies particular output and input efficiencies. As examples, animal products inefficiency is usual only in southern regions. Inefficiency in intermediate consumption usage is pervasive, suggesting the possibility of reducing agricultural production costs. Labor and capital inefficiencies arise in different regions. Land slacks are common in the southern and the westernmost regions. ...|$|E

No entanto, o setor agrÃcola pode obter capacidade de se adaptar aos riscos, sejam eles climÃticos ou nÃo, mediante investimentos em estratÃgias de planejamento para o desenvolvimento no meio rural. Diante disso, o objetivo geral deste trabalho foi avaliar a resiliÃncia da produÃÃo da agricultura familiar no Nordeste brasileiro no perÃodo de 1990 a 2012, por meio da estimaÃÃo do Ãndice de ResiliÃncia dessas culturas a partir dos indicadores parciais de participaÃÃo da agricultura familiar na formaÃÃo do PIB agregado dos estados do Nordeste, quantidade anual {{per capita}} de alimentos, rendimento em quilogramas por hectare e Ãrea colhida em hectares com arroz, feijÃo, mandioca e milho. As variÃveis foram transformadas em Ãndices parciais antes de serem agregadas para a construÃÃo do Ãndice de resiliÃncia. Para a aferiÃÃo dos pesos associados a cada Ãndice parciais, utilizou-se anÃlise fatorial por meio do mÃtodo de decomposiÃÃo em componentes principais. Uma vez construÃdo o Ãndice de ResliÃncia da agricultura familiar produtora de alimentos nos estados do Nordeste, testou-se o impacto do PRONAF sobre os Ãndices de cada estado. Os dados utilizados na pesquisa foram de fontes secundÃrias, coletados nos AnuÃrios EstatÃsticos do IBGE â Instituto de Geografia e EstatÃsticas e no Banco Central do Brasil. Os resultados mostram que a participaÃÃo da produÃÃo agrÃcola familiar agregada no Nordeste, apresentou tendÃncia negativa e Taxa GeomÃtrica de Crescimento (TGC%) anual decrescente. Constatou-se diferentes trajetÃrias para os Ãndices de ResiliÃncia estimados no estudo. Como os Ãndices estimados provavelmente refletem as dificuldades climÃticas e os inexistentes ou deficientes serviÃos de assistÃncia tÃcnica que prevalecem em todos os estados da regiÃo, pode-se inferir que esses fatores provavelmente induziram o comportamento da trajetÃria observada para os Ãndices que apresentaram tendÃncia negativa de crescimento. Complementando, observou-se que, ao contrÃrio do que seria esperado, o PRONAF na modalidade de custeio destinado a produÃÃo de arroz, feijÃo, mandioca e milho, foi incapaz de influenciar, de um ponto de vista estatÃstico os Ãndices de ResiliÃncia dos estados do Nordeste no perÃodo analisado.

However, the agricultural sector can get ability {{to adapt to the}} risks, whether climatic or not, through investments in planning strategies for development in rural areas. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the resilience of family farming production in Northeastern of Brazil from 1990 to 2012, through the estimation of the resilience index of these cultures from the partial indicators of family farmers participation in the formation of aggregate GDP of the states of the Northeast, annual per capita amount of food yield in kilograms, per hectare and harvested <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>hectares</b> with rice, beans, cassava and maize. The variables were transformed into partial indices prior to aggregate for building resilience index. To measure the weights associated with each partial index it was used factorial analysis using the decomposition method of principal components. Once built the index of resilience of food family farming producer in the Northeast states, it was tested the impact of PRONAF on the index of resilience of each state. The data used in the research came from secondary sources collected in the Statistical Yearbooks IBGE - Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Central Bank of Brazil. The results showed that the participation of family farming aggregate in the Northeast, had a negative trend and Geometric Growth Rate (TGC) decreasing yearly. It was found different paths to the resilience indices estimated in the study. As the estimated these results probably reflect the climatic difficulties and the non - existent or deficient technical assistance services that prevail in all states of the region. It can be inferred that these factors probably led the behavior of the trend observed in the indices showed negative growth trend. Complementing, it was observed that, contrary to what would be expected, PRONAF, rural credit for the production of rice, bean, cassava and maize, have not been able to influence, from a statistical point of view, the indices of resilience in all states of Northeast period analyzed...|$|E
