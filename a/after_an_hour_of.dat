5|$|Aware {{that his}} ship was {{suffering}} {{the worst of}} the casualties, L'Héritier ordered his men to attempt to board the British ship of the line, but first one and then another attempt to do so was driven back with heavy casualties. The lighting of Hercule had gone out {{at the beginning of the}} engagement, leaving her crew confused, and as a result, only around 40 men answered when L'Héritier ordered the boarding; he was himself injured twice, to the head by a sabre and to the thigh by a pike, while leading the assault. At 10:30, <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> continual bombardment L'Héritier surrendered: Hercules hull had been torn open, five guns were dismounted with others damaged and more than two fifths of the crew killed or wounded. Jason was approaching fast and the rest of Bridport's fleet was close enough to see the muzzle flashes from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan next turned Virginia on Congress. Seeing {{what had}} {{happened}} to Cumberland, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of Congress, ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on Congress. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> unequal combat, the badly damaged Congress surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered Congress fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. Congress caught fire and burned {{throughout the rest of the}} day. Near midnight, the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.|$|E
5|$|Nebiu Demeke {{was arrested}} and charged with air piracy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. He was arraigned on February 12, 1993; Judge Allyne Ross ordered him held without bail until his trial. Demeke {{remained}} convinced that he would not spend any time in prison and that he would be granted asylum. During the course of his trial, he was twice found to be incompetent to stand trial and was prescribed medication for depression and hallucinations. He represented himself during the course of his four-day trial. He was found guilty in a jury trial <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> deliberation, and Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. sentenced him to prison until 2013.|$|E

5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|As Ethalion subdued Thetis the {{remainder}} of the British squadron continued southwards in pursuit of Santa Brigida. Pillon was an experienced officer with a good knowledge of the Northern Spanish coast and he intended to lose his pursuers in the rocky channels of Cape Finisterre. Early on 17 October he reached Spanish coastal waters, rounding Finisterre just beyond the Monte Lora rocks. Captain Gore on Triton, which was in full flow at seven knots, was unaware of the obstacle and at 05:00 crashed into them, coming to a juddering halt and inflicting severe damage to his ship's hull. Gore was able however to bring Triton off soon afterwards and continued pursuit, assisted by Digby on Alcmene who was able to block Pillon's route into Porte de Vidre. Both frigates opened fire on Santa Brigida at 07:00 as the Spanish ship sought shelter in the rocks at Commarurto close to the safe harbour at Muros, Pillon's movement hampered by the coastal rias that blocked the wind. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> resistance, with Naiad belatedly approaching, Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces. Santa Brigida had lost two men killed and eight wounded, Alcmene one killed and nine wounded and Triton a single man wounded.|$|E
5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain {{planned to}} stay there for at least 20 days to {{complete}} the most urgent repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus. There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> target practice. The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E

5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; they asked for it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E
5|$|Probes {{began on}} the A and B Company positions, {{and a number of}} assaults {{occurred}} during the night. Utilising indirect fires, the Chinese charged forward in waves, only to be beaten back by the Australians' Bren light machine-guns, Owen submachine-guns, rifle fire and grenades, before again regrouping and attacking again. B Company—under the command of Captain Darcy Laughlin—supported by tanks, drove off each assault, inflicting heavy casualties while emerging almost unscathed. Laughlin's command post was fired upon by a number of Chinese that had infiltrated the company position, but they were swiftly driven out. An outpost on the northern knoll reported Chinese massing on their flanks at 23:00, and although heavy artillery was directed against the attackers, the section was forced to break contact and withdraw to the main defensive position. The main Chinese assault began at 00:50, falling on 4 Platoon but was broken up <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> heavy fighting. A second assault was mounted on 6 Platoon at 03:30, following a feint against 5 Platoon. With determination the Chinese swept forward, penetrating the Australian perimeter before being ejected by an equally determined counter-attack by 6 Platoon with Sherman tanks in support. At 04:00 a small outpost {{to the rear of the}} company position was attacked by more than 50 Chinese. Held by just four men under the command of Lance Corporal Ray Parry, the Australians fought off four separate attacks, killing more than 25 and wounding many more over the space of twenty minutes. Parry was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions. A final assault on B Company was made just on dawn at 04:45 by about 70 Chinese, and was again repulsed.|$|E
25|$|The Action of 4 April 1941 was a naval battle fought {{during the}} Atlantic Campaign of the Second World War. A German {{commerce}} raider encountered a British auxiliary cruiser and sank her with heavy losses <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> fighting.|$|E

25|$|As the {{distance}} {{had not been}} reduced <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> pursuit, the Italian cruisers broke off the chase, turning to the north-west on a course to rejoin Vittorio Veneto. The Allied ships changed course in turn, following the Italian cruisers at extreme range. Iachino let them come on in hopes of luring the British cruisers into the range of Vittorio Venetos guns.|$|E
25|$|After the Polling Day, {{a meeting}} on the {{defamation}} suit was called by Francis Yong, vice-chairman of the SDP, in the SDP headquarters.

25|$|Williams did not {{feature in}} {{the first game of the}} All Blacks' year-end tour to Europe, but was one of ten changes to the {{starting}} line-up for the second game, against France in Lyon and he started in all three remaining matches, two against France and one against Wales in Cardiff. He was replaced by James Ryan <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the last game, but not before he had demonstrated yet another aspect of his versatility, when he fielded the ball in his own 22 and, with a spiralling kick, cleared it into touch on Wales' 10-metre line, setting up a line-out from which the All Blacks came away with the ball to score their third try of the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{distress}} call was {{received by the}} crew at Bjørnøya Radio {{and they decided to}} send two men, Einar Strand and Alv Alvær, to look for the aircraft on the island. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> searching in one meter (3ft) deep snow, the two spotted the aircraft, which they quickly identified as they saw flames. They arrived three hours after the accident and found Olsen. Strand and Alvær attempted to drag the survivor with them, but this proved too strenuous. Instead Alvær went back to the station and Strand stayed with Olsen. On the return trip Alvær got lost at one time, but finally managed to reach the station. Bjørnøya Radio contacted Skattøra at 21:45 reporting that the wreck had been found.|$|E
25|$|Olympia sailed {{from the}} Downs on 1 March 1811 to take station of Dieppe. That day she sighted five French luggers and sailed towards them, but they {{dispersed}} and ran inshore, {{with the result}} that she lost them. The next day Olympia sighted a lugger, gave chase, only to see several more emerge from the haze until there were 13 French vessels in all. Olympia strove to escape but by 2pm French vessels were close enough to open fire. Though she was able to repulse two attempts by the French to board, <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> action Olympia was forced to surrender as more French vessels arrived. She had had two men wounded, including Taylor. Taylor would spend until late 1813 in captivity.|$|E

25|$|At this juncture, Clive faced a dilemma. The Nawab had {{reconciled}} with Mir Jafar and had posted him on one flank of his army. Mir Jafar had sent messages to Clive, declaring {{his intention to}} uphold the treaty between them. Clive decided to refer the problem to his officers and held a council of war on 21 June. The question Clive put before them was whether, under the present circumstances, the army, without other assistance, should immediately cross into the island of Cossimbazar and attack the Nawab or whether they should fortify their position in Katwa and trust to assistance from the Marathas or other Indian powers. Of the twenty officers attending the council, thirteen including Clive were against immediate action, while the rest including Major Coote were in favour citing recent success and the high spirits of the troops. The council broke up and <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> deliberation, Clive gave the army orders to cross the Bhagirathi River (another name for the Hooghly River) {{on the morning of}} 22 June.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|The 49th {{had been}} ordered to proceed up the beaches of Egmont-op-Zee, a steep climb through sand dunes and poor terrain. The risks were {{exacerbated}} by harassment from French sharpshooters, who had excellent cover. After about six hours of heavy fighting, the attack was stopped about a mile (1.6km) short of the British objective. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> close combat, the French began to withdraw. Brock was injured in the fighting when hit in the throat by a spent musket ball. His neck cloth prevented a possibly fatal injury.
