40|$|SUMMARY. Alkalic rhyolites with {{peralkaline}} affinities, bearing quartz and potassic feldspar pheno-crysts, {{are described}} from Iceland {{for the first}} time. Evidence from electron-probe analyses of feldspar phenocrysts indicates crystallization {{in or near the}} thermal valley of the system SiO 2 -Or-Ab. Icelandic <b>acid</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> are subdivided into alkalic rhyolites, belonging to transitional nd alkalic basalt lineages, and the mildly calc-alkaline rhyolites of tholeiite lineages. PUBLISHED chemical and mineralogical data on some <b>acid</b> <b>rocks</b> from eastern Iceland have provided good documentation f a suite of <b>acid</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> typified by a high silica/alkalis ratio (greater than 9), an affinity with calc-alkaline <b>acid</b> <b>rocks,</b> and the presence of plagioclase phenocrysts as the salic, and often the only pheno-cryst phase (Carmichael, 1962, 1963). Their association with tholeiitic basalt lavas has been pointed out by Carmichael (I 963) who suggested that these one-feldspar rhyolites were typical products of the fractionation of a tholeiitic magma. For some time now, these rhyolites have come to be regarded as the typical Icelandic acid magma, but the discovery of alkalic acid lavas in western and southern Iceland has shown the compositional range of Icelandic acid volcanics to be much greater tha...|$|R

25|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>rock</b> {{drainage}} occurs naturally within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> drainage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>rock</b> {{drainage}} {{has recently}} been a hindrance to {{the completion of the}} construction of Interstate 99 near State College, Pennsylvania. However, this <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> drainage didn't come from a mine; rather, it was produced by oxidation of pyrite-rich rock which was unearthed during a road cut and then used as filler material in the I-99 construction. A similar situation developed at the Halifax airport in Canada. It is from these and similar experiences that the term <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> drainage has emerged as being preferable to acid mine drainage, thereby emphasizing the general nature of the problem.|$|E

25|$|Sub-surface mining often {{progresses}} {{below the}} water table, so water must be constantly pumped {{out of the}} mine {{in order to prevent}} flooding.

25|$|The hippie {{legacy in}} {{literature}} includes the lasting popularity of books reflecting the hippie experience, such as The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. In music, the folk rock and psychedelic rock popular among hippies evolved into genres such as <b>acid</b> <b>rock,</b> world beat and heavy metal music. Psychedelic trance (also known as psytrance) {{is a type}} of electronic music influenced by 1960s psychedelic rock. The tradition of hippie music festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey's Acid Tests, where the Grateful Dead played tripping on LSD and initiated psychedelic jamming. For the next several decades, many hippies and neo-hippies became part of the Deadhead community, attending music and art festivals held around the country. The Grateful Dead toured continuously, with few interruptions between 1965 and 1995. Phish and their fans (called Phish Heads) operated in the same manner, with the band touring continuously between 1983 and 2004. Many contemporary bands performing at hippie festivals and their derivatives are called jam bands, since they play songs that contain long instrumentals similar to the original hippie bands of the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|They were {{influenced}} heavily by bands such as Wire, Gang Of Four, The Pop Group, Richard Hell & The Voidoids, and The Urinals, {{and nearly all}} of their early songs had unusual structures and were {{less than a minute}} long—even later, when Minutemen's music became slightly more conventional, their songs rarely passed the three-minute mark. Though Minutemen were members of the hardcore punk community and were somewhat influenced by the speed, brevity, and intensity of hardcore punk, they were known for hybridizing punk rock and hardcore with various forms of music (like jazz, funk, <b>acid</b> <b>rock,</b> and R), separating them from most hardcore bands of that era. Minutemen were fans of Captain Beefheart, and echoes of his distinctive, disjointed, avant-blues music can be heard in their songs, especially their early output. Through most of their career they ignored standard verse-chorus-verse song structures in favor of experimenting with musical dynamics, rhythm, and noise. Later in their career they blended in more traditional song elements they had initially avoided. They also played cover versions of classic rock songs by bands such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Steely Dan, and Blue Öyster Cult.|$|E
