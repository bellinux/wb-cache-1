5|$|Hurricane Florence {{produced}} strong swells {{and dangerous}} surf conditions {{along the northern}} Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Bermuda.

The hurricane also caused strong swells and rough ocean conditions, including rip currents, in the Bahamas <b>and</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Canada.
