Devotees visit the temple to worship in front of the image of Badrinath in the sanctum and have a hold dip in Alaknanda River. The general belief is that <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tank purifies the soul.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Reynolds {{fell ill}} with {{multiple}} myeloma, {{a type of}} blood cancer that often attacks the bones, {{and was forced to}} stop anchoring in April. His absence caused <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.|$|E

5|$|Pushkar Lake is {{surrounded}} by 52 bathing ghats (a series of steps leading to the lake), where pilgrims throng in large numbers to take a sacred bath, especially around Kartik Poornima (October–November) when the Pushkar Fair is held. <b>A</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sacred lake is believed to cleanse sins and cure skin diseases. Over 500 Hindu temples are situated around the lake precincts.|$|E
5|$|Gomti Ghat {{consists}} of steps {{leading to the}} Gomti River, {{which is also a}} holy place for pilgrims to take <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river, before visiting Dwarakadish temple. The ghat has a number of small shrines dedicated to the Samudra (God of the Sea), Saraswati and Lakshmi. Other notable temples in the ghat area include the Samudra Narayana (Sangam Narayana) temple, which is at the confluence of the Gomti River with the sea, the Chakra Narayana temple where there is a stone with an imprint of a chakra as a manifestation of Vishnu, and the Gomati temple, which has an idol of the river goddess Gomati that {{is said to have been}} brought to earth by the sage Vasishta.|$|E
5|$|However some {{properties}} have so {{far gone}} unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which {{may be due to}} unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. One possible explanation of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it loses its electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small dust particles partially corotate with the planet, they will move outward during the shadow pass creating an outward extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> particle distribution and ring's brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} marginality on the ground state fidelity and Loschmidt echo. For this purpose, we study the above quantities near the quantum critical point (QCP) of the two-dimensional (2 -D) Dirac Hamiltonian <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of a mass term which is tuned to zero at the Dirac point. An ideal example would be that of <b>the</b> low-energy carriers <b>in</b> graphene in which a mass term opens up a band gap. This {{happens to be a}} marginal situation where the behavior of the fidelity and the echo is markedly different as compared to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one-dimensional case. We encounter this marginal behavior near the Dirac point, which is displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of <b>a</b> sharp <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground state fidelity (or equivalently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> logarithmic scaling of the fidelity susceptibility). Most importantly, there is also a logarithmic correction to the proposed scaling of <b>the</b> fidelity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thermodynamic limit which can not be a priori anticipated from the predicted scaling form. Interestingly, <b>a</b> sharp <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground state Loschmidt echo is also found to be absent near this QCP, which is again a consequence of the marginality. We also explain the absence of <b>a</b> sharp <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> fidelity and the Loschmidt echo close to <b>the</b> QCP <b>in</b> dimensions greater than two.

The {{results indicate that the}} estimated short rate curve exhibits <b>a</b> slight <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long end of the curve.

5|$|The half-lives of {{nobelium}} isotopes increase smoothly from 250No to 253No. However, a dip {{appears at}} 254No, and beyond this the half-lives of even-even nobelium isotopes drop sharply as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode. For example, the half-life of 256No is almost three seconds, {{but that of}} 258No is only 1.2milliseconds. This shows that at nobelium, the mutual repulsion of protons poses a limit to the region of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series. The even-odd nobelium isotopes mostly continue to have longer half-lives as their mass numbers increase, with <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trend at 257No.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{playing fields}} to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that {{has evolved into}} a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E
5|$|The force {{reached the}} Bulganak River that day, where skirmishers found {{a force of}} Cossacks and Russian {{infantry}}, with a light battery of artillery. The infantry and artillery had been hidden in <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terrain while the British formed up, and their placement put the British cavalry in heavy danger. Raglan decided to withdraw, and sent a troop forward to cover the retreat; this body's confidence deceived the Russians into thinking {{that there was a}} larger British force than there was, and they failed to pursue the retreating cavalry. A day later, the British force, together with the French under General St Arnaud, defeated the Russians at the Battle of Alma. Nolan spent the battle as a liaison due to his fluent French, and was often galloping between the two allied armies. They resumed marching on 26 September and entered the plains of Balaclava, near Sevastopol.|$|E

5|$|Traffic, {{receipts}} and dividends steadily increased. Tolls rose from £1,468 in 1779 to £6,807 in 1821. The first dividend of 3.75 per cent was paid in 1786, and had reached 15.78 per cent by 1821. Figures for tonnage {{are not available}} for the early years, but were 79,359 tons in 1821. There was <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carriage of merchandise in 1810, when the Kennet and Avon Canal opened and provided a more convenient route from Bristol to London, but it picked up again after 1819, when the North Wilts Canal opened, providing a link from Latton to Abingdon via Swindon and the Wilts and Berks Canal, which was easier than using the Thames. The highest dividend paid was in 1833, when shareholders received 26.33 per cent, after which {{receipts and}} dividends steadily dropped. In 1859 {{in order to allow}} the passage of a coal barge called the Queen Esther two of the locks were widened.|$|E

The rapids of the Ganges also are popular for river rafting, attracting adventure seekers in the summer months. Also, several cities such as Kanpur, Kolkata and Patna have developed riverfront walkways along the banks to attract tourists.|$|E

25|$|After hitting <b>a</b> <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, losing 13–3 to {{eventual}} {{national champion}} Clemson, Georgia regained its focus and won {{out to get}} to 10–1 by the regular season's end.

Georgia rebounded by blanking South Carolina, 24–0, on September 26 as the sophomore Walker ran for 176 yards on 36 carries. Georgia led just 3–0 at the half, and Walker opened things up for the Bulldogs {{in the third quarter}} by scoring on touchdown runs of 3 and 8 yards to put the Gamecocks away.|$|E
