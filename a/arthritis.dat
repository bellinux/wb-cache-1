5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic <b>arthritis.</b> This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis,</b> and reactive <b>arthritis.</b> Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is used as}} an {{anti-inflammatory}} {{agent for}} both acute and long-term inflammation, {{as well as for}} treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|Crippled with <b>arthritis,</b> Murray {{had moved}} into a home in North Finchley, north London, where she was cared for by a retired couple who were trained nurses; from here she {{occasionally}} took taxis into central London to visit the UCL library.|$|E

5|$|The {{aging of}} adult skeletons {{is not as}} {{straightforward}} as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached. One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton {{is to look at}} bone osteons under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for <b>arthritis</b> indicators on the bones. <b>Arthritis</b> will cause noticeable rounding of the bones. The degree of rounding from <b>arthritis</b> coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive <b>arthritis,</b> ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic <b>arthritis,</b> lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 76, Moses had {{developed}} <b>arthritis,</b> which made embroidery painful. Her sister Celestia suggested that painting would be easier for her, and this idea spurred Moses's painting career in her late 70s. When her right hand began to hurt, she switched to her left hand.|$|E
5|$|Needles made of yttrium-90, {{which can}} cut more {{precisely}} than scalpels, {{have been used}} to sever pain-transmitting nerves in the spinal cord, and yttrium-90 is also used to carry out radionuclide synovectomy in the treatment of inflamed joints, especially knees, in sufferers of conditions such as rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It may {{be caused}} by wear and tear ({{degenerative}} joint disease), injury (traumatic <b>arthritis),</b> surgery (secondary degenerative joint disease), inflammation (rheumatoid <b>arthritis)</b> or infection (septic <b>arthritis).</b>|$|E
25|$|O’Keeffe {{launched}} “Let’s Cook!” in April 2012, {{an initiative}} that provides free cooking classes and demonstrations {{for people with}} <b>arthritis.</b> Partnering with <b>Arthritis</b> Ireland and healthcare company Abbott, the chef developed nutritionally balanced recipes for <b>arthritis</b> sufferers. For the classes, O’Keeffe incorporated culinary skills which maximize comfort for people with <b>arthritis</b> pain and symptoms..|$|E

25|$|Total hip {{replacement}} is {{most commonly used}} to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> avascular necrosis, traumatic <b>arthritis,</b> protrusio acetabuli, certain hip fractures, benign and malignant bone tumors, <b>arthritis</b> associated with Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b> The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have failed.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} is {{more common}} in people with rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> than in the general population. However, whether vitamin D deficiency is a cause or a consequence of the disease remains unclear. One meta-analysis found that vitamin D levels are low in people with rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and that vitamin D status correlates inversely with prevalence of rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reactive <b>arthritis</b> may be self-limiting, {{frequently}} recurring, chronic or progressive. Most {{patients have}} severe symptoms lasting {{a few weeks}} to six months. 15 to 50 percent of cases involve recurrent bouts of <b>arthritis.</b> Chronic <b>arthritis</b> or sacroiliitis occurs in 15–30 percent of cases. Repeated attacks over many years are common, and patients sometimes end up with chronic and disabling <b>arthritis,</b> heart disease, amyloid deposits, ankylosing spondylitis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, or aortitis with aortic regurgitation. However, most people with reactive <b>arthritis</b> can expect to live normal life spans and maintain a near-normal lifestyle with modest adaptations to protect the involved organs.|$|E

25|$|Ocular {{involvement}} (mild bilateral conjunctivitis) {{occurs in}} about 50% {{of men with}} urogenital reactive <b>arthritis</b> syndrome and about 75% of men with enteric reactive <b>arthritis</b> syndrome. Conjunctivitis and uveitis can include redness of the eyes, eye pain and irritation, or blurred vision. Eye involvement typically occurs early {{in the course of}} reactive <b>arthritis,</b> and symptoms may come and go.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a large}} molecule, with a {{molecular}} weight of 150 kDa., that binds to TNFα and decreases its role in disorders involving excess inflammation in humans and other animals, including autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> psoriasis, psoriatic <b>arthritis,</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> and, potentially, {{in a variety of}} other disorders mediated by excess TNFα.|$|E
25|$|Leflunomide (original {{brand name}} Arava) is an {{immunosuppressive}} disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), used in active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and psoriatic <b>arthritis.</b> It is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor that works by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|Reactive <b>arthritis</b> is an RF-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked <b>arthritis</b> often {{precipitated by}} {{genitourinary}} or gastrointestinal infections. The most common triggers are intestinal infections (with Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (with Chlamydia trachomatis).|$|E
25|$|Regular {{consumption}} of alcohol is {{associated with an increased}} risk of gouty <b>arthritis</b> and a decreased risk of rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b> Two recent studies report that the more alcohol consumed, the lower the risk of developing rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b> Among those who drank regularly, the one-quarter who drank the most were up to 50% less likely to develop the disease compared to the half who drank the least.|$|E
25|$|In March 1931, Heilmann was {{incapacitated}} by <b>arthritis</b> in {{his right}} wrist. The <b>arthritis</b> was so severe that he was hospitalized {{for a time in}} the spring. He ended up missing the entire 1931 season.|$|E
