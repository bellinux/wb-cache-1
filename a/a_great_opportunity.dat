5|$|The government's {{campaign}} was criticized as having poor promotional videos, especially lacking in informational value. The {{final days of}} the campaign were marked by events in support of and opposition to joining the EU, as the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs set up an EU information event in Zagreb, while a protest against EU accession at the main city square drew 200 (some arrests occurred). The Croatian Bishops' Conference called on citizens to vote in the referendum, reminding Croatians that Croatia is a part of European culture while refraining from directly advocating either position. The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts also supported joining the EU with 93 academicians in favour, 2 against and 1 abstention; they said that the event represents <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> for Croatia. In contrast to EU accession opponents' request to postpone the referendum until Generals Gotovina and Markač were released by the ICTY, Gotovina himself urged citizens of Croatia to vote in the referendum and said that he would vote in favour of joining the EU.|$|E

As a result of this pact, on 1 September, the Germans invaded Poland from the west.

25|$|Tennessee's {{inability}} {{to get into the}} end zone came to an end on just the third play of the third quarter, when George took a handoff from McNair and stormed through {{the middle of the field}} for a 68-yard touchdown run. Then after several punts, the Titans put together a 13-play, 73-yard drive, featuring a 26-yard completion from McNair to receiver Chris Sanders. With 12:57 left in the fourth quarter, Del Greco finished the drive with his third field goal, increasing the Tennessee lead to 16–9. Later in the quarter, the Colts had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> to come back when wide receiver Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 87 yards to the Titans 3-yard line, but it was overruled by a replay challenge from coach Jeff Fisher. Fisher had to burn a timeout to get his challenge heard over the roaring crowd in the RCA Dome, but it paid off, as the replay showed Wilkins had stepped out of bounds at his own 33-yard line during the return.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, CBS asked Ball to take My Favorite Husband to {{television}} with co-star Richard Denning. She, however, saw {{a television show}} as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> to work with Desi as it would keep them both in Hollywood, and perhaps save their shaky marriage. Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS, which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban. Network executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a vaudeville act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they took on the road with Arnaz's orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball-Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture. At the same time, rival networks NBC, ABC, and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball-Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo.|$|E

25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E
25|$|One {{view is that}} it {{was only}} a partial success for non-caste Hindus (Avarnas) as they gained access only to the roads on three sides of the temple. The fourth and most {{important}} eastern road remained inaccessible to them. It was really a blow to the Christians and Muslims as they lost their previously enjoyed freedom to have complete access on all the roads around the temple. Now the eastern road was blocked to them. Because of the gates, which remained closed the members of the Devaswam Board and the inmates of the temple who used the eastern road as thoroughfare were denied the opportunity. Anyway, it was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the Indian National Congress party to grow in Kerala. Before this agitation, the Congress in Kerala was {{only a limited number of}} Upper Caste and Upper class people of Malabar (which was under British Rule). The Avarnas did not bother about the Congress, as the Congress leaders did not show any enthusiasm for the eradication of social inequalities. But when the party undertook to lead the agitation at Vaikom, the Avarnas underwent a sea of changes. At the exhortation of T. K. Madhavan, they joined the Congress en masse. The Congress swelled from being a class party to a mass party.|$|E
500|$|... "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] {{was written}} by Ian Maxtone-Graham and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon {{as part of the}} eleventh season of the show (1999–2000). When the writing staff conceived the idea for the speedway parts, they were thinking that it would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> for them to get several NASCAR drivers to make guest appearances in the episode. However, according to Scully, they could not get a single one because [...] "they were all concerned about the way we were portraying NASCAR". Speedway racing is depicted in a negative light in the episode, with an overemphasis on crashes.|$|E
