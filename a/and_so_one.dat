25|$|To canonically {{quantize}} Chern–Simons theory one {{defines a}} state on each 2-dimensional surface Σ in M. As in any quantum field theory, the states correspond to rays in a Hilbert space. There is no preferred notion {{of time in}} a Schwarz-type topological field theory <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> can require that Σ be a Cauchy surface, in fact, a state can be defined on any surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{anomalous}} {{dimensions in}} certain two-dimensional CFTs {{can be related}} to the typical fractal dimensions of random walks, where the random walks are defined via Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE). As we have seen above, CFTs describe the physics of phase transitions, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> can relate the critical exponents of certain phase transitions to these fractal dimensions. Examples include the 2d critical Ising model and the more general 2d critical Potts model. Relating other 2d CFTs to SLE is an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|Σ is of codimension one, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> may cut M along Σ. After such {{a cutting}} M {{will be a}} {{manifold}} with boundary and in particular classically the dynamics of Σ will be described by a WZW model. Witten has shown that this correspondence holds even quantum mechanically. More precisely, he demonstrated that the Hilbert space of states is always finite-dimensional and can be canonically identified with the space of conformal blocks of the G WZW model at level k. Conformal blocks are locally holomorphic and antiholomorphic factors whose products sum to the correlation functions of a 2-dimensional conformal field theory.|$|E

25|$|According to Jewish teachings, hell is {{not entirely}} physical; rather, it can be {{compared}} to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of God, one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of teshuva (return) are said to be always open, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the Torah.|$|E
25|$|By 1901, the Australian colonies were federated and {{formally}} {{joined together}} {{to become the}} Commonwealth of Australia, {{and the federal government}} assumed all defensive responsibilities. The Federation of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 and as of that time the constitution of Australia stated that all defence responsibility was vested in the Commonwealth government. Co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean {{was one of the main}} reasons for federation, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> of the first decisions made by the newly formed Commonwealth government was to create the Department of Defence which came into being on 1 March 1901. From that time the Australian Army came into being under the command of Major General Sir Edward Hutton, and all of the colonial forces, including those then on active service in South Africa, transferred into the Australian Army.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{valuable}} {{minerals and}} rocks {{are referred to}} as industrial minerals. For example, muscovite, a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator. Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or cassiterite (SnO2), an ore of tin. Gems are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, ruby and sapphire are both corundum, Al2O3.|$|E

25|$|Oceans, seas, {{lakes and}} other bodies of liquids can be {{composed}} of liquids other than water, for example the hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. The possibility of seas of nitrogen on Triton was also considered but ruled out. There {{is evidence that the}} icy surfaces of the moons Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan and Enceladus are shells floating on oceans of very dense liquid water or water–ammonia. Earth is often called the ocean planet because it is 70% covered in water. Extrasolar terrestrial planets that are extremely close to their parent star will be tidally locked <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> half of the planet will be a magma ocean. It is also possible that terrestrial planets had magma oceans at some point during their formation as a result of giant impacts. Hot Neptunes close to their star could lose their atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape, leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface. Where there are suitable temperatures and pressures, volatile chemicals that might exist as liquids in abundant quantities on planets include ammonia, argon, carbon disulfide, ethane, hydrazine, hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, neon, nitrogen, nitric oxide, phosphine, silane, sulfuric acid, and water.|$|E

2500|$|Modular {{representations}} of a finite group G are representations over a field whose characteristic is not coprime to |G|, so that Maschke's theorem no longer holds (because |G| is not invertible in F <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>one</b> cannot divide by it).
