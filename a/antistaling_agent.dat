40|$|The gene {{encoding}} the cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) of Paenibacillus pabuli US 132, {{previously described}} as efficient <b>antistaling</b> <b>agent</b> and good candidate for cyclodextrins production, was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Sequence {{analysis showed that}} the mature enzyme (684 amino acids) was preceded by a signal peptide of 34 residues. The enzyme exhibited the highest identity (94 %) to the ÃŽÂ²-CGTase of Bacillus circulans no. 8. The production of the recombinant CGTase, as active form, was very low (about 1 Ã¢Â€Â‰U/mL) in shake flasks at 37 Ã¢ÂˆÂ˜C. This production reached 22 Ã¢Â€Â‰U/mL after 22 Ã¢Â€Â‰hours of induction by mainly shifting the postinduction temperature from 37 to 19 Ã¢ÂˆÂ˜C and using 2 TY instead of LB medium. High enzyme production (35 Ã¢Â€Â‰U/mL) was attained after 18 Ã¢Â€Â‰hours of induction in fermentor using the same culture conditions as in shake flask. The recombinant enzyme showed VmaxÃ¢ÂÂ¡ and Km values of 253 Ã‚Â± 36 Ã¢Â€Â‰ÃŽÂ¼mol of ÃŽÂ²-cyclodextrin/mg/min and 0. 36 Ã‚Â± 0. 18 Ã¢Â€Â‰g/L, respectively...|$|E

However, gluten-free breads are still characterized by a poor structure and overall mediocre quality. This research was aimed at determining the impact of egg addition as well as an <b>antistaling</b> <b>agent</b> (DATEM) on the quality of a batter-based gluten-free sorghum bread. Gluten-free bread loaves containing 20, 25, or 30 % eggs (as is) on a flour basis were evaluated against a control (no egg). The impact of the <b>antistaling</b> <b>agent,</b> DATEM at 0. 5 % was also studied for each of these formulations. Quality factors evaluated included water activity, color, specific volume, and cell size. Texture profile analysis was performed to evaluate staling rate based on changes in crumb hardness values and a trained panel evaluated staling attributes by descriptive analysis. Finally, a consumer acceptance test on sorghum bread with and without eggs was also conducted. Results showed that sorghum breads with eggs had higher specific volumes than control (increase from 0. 06 cm[superscript] 3 /g to 0. 11 cm[superscript] 3 /g), while DATEM had a negative effect on the volume of gluten-free bread (decrease of 0. 73 cm[superscript] 3 /g). Eggs also improved cell structure and produced significantly darker crust (p< 0. 05). Additionally, the addition of eggs reduced bread hardness (from 54 g force to 142 g force on fresh bread) and slowed the rate of staling over the 12 day storage period studied. Descriptive analysis results confirmed the findings of the texture analysis, showing control bread significantly harder (p< 0. 05) than egg-containing bread at days 0 and 4. The consumer test indicated a significant preference (p< 0. 05) for sorghum bread with eggs over the control. The overall acceptability score for this bread was above 6 on a 1 to 9 hedonic scale. The score was closer to 7 when the bread was rated by consumers with celiac disease. This research proved that the addition of eggs to a gluten-free sorghum bread formulation resulted in delayed staling and better overall quality and acceptability of the product...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryYong Cheng ShiMaltogenic {{amylases}} {{are widely}} {{being used as}} an <b>antistaling</b> <b>agent</b> in baking industry. However, their action on starch in granular, swelled and dispersed forms, important components formed during bread baking, is largely unknown. Actions of two maltogenic amylases- A and -B on waxy maize starch (WMS) (100 % amylopectin) and normal wheat starch (NWS) (~ 25 % amylose) were studied and compared. For any given starch type, starch form, and hydrolysis time, maltogenic amylase-B hydrolyzed both starches more than maltogenic amylase-A as seen through sugar profile analysis indicating its higher degree of multiple attack action (DMA). Their action on non reducing ends blocked compound, p nitrophenol maltoheptaoside, confirmed their endo action. Maltogenic amylase-B showed a higher endo to total enzyme activity ratio than maltogenic amylase-A at any given enzyme weight. Greater MW reduction of dispersed starches by maltogenic amylase-B indicates its higher level of inner chain attack (LICA). Interestingly, MW distributions profiles of swelled starch hydrolysates did not show significant differences irrespective of swelling temperatures. Both enzymes showed differences in oligosaccharides compositions in dispersed and swelled starches’ reaction mixtures with sugars of degree of polymerization (DP) > 2 being degraded to glucose and maltose during later stages. For granular starches, enzymes followed a random pattern of formation and degradation of sugars with DP > 2. MW distributions of hydrolyzed granular starches did not show significant shift until {{at the end of}} 24 h when a low MW peak was observed. Morphological study of granular starches showed that maltogenic amylase-A mainly caused pinholes on WMS while maltogenic amylase-B caused surface corrosion with fewer pinholes. For NWS, both enzymes degraded A granules with deep cavities formation during later stages. A decrease in crystallinity of granular starches means that enzymes were able to hydrolyze both amorphous and crystalline regions. These results indicate that maltogenic amylase-B with a high LICA and high DMA possesses a better starch binding domain which can decrease the starch MW without affecting bread resilience. Strucuture of maltogenic amylase-A modified amylopectin (AP) in relation to its retrogradation was also studied. AP retrogradation was completely inhibited at % DH ≥ 20. MW and chain length distributions of debranched residual AP indicated with increase in % DH, a high proportion of unit chains with DP ≤ 9 and low proportion of unit chains with DP ≥ 17 were formed. Higher proportion of short outer AP chains which cannot participate in double helices formation supports the decrease and eventually complete inhibition of retrogradation. Thus, maltogenic amylase-A can play a very powerful role in inhibiting starch retrogradation even at limited DH (%) ...|$|E
40|$|Cyclodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTases) are industrially {{important}} {{enzymes that}} produce cyclic alpha-(1, 4) -linked oligosaccharides (cyclodextrins) from starch. Cyclodextrin glucanotransferases are also applied as catalysts in {{the synthesis of}} glycosylated molecules and can act as <b>antistaling</b> <b>agents</b> in the baking industry. To improve the performance of CGTases in these various applications, protein engineers are screening for CGTase variants with higher product yields, improved CD size specificity, etc. In this review, {{we focus on the}} strategies employed in obtaining CGTases with new or enhanced enzymatic capabilities by searching for new enzymes and improving existing enzymatic activities via protein engineering...|$|R

Together with diglycerides, monoglycerides are commonly added to commercial food products in small quantities as E471, which helps to prevent mixtures of oils and water from separating. The values given in the nutritional labels for total fat, saturated fat, and trans fat do not include those present in mono- and diglycerides as fats are defined as being triglycerides. They are also often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. In bakery products, monoglycerides are useful in improving loaf volume and texture, and as <b>antistaling</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
40|$|Differ ent {{concentrations}} (1. 2 - 3. 6 %) of maltodextrin preparations {{with average}} degrees of polymerization (DP) varying between 4 and 66 reduced the {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) staling endotherm in baked and stored (7 days, 23 degrees C) bread doughs from 3. 4 mJ/mg to values within a 3. 0 - 1. 9 mJ/mg range. Commercial enzymes used in industrial practice as <b>antistaling</b> <b>agents</b> for bread also reduced amylopectin retrogradation. This suggested that the maltodextrins used are promising antistaling components and that the staling of bread and amylopectin retrogradation are related phenomena. In addition, the results obtained suggest that starch hydrolysis products resulting from enzymic attack may well {{be responsible for the}} antistaling effect induced by antistaling enzymes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the use of}} {{additives}} {{has become}} a common practice in the baking industry. In this paper, the relevance two groups of these compounds (emulsifiers and hydrocolloids) for bakery applications are described. Emulsifiers are commonly added to commercial bakery products to improve bread quality and dough handling characteristics. Some frequently used emulsifiers are diacetyl tartaric acid esters of monodiglycerides and lecithin, which are known as dough improvers, and monoacylglycerols, which are applied as <b>antistaling</b> <b>agents</b> or crumb softeners. Food hydrocolloids are high-molecular weight hydrophylic biopolymers used as functional ingredients in the food industry. In the baked goods, hydrocolloids {{have been used for}} retarding the staling and for improving the quality of the fresh products. They help to minimize the negative effects of the freezing and frozen storage. An improvement in wheat dough stability during proofing can be obtained by the addition of sodium alginate, κ-carrageenan and xanthan gum. Carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and alginate can be added as anti-staling agents that retarded crumb firming...|$|R
