40|$|This article explores NATO’s support {{mission to}} the African Union’s {{peacekeeping}} operation in Darfur, Sudan between 2005 and 2007.

In this essay, a poststructuralist practice-oriented approach is used to understand {{the way in which}} discursive practices progressively establish a policy option as ‘natural’ in a given situation. It is argued that the normalization of NATO’s support {{mission to the}} African Union in Darfur and the integration of this operation in NATO’s security identity were the result of complex and conflict-ridden social interactions between different discursive practices supported by different actors.

2500|$|On 6 April 2014, in {{the wake}} of the 2014 Crimean crisis, Zeman called for strong action to be taken, {{possibly}} including sending NATO forces into Ukraine, if Russia tried to annex the eastern part of the country. Speaking on a radio show he said that, [...] "The moment Russia decides to widen its territorial expansion to the eastern part of Ukraine, that is where the fun ends. There I would plead not only for the strictest EU sanctions, but even for military readiness of the North <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Alliance,</b> like for example NATO forces entering Ukrainian territory." [...] The Czech Republic has been a NATO member since 1999, when Zeman was prime minister. In the Czech constitutional system it is the government that has the main responsibility for foreign policy, although the President is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The ČSSD government of Bohuslav Sobotka resisted strong EU sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea, because of the negative economic impact of such a step on the country.|$|E

Schmidt, {{a strong supporter of}} the European Community (EC) and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>alliance,</b> emphasized his commitment to [...] "the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA". Throughout the 1970s, the Red Army Faction had continued its terrorist campaign, assassinating or kidnapping politicians, judges, businessmen, and policemen. The highpoint of the RAF violence came with the German Autumn in autumn 1977. The industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer was kidnapped on 5 September 1977 in order to force the government to free the imprisoned leaders of the Baader-Meinhof Gang. A group from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked Lufthansa Flight 181 to seize further hostages to free the RAF leaders. On 18 October 1977, the Lufthansa jet was stormed in Mogadishu by the GSG 9 commando unit, who were able to free the hostages. The same day, the leaders of the Baader-Meinhof gang, who had been waging a hunger strike, starved themselves to death, which led to Schleyer being executed by his captors. The Red Army Faction was to continue its terrorist campaign into the 1990s, but the German Autumn of 1977 was the highpoint of its campaign. That the Federal Republic had faced a crisis caused by a terrorist campaign from the radical left without succumbing to dictatorship as many feared that it would, was seen as vindication of the strength of German democracy.|$|E
2500|$|Altogether, around 8 million ethnic German {{refugees}} and expellees from across Europe eventually settled in West Germany, with a further 3 million in East Germany. [...] In West Germany these represented a major voting block; maintaining a strong culture of grievance and victimhood against Soviet Power, pressing for a continued commitment to full German reunification, claiming compensation, pursuing {{the right of}} return to lost property in the East, and opposing any recognition of the postwar extension of Poland and the Soviet Union into former German lands. Due to the Cold War rhetoric and successful political machinations of Konrad Adenauer, this block eventually became substantially aligned with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany; although in practice 'westward-looking' CDU policies favouring the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the European Union worked against the possibility of achieving {{the objectives of the}} expellee population from the east through negotiation with the Soviet Union. But for Adenauer, fostering and encouraging unrealistic demands and uncompromising expectations amongst the expellees would serve his [...] "Policy of Strength" [...] by which West Germany contrived to inhibit consideration of unification or a final Peace Treaty until the West was strong enough to face the Soviets on equal terms. Consequently, the Federal Republic in the 1950s adopted much of the symbolism of expellee groups; especially in appropriating and subverting the terminology and imagery of the Holocaust; applying this to post-war German experience instead. [...] Eventually in 1990, following the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany, the unified Germany indeed confirmed in treaties with Poland and the Soviet Union that the transfer of sovereignty over the former German eastern territories in 1945 had been permanent and irreversible; Germany now undertaking never again to make territorial claims in respect of these lands.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe central issue defining the European security debate concerns {{the future of}} Central and Eastern European countries currently outside of any durable military or political security arrangement.

Based upon the 1949 Washington Treaty and the 1967 Harmel Report, members have agreed to "safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization [...] . founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. " NATO has accomplished this goal by adhering to the dual approaches of attempting to settle disputes by political means while maintaining a strong military deterrent. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Alliance's</b> raison d'etre into the twenty-first century will hinge upon its ability to take on new missions and new members.

As the US, Great Britain and the USSR drew near the conclusion of a treaty, two of the key Western European allies, namely West Germany and Italy, displayed a growing resentment towards what they saw as an unprecedented turnaround, and forced the Johnson administration to adjust to at least some of their requests before they joined the NPT. After a brief survey of the early phase of the NPT negotiations, the chapter focuses on the crucial period between late 1966 and early 1968, when the US reached an agreement with the Soviet Union for a joint draft treaty. In a second paragraph, the chapter explores the criticism levelled by West Germany and Italy against the Soviet-American draft. Particular attention is given to the Italian-German bilateral discussions, in which representatives of the two governments frankly expressed their disappointment at the evolution of the NPT talks. A final paragraph looks more in depth at the motivations of this hostile attitude and also tries to interpret the significance of this episode for the evolution of the alliance. ...|$|R
