5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in <b>axenic</b> culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} capable of decomposing {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) as well, such as organochlorides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Species such as Suillus variegatus and Paxillus involutus were able to mineralize 2,4-dichlorophenol both in <b>axenic</b> culture and in an EcM association with Pinus sylvestris. The intact rhizosphere of Pinus taeda also exhibited the capacity to mineralize tetrachloroethylene under natural conditions. The EcM fungi Radiigera atrogleba and Hysterangium garneri were capable of decomposing up to 80% of a particular PCB when tested.|$|E
500|$|The {{mycelium}} of Tylopilus felleus can {{be grown}} in <b>axenic</b> culture, on agar containing growth medium. The fungus can form fruit bodies if the temperature is suitable, and the light conditions simulate a 12-hour day. The mushrooms are usually deformed, often lacking stalks so that the cap grows directly on the surface, and the caps are usually [...] in diameter. There are few Boletaceae species known to fruit in culture, as ectomycorrhizal fungi tend to not fruit when separated from their host plant.|$|E
500|$|Escobar grew {{cultures}} of the fungus by placing fresh fruit bodies on agar containing growth medium with an extract of horse dung. The tips of the hyphae were used to obtain <b>axenic</b> cultures; the fungus can grow {{on a variety of}} media commonly used to grow fungi in the laboratory. Depending on the composition of the growth media, fruit bodies were formed as early as eight days after initiating, when grown at [...] and under dim light. When minute agar blocks containing mycelium were submerged in distilled water, mycelial strands grew towards the water surface and eventually gave rise to floating fruit bodies connected to the parent agar block by strands of hyphae.|$|E
500|$|Many fungy have an asexual {{stage in}} their life cycle, in which they {{propagate}} via asexual spores called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. [...] In 2004, researchers reported a connection between C.geaster {{and the appearance of}} blackish-brown tufted structures on rotting wood. By comparing the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA from the two organisms, they established a phylogenetic connection between Chorioactis and the fungus they called Conoplea aff. elegantula. However, they were unable to induce the new organism to grow on artificial media, and did not definitively establish a teleomorph-anamorph connection between the fungi. In 2009, Japanese researchers found a similar fungus growing on rotting logs that were normally associated with the growth of C.geaster; they were able to grow the organism in <b>axenic</b> cultures from single-spore isolates of C.geaster. Until the one fungus, one name rule was enacted in 2011, the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permitted the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph(s). So Nagao et al named the anamorph Kumanasamuha geaster due to its morphological similarity with species in the genus Kumanasamuha.|$|E
50|$|In biology, <b>axenic</b> {{describes}} {{the state of}} {{a culture in which}} only a single species, variety, or strain of organism is present and entirely free of all other contaminating organisms. The earliest <b>axenic</b> cultures were of bacteria or unicellular eukaryotes, but <b>axenic</b> cultures of many multicellular organisms are also possible. <b>Axenic</b> culture is also an important tool for the study of symbiotic and parasitic organisms in a controlled manner.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Axenic</b> {{cultures}} are usually checked routinely {{to ensure that}} they remain <b>axenic.</b> One standard approach with microorganisms is to spread a sample of the culture onto an agar plate, and to incubate this for a fixed period of time. The agar should be an enriched medium that will support the growth of common [...] "contaminating" [...] organisms. Such [...] "contaminating" [...] organisms will grow on the plate during this period, identifying cultures that are no longer <b>axenic.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Axenic</b> {{cultures}} of microorganisms are typically prepared by subculture {{of an existing}} mixed culture. This may involve use of a dilution series, in which a culture is successively diluted {{to the point where}} subsamples of it contain only a few individual organisms, ideally only a single individual (in the case of an asexual species). These subcultures are allowed to grow until the identity of their constituent organisms can be ascertained. Selection of those cultures consisting solely of the desired organism produces the <b>axenic</b> culture. Subculture selection may also involve manually sampling the target organism from an uncontaminated growth front in an otherwise mixed culture, and using this as an [...] source for the subculture.|$|E

50|$|The <b>axenic</b> {{culture of}} some {{pathogens}} is complicated because they normally thrive within host tissues which exhibit properties {{that are difficult}} to replicate in vitro. This is especially true in the case of intracellular pathogens. However, careful replication of key features of the host environment can resolve these difficulties (e.g. host metabolites, dissolved oxygen), such as with the Q fever pathogen, Coxiella burnetii.|$|E
50|$|Since E. histolytica {{does not}} form cysts {{in the absence}} of bacteria, E. invadens has become used as a model for encystation studies as it will form cysts under <b>axenic</b> growth conditions, which {{simplifies}} analysis.

On completion of encystation, predominantly tetra-nucleate cysts are formed along with some uni-, bi- and tri-nucleate cysts.|$|E

50|$|As <b>axenic</b> {{cultures}} {{are derived from}} very few organisms, or even a single individual, they are useful because the organisms present within them share a relatively narrow gene pool. In {{the case of an}} asexual species derived from a single individual, the resulting culture should consist of identical organisms (though processes such as mutation and horizontal gene transfer may introduce a degree of variability). Consequently, they will generally respond in a more uniform and reproducible fashion, simplifying the interpretation of experiments.|$|E
50|$|Resolving a well-supported monophyly of the Zoopagomycotina {{has been}} {{particularly}} challenging for several main reasons: 1) most species of Zoopagomycotina are microscopic and challenging to observe, 2) most species of Zoopagomycotina cannot be grown separately from their host organisms in <b>axenic</b> culture, so obtaining pure DNA for molecular studies is challenging, and 3) based on ribosomal DNA sequences, species of Zoopagomycotina may have undergone accelerated evolution, so grouping may be skewed by long-branch attraction (LBA) and a high frequency of parallel evolutionary changes.|$|E

5000|$|Amoebidium parasiticum was {{the first}} trichomycete (a group of {{microscopic}} fungi and protists found in symbiotic association with aquatic arthropods) to be obtained in <b>axenic</b> culture, allowing for detailed studies of its nutritional requirements, cell wall composition, and conditions that induce amoebagenesis (formation and release of the dispersal amoebae) {{as well as providing}} pure tissue for DNA extraction. Several important characteristics were discovered from these studies. Firstly, Amoebidium was originally tentatively placed within Kingdom Fungi, but its actual relatedness to fungi was questioned due to the formation of amoeboid cells (a character not observed among fungi). [...] When the cell wall composition of A. parasiticum was analyzed, there was no chitin or cellulose detected, a result that supported the non-relatedness of Amoebidium to fungi. [...] Secondly, experimentation on the nutritional requirements of A. parasiticum lead to the development of various media recipes that enabled the culturing of other trichomycete species. [...] Thirdly, researchers had noted that amoebagenesis appeared to be triggered by ecdysis or death of the host arthropod based on their observations during dissections. [...] Experiments with A. parasiticum cultures supported these observations by showing that amoebagenesis could be induced by incubating Amoebidium thalli with a homogenate of the host (Daphnia) supplemented with various combinations of amino acids and vitamins. [...] Finally, collection of trichomycete DNA for molecular phylogenetic analysis is very challenging due to contaminating DNA from the host, bacteria, and other symbionts and food items residing in the host gut at the time of dissection. Therefore, <b>axenic</b> cultures of trichomycetes are highly valuable for obtaining pure DNA samples. As a result, the phylogenetic position of A. parasiticum was finally resolved in 2000 when molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that it clearly was not related to fungi, but instead belonged with a group of protists in the Mesomycetozoea (at the time referred to as the DRIP clade). Amoebidium appalachense was also obtained in <b>axenic</b> culture, and subsequent molecular analyses supported its relationship with A. parasiticum and other Mesomycetozoea.|$|E

Ellsworth Dougherty proposed in 1948 that free-living nematodes of the sub-order Rhabditina {{might be useful}} for genetic study, noting their relative structural simplicity and invariant cell lineage (eutely). Dougherty and Victor Nigon obtained the first mutant, from a laboratory culture of the closely related nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae.

50|$|The Showy Lady's Slipper is {{a popular}} plant among orchid {{collectors}} for its color and structure.

50|$|In the field, to the eye, Loreleia is most {{similar to}} Rickenella {{because of the}} orangish colors and omphalinoid shape, but microscopically it differs {{by the absence of}} cystidia that in Rickenella make the latter {{minutely}} fuzzy as seen with a hand lens. Loreleia penetrates the rhizoids of liverworts and may form a type of symbiosis with them, but in <b>axenic</b> culture tests, L. marchantiae killed Marchantia polymorpha when directly inoculated in contrast to the absence of necrosis in nature in situ. In nature Loreleia often occur in wet areas such as seepages with their hosts, Marchantia.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{essential}} to isolate a pure culture of microorganisms. A pure (or <b>axenic)</b> {{culture is a}} population of cells or multicellular organisms growing {{in the absence of}} other species or types. A pure culture may originate from a single cell or single organism, in which case the cells are genetic clones of one another. For the purpose of gelling the microbial culture, the medium of agarose gel (agar) is used. Agar is a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed. A cheap substitute for agar is guar gum, which can be used for the isolation and maintenance of thermophiles.|$|E
