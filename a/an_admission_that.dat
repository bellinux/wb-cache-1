5|$|There was no Whig platform—the {{party leaders}} decided {{that trying to}} put one {{together}} would tear the party apart. So the Whigs ran on their opposition to Van Buren, blaming him and his Democrats for the recession. In campaign materials, Tyler was praised for integrity in resigning over the state legislature's instructions. The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler, lest they make policy statements that alienated segments of the party. But after Tyler's Democratic rival, Vice President Johnson, made a successful speaking tour, Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to Columbus, Ohio, and there address a local convention, in a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison's views. In his journey of nearly two months, Tyler made speeches at rallies. He could not avoid questions, and after being heckled into <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>that</b> he supported the Compromise Tariff (many Whigs did not), resorted to quoting from Harrison's vague speeches. In his two-hour speech at Columbus, Tyler entirely avoided {{the issue of the}} Bank of the United States, one of the major questions of the day.|$|E

In an extensive interview with Régis Debray in 1972, Allende explained his reasons for agreeing to the guarantees.

25|$|The United Nations {{responded to}} the Iranian government's accusations by stating {{that there has been}} no {{evidence}} of Iran's claims and that the Bahá'í community in Iran professes its allegiance to the state. The United Nations pointed to the Bahá'í teaching of obedience to the government of one's country and stated that any involvement in any subversive acts against the government would be antithetical to precepts of the Bahá'í religion. The United Nations also stated that if the Iranian government did acknowledge that the Bahá'í Faith is a religion, it would be <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>that</b> freedom of religion does not apply to all in Iran and that it is not abiding by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenants on Human Rights to which it is a signatory.|$|E
500|$|For sequencing, {{the band}} decided that each band member would be {{allocated}} {{a side of}} the record, an arrangement inspired by Pink Floyd's 1969 double album Ummagumma. The band drew straws to select songs; Hurley won the draw and decided to pick his solo track [...] "You Need the Glory", followed by Boon and Watt.

500|$|Thích Tịnh Khiết, the 80-year-old Buddhist patriarch, {{was seized}} {{and taken to}} a {{military}} hospital {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon. As commander of the III Corps, General Đính soon announced military control over Saigon, canceling all commercial flights into the city and instituting press censorship. Later, Thích Quảng Độ, one of the leading arrested monks, who later would become a leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, explained the protest strategy. After being released following the deposal of Diệm, he was asked why the Buddhist leaders had not fled to avoid arrest. He said that [...] "We had done nothing wrong; therefore we could not flee.

500|$|Nolan Feeney of The Atlantic {{argued that}} [...] "Jealous" [...] was both {{one of the}} album's best songs and one of singer's most notable songs overall. Feeney felt that its message was interesting, {{particularly}} during the bridge, [...] "It's not exactly an apology, and it's not exactly <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>that</b> she's somehow responsible for her date (Jay Z, presumably) not showing. But it is, by my count, {{only the second time}} in her solo career that Beyoncé has ever admitted that just maybe it's she who's in the wrong." [...] He went on to say that by moving away from the big and [...] "sweeping" [...] statements present in some of her older material, towards personal narration, Beyoncé managed to effectively examine the themes and statements she explored throughout her career. Feeney concluded by stating: [...] "It's not a breakup anthem, nor is it a declaration of undying love. It's angry, it's introspective, it's regretful, it's playful, it's loving, and it's everything in between." ...|$|E
500|$|When Greenfield {{was asked}} a {{difficult}} question in the legislature, he often leaned over to Brownlee, his seatmate, who supplied him with an answer {{in full view of}} the legislature. Many UFA members found this practice humiliating. [...] Brownlee's importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in 1922. Brownlee was on vacation in Victoria during a special sitting of the legislature. While his presence was usually considered crucial, the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial, and passed by a large margin. However, once this item was dispensed with, some members complained that the C$100 payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low. Greenfield brought a motion to double it; the amount was increased to $250 in committee. At a time when many farmers earned less than $250 per year, the move cost the UFA dearly in the eyes of its supporters. [...] Many UFA MLAs privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had Brownlee been present. [...] On another occasion, in 1924, Brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness. Boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy, since the Liberals would not raise any difficult issues in his absence. While Brownlee appreciated the gesture, all involved recognized it as <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>that</b> the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman.|$|E

500|$|Austria's allies saw the {{declaration}} as <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>that</b> Austria's diplomatic ambitions had failed, but Metternich {{viewed it as}} one move in a much longer campaign. For {{the rest of the}} war he strove to hold the Coalition together and, as such, to curb Russian momentum in Europe. To this end he won an early victory as an Austrian general, the Prince of Schwarzenberg, was confirmed supreme commander of the Coalition forces rather than Tsar Alexander I. He also succeeded in getting the three allied monarchs (Alexander, Francis and Prussia's Frederick William III) to follow him and their armies on campaign. With the Treaties of Teplitz, Metternich allowed Austria to remain uncommitted over the future of France, Italy, and Poland. He was still confined, however, by the British, who were subsidizing Prussia and Russia (in September Metternich requested subsidies for Austria as well). Meanwhile, the Coalition forces took the offensive. On 18 October 1813 Metternich witnessed the successful Battle of Leipzig and, two days later, he was rewarded for his [...] "wise direction" [...] with the rank of prince (...) [...] Metternich was delighted when Frankfurt was retaken in early November and, in particular, by the deference the Tsar showed Francis at a ceremony organised there by Metternich. Diplomatically, with the war drawing to a close, he remained determined to prevent the creation of a strong, unified German state, even offering Napoleon generous terms in order to retain him as a counterweight. On 2 December 1813 Napoleon agreed to talk, though these talks were delayed by the need for the participation of a more senior British diplomat, (Viscount Castlereagh).|$|E
500|$|While {{the road}} {{building}} went on, Washington pressed Tanacharison for more Indian support. However, the Half King {{seemed to have}} lost confidence in the British cause, {{and he and his}} followers soon abandoned the British camp. This complete loss of Indian support prompted Washington to withdraw his work crews back to Fort Necessity. [...] Not long afterward, a force of 700 French and Indians surrounded the fort, and Washington was soon compelled to surrender. The surrender document that Washington signed prevented his men from returning to the Ohio Country for one year, and included <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>that</b> Jumonville had been [...] "assassinated". (The document was written in French, which Washington could not read, and may have been poorly translated for him.) Because the French claimed that Jumonville's party had been on a diplomatic (rather than military) mission, the [...] "Jumonville affair" [...] became an international incident, and the military escalation that followed blossomed into the global Seven Years' War. [...] Although most Virginians were not particularly critical, there was rumbling about Washington's actions in other quarters. One New Yorker wrote that Washington acted rashly and that he was [...] "too ambitious of acquiring all the honor", while London commentators dismissed the failure casually, citing a lack of colonial military experience. [...] Governor Dinwiddie was publicly supportive of Washington, but criticized him privately, noting that some of the Virginia Regiment's problems originated in a [...] "want of proper Command". [...] Dinwiddie assigned command of a follow-up expedition (that never actually reached the Ohio Country) to North Carolina militia colonel James Innes. In another step that may have been calculated to clip the young colonel's wings, Dinwiddie reorganized the Virginia Regiment into separate companies, with no ranks above captain; Washington resigned rather than accept a demotion.|$|E
