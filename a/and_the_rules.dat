5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his mind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 Tour de France would be decided with a points system. Tour de France 1904 winner Cornet would enter the Tour de France for seven more times, but would never again play an important role.|$|E

In addition, the authors point {{out some of the}} modern challenges that <b>the</b> legal state <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law are faced to, thus acquires rounded picture about transformation of those terms, from the basic idea to the modern theories. Finally, the authors indicates some of the possible tendencies in further development of legal state <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law...|$|R

5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{what was}} {{included}} in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's proposal would ultimately be incorporated into {{the final version of the}} Constitution without debate. Examples of these details included the Speech and Debate Clause, which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> for organizing the House of Representatives and the Senate.|$|E

5|$|The first preview {{screening}} of the 113-minute version of The Rules of the Game took place on June 28, 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience. On June 29 the film was screened for the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts Jean Zay and for the jury of the annual Louis Delluc Prize for the best French film. When the awards were announced ten days later Marcel Carne's Le Quai des brumes won the first prize <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rules</b> of the Game was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir's previous films, The Rules of the Game was highly anticipated and Zay had expected to award it the prize. Renoir later {{said he thought the}} film would be commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|The American Stud Book, the {{registration}} book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much {{later than the}} General Stud Book, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud Book or other national stud books, unlike the General Stud Book rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules. Adding to the problem {{was the fact that}} American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby.|$|E
5|$|Two laps {{from the}} finish of the 1998 British Grand Prix, Schumacher {{was leading the}} race when he was issued a stop-and-go penalty for {{overtaking}} a lapped car (Alexander Wurz) during the early moments of a Safety Car period. This penalty involves going into the pit lane and stopping for 10 seconds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> state that a driver must serve his penalty within three laps of the penalty being issued. On the third lap after receiving the penalty, Schumacher turned into the pit lane to serve his penalty, but as {{this was the last}} lap of the race, and as Ferrari's pit box was located after the start/finish line, Schumacher technically finished the race before serving the penalty. The stewards initially resolved that problem by adding 10 seconds to Schumacher's race time, then later rescinded the penalty completely due to the irregularities in how the penalty had been issued.|$|E
