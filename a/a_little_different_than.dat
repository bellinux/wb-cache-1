40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} {{aircraft}} structure maintenance.

Both scheduled maintenance and condition-based maintenance using SHM are considered for different aircrafts with different lifetimes and timetable inspections. In each case, the aircraft lifecycle cost is evaluated in terms of average number of panels changed.
