25|$|Before jumping, they glue a silk thread to {{the surface}} that they <b>are</b> <b>jumping</b> from so that if they miss the target, they can climb up the thread and try again - However, they may 'abseil' with a silk thread {{if they wish to}} descend from a height safely, for {{instance}} they have been documented 'abseiling' from ceilings. They ignore unappetising insects such as ants.|$|E
25|$|Tearaway Unfolded is an {{expanded}} {{remake of the}} 2013 PlayStation Vita game Tearaway. Like the original, it is a third-person platform game with heavy emphasis on environmental interaction, {{the features of the}} DualShock 4 controller, and quirky creativity. The player navigates the protagonist though environments made almost entirely out of paper, and may complete side-objectives which involve helping non-player characters and the creation of items. The protagonist's main movement options <b>are</b> <b>jumping,</b> grabbing, and rolling.|$|E

25|$|Species-specific defense {{reactions}} (SSDRs) or avoidance {{learning in}} nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, {{it is how}} animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight, fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression, freeze response to threats, which {{is controlled by the}} sympathetic nervous system. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment. These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they <b>are</b> <b>jumping</b> away from, and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake.|$|E

50|$|The Canal Turn is a fence on Aintree Racecourse's National Course {{and thus}} <b>is</b> <b>jumped</b> during the Grand National steeplechase which is held {{annually}} at the racecourse, located near Liverpool, England. Named for the Leeds & Liverpool Canal which passes alongside the racecourse at this point, it <b>is</b> <b>jumped</b> twice during the race, as the eighth and 24th fences.|$|R

50|$|The {{football}} is moved {{by a series}} of jumps over adjacent men. Each <b>jump</b> <b>is</b> to the first vacant point in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally over one or more men. The <b>jumped</b> men <b>are</b> then removed from the board (before any subsequent jump occurs). This process repeats for as long as there remain men available to <b>be</b> <b>jumped</b> and the player desires. <b>Jumping</b> <b>is</b> optional: there is no requirement to jump. In contrast to checkers, multiple men in a row <b>are</b> <b>jumped</b> and removed as a group.|$|R

I have painted my two first pictures, which you like, principally because your face is in one of them, {{but that is a}} short step towards {{becoming}} a great artist. You are like a young lady in love with a curate, and therefore convinced that some day he will be Archbishop of Canterbury, and with almost equally good foundation; however, I shall do my best, and as I shall still have a strong motive for work, and shall have you to spur me on I hope I may make a modest success." ...|$|E
60|$|And the men <b>are</b> <b>jumping.</b> Mr. Pike {{is driving}} with those block-square fists of his, as many a man's face attests. So weak are they, and so terrible is he, that I swear he could whip either watch single-handed. I cannot help but note that Mr. Mellaire refuses {{to take part}} in this driving. Yet I know that he is a trained driver, and that he was not averse to driving {{at the outset of the}} voyage. But now he seems bent on keeping on good terms with the crew. I should like to know what Mr. Pike thinks of it, for he cannot {{possibly}} be blind to what is going on; but I am too well aware of what would happen if I raised the question. He would insult me, snap my head off, and indulge in a three-days' sea-grouch. Things are sad and monotonous enough for Margaret and me in the cabin and at table, without invoking the blight of the mate's displeasure.|$|E

50|$|Very {{different}} from normal games, your pieces start out weak (one jump over them by an opponent will capture them), and are built up by your opponent. Note {{that if you}} capture three enemy pieces with a single piece stack, then when your stack <b>is</b> <b>jumped</b> by an opponent, your opponent will now have a stack that has to <b>be</b> <b>jumped</b> three times to be captured.|$|R
