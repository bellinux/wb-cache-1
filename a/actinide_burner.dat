40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of a minor}} <b>actinide</b> <b>burner</b> can be evaluated by comparing safety and economic parameters to the support ratio. Minor actinicle mass produced per unit time in this number of Light Water Reactors (LWRS) can be burned {{during the same time}} period in one burner system. The larger the support ratio for a given set of safety and economic parameters, the better. To illustrate this concept, the support ratio for selected Liquid Metal Reactor (LMR) burner core designs was compared with corresponding coolant void wortbs, a fundamental safety concern following the Chernobyl accident. Results can be used to evaluate the cost in reduced burning of minor actinides caused by LMR sodium void reduction efforts or to compare wilh other minor <b>actinide</b> <b>burner</b> systems.

Various systems, including existing reactors, fast reactors and advanced systems have been considered to optimise the transmutation scheme. Recently, many countries have shown interest in accelerator-driven systems (ADS) due to their potential for transmutation of minor actinides.

40|$|This study investigates {{actinide}} {{burning in}} a standard lattice PWR. It assumes that after the first loading of depleted uranium, plutonium and minor actinides, only the fission products are removed and only depleted uranium and the plutonium/minor actinide mixture are added. The relative concentrations of plutonium and minor actinide feed are always maintained the same as PWR discharge fuel after 33, 000 MWD/MTU burnup. It is found that the minor actinides act as a burnable absorber. After seven reloading, a burnup of 64, 000 MWD/MTU yields a reactivity change of less than 3 % zik/k.

A strong positive void coefficient is calculated for both sodium and lead/bismuth. This is attributed to the high fraction of americium in the fuel. It is shown that the lead/bismuth-cooled reactor features twice the grace time with respect to fuel or cladding damage compared to the sodium-cooled reactor of comparable core size and power rating.

40|$|Minor {{actinides}} transmutation {{has been}} proposed as an alternative way to the high level radioactive waste depositary problem. Several studies of minor <b>actinide</b> <b>burners</b> promote a fast neutron reactor in which minor actinides can be incinerated efficiently by fission. High quality fast neutron induced reaction cross sections (capture and fission) are crucial to provide reliable neutronic design and fuel assessments. But the existing evaluated data files show that neutron data for Americium and Curium isotopes of interest are often of poor quality. The reasons being: the difficulty of obtaining pure minor actinide samples and their huge D radioactivity complicate direct neutron cross section measurements. We will present an original experimental method that allows overcoming these difficulties. This indirect method consists of measuring the fission probability of a compound nucleus produced via a few-nucleon transfer reaction. The transfer reaction chosen is such that the resulting compound nucleus is on the average {{the same as the}} one that would be formed if a neutron would be directly absorbed by the minor actinide. The neutron-induced fission cross section as a function of neutron energy is then deduced from the product of the measured fission probability with the compound nucleus cross section obtained from semi microscopi...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of radioactive wastes from the nuclear fuel cycle {{has become an}} important issue {{in the development of}} future, more sustainable nuclear energy systems. Partitioning and transmutation (P&T) of actinides and some long-lived fission products could reduce the mass and radiotoxicity of highlevel wastes and possibly ease repository licensing requirements. Influenced by political and technological developments, an increasing number of countries employing nuclear power have become interested in P&T technology which involves the development of new types of critical and/or sub-critical reactors and very efficient fuel cycle strategies. The present thesis is closely connected to two P&T related projects of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris, a numerical benchmark exercise for an accelerator-driven minor <b>actinides</b> <b>burner</b> and a calculational system study on the role of accelerator-driven systems (ADS) and advanced fast reactors (FR) in advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The author co-coordinated the benchmark exercise and performed the comparative analysis of the different "fuel cycle schemes" investigated in the system study. The benchmark exercise contributed to a greater understanding of the physical phenomena characteristic of the transmutation of actinides in a closed fuel cycle, and allowed to test and improve the tools used for modeling ADSs and corresponding advanced fuel cycles. This work thus effectively {{led to the development of}} an efficient and more complete calculational scheme, which has permitted an in-depth and reliable analysis of different transmutation scenarios to be carried out. To quantitatively assess the advantages and drawbacks of transmutation, we considered a limited number of "base" transmutation scenarios which constitute an envelope for various possible transmutation strategies employing fast spectrum systems. We then evaluated, for an equilibrium situation, the main aspects which characterise the different transmutation strategies, such as the nuclear park composition, the mass and toxicity of the waste, the need for natural uranium, the in-pile and out-pile mass inventories and, finally, the fuel cycle requirements. Thus, this study has allowed for the reliable comparison of performances of the three main options in the nuclear waste management, viz. open cycle, recycling of plutonium alone and recycling of all the actinides, as well as an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of ADSs in comparison to advanced critical reactors in the {{management of}} minor actinides or transuranics. The last part of the dissertation is dedicated to a phase-out study for two schemes employing either ADSs or critical reactors. It has been shown thereby that advanced systems, optimised for an equilibrium fuel composition, can indeed be used to reduce the inventory of transuranics. A comparison of ADS and FR performances has been made in this context, and the relative benefits of transmutation have been quantified in each case taking into consideration, more realistically, the residual mass inventory after the shutdown of all nuclear installations...|$|R
40|$|Isotopes of {{transuranic}} elements are produced {{as a result}} of successive radiative capture reactions in the fuel of a nuclear reactor. Typically, these transuranic isotopes decay through long chains, have long half lives and dominate the long term toxicity of the spent reactor fuel. One of the options for waste management is to remove the transuranic from spent fuel by chemical processing, to load them into new special fuel elements, and to transmute them by neutron induced fission into shorter-lived fission fragments. Previous studies have shown the feasibility of actinide transmutation in either Light Water Reactors or Liquid Metal Fast Reactors. Due to the anticipated high transuranic loadings in the fuel of <b>actinide</b> <b>burner</b> reactors, the neutronic properties of the transuranic isotopes will {{have a significant effect on}} the operational and safety characteristics of such reactors.

40|$|Cost of {{electricity}} {{is the key}} factor that determines competitiveness of a power plant. Thus the proper selection, design and optimization of the electric power generating cycle is of main importance. This report makes an assessment of power generation of the <b>Actinide</b> <b>Burner</b> Reactor (MABR). The reactor is a fast reactor cooled by lead bismuth eutectic. As a reference plant for capital cost evaluation, the Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor (ALMR) reactor was used based on its 1994 capital and busbar cost estimates. Two balance of plant schemes have been evaluated - a steam cycle and a helium cycle. For the steam cycle, the reference plant is the ALMR steam cycle and for the helium cycle the power generating side of the Modular High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (MHTGR) was used. To identify the basic core design values, a hot channel analysis of the forced cooled core was performed. A scoping design study of the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) for the helium cycle and the steam generator (SG) for the steam cycle was also carried out. Both were designed using the ALMR IHX as a base case in order to match the modularity criteria imposed on the reactor design and keep the MABR design {{as close to the}} reference plant as possible. The estimated cost {{of electricity}} for the helium cycle varies from 43. 3 to 62. 2 mills/kWhe, for the steam cycle from 30. 5 to 33. 3 mills/kWhe.

The chapter is divided into eight different sections starting with introduction section (Section 1) where the general characteristic of the molten salt reactor is described, followed by the report (Section 2) about the historical develop ments of this reactor concept with the main emphasis on the work performed in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1960 's and 1970 's. Section 3 briefly shows the current molten salt reactor concepts and their applications as either breeder designs or <b>actinide</b> <b>burner</b> concepts for management of the long lived actinides. Section 4 summarizes the physico-chemical properties of typical fuel and coolant choices based on the critical evaluation of available experimental data of the uoride systems. This part is divided into several subsections according to the properties discussed, first briefly describing the structure of the uoride liquids, followed by the description of various phase diagrams. Furthermore the solubility of actinide uorides in the fuel matrix is given as well as the information about the density, viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity and the vapour pressure. One of the key issues is the understanding of the fuel behaviour under irradiating conditions. This will be briefly discussed in Section 7. Section 8 is related to the fission products and its behaviour in the uoride fuel matrix with respect to its solubility and Section 9 will address the corrosion aspects of the fuel salt on the structural materials.

40|$|The nuclear {{reactors}} currently in operation utilise {{only a small}} fraction of the available natural uranium. By continuing in this track, known resources will be depleted too soon. Furthermore, Light Water Reactors (LWR) need to be shut down periodically so that refueling can take place. On top of that, their spent fuel must be safely stored for thousands of years. These unfortunate facts call for {{nuclear reactors}} which can convert non-fissile isotopes to fissile ones and produce less long-lived transuranic elements. Such a reactor is the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). In this project in-house developed codes were used for neutronics (DALTON) and burnup (LOWFAT) calculations. The isotopic evolution of nuclides in the core and in the fertile blanket was simulated for two different initial core loadings: a mixture containing 233 U as the fissile material and a mixture with transuranium elements (TRU) produced by a LWR. Moreover, the transition from the second configuration (<b>actinide</b> <b>burner)</b> to the first one was investigated. The results showed a huge reduction in the share of the initial isotopes for the TRU-started MSFR after one century of operation. The amount of 233 U in the reactor core at that time is equal to the amount needed to create an initial inventory of a 233 U-started MSFR, while the 233 U to keep the reactor critical can be covered by the 233 U bred by the 233 Pa extraction from the fertile blanket. Both these facts lead to the conclusion that a transition from a burner to a breeder MSFR is possible.

LLNL's efforts in FY 06 included: (1) Development of a systems code for Z-IFE and use of the code to examine the operating parameter space in terms of design variables such as the Z-pinch driver energy, the chamber pulse repetition rate, the number of chambers making up the power plant, and the total net electric power of the plant.

40|$|The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR&PP) Working Group has {{developed}} a methodology for the PR&PP evaluation of advanced nuclear energy systems. The methodology is organised as a progressive approach applying alternative methods {{at different levels of}} thoroughness as more design information becomes available and research improves the depth of technical knowledge. The GIF Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR&PP) Working Group developed a notional sodium cooled fast neutron nuclear reactor, named the Example Sodium Fast Reactor (ESFR), for use in developing and testing the methodology. The ESFR is a hypothetical nuclear energy system consisting of four sodium-cooled fast reactors of medium size, co-located with an on-site dry fuel storage facility and a Fuel Cycle Facility with pyrochemical processing of the spent fuel and re-fabrication of new ESFR fuel elements. The baseline design is an <b>actinide</b> <b>burner,</b> with LWR spent fuel elements as feed material processed on the site. In the years 2007 and 2008 the GIF PR&PP Working Group performed a case study designed to both test the methodology and demonstrate how it can provide useful feedback to designers even during pre-conceptual design. The Study analysed the response of the entire ESFR system to different proliferation and theft strategies. Three proliferation threats were considered: Concealed diversion, Concealed Misuse and Abrogation. An overt theft threat was also studied. One of the objectives of the case study is to confirm the capability of the methodology to capture PR&PP differences among varied design configurations. To this aim Design Variations (DV) have been also defined corresponding respectively to a) a small variation of the baseline design (DV 0), b) a deep burner configuration (DV 1), c) a self sufficient core (DV 2), and c) a breeder configuration (DV 3). This paper builds on the approach followed for the qualitative assessment of the ESFR baseline design for a misuse scenario, and presents both the approach and the results of the assessment for the design variations DV 0 and DV 1.

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of fertile free fast lead-cooled modular reactors as efficient incinerators of plutonium and minor actinides (MAs) for application to dedicated fuel cycles for transmutation. A methodology is developed that assesses the actinide incineration performance of several transmutation fuel cycles, both single and multi-tiered, {{on the basis of}} performance indicators related to the reduction of actinide mass at the repository and economics. Application of the methodology indicates that fast fertile-free critical reactors that bum plutonium and MAs applied to both one-tier and two-tier fuel cycles with fuel reprocessing have the potential to be more economical than other dedicated systems like the ATW. Hence the thesis studies two lead-cooled critical reactors that employ fertile-free fuel as possible candidates. The two designs proposed are: an <b>actinide</b> <b>burner</b> reactor (ABR), designed to incinerate mostly plutonium and some MAs from the spent fuel of the conventional LWR fleet, and a minor a ctinide buumer reactor (MABR), devoted to bum mostly minor actinides and some plutonium both recycled from the burner and produced by the LWR fleet that should be integrated in a two-tier fuel cycle where most of the plutonium is fed back to advanced thermal reactors or conventional fast reactors (first tier) for incineration. These designs incorporate several advanced technical solutions such as fuel assemblies with streaming elements, double-entry control rods and special absorbing materials that establish favorable neutronics characteristics and excellent self-controllability features, comparable to those of the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) core. (cont.) Specifically, the designs achieve (a) negative reactivity feedbacks based on coolant voiding, Doppler and fuel and core structure thermal expansion effects; (b) satisfactory values for the effective delayed neutron fractions, comparable to those reported for the IFR; (c) proliferation resistance with dilution of the plutonium vector, which is practically unusable for nuclear weapons fabrication. The safety features of these designs is assessed by applying a thermal-hydraulic code that simulates the worst accident scenarios envisaged for the burners. Application of the fuel cycle methodology to both designs shows that a) deployment of the MABR as the burner in the two-tier fuel cycle is the most efficient strategy to manage actinides and that b) both designs yield lower fuel cycle costs compared to the subcritical reactors. by Antonino Romano.

40|$|The AFR- 300, Advanced Fast Reactor (300 Mwe), {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a Generation IV concept. It {{could also be used}} to dispose of surplus weapons grade plutonium or as an <b>actinide</b> <b>burner</b> for transmutation of high level radioactive waste. AFR- 300 uses metallic fuel and sodium coolant. The design of AFR- 300 takes account of the successful design and operation of EBR-II, but the AFR- 300 design includes a number of advances such as an advanced fuel cycle, inspectability and improved economics. One significant difference between AFR- 300 and EBR-II is that AFR- 300 is considerably larger. Another significant difference is that AFR- 300 has no auxiliary EM pump in the primary loop to guarantee positive core flow when the main primary pumps are shut down. Thus, one question that has come up in connection with the AFR- 300 design is whether natural circulation flow is sufficient to prevent damage to the core if the primary pumps fail. Insufficient natural circulation flow through the core could result in high cladding temperatures and cladding failure due to eutectic penetration of the cladding by the metal fuel. The rate of eutectic penetration of the cladding is strongly temperature dependent, so cladding failure depends on how hot the cladding gets and how long it is at elevated temperatures. To investigate the adequacy of natural circulation flow, a number of pump failure transients and a number of design options have been analyzed with the SASSYS- 1 systems analysis code. This code has been validated for natural circulation behavior by analysis of Shutdown Heat Removal Tests performed in EBR-II. The AFR- 300 design includes flywheels on the primary pumps to extend the pump coastdown times, {{and the size of the}} flywheels can be picked to give optimum coastdown times. One series of transients that has been run consists of protected loss-of-flow transients with various values for the combined moment of inertia of the pump, the motor and the flywheel giving coastdown times from 70 seconds to 586 seconds. In this transient series both the main pump motors and the pony motors lose power. Another series of loss-of-flow cases involved staggered failures of the pony motors. The main pump motors fail, the reactor scrams, and the pumps coast down to pony motor speed. Then at various times the pony motors are assumed to fail. If the pony motors fail at the wrong time, then the resulting transient can be more severe than if the pony motors failed at the same time as the main motors. A third series of cases involved a reactor scram followed by failure of both the main pump motors and the pony motors at various times. For all of these cases, satisfactory natural circulation behavior can be obtained if the right design options are used...|$|E
40|$|The {{deployment}} of fuel recycling through either CONFU (COmbined Non-Fertile and UO 2 fuel) thermal watercooled reactors (LWRs) or fast ABR (<b>Actinide</b> <b>Burner</b> Reactor) reactors {{is compared to}} the Once-Through LWR reactor system in terms of accumulation of actinides over the next 100 years under the assumption of a growing worldwide demand for nuclear energy. It is assumed that the growth rate is about 2. 1 % per year up to 2053, with alternative scenarios after that date. The transuranics (TRU) stored in temporary repositories, the TRU sent to permanent repositories, the system cost and a vulnerability index toward proliferation are calculated by the CAFCA code and taken as key figures of merit. Deployment of the ABRs is assumed to occur later (2028) than the CONFU LWRs (2015), whose technology requires less extensive additional R&D. Through 2050 the CONFU strategy performs better than the ABR strategy. The CONFU LWRs in our model yield zero net TRU incineration while the ABRs have a net consumption of TRU. Compared to the Once-Through strategy, by 2050 the CONFU (respectively ABR) strategy reduces by about 22 % (respectively 16 %) the total inventory of TRU in the system. This reduction corresponds to the TRU production being avoided by CONFU LWRs or being incinerated in ABRs compared to the TRU produced in the traditional LWRs used in the Once-Through strategy. (cont.) The net consumption of TRU in ABRs makes the ABR strategy more attractive in a longer term. By 2100, the ABR (respectively CONFU) strategy would have reduced the worldwide TRU inventory by 75 % (respectively 58 %) compared to the Once-Through case. The three strategies are also discussed with regard to uranium ore availability, repository need, and processing plants need. It {{is interesting to note}} that with either recycling strategies the total capacity for separation of spent UO 2 constituents need only be four to five times the existing capacity today. Furthermore, only one TRU recycling plant from fertile-free fuel would be needed at a capacity of 250 MTHM/year up to 2050. The economic analysis shows that both closed fuel cycles are more expensive than the reference Once-Through scheme. The total cost of electricity production is expected to be 5 mills/kWhe, or about 15 %, larger than the Once-Through cycle case, if the spent fuel separation is paid off by the electricity sales from the resulting fuel. The timing of collection of fuel cycle costs significantly affects the cost of electricity. Paying for fuel separation by the sales of the electricity producing the spent fuel to be reprocessed later has a smaller effect on the cost of electricity in the advanced fuel cycles (between 1 or 2 mills/kWhe or between 3 and 6 %) compared to the cost of electricity in the Once-Through strategy. (cont.) From a policy point of view, an index of vulnerability toward proliferation is defined and gives an advantage to the advanced fuel cycles. The large amount of heavy metal in the repository and the long life time of this repository penalize the Once-Through strategy. However the results are sensitive to the accessibility factor assigned to the repository which is, as all accessibility factors, a subjective value that is not precisely defined. Moreover, worldwide cooperation to implement the two advanced strategies and the challenges this implementation could face are discussed. The use of a single behaviour mode throughout the world implies an unlikely perfect cooperation between countries that do not have the same capabilities or incentives to choose among the advanced fuel cycle strategies. by Thomas Boscher.

40|$|A system {{dynamics}} simulation technique {{is applied to}} generate {{a new version of}} the CAFCA code to study mass flows in the nuclear fuel cycle, and the impact of different options for advanced reactors and fuel recycling facilities on the inventory and distribution of transuranics (TRU). Several nuclear fuel cycle options are studied for U. S. and Brazil markets, and special consideration is given to potential collaboration between the two countries. This includes the impact of advanced nuclear technologies, under a prescribed growth in demand for nuclear electricity, on demand for uranium resources, uranium enrichment, and fuel reprocessing facilities, and on total cost of nuclear electricity over the next few decades. Introduction of fuel recycling reduces the growing demand for uranium, and the long-term need for storage of radioactive spent fuel. However, the timing of introduction of recycling is important for proper technology development, and the rate of deployment is restrained by the industrial capacity as well as the desire for high utilization factor of the deployed facilities over their life time, and that is reflected in the assessments. The nuclear fuel cycle is modeled as a high level structure diagram, which provides an overview of the interconnections among its blocks without showing all details, and as a structure-policy diagram which details the decision rules applied to the structure. The high level structure diagram represents the nuclear fuel cycle; the fleet of thermal and fast reactors; the separation and reprocessing plants; the waste repository; the spent fuel storage; and the paths for the fuel and waste mass transfer. In addition, an economic model is added to study different cases under the same assumptions. The economic model is based on the forecasted need for advanced reactors and recycling facilities, assuming that all costs are recovered within the nuclear energy system. Different recycling technology options are included in the code: (1) Thermal recycling in LWRs using Combined Non-Fertile and UO 2 Fuel (CONFU), (2) Recycling of TRU in fertile-free fast cores of <b>Actinide</b> <b>Burner</b> Reactors (ABR); and (3) Fast recycling of TRU with UO[subscript 2] in self-sustaining Gas-cooled Fast Reactors (GFR). Case studies for different advanced technology introduction dates and for distinct TRU depletion rates are examined. In particular, the code is 3 equipped to simulate the introduction of two recycling technology options with a prescribed allocation of the TRU supply between them. The simulation results show that early introduction of the GFR recycling scheme leads to the most significant reduction in uranium consumption and enrichment requirements, thus delaying the eventual depletion date of uranium ore. The GFR requires less uranium resources due to the use of TRU as recycled fuel and near unity fissile conversion ratio. However, in a nonbreeding reactor system, the consumption of U continues to grow, and the TRU needed to start fast reactors will be growing at a constrained rate. On the other hand, the CONFU recycling scheme keeps the TRU inventory in the entire system well below other schemes, and guarantees equilibrium between the generation and consumption of transuranics without investments in fast reactors. CONFU incinerates more TRU than the GFR and ABR schemes during the simulation period. Also, it reduces the TRU sent to the repository for disposal by orders of magnitude. The ABR scheme does the same but requires the introduction of fast reactors. Nevertheless, the CONFU and ABR schemes have no significant impact on the amount of uranium resources consumption or enrichment requirements. Economic analysis indicates that the CONFU technology is more attractive at current uranium prices, and that fast recycling becomes as attractive as thermal recycling at higher uranium prices. The results also show that if a nuclear fuel cycle state/reactor state collaboration with Brazil is started, there will be a significant impact on the U. S. cumulative TRU inventory at interim storage, enrichment requirements, uranium consumption, and number of advanced fuel facilities. The results show that a nuclear partnership without the introduction of advanced nuclear technologies would not have advantages for the U. S. Furthermore, a nuclear collaboration allows a higher ratio of fast reactors to total installed nuclear electric capacity in the U. S. Brazilian Navy Research Institut...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of transuranic inventories of {{spent nuclear fuel}} depends upon the deployment of advanced fuels that can be loaded with recycled transuranics (TRU), {{and the availability of}} facilities to separate and reprocess spent fuel. Three recycling strategies are explored in this study: (1) Recycling in thermal Light Water Reactors (LWR) using CONFU technology (COmbined Non-Fertile and UO[subscript 2] fuel), (2) recycling of TRU in fertile-free fast cores of <b>Actinide</b> <b>Burner</b> Reactors (ABR), and (3) recycling of TRU with UO[subscript 2] in self-sustaining Gas-cooled Fast Reactors (GFR). Choosing one strategy over another involves trade-offs. The CONFU, ABR, and GFR strategies differ from each other in terms of T RU loading in the reactor, net TRU incineration, capacities of recycling facilities needed, date for technology option availability, and flexibility. The CONFU and GFR are assumed to achieve zero net TRU incineration, while the ABR is a net consumer of TRU. The TRU loading is greatest in GFR and lowest in CONFU. While both CONFU and ABR require separation (of TRU from U) and reprocessing (recycling of TRUs from fertile-free fuel), the GFR is designed to, in equilibrium, recycle TRU+U after extraction of the fission products. It is assumed that thermal recycling is available in the short-term (2015), as opposed to recycling in fast reactors (2040). Finally, thermal recycling is the most flexible as either CONFU batches or regular LWR uranium batches can be loaded; the issue of running out of TRU fuel is therefore irrelevant for this option. A fuel cycle simulation tool, CAFCA II (Code for Advanced Fuel Cycles Assessment) has been developed. The CAFCA II code tracks the mass distribution of TRU in the system and the cost of all operations. The code includes a specific model for deployment of recycling plants, with certain capacities and investment requirements. These facilities may operate with a minimum target capacity factor during the lifetime of the plant. The deployment of these facilities is also constrained by a user-specified ability to add recycling capacity within a given time interval. Finally, the CAFCA II code includes a specific model for recycling prices which reflects the economies of scale that go with increases in the nominal capacity of recycling plants. Two case studies are presented. The first explores the optimal fuel cycle and recycling plant capacities {{as a function of the}} deployment of advanced fuel cycle technologies over the next hundred years, under the assumption of the US demand for nuclear energy growing at a 2. 4 % annual rate. Key figures for comparison of the strategies are evaluated, including {{reduction of}} TRU interim storage requirements, maximization of TRU incineration, minimization of the size of the fleets of recycling plants and fast reactors, fuel cycle cost, and capital cost requirements. We found that it is not possible to minimize the construction rate of advanced reactors and advanced spent fuel recycling facilities simultaneously with the construction rate of separation facilities for UO[subscript 2] spent fuel. The latter was found to be more constraining than the former. Further, we found that reactor technologies with zero net TRU destruction rate can achieve total depletion of TRU inventories in spent fuel interim storage at a lower fuel cycle cost and with fewer recycling facilities than reactor technologies that incinerate TRU. However, the lower fuel cycle cost is achieved at the expense of a smaller reduction of total TRU inventories. Finally, if the construction rate of advanced nuclear technologies is large enough, the later introduction date of fast recycling schemes compared to thermal recycling schemes does not prevent the reduction of TRU inventories in interim storage by 2100. Recently, the potential benefits of multi-lateral approaches to the management of nuclear fuel have been widely discussed. These include cost attractiveness following from economies of scale, proliferation resistance, and more efficient nuclear waste treatment strategies. CAFCA II has been developed to quantify these implications for the back-end of the fuel cycle. Three partnership scenarios have been examined: first, a scenario where the “Fuel leasing/fuel take-back” concept is implemented; second, a scenario with “Limited Collaboration” at the back-end fuel cycle, where spent fuel recycling and advanced fuel fabrication are externalized in countries that have these technologies; and third, a scenario of “Full Collaboration”, under which two regions fully collaborate at the fuel cycle back-end: spent fuel inventories and advanced fuel cycle facilities are co-owned and co-managed. The second case study concentrates on optimizing the choice of (1) fuel cycle option, (2) recycling plant capacities, and (3) partnership scenario by analyzing the implications of these choices for the LWR-CONFU, LWR/ABR, and LWR/GFR strategies. The nuclear fuel cycle is simulated in a two-region context from 2005 to 2100 under the assumption that one region represents the US growing at a 2. 4 % annual rate and the other region represents Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico growing at a 7. 4 % annual rate until 2080, and 2. 4 % afterwards. Under this scenario, we found that a US partnership with a region representing Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia could be advantageous to the reduction of TRU storage in both regions if the construction rate of UO[subscript 2] spent fuel separation plants would be larger than one 1, 000 MT/yr plant every two years after 2050. From the point of view of the spent fuel recycling industry, use of the largest recycling plants with the lowest construction cost per unit of installed capacity becomes optimal only with multi-national approaches to the fuel cycle back-end.
