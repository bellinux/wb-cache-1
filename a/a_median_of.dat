25|$|In 2007, Toronto was {{reported}} as having {{some of the}} longer average ER wait times in Ontario.

Tests, consultations, and initial treatments were also provided within waiting rooms. 50% of patients waited 4 hours before being transferred from the emergency room to another room. The least-urgent 10% of cases wait over 12 hours. The extended waiting-room times experienced by some patients were attributed to an overall shortage of acute care beds.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>median</b> <b>of</b> a {{triangle}} is {{a straight line}} through a vertex and {{the midpoint of the}} opposite side, and divides the triangle into two equal areas. The three medians intersect in a single point, the triangle's centroid or geometric barycenter, usually denoted by G. The centroid of a rigid triangular object (cut out of a thin sheet of uniform density) is also its center of mass: the object can be balanced on its centroid in a uniform gravitational field. The centroid cuts every median in the ratio 2:1, i.e. the distance between a vertex and the centroid is twice the distance between the centroid and the midpoint of the opposite side.|$|E

25|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for {{all stages of}} ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year {{survival rate}} is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.

About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1–4 years after treatment. Brain metastasis {{is more common in}} stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive <b>a</b> <b>median</b> <b>of</b> 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and whole brain radiation therapy can improve survival.|$|E
25|$|HSV-1 and -2 are {{transmitted}} by {{contact with an}} infected person who has reactivations of the virus. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 is periodically shed in the human genital tract, most often asymptomatically. Most sexual transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding. Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical, subtle or hard to notice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection. Meaning, {{it is possible to}} acquire the virus even if no active HSV blisters or sores are present. In one study, daily genital swab samples found HSV-2 at <b>a</b> <b>median</b> <b>of</b> 12–28% of days among those who have had an outbreak, and 10% of days among those suffering from asymptomatic infection, with many of these episodes occurring without visible outbreak ("subclinical shedding").|$|E
25|$|While many Americans cite {{income as}} the prime {{determinant}} of class, occupational status, educational attainment, and value systems are equally important variables. Income is in part determined by the scarcity of certain skill sets. An occupation that requires a scarce skill set which is attained through higher educational degree, and which involves higher autonomy, responsibility and influence, will usually offer higher economic compensation. Qualifying for such higher income often requires that individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g., by attending law, medical, or postgraduate school) and demonstrate the necessary competencies. There are also differences between household and individual income. In 2005, 42% of US households (76% among the top quintile) had two or more income earners; as a result, 18% of households but only 5% of individuals had six-figure incomes. To illustrate, two nurses each making $55,000 per year can out-earn, in a household sense, a single attorney who makes <b>a</b> <b>median</b> <b>of</b> $95,000 annually.|$|E
