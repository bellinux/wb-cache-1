40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare HCV and HIV {{infection}} among heroin <b>addicts</b> in MMT {{and not in}} MMT in {{two large}} cities in central China. METHODS: A total of 541 heroin <b>addicts</b> were recruited from MMT clinics and voluntary detoxification centers in Changsha and Wuhan, China. Structured questionnaires collected data on their socio-demographics, clinical status, risk behaviors, and their knowledge of HIV. Their HIV serostatus and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus were determined by testing antibodies in blood serum. RESULTS: We observed a higher prevalence of HCV infection among MMT heroin <b>addicts</b> (82. 3 %) than that in the non-MMT group (50. 6 %). However, our findings indicated that the heroin <b>addicts</b> in MMT had less drug or sexual HIV/HCV risk behaviors and more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT <b>addicts.</b> The heroin <b>addicts</b> in MMT had a significantly higher percentage of individuals who always used condoms (44. 9 %) compared with patients in the non-MMT group (14. 6 %, p = 0. 039), and they had more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT individuals (p<. 001). The percentage of HIV-positive <b>addicts</b> in the MMT group (0. 7 %) and non-MMT group (0. 8 %) were almost same. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated {{that the rate of}} HCV infection among heroin <b>addicts</b> among MMT or non-MMT settings in central China is very high. The non-MMT heroin <b>addicts</b> have higher risk of becoming infected with HCV in the future, while at present they have lower rates of HCV infection than MMT heroin <b>addicts.</b> Although rates of HIV infection among MMT and non-MMT heroin <b>addicts</b> are low now, they are all at great risk of becoming infected with HIV in the future, especially for non-MMT heroin <b>addicts.</b> We should use the MMT sites as a platform to improve the control of HCV and HIV infection in heroin <b>addicts...</b>|$|R

Thus, opiate <b>addicts</b> had higher levels of harm avoidance, reward dependence, and cooperativeness, and stimulant <b>addicts</b> had higher levels of self-transcendence.
