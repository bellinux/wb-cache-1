5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin {{was born}} on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city {{in what was then}} the Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five {{children}} born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant. Their marriage was characterized by <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings' artistic inclinations—and Sophie's cool pragmatism. The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, societal anti-Semitism early on.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>tensions</b> <b>between</b> Europe's Great Powers {{escalated}} in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, Bernstein feared that Germany's arms race with other powers was threatening {{the possibility of a}} major war. Bernstein's fears were realised with the outbreak of World War I.|$|R
5|$|The ice trade revolutionised the {{way that}} food was {{preserved}} and transported. Before the 19th century, preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking, but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead. Although using ice to chill foods was a relatively simple process, it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling the flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems. In {{the early stages of}} the ice trade there was also <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> preserving the limited supply of ice, by limiting the flow of air over it, and preserving the food, which depended on circulating more air over the ice to create colder temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Non-human mammals play a {{wide variety}} of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of {{millions}} of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world. Mammals such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht Dürer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals. Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals. Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome. There is <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. Mammals further play {{a wide variety}} of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E

25|$|In Sub-Saharan Africa, {{there has}} often been <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> the Christian insistence on monogamy and {{traditional}} polygamy. In some instances in recent times there have been moves for accommodation; in other instances, churches have resisted such moves strongly. African Independent Churches have sometimes referred to {{those parts of the}} Old Testament that describe polygamy in defending the practice.|$|E
25|$|Many private Waldorf schools {{experience}} <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> {{these social}} {{goals and the}} way tuition fees act {{as a barrier to}} access to the education by less well-off families. Schools have attempted to improve access for a wider range of income groups by charging lower fees than comparable independent schools, by offering a sliding scale of fees, and/or by seeking state support.|$|E
25|$|Like many Renaissance artists before him, Milton {{attempted}} to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In Comus, Milton may make ironic {{use of the}} Caroline court masque by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> the {{countries}} grows, the American government orders Brooks {{to leave the}} country and return to America. It is later said that the <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> Pakistan and India is resolved after they learn that everything was Brooks' fault. It is also revealed that Maya sent what was written of the report to Washington, but it received no recognition.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>tensions</b> <b>between</b> native {{tribes and}} white missionaries rose during the 1850s, {{resulting}} in small-scale wars between settlers and natives, like the Rogue River War, missionary work in Oregon was increasingly targeted at white {{immigrants from the}} eastern parts of the US, rather than native populations.|$|R

25|$|Gender/ Sexuality- All of {{the major}} {{characters}} in the novel are female. The male characters that do exist are often portrayed as untrustworthy, or are using the female characters for money, sex, or some other object. Additionally, both Anna and Alyona are unrelentingly chastised by their mothers for their choices in partners. This creates <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> {{the male and female}} characters, and often drives the male characters from the apartment, the main space of the novel.|$|E
25|$|Black preachers {{provided}} leadership, encouraged {{education and}} economic growth, and were often the primary {{link between the}} black and white communities. The black church established and/or maintained the first black schools and encouraged community members to fund these schools and other public services. For most black leaders, the churches always were connected to political goals of advancing the race. There grew to be <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> black leaders from the North and people in the South who wanted to run their churches and worship in their own way.|$|E
25|$|Although Mali {{has enjoyed}} a {{reasonably}} good inter-ethnic relationships based on {{the long history of}} coexistence, some hereditary servitude and bondage relationship exist, as well as ethnic tension between settled Songhai and nomadic Tuaregs of the north. Due to a backlash against the northern population after independence, Mali is now in a situation where both groups complain about discrimination {{on the part of the}} other group. This conflict also plays a role in the continuing Northern Mali conflict where there is <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> both Tuaregs and the Malian government, and the Tuaregs and radical Islamists who are trying to establish sharia law.|$|E

25|$|Dionysus has {{remained}} {{an inspiration to}} artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In The Birth of Tragedy (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. Nietzsche claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based on suffering of Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work Beyond Good and Evil, and later works The Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist and Ecce Homo, Dionysus is conceived {{as the embodiment of}} the unrestrained will to power.|$|E
25|$|When Jan Pieterszoon Coen {{became the}} Governor-General of Dutch East Indies, he built another loge {{to the east}} of Nassau Huis in 1617, named Mauritius. In 1618, Coen built a slipway, a hospital, and masonry cannon ex-placements that {{supplemented}} the cannons to these loge on the island of Onrust. Later, Coen fortified the two houses into a square fort surrounded with solid stone wall of 9 feet tall and 6 to 7 feet thick, as well as equipping it with cannons. This new fort building was known as Fort Jacatra. When Coen sailed to Ambon, Pieter de Carpentier took over the position of Governor-General temporarily and was responsible in managing Fort Jacatra. This new situation created <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> VOC and Prince Jayawikarta.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} God created the world {{out of nothing}} (creatio ex nihilo) is central today to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism – indeed, the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides felt {{it was the only}} concept that the three {{religions}} shared – yet it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible. The Priestly authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function. This was still the situation in the early 2nd century AD, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God; {{by the beginning of the}} 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation ex nihilo had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.|$|E

25|$|One {{application}} of the psychology of religion is in pastoral psychology, the use of psychological findings to improve the pastoral care provided by pastors and other clergy, especially in how they support ordinary members of their congregations. Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of chaplains in healthcare and in the military. One major concern of pastoral psychology {{is to improve the}} practice of pastoral counseling. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as Pastoral Psychology, the Journal of Psychology and Christianity, and the Journal of Psychology and Theology. In 1984, Thomas Oden severely criticized mid-20th-century pastoral care and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from Freud, Rogers, and others. More recently, others have described pastoral psychology as a field that experiences <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> psychology and theology.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{social theory}} {{contains}} <b>a</b> <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> {{the realization of}} human freedom {{and the necessity of}} social rules. Liberal political theorists of the seventeenth century, such as Hobbes and Locke, saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary impositions that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive {{on one side of the}} road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender our freedom for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a state of nature. The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon us. In this way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.|$|E
