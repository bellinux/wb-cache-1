The school uses an approach {{which has been}} described variously as an oral-option <b>or</b> <b>auditory-oral</b> <b>or</b> auditory-aural method, {{in the sense that}} the program helps children [...] "to listen and talk without the use of sign language". The school receives funding from various sources, including the Junior League of Summit and the State of New Jersey. It hosts benefits to raise funds. According to a report in 2010, fund-raising is on-going and ranges from $800,000 to $1 million a year. It has been assisted in the past by volunteers.
