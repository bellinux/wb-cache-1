40|$|Nutrition {{is related}} to the mental {{well-being}} of clients. However, the nutritional views and practices of social workers in the mental health field have not been thoroughly explored. By using the post-positivist paradigm, 15 mental health social work students were interviewed for their perspectives regarding nutrition and nutrition’s effect on stress. Their main ideas were identified, connected, and organized to develop a theoretical statement. The resulting theory focused on the development of social work students 2 ̆ 7 perspectives in <b>applying</b> <b>nutrition</b> into their mental health practice. The students were influenced by a variety of background factors, including their education, barriers to <b>applying</b> <b>nutrition</b> into their mental health practice, and solutions to the barriers. Background factors affected the students 2 ̆ 7 thoughts on nutrition, including their abstract thoughts, food, eating behaviors, and general well-being.

40|$|Nearly 11 million {{deaths in}} 2012 can be {{attributed}} to ischemic and hypertensive heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Yet, these diseases are highly preventable and even treatable via improvement in nutritional intake and physical activity. From a public health perspective, primary care providers have promising and population-wide potential for modifying patient behavior to reduce dietary risk factors. However substantial socio-structural barriers prevent physicians from <b>applying</b> <b>nutrition</b> to improve patient outcomes. In my thesis, I first examine the epidemiological context in both the populations of United States and Switzerland. I then elucidate the importance and context of the application of nutrition knowledge in primary care based on the ideologies of holistic, patient-centered health. Then, I identify and analyze the obstacles physicians face in <b>applying</b> <b>nutrition</b> in patient care, as well as the sociological structures in which these barriers arise. Lastly, I set forth models of progress to improve patient outcome via reformed and restructured application of nutrition in primary care, using studies of exemplary strategies for addressing these barriers to nutrition counseling...|$|R
