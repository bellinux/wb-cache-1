Nevertheless, Heller {{said that if the}} wind did not come, a first-stage alert would likely remain in effect and it might become necessary to declare a second-stage alert if conditions worsened.|$|E
25|$|Arles has a Mediterranean climate {{with a mean}} annual {{temperature}} of 14.6°C (1948 - 1999). The summers are warm and moderately dry, with seasonal averages between 22°C and 24°C, and mild winters with a mean temperature of about 7°C. The city is constantly, but especially in the winter months, subject {{to the influence of}} the mistral, <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> which can cause sudden and severe frosts. Rainfall (636mm per year) is fairly evenly distributed from September to May, with the summer drought being less marked than in other Mediterranean areas.|$|E
25|$|On 21 December, the 12th SS Division made an even heavier attack, but the U.S. 613th Tank Destroyer Battalion {{equipped}} with the new M36 tank destroyer stopped the attack. On 22 December the Germans attacked {{on the right of}} Elsenborn Ridge for the last time which was also smothered by heavy American artillery fire from M1 howitzers. The Americans fired 10,000 rounds in one day. The 26th Infantry Regiment and a company of Sherman tanks from the 745th Tank Battalion played key roles. Fortunately for the Americans, the weather came to their assistance {{for the first time in}} the campaign. On 23 December <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> from the northeast brought clear weather and froze the ground, allowing free movement of tracked vehicles and the return of U.S. Army Air Forces to the skies. The U.S. defenders cheered wildly at the return of clearer weather and much heavier support. The air attacks played an instrumental role in defeating the German attack.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} entry of the franchise, {{made up of}} four {{segments}} from a presumably failed television series, Belle teaches the Beast {{a thing or two}} about life itself, consideration and manners. He appears only in the first and fourth segments, and in a cameo in the third. In the first part, The Perfect Word, Beast and Belle have a bitter falling out at dinner when the Beast demands that Cogsworth open the windows to cool him down, despite the fact that he is the only one hot and there is <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>wind,</b> and angrily strikes his servant, Webster, a long-tongued dictionary. Despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's pleas, Beast refuses to apologise for his behaviour, until Webster, Crane and LePlume forge a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle. All is settled, until the Beast realises that it was a forgery. He furiously banishes Webster, Crane and LePlume from the castle, but Belle brings them back from the woods, and the Beast soon learns to forgive them, as their intentions were good.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} half year, {{the air on}} the Swiss Plateau can stay still, with little {{exchange}} to rest of the atmosphere, building a lake of cold air on the plateau and often a ceiling of high fog. The clouds look like an ocean of fog when seen from above, (usually around 800m) and hence is called the 'nebelmeer'. This weather is called inversion because the temperature below the fog {{is lower than the}} temperature above. Sometimes, it lasts for days or even for weeks, during which the neighbouring regions of the Alps and the Jura can have the brightest sunshine. Typical for the high fog is the bise, <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> from northeast. Since it is channelled by the Swiss Plateau narrowing in southwest, it reaches its major strength in the lake Geneva region where wind speeds of 60km/h with top speeds of more than 100km/h are usual in typical bise weather. The regions near the Alps of the central and eastern plateau sometimes have temperature rises due to the warm foehn wind.|$|E

60|$|Jones, though {{eager and}} impatient, {{restrained}} himself, {{for it was}} unwise to begin operations in the storm. There {{was nothing to do}} but wait. Ill fared the hunters that day. Food had to be eaten uncooked. The long hours dragged by with the little group huddled under icy blankets. When darkness fell, the sleet changed to drizzling rain. This blew over at midnight, and <b>a</b> <b>colder</b> <b>wind,</b> penetrating to the very marrow of the sleepless men, made their condition worse. In the after part of the night, the wolves howled mournfully.|$|R

[...] The door was closed, {{and no one in}} the audience seemed to notice the addition.|$|E

[...] The second touchdown was also scored by Newman, this time in the last minute of the game on a 28-yard run off a fake pass play. [...] Both PAT attempts failed. [...] The game was the last by Chicago head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg against Michigan.

Abigail denies Mary's assertions that they are pretending, and stands by her story about the poppet. When challenged by Parris and Hathorne to 'pretend to be possessed', Mary is too afraid to comply. John attacks Abigail's character, revealing that she and the other girls were caught dancing naked in the woods by Rev. Parris {{on the night of}} Betty Parris' alleged 'bewitchment'. When Danforth begins to question Abigail, she claims that Mary has begun to bewitch her with <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> and John loses his temper, calling Abigail a whore. He confesses their affair, says Abigail was fired from his household over it and that Abigail is trying to murder Elizabeth so that she may [...] "dance with me on my wife's grave." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{spring of}} this region and {{elevation}} most vividly recalled that of England. The oak flowering, the birch bursting into leaf, the violet, Chrysosplenium, Stellaria and Arum, Vaccinium, wild strawberry, maple, geranium, bramble. <b>A</b> <b>colder</b> <b>wind</b> blew here: mosses and lichens carpeted the banks and roadsides: the birds and insects were very different from those below; and everything proclaimed the marked change in elevation, and not only in this, but in season, for I had left the winter of the tropics and here encountered the spring of the temperate zone.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Maritimes, {{specifically}} Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, {{are often}} affected by such snow squalls when an Arctic winter airmass moves over unfrozen waters. In PEI, sea-effect snow is often generated when <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> north <b>wind</b> blows over the unfrozen Gulf of St. Lawrence, dumping heavy {{snow on the}} north shore. In Nova Scotia, <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> north-west <b>wind</b> can produce sea-effect snow over the Cape Breton Highlands from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Annapolis Valley from the Bay of Fundy; in the latter case, the sea-effect snow season can continue all winter as the Bay of Fundy remains open owing to its extreme tidal currents.|$|R

2500|$|If {{the attack}} succeeded, the 7th Armoured Division tanks were to drive north {{to cut the}} Italian line of retreat from Sidi Barrani while the Indians {{captured}} the other camps near the port. Maktila was to be cut off by the Matruh Garrison Force and the tanks were to drive for Buq Buq to cut of the retreat of the garrison to Sollum. On the night of 6/7 December, the 4th Indian Division left camp for Training Exercise No 2 in <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> that raised dust and concealed the lorries of the 4th and 6th New Zealand Reserve Mechanical Transport companies as they drove spread out over the desert, in air formation (no lorry to be within [...] of another).

By late afternoon the Indians were [...] south-east of Nibeiwa, [...] west of their jumping-off point. At dusk two battalions of the 11th Indian Brigade and the 7th RTR moved off and drove in moonlight to a position [...] south-west of Nibeiwa; before sunrise the units assembled at a jumping-off point [...] north-west of the camp. The third battalion drove about [...] short of {{the east side of the}} camp, which was on a flat plateau with a shallow valley on that side.|$|E
