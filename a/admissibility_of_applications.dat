50|$|The Court was {{established}} on 21 January 1959 {{on the basis}} of Article 19 of the European Convention on Human Rights when its first members were elected by the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. The Convention charges the Court with ensuring the observance of the engagement undertaken by the contracting states in relation to the Convention and its protocols, that is ensuring the enforcement and implementation of the European Convention in the member states of the Council of Europe. The jurisdiction of the Court has been recognised to date by all 47 member states of the Council of Europe. In 1998, the Court became a full-time institution and the European Commission of Human Rights, which used to decide on <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications,</b> was abolished by Protocol 11.|$|E
40|$|The European Court of Human Rights' {{case law}} on {{judicial}} review in asylum cases {{is not entirely}} consistent. However, it {{can be interpreted as}} consistent if two presumptions are accepted. First, that, as the Court's role should be subsidiary to that of domestic courts, domestic judicial review should at least be of the same quality and substance as the European Court of Human Rights' review. Secondly, that the Court distinguishes between arguable and non-arguable cases not just in the context of Article 13 ECHR and of the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications,</b> but that this distinction is central to its entire case law about the asylum procedure. This analysis results in a coherent doctrine on deadlines for submitting evidence, the burden of proof, the intensity of judicial review, and suspensive effect. If the Court understands its case law in this way, it can prevent it from becoming, in some respects, a court of first instance. © The Author (2009). Published by Oxford University Press.

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} the conditions <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> to the European Court of Human Rights stating the specific examples and decisions about admissibility {{adopted by the}} Court {{that in order to}} assist applicants that, due to formal flaws in the proceedings, do not lose their ability to realize their rights in the court. The author seeks to emphasize the importance of possibility of proceedings in the court to realize fundamental human rights and freedoms of the citizens of Croatia. Conditions <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> are regulated in Art. 33, Art. 34 and Art. 35 of European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and most requests are rejected due to their failure in those requirements. The <b>admissibility</b> stage <b>of</b> testing is often decisive for the fate of the request, the more so as the decision of inadmissibility cannot be disputed in any way...|$|R

40|$|Resumé The {{official}} {{title of}} my thesis is Application for an appeal review on {{the points of}} law in civil procedure. The main objective of this thesis is to describe {{the development of an}} institute <b>of</b> an <b>application</b> for an appeal review throughout the legal history of the civil procedure {{in the area of the}} Czech Republic up to current state, with a particular focus on the conditions <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> such <b>application</b> and its essentials. My thesis is composed of three chapters. The first chapter is to introduce the reader to the historical development <b>of</b> an <b>application</b> <b>of</b> an appeal review from the very beginning in the 18 th century up to date. In particular, the landmark Constitutional Court decision (sp. zn. Pl. ÚS 29 / 11) is emphasized in the end of the chapter. The second chapter deals with the actual legislation <b>of</b> an <b>application</b> for an appeal review in The Code of Civil Procedure. Its main goal is to describe this institute as whole. It is also to provide the reader with further analysis of some controversial issues of the actual legislation as the conditions <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> an <b>application</b> and its essentials required by the law. Finally, it manifests the attitude of the judiciary towards these problematic features of the actual legislation. The third chapter contains the brief explication about an [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims to {{describe}} the new regulation <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> for appeal review introduced {{by means of an}} amendment to the Civil Procedure Code made by the act No. 404 / 2012 Sb. and to assess its compliance with the Constitution. During the preparation of this amendment a part of the Civil Procedure Code (specifically sec. 237 (1) c)) governing the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the discretionary <b>application</b> for appeal review was cancelled due to being in conflict with the Constitution by means of the decision of the Constitutional Court of 21 February 2012, file No. Pl. ÚS 29 / 11. For that purpose, at first, the thesis deals with the application for appeal review itself and certain aspects of it, especially the role it has in the Czech legal system. Based on this general part a special part is built dealing with the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> for appeal review. Firstly, the admissibility under the old legislation is described, after that the conclusions of the Constitutional Court are critically examined and, finally, the new legislation is described and confronted with the findings of the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court criticized the old legislation for not being sufficiently predictable. It concluded that in order for the new legislation to comply with the Constitution the potential [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Parallel <b>application</b> <b>of</b> {{national}} and Union competition law The adoption of regulation No. 1 / 2003 opened {{a discussion on}} <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> parallel <b>application</b> <b>of</b> {{national and}} EU competition law regarding the {{ne bis in idem}} principle. The aim of the thesis is to map the condition of this legal topic after ten years since the process of modernisation of EU competition law {{on the basis of the}} analysis of judicial decisions and relevant legal acts including EU Charter of fundamental rights that became a part of EU primary law since Lisbon Treaty. Three different cases are to be understood under the term parallel application. The cumulative application means a case where national competition authority applies both national and EU law to punish anticompetitive behaviour in one single proceedings. The second case is the parallel application on the EU territory, where there are several proceedings held by competition authorities parallelly. These proceedings are held either concurrently or consequently. Lastly, the parallel application going beyond the EU territory is the case where an anticompetitive behaviour that has already been punished by a competition authority of a non-member state is subject of proceedings held by competition authority in EU. The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first [...] ...|$|R

30|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> {{simultaneous}} prediction of actual and average values of the unobserved regressand in finite population under the quadratic loss function. Admissibility is an interesting problem in statistical theory and received much attention. [18, 19] and [20] discussed the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> predictions of y_T. [21, 22] and [23] studied the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> estimations of β. We discuss the admissible predictors of δ in classes of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous linear predictors, respectively.

30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{relation}} between exponential dichotomy on time scales and <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for an evolution family on time scales. We establish a sufficient criterion {{for the existence}} of exponential dichotomy on time scales in terms <b>of</b> the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for the evolution family. Conversely, with the help of exponential dichotomy on time scales, we give the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for an input-output equation on time scales.|$|R
40|$|The issue <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> {{evidence}} has been regulated only very scarcely in the EU. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters has been embracing {{the increasing number of}} instruments, covering plethora of aspects, however, the field <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> evidence remains almost untouched. Can the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice be called the Common Evidence Area? From the national perspective, the issue <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> evidence is still subject to divergent solutions in the Member States, concerning the common law and continental law systems, i. e. the right of access to a lawyer. Thus, the paper aims {{to take into account the}} tendencies of legal rule in matter <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> evidence, the dynamic of evidence movement within EU area...|$|R

In this paper, we investigate some relations between one of the above methods, based on the reduced normal form rules, and sets of substitutions which reject them.
