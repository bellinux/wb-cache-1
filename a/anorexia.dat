5|$|An overvalued idea is a {{false belief}} that is held with {{conviction}} but not with delusional intensity. Hypochondriasis is an overvalued idea that one is suffering from an illness, dysmorphophobia is an overvalued idea that a part of one's body is abnormal, and people with <b>anorexia</b> nervosa may have an overvalued idea of being thin.|$|E
5|$|Sam (Eric Schaeffer) is a {{commodities}} trader {{who suffers}} from <b>anorexia</b> and compulsive overeating. His interests quickly turn into obsessions. Despite being with several different women during the series, he is secretly in love with Billie.|$|E
5|$|During her {{sophomore year}} of high school, after Wilson's {{interest}} in modeling grew more serious, her mother urged her to pursue it. They visited an agency and were informed that Wilson would have to lose weight {{to be considered for}} jobs. In the process of losing weight, she began a bout with <b>anorexia</b> nervosa and then bulimia that lasted from ages 14-to-20.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{season of}} Degrassi: The Next Generation {{was the most}} {{successful}} season to date, averaging 767,000 viewers in Canada, and had one episode watched by a million viewers. It received praise for its depiction of a relationship between two gay characters, but mixed reviews for highlighting the issue of <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia in teenage girls.|$|E
5|$|Toxemia of {{pregnancy}} is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include <b>anorexia,</b> lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia {{appears to be}} most common in hot climates. Other serious complications {{of pregnancy}} can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Bible is {{the third}} studio album by Welsh {{alternative}} rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 29 August 1994 by record label Epic. At the time the album was written and recorded, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards was struggling with severe depression, alcohol abuse, self-harm and <b>anorexia</b> nervosa, and its contents are considered by many sources to reflect his mental state. The songs focus on themes relating to politics and human suffering. The Holy Bible was the band's last album released before Edwards' disappearance on 1 February 1995.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as <b>anorexia</b> nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to <b>anorexia</b> and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, <b>anorexia,</b> vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are <b>anorexia</b> and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, <b>anorexia</b> nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include <b>anorexia,</b> nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
5|$|Rhys discovers Zak and Gilly are {{planning}} a strip show at nightclub The Loft. Rhys agrees to join, however, is replaced by Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle). During the strip show, Rhys tries to chat up a girl, who is only interested in Gilly. Gilly meets a young woman named Molly Traverse (Kate Deakin), whom he is put off by when she mentions marriage. During her battle with <b>anorexia,</b> Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and friend, Melissa Hurst (Carla Chases), begin being horrible to Gilly. Hannah hits him, however, after returning from hospital, she apologises. After finding out his girlfriend Beth is his half-sister, Rhys begins being jealous after she and Gilly grow close. Gilly and Beth grow closer and kiss. They start a relationship and agree to take it slowly. Gilly decides to become a lifeguard. Whilst cleaning up, Gilly sees boss, Simon Crosby (Simon Lawson), leaving a cubicle with a crying child. Gilly automatically assumes he is a paedophile. Gilly breaks into Simon's house and finds pictures of children in their swimwear, {{one of whom is}} Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins). He also finds a boy's room with a lock on the door. Gilly shows various residents the proof. Angry parents begin to gather outside Simon's home and vandalise it by smashing the windows. Realsing his reputation is ruined, Simon attempts suicide. Simon's wife Gemma Grosby (Gemma Langford) shows Gilly a picture of their son, who died. Gilly realises Simon is innocent and feels guilty.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced <b>anorexia</b> caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{may cause}} {{a decrease in}} appetite which can degenerate into <b>anorexia</b> or <b>anorexia</b> nervosa. Appetite disorders, in turn, cause malnutrition and, notably, inadequate zinc intake. <b>Anorexia</b> itself is a cause of zinc deficiency, thus leading to a vicious cycle: the worsening of <b>anorexia</b> worsens the zinc deficiency. A 1994 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that zinc (14mg per day) doubled the rate of body mass increase {{in the treatment of}} <b>anorexia</b> nervosa.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>anorexia</b> nervosa {{was coined}} in 1873 by Sir William Gull, one of Queen Victoria's {{personal}} physicians. The history of <b>anorexia</b> nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting {{dating from the}} Hellenistic era and continuing into the medieval period. The medieval practice of self-starvation by women, including some young women, {{in the name of}} religious piety and purity also concerns <b>anorexia</b> nervosa; it is sometimes referred to as <b>anorexia</b> mirabilis.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition due to worms {{can give}} rise to <b>anorexia.</b> A study of 459 {{children}} in Zanzibar revealed spontaneous increases in appetite after deworming. <b>Anorexia</b> might {{be a result of}} the body’s immune response and the stress of combating infection. Specifically, some of the cytokines released in the immune response to worm infestation have been linked to <b>anorexia</b> in animals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> nervosa causes {{alterations}} {{in the female}} reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with <b>anorexia</b> nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. <b>Anorexia</b> nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in people with <b>anorexia</b> nervosa has been documented. Typically, growth hormone (GH) levels are high, but levels of IGF-1, the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of “resistance” to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in <b>anorexia</b> nervosa contribute {{to a loss of}} bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. <b>Anorexia</b> nervosa can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of <b>anorexia</b> nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|Grahame {{spent some}} of her {{childhood}} and most of her adolescence in psychiatric hospitals, suffering from eating disorder <b>anorexia</b> nervosa, a condition that left her comatose and near death {{at the age of}} 12, something she has written about in two autobiographies called Dying To Be Thin— The True Story Of My Lifelong Battle Against <b>Anorexia</b> (2009) and Fragile— The True Story of My Lifelong Battle With <b>Anorexia</b> (2012).|$|E
25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> has classically been {{associated}} with disturbances to interoception with people hyper-focused on their bodies. People with <b>anorexia</b> concentrate on distorted perceptions of their body exterior in fear of weight gain, and they also report altered physical states within their bodies, such as indistinct feelings of fullness or {{are not able to}} distinguish emotional states from bodily sensations in general (also called alexithymia). Further, people with <b>anorexia</b> experience abnormally intense cardiorespiratory sensations, particularly of the breath, and this is most prevalent before they consume a meal. Abnormal senses of interoceptive awareness such as these have been observed so frequently in <b>anorexia</b> that they have become key characteristics of the illness.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence that any particular treatment for <b>anorexia</b> nervosa works better than others; however, {{there is enough}} {{evidence to suggest that}} early intervention and treatment are more effective. Treatment for <b>anorexia</b> nervosa tries to address three main areas.|$|E
25|$|Other. Weakness, fatigue, <b>anorexia,</b> weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceuticals {{have limited}} benefit for <b>anorexia</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> nervosa may be {{associated}} with increased cortisol levels.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, Christina Hoff Sommers criticized Wolf for {{publishing}} the estimate that 150,000 women were dying {{every year from}} <b>anorexia.</b> Sommers states that she tracked down the source to the American <b>Anorexia</b> and Bulimia Association who stated that they were misquoted; the figure refers to sufferers, not fatalities. Wolf's citation for the incorrect figure came from a book by Brumberg, who referred to an American <b>Anorexia</b> and Bulimia Association newsletter and misquoted the newsletter. Wolf accepted the error and changed it in future editions. Sommers gave an estimate {{for the number of}} fatalities in 1990 as 100-400.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> nervosa is {{an eating}} {{disorder}} that is characterized by low appetite and {{a strong desire to}} lose weight, be thin, and fears of gaining weight. People suffering from <b>anorexia</b> nervosa frequently have an abnormally low body weight, which can cause muscle dysfunction and weak osmoregulation. It can also accompany emotional symptoms such as depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> nervosa, and the {{associated}} malnutrition that results from self-imposed starvation, can cause complications in every major organ system in the body. Hypokalaemia, {{a drop in the}} level of potassium in the blood, is a sign of <b>anorexia</b> nervosa. A significant drop in potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms, constipation, fatigue, muscle damage and paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Early {{theories}} of the cause of <b>anorexia</b> linked it to childhood sexual abuse or dysfunctional families; evidence is conflicting, and well-designed research is needed. The fear of food is known as sitiophobia, cibophobia, or sitophobia and {{is part of the}} differential diagnosis. Other psychological causes of <b>anorexia</b> include low self-esteem, feeling like there is lack of control, depression, anxiety, and loneliness.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of disseminated sporotrichosis include weight loss, <b>anorexia,</b> and appearance of bony lesions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as <b>anorexia,</b> is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and {{a strong desire to}} be thin, resulting in food restriction. Many people with <b>anorexia</b> see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E
25|$|Globally, <b>anorexia</b> is {{estimated}} to affect 2.9 million people as of 2015. It {{is estimated}} to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries {{at some point in}} their life. About 0.4% of young women are affected in a given year and it {{is estimated to}} occur ten times less commonly in men. Rates in most of the developing world are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. While <b>anorexia</b> became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. In 2013 it directly resulted in about 600 deaths globally, up from 400 deaths in 1990. Eating disorders also increase a person's risk of death from a wide range of other causes, including suicide. About 5% of people with <b>anorexia</b> die from complications over a ten-year period, a nearly 6 times increased risk. The term <b>anorexia</b> nervosa was first used in 1873 by William Gull to describe this condition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century <b>anorexia</b> nervosa became widely {{accepted}} by the medical profession as a recognized condition. In 1873, Sir William Gull, one of Queen Victoria's personal physicians, published a seminal paper which coined the term <b>anorexia</b> nervosa and provided a number of detailed case descriptions and treatments. In the same year, French physician Ernest-Charles Lasègue similarly published details {{of a number of}} cases in a paper entitled De l'Anorexie hystérique.|$|E
