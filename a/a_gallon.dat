25|$|Most of {{the retail}} {{gasoline}} now sold in the United States contains about 10% fuel ethanol (or E10) by volume. Burning <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of E10 produces about 17.68 pounds of CO2 that is emitted from the fossil fuel content. If the CO2 emissions from ethanol combustion are considered, then about 18.95 pounds of CO2 are produced when <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of E10 is combusted. About 12.73 pounds of CO2 are produced when <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of pure ethanol is combusted.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel fuel is sold {{with various}} amounts of {{biodiesel}} content. B20 is a commonly sold biodiesel fuel. B20 contains 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel fuel. Burning <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of B20 {{results in the}} emission of about 17.90 pounds of CO2 that is emitted from the fossil fuel content. If the emissions from burning the biodiesel in B20 are included, then about 22.06 pounds of CO2 are produced. About 20.77 pounds of CO2 are produced from burning <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of B100 (100% biodiesel).|$|E

25|$|The {{total cost}} of the project (all paid by U.S. taxpayers) was $134 million, in 1943 U.S. dollars. Total crude {{production}} was 315,000 m³ (2.7 million barrels) of which 7,313 m³ (63,000 barrels) were spilled. The cost of the crude oil was $426 per cubic metre ($67.77 per barrel). Refined petroleum product output was just 138,000 m³ (1.2 million barrels). Cost per barrel of refined product was thus $975 per cubic metre, or 97.5 cents per litre ($3.69 <b>a</b> <b>gallon).</b> Adjusted to current dollars using the U.S. consumer price index, in 2000 dollars the oil would have cost $4,214 per cubic metre ($670 a barrel), while the refined product would have been worth an astonishing $9.62 a litre ($36.42 <b>a</b> <b>gallon).</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{was a brief}} {{revival in}} the economy during the {{presidency}} of Juan Perón but the economy declined soon again under the military dictatorship of the 1960s and 1970s. During this time the wine industry was sustained by the domestic consumption of cheap vino de mesa. By the early 1970s, average consumption was nearly 24 gallons (90 liters or around 120 standard 750 milliliter wine bottles) of wine a year, significantly more than many other countries including the United Kingdom and United States which averaged less than <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> (3 liters) a person during the same period.|$|E

25|$|Alaska's economy depends {{heavily on}} {{increasingly}} expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at {{the time of}} the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.|$|E

500|$|The {{economic}} conditions facing {{the new government}} were dismal. Tens of thousands of Nova Scotians were impoverished and unemployed. The government expected that 75,000 Nova Scotians would need assistance during the coming winter. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald sympathized with the poor, but he worried that direct government relief payments would undermine their pride and self-respect. Even though direct relief might be cheaper, the Macdonald government preferred to hire the unemployed for public works projects such as paving roads. Henderson reports that in 1933, there were only [...] of paved roads in the province. By 1937, that figure had risen to 605.
