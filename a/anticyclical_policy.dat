It contains a short description of conditions in which the US economy was operating during the period proceding the crisis, and against this background the author makes some remarks about the state role in fighting cyclical fluctuations. These remarke concerns president R. Reagan's economic programme, main instruments of supply-side economics, achlevements of supply-side eoonomics. The analysis ends with a conclusion about a combination of instruments provided by two economic schoolｻ i. e. Keynesism and neomonetarism as the most effective solution for problems ensuing from the contemporary stagnation and inflation.

40|$|The {{literature}} on systematic fiscal policy and macroeconomic performance in industrialized countries is large but fragmented. Based {{on a broad}} overview of that literature, several patterns emerge. First, the empirical literature points toward strongly <b>anticyclical</b> <b>policy,</b> which consists of procyclical tax revenues, acyclical tax rates and government purchases, and countercyclical transfer payments. Secondly, consolidation {{in response to the}} debt has come primarily through adjustments to taxes and possibly purchases. Thirdly, a large government is associated with reduced macroeconomic volatility. Meanwhile, the theoretical {{literature on}} anticyclical fiscal policy has gone from mostly focusing on government purchases and tax rates toward beginning to focus on transfer payments, although more quantitative work remains to be done in linking theory with empirics. In addition, a policy literature has begun to develop, which has applied lessons from the theoretical literature in order to understand different consolidation scenarios and different proposed fiscal rules, particularly in Europe...|$|E
40|$|Chile {{was one of}} the world’s {{fastest-growing}} {{economies in}} the 1990 s. Its growth rate of 6. 8 percent per year from 1990 to 2000 (inclusive) was the seventh highest in the world, and by far the highest in Latin America. Poverty was halved, and while this was overwhelmingly due to growth rather than a reduction in the concentration of income, public services became much more equitably distributed. Inflation fell progressively from over 20 percent {{at the beginning of the}} decade to under 4 percent at the end. My own explanation of this success centers on the well-rounded policy measures that were implemented in Chile over the period. The Central Bank {{was one of the}} institutions responsible for implementing these successful policies. In particular, it helped that the Central Bank took a balanced view of its responsibilities. It aimed to reduce inflation, but it took a gradual approach rather than believing that a sudden reduction in inflation would automatically bring all other good things in its wake or that there were no trade-offs. It was also concerned with securing an <b>anticyclical</b> <b>policy</b> that would stabilize the real economy. Furthermore, it took into account the encaje, an important instrument in the battle to maintain a competitive exchange rate, and thereby avoided the overvaluation that had such a devastating effect in other Latin American countries. The questions that I address in this paper are whether considerations of growth and development demand a more competitive exchange rate than might emerge spontaneously. If so, what (if any) instruments should be used to affect the exchange rate...|$|E
40|$|We show in {{a dynamic}} {{stochastic}} general equilibrium framework that {{the introduction of a}} common currency by a group of countries with only partially integrated goods markets, incomplete ?nancial markets and no labor migration across member states, signi?cantly increases volatility of consumption and employment in the face of asymmetric shocks. We propose a simple transfer mechanism between member countries of the union that reduces this volatility. Further- more, we show that this mechanism is more e¢ cient than <b>anticyclical</b> <b>policies</b> at the national level in terms of a better stabilization for the same budgetary e¤ects for households while in the long run deeper integration of goods markets could reduce volatility signi?cantly. Re- garding its implementation, we show that the centralized provision of public goods and services {{at the level of the}} monetary union implies cross-country transfers comparable to the scheme under study...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{fundamental}} opinions regarding {{macroeconomic stabilisation}} {{of an economy}} consider that (i) economy autocorrects itself and on the long term tends toward equilibrium and (ii) because of rigidities, the economy cannot correct by itself and {{it is necessary for}} the government to intervene, through <b>anticyclical</b> <b>policies,</b> and bring it to equilibrium. The automatic stabilisers are described as categories of government revenues and expenditures that adjust themselves to the cyclical changes of an economy – for example, as output decreases, revenue collection is reduced, while unemployment benefits increase. These changes will have a direct impact on business and household income. The effect of the automatic stabilisers depends on government size and the speed with which tax and expenditure answer to cyclical fluctuations. This article addresses the issue of automatic stabilisers and how social policy acts as a macro-stabilisation policy for the economy...|$|R
40|$|Since the 2009 {{financial}} crisis, {{some national}} governments have adopted <b>anticyclical</b> tax <b>policies</b> for recovering and economic growth. These policies can {{be different in}} terms of what type of tax incentive policy (income, labor, value added) is chosen as well if the strategy is vertical, benefiting some sectors, or horizontal, benefiting all economic sectors. In Brazil, one of the <b>anticyclical</b> tax <b>policy</b> carried out by the federal government was to reduce the value added tax named ?Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados? (IPI) using a vertical strategy mainly benefiting the automobile sector among few others. Taking into account this recent experience, this paper aims primary to assess the efficacy of vertical versus horizontal tax incentive policies for promoting economic recovering. Additionally, the paper addresses the distributive effects of these policy strategies considering the impact on the income classes as well on the regional public finances. Considering the price effects of tax policies, the computable general equilibrium approach is the most appropriated methodological framework to achieve the objectives of this paper. We calibrated a CGE model for the Brazilian economy for 2007, recognizing the productive structure for 56 sectors and 8 types of labor segmented by income classes. This model is integrated with a public finance module specifying the government accounts for each level of government (federal, states and municipalities) as well the vertical fiscal linkages. The CGE model allow short run and long run simulations. The CGE model was used for simulating two shock scenarios. The first one represents the vertical tax policy and simulate a reduction in the IPI tax rate of the automobile sector in accordance with the average incentives over the period 2010 - 2013. The second one represents the horizontal tax policy and the simulation imply reductions in the IPI tax rate of all sector keeping the amount of tax revenue reduction equal to the vertical shock. These shocks were simulated for a short run closure considering the transitory nature of <b>anticyclical</b> <b>policies.</b> The simulation results show that the economic impact of vertical and horizontal tax incentives strategies are quite similar. The policy implication is that both strategies are indifferent in terms of the impact on GDP and employment. Nevertheless, the distributive impact evaluated through the effects on labor factor by income classes shows the vertical policy is more regressive than the horizontal policy. Considering the impact on the regional public finance, both policies imply reductions in the level of transfers to the regional governments due the vertical fiscal linkages of the Brazilian federalism. Despite the positive economic impact on GDP and employment, the magnitude of this effect is not so high and fiscal linkages among governments seems play an important role at least for the Brazilian economy...|$|R

The regulatory model to be applied to the local loop should not be the common carrier model, but rather the press model of regulation, providing free entry for all network operators and information suppliers to the telecommunications market. ...|$|R

We find that developed countries' public debt, already very high before the crisis, has substantially increased over the past two years, mainly due to the sharp increase in budget deficits, both as a consequence of cyclical revenue and expenditure increases and of <b>anticyclical</b> budgetary <b>policy</b> measures, threatening to evolve into an unsustainable level. Although several strategies could be conceived to reduce public debt to a sound level, the most appropriate consists in adjusting budget balances so as to have a structural budget surplus on the medium-term. public dedt, policy, crisis, global economic, budget deficit...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} how tight a {{constraint}} are convergence {{criteria for the}} conduct of inflation targeting. This particular question is relevant only for these EU member countries staying outside the euro area that are currently operating under flexible exchange rate arrangements. For these countries, {{it will be very difficult}} to avoid a double shift in monetary policy. To meet the convergence criteria, they are pressured to switch to exchange rate targeting and adopt regime similar to inflation targeting after joining the euro area again. For these that want to avoid the double shift, the conditions for using IT as an independent <b>anticyclical</b> monetary <b>policy</b> after joining ERM 2 are defined. The approach applied is rather informal and builds on potential financial markets reactions to the existing policy constraints. The experience of the current euro area members during the ERM 2 period is analysed and implications the term structure of interest rates and the uncovered interest rate parity condition are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Cyclically {{adjusted}} government budget balance {{has often}} {{been used in the}} evaluation of fiscal stance. It indicates how much room fiscal authorities have to act anticyclically. The main idea is to separate temporary (cyclical) effects on the budget from those caused by discretionary measures of fiscal authorities. In this paper, after reviewing the concept, its applications and various methodological approaches, the size of cyclically adjusted budget balance is estimated in the case of Croatia for the period 1995 : 1 q- 2008 : 3 q. Thereby, the ECB methodology is implemented and it is assumed that cyclically sensitive budget elements include income tax, profit tax, VAT, excise duties, social security contributions and unemployment benefits. The elasticities of cyclically sensitive budget components, with respect to their macroeconomic bases, are calculated with an error-correction model. The results of the exercise indicate that both periods of pro- and <b>anticyclical</b> fiscal <b>policies</b> have been present in the analyzed period with the restrictive and procyclical policy prevailing in the recent years. fiscal policy, government budget, cyclical adjustment, Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Few {{fields of}} {{economics}} have seen more shifts of opinion than has fiscal policy. In the beginning, now shrouded in mist, the orthodoxy was “sound finance, ” preached in the 1920 s by Harley Lutz and Frederick Fairchild. While brief passive deficits triggered by dips in economic activity were tolerated, attempts to moderate dips through aggressive reductions in tax rates and attendant deficits or widening of deficits were judged inappropriate. With {{the rise of}} Keynes’s monetary theory of employment in the 1930 s, Keynesians like Abba Lerner (1944) saw the old fiscal orthodoxy as dysfunctional and proposed <b>anticyclical</b> tax-rate <b>policy</b> – functional finance – as the quickest and safest (in some cases the only) method of controlling “effective demand. ” In the 1950 s, the neo-Keynesians, led by Paul Samuelson (1948, 1956), broke with functional finance. His “neoclassical synthesis ” would analyze fiscal policies from a non-monetary perspective, i. e., with “real ” models, {{on the grounds that}} monetary policy was available to control effective demand. 1 This principle rapidly won acceptance in mainstream academic economics. But after that, it was one disagreement after another. What kind of real model was to be used...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} role of the current {{institutional}} setup of the eurozone in fostering the ongoing peripheral euro countries' sovereign debt crisis. In line with Modern Money Theory, we stress that the lack of a federal European government running <b>anticyclical</b> fiscal <b>policy,</b> the loss of euro member-states' monetary sovereignty, and the lack of a lender-of-last-resort central bank have significantly contributed to the generation, amplification, and protraction of the present crisis. In particular, we present a Post-Keynesian eurozone center-periphery model through which we show how, due to the incomplete nature of eurozone institutions with respect to a full-fledged federal union, diverging trends and conflicting claims have emerged between central and peripheral euro countries {{in the aftermath of the}} 2007 - 08 financial meltdown. We emphasize two points. (1) Diverging trends and conflicting claims among euro countries may represent decisive obstacles to the reform of the eurozone toward a complete federal entity. However, they may prove to be self-defeating in the long run should financial turbulences seriously deepen in large peripheral countries. (2) Austerity packages alone do not address the core problems of the eurozone. These packages would make sense only if they were included in a much wider reform agenda whose final purpose was the creation of a government banker and a federal European government that could run expansionary fiscal stances. In this sense, the unlimited bond-buying program recently launched by the European Central Bank is interpreted as a positive, albeit mild step in the right direction out of the extreme monetarism that has thus far shaped eurozone institutions...|$|R

Specifically whether the local governments stabilized each phase of economic cycle by their own interventions between the years 2001 and 2012 and helped to smoother economic development. Null hypothesis expected that bigger townships are more influential in the stabilization of economy than the smaller ones. In the first theoretical part of the thesis there were analyzed the types of economic cycle, literature, each components of municipal budget and last but not least, there were presented brief characteristics of the development of Czech economy. The study focused on selected municipalities of Hradec Králové region which were divided into four size-based categories. Statements about economic policy of each category were set up using the capital expenses and information gained during the interviews. Despite the fact that in most cases municipalities behaved as stabilizer of economic development, null hypothesis wasn't validated. Keywords: economic <b>policy,</b> <b>anticyclical</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: Ao longo das últimas duas décadas, a {{literatura}} consagrada no mainstream economics apresentou importantes alterações no escopo de seus estudos. Houve, claramente, dois momentos de descontinuidade, a saber: i) o primeiro, que se seguiu à crise dos países "emergentes"; e ii) o segundo, depois da crise financeira global deflagrada em 2008 - processo este ainda em curso. Nesse sentido, o objetivo dessa dissertação foi analisar essa ruptura no mainstream economics e como isso se refletiu sobre as prescrições do FMI sobre controles de capital e abertura financeira. Para tanto, o trabalho foi realizado a partir de pesquisa bibliográfica. Foi possível verificar que o primeiro momento de reorientação do mainstream economics foi caracterizado por estudos empíricos que contradisseram, para o conjunto de países "emergentes", os principais pressupostos ortodoxos que fundamentaram teoricamente o processo de abertura financeira dessas economias nos anos 1990. O segundo momento, por seu turno, tem se caracterizado por trabalhos empíricos que demonstram a efetividade e os limites do uso de controles sobre os fluxos internacionais de capital pelos países "emergentes", como resposta ao forte influxo de divisas ocorrido logo depois da crise global iniciada em 2008, sob o acicate das políticas anticíclicas realizadas pelos países desenvolvidos. Observou-se, ademais, que concomitantemente a esses estudos, também tem ocorrido uma reorientação teórica importante no âmbito do mainstream economics, caracterizada pelo surgimento de modelos ortodoxos que passaram a fundamentar o uso de controles de capital, inclusive de forma permanente. Com efeito, as recomendações do Fundo Monetário Internacional (FMI) quanto aos temas de abertura financeira e controles de capital também apresentaram mudanças desde as crises dos países "emergentes" dos anos 1990. No período caracterizado entre as "crises dos "emergentes" e crise global iniciada em 2008, as prescrições do FMI enfatizaram um processo de abertura financeira sequencial, em conjunto com a adoção de políticas macroeconômicas sólidas (os denominados thresholds), em contraposição à conversibilidade plena das contas financeiras que a instituição multilateral tradicionalmente recomendava aos países antes dos anos 1990. O segundo ponto de ruptura da retórica do FMI, que vem ocorrendo desde a crise iniciada em 2008, tem sido caracterizado por uma defesa parcial do uso de controles temporários de capital, desde que acompanhados ou precedidos de uma série de pré-requisitos. Contudo, a despeito das novas evidências apontadas pelos trabalhos mais recentes publicados pelo mainstream economics, as quais apontam para a pertinência do uso, inclusive permanente, dos controles sobre os fluxos internacionais de capital, as recomendações do FMI permaneceram relativamente conservadoras a esse respeito.;;Abstract:Over {{the past}} two decades, the literature consecrated in mainstream economics presented important change in its studies scope. There was, clearly, two moments of discontinuity, to know: i) the first one, which occurred after the crisis that hit the "emerging countries"; and ii) the second one, which occurred after the global financial crisis deflagrated in 2008 ¿ {{a process that is}} still ongoing. In this sense, the objective of this dissertation was to analyze this rupture in the mainstream economics, and how this process reflected on the International Monetary Fund¿s (IMF) prescriptions about capital controls and financial openness. Therefore, this dissertation was based in bibliographic research. It was possible to verify that the first moment of reorientation was characterized by empirical studies that contradicted, for the conjunct of "emerging" countries, the main orthodox assumptions that theoretically grounded the liberalizing processes of capital account of these economies during the 1990 s. The second period, in turn, has been characterized by empirical studies that demonstrate the effectiveness and limits of the use of controls over international fluxes of capital by "emerging countries", {{as a response to the}} strong influx of foreign currency that occurred since after the global crisis initiated in 2008, under the spur of <b>anticyclical</b> <b>policies</b> implemented by developed countries. It was observed, in addition, that in tandem with these studies, it also has been occurring an important rhetorical reorientation within mainstream economics, characterized by the appearance of orthodox models that ground the use of capital controls, including in a permanently way. Indeed, the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about financial openness and capital controls also presented significant change since the crisis that hit "emerging countries" in the 1990 s. In the period between these crisis and global financial collapse initiated in 2008, the IMF¿s prescriptions focused on a process of sequential financial openness in conjunct with the adoption of solid macroeconomic policies (the thresholds), in contraposition to the pressure for a full convertibility of capital account that this multilateral institution used to recommend to countries before the 1990 s. The second rupture point of the IMF¿s rhetoric, that has been occurring since the global crisis initiated in 2008, has been characterized by a partial defense of temporary capital controls, provided they are accompanied or preceded by a series of prerequisites. However, despite the new evidences pointed out by the mainstream economics¿ latest publications, which point out to the relevance of the use, including in a permanently way, of controls over international fluxes of capital, the IMF¿s recommendations remained relatively conservative about it...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the third pillar of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the {{discipline}} of agricultural domestic support. The paper examines the current definition of agricultural domestic support used by the WTO, focusing on the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) {{and other forms of}} support that are less to least distorting (Blue and Green Box payments). The analysis looks at the recent experience of four member states (the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Brazil). The structure of recent support varies considerably by country. Some countries, notably the United States, have strategically used the de minimis exemption to deflate their support figures substantially in order to remain within AMS limits, even though total support has exceeded these limits. The paper investigates the possible effects of changing the definition of the AMS so that it better reflects current support conditioned by market forces. If market prices (world and/or domestic) were to be used to compute current market support, a greater variability of the AMS would result, and violations of AMS limits would be more likely given the <b>anticyclical</b> nature of <b>policies</b> included in the AMS, especially for the United States and European Union. We also identify possible changes that would lead to more substantial trade reforms. In particular, we argue for phasing out the de minimis exemption and Blue Box support, adding a generous Green Box definition, which would allow countries to move quickly away from trade-distorting policies (Amber Box and the most trade-distorting Blue Box policies), followed by a phase-down of Green Box payments over time. The recent reforms of the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) exemplify the spirit of {{the first part of the}} recommendation, while resistance to phase-down of Green Box payments may be overcome by a 2 ̆ 2 reasonable 2 ̆ 2 reduction schedule...|$|R
