5|$|In March 2008, GMG Radio {{requested}} that Ofcom remove the 45-hour jazz commitment for its London and Manchester stations. The company planned to relaunch Jazz FM from the jazzfm.com service which broadcast on DAB in Glasgow, online and on <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> multiplex in London. In {{a meeting on}} 22 April 2008, Ofcom declined the request. GMG relaunched Jazz FM despite having to retain the jazz commitment.|$|E
5|$|Ofcom awards {{licenses}} for digital radio services differently {{depending on the}} type of service and the platform. Ofcom advertises the licences of new digital radio ensembles and are subject to an open competition to the highest bidder. Ensemble licence awards are awarded for twelve years. To broadcast a service on <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> ensemble, a station must hold a Digital Sound Programme Service licence from Ofcom. On digital television services, individual stations can apply for either a digital cable and satellite licence to broadcast on the aforementioned platforms, or apply for a digital terrestrial licence to broadcast on digital terrestrial television.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>DAB</b> is at <b>a</b> {{relatively}} {{early stage}} of deployment, DAB coverage is poor in nearly all countries {{in comparison to the}} high population coverage provided by FM.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>DAB</b> is not forward {{compatible}} with DAB+, older DAB receivers can not receive DAB+ broadcasts. However, DAB receivers {{that will be}} able to receive the new DAB+ standard via a firmware upgrade went on sale in July 2007. If a receiver is DAB+ compatible, there will be a sign on the product packaging.|$|R
5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast DAB signals within their stores to demonstrate DAB radio sets within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E
25|$|Within {{an overall}} target bit {{rate for the}} DAB ensemble, {{individual}} stations can be allocated different bit rates. The number of channels within <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> ensemble can be increased by lowering average bit rates, but {{at the expense of}} the quality of streams. Error correction under the DAB standard makes the signal more robust but reduces the total bit rate available for streams.|$|E
25|$|This {{efficiency}} originates {{from the}} ability <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> network has in broadcasting more channels per network. One network can broadcast 6–10 channels (with MPEG audio codec) or 10–16 channels (with HE AAC codec). Hence, {{it is thought}} that the replacement of FM-radios and FM-transmitters with new DAB-radios and DAB-transmitters will not cost any more as opposed to newer FM facilities.|$|E
60|$|The {{trouble of}} printing, reading off, and {{indexing}} the ten digits, is practically {{twice that of}} dealing with the six fingers; namely, three on each of the hands; the thumb being inconvenient to print from, and having to be printed separately, even for <b>a</b> <b>dabbed</b> impression, while the fingers of either hand can be dabbed down simultaneously.|$|R

However {{it is expected to}} be automatically renewed because it provides <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> simulcast signal. This is the same scenario applies to its sister stations GWR FM Bath and Classic Gold 1260.|$|E
25|$|Other favoritism {{allegations}} include Party {{vice chairman}} of the DAB, Lau Kong wah, who questioned whether Hong Kong police were biased in favoring the democrats, saying they made no arrest on 15 November when <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> staff member was pushed to the ground by a Democratic party member. He alleged the pan-democrats were playing victims and creating tragedy to win sympathy for Chan's campaign.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{multimedia}} broadcasting (DMB) and DAB-IP {{are suitable}} for mobile radio and TV both because they support MPEG 4 AVC and WMV9 respectively as video codecs. However, a DMB video subchannel can easily be added to any DAB transmission, as {{it was designed to}} be carried on <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> subchannel. DMB broadcasts in Korea carry conventional MPEG 1 Layer II DAB audio services alongside their DMB video services.|$|E

However, the station never launched after Channel 4 announced that it was abandoning its plans for digital radio stations ...|$|R
25|$|Traditionally radio {{programmes}} were {{broadcast on}} different frequencies via AM and FM, {{and the radio}} had to be tuned into each frequency, as needed. This used up a comparatively large amount of spectrum for {{a relatively small number}} of stations, limiting listening choice. DAB is a digital radio broadcasting system that through the application of multiplexing and compression combines multiple audio streams onto a relatively narrow band centred on a single broadcast frequency called <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> ensemble.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} decisions regarding the design of a digital radio system is the choice of which audio codec to use, because the efficiency of the audio codec determines how many radio stations can be carried on a multiplex at a given level of audio quality. The capacity of <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> multiplex is fixed, so the more efficient the audio codec is, the more stations can be carried, and vice versa. Similarly, for a fixed bit-rate level, the more efficient the audio codec is the higher the audio quality will be.|$|E
25|$|While {{offering}} listeners a {{much greater}} choice of stations and programming than previous, DAB did not offer Cornwall any extra local offering, as was hoped. Costs of launching <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> only station on the two non-BBC multiplexes was very expensive for any would-be community broadcasters, and when the NOW Cornwall Multiplex launched on the two main transmitters in Cornwall in 2004, it only relayed existing local FM stations, {{with the addition of}} DAB Networked Stations {e.g. XFM, Chill). The NOW Cornwall Multiplex however meant that Plymouth Sound, previously only audible in South East Cornwall, could be heard across most of Cornwall for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{admitted}} cowardice, Flashman is <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> hand at fighting {{when he has}} to. Though he dodges danger {{as much as he}} can, {{and runs}} away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides {{all the way to the}} Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.|$|E
2500|$|Also, as DAB transmits digital audio, {{there is}} no hiss with a weak signal, which can happen on FM. However, radios in the fringe of <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> signal, can {{experience}} a [...] "bubbling mud" [...] sound interrupting the audio or the audio cutting out altogether.|$|E

On , the company MuxCo Lincolnshire was the only company to bid for the Lincolnshire DAB licence. It is 51% owned by the Lincs FM Group, and will have transmitters at Belmont, High Hunsley (in East Yorkshire), Grantham and Lincoln County Hospital. They were [...] the DAB licence on 19 February 2008. Transmissions were expected to begin by July 2009, but funding for the project has delayed the roll-out to at least late-2010.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 the Office of Communications (Ofcom) awarded <b>a</b> <b>DAB</b> Digital Radio {{multiplex}} licence for Herefordshire & Worcestershire to [...] MuxCo Ltd. who {{aimed to}} provide several new stations in 2009, while also providing a digital platform for Free Radio, Sunshine Radio and BBC Hereford & Worcester and area extensions to United Christian Broadcasters and the Highways Agency. This multiplex eventually launched in December 2013, carrying the three aforementioned local services. In 2008, MXR, who {{owned and operated}} the West Midlands regional DAB multiplex licence, improved coverage of DAB Digital Radio across {{other parts of the}} county to include Worcester and Malvern. Services that could be heard reasonably across much of Worcestershire included: Chill, Gold (Birmingham), Magic Radio, Sunrise Radio, Traffic Radio (Midlands), BBC Radio WM, Xfm and Radio XL. However, this regional multiplex closed on 27 August 2013, reducing the number of services available in the county. A key factor behind this move was the industry-wide shift, supported by government, towards improving local and national DAB multiplexes.|$|E
