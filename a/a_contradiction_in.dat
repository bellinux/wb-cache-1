5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either result in <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> conception or in <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the will. The former {{are classified as}} perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses.

If the player spots a lie or <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E

25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E

His economic policy was often criticized for persisting with certain obsolete economic views and failing certain livelihood issues. There had been a considerable diplomatic dissonance between South Korea and its traditional allies during Roh's presidency as well. Former Bush administration officials such as Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates, in their memoirs published, claimed that Roh was anti-American and disclosed {{that there had been}} numerous conflicts between the U.S. and South Korea because of Roh's unpredictability. There has been criticism that Roh's anti-Americanism, nationalism, and pro-North Korean views contributed to <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> diplomacy and impaired credibility in the international community. It also led to a decline in some of his popular support, especially among the older generation.|$|E
500|$|When someone acts, it is {{according}} to a rule, or maxim. For Kant, an act is only permissible if one is willing for the maxim that allows the action to be a universal law by which everyone acts. Maxims fail this test if they produce either <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> conception or <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the will when universalized. <b>A</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> conception happens when, if a maxim were to be universalized, it ceases to make sense because the [...] "...maxim would necessarily destroy itself {{as soon as it}} was made a universal law." [...] For example, if the maxim 'It is permissible to break promises' was universalized, no one would trust any promises made, so the idea of a promise would become meaningless; the maxim would be self-contradictory because, when universalized, promises cease to be meaningful. The maxim is not moral because it is logically impossible to universalize—we could not conceive of a world where this maxim was universalized. A maxim can also be immoral if it creates <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the will when universalized. This does not mean a logical contradiction, but that universalizing the maxim leads to a state of affairs that no rational being would desire. For example, Driver argues that the maxim 'I will not give to charity' produces <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the will when universalized because a world where no one gives to charity would be undesirable for the person who acts by that maxim.|$|E

In Volkogonov's view, Lenin accepted Marxism as [...] "absolute truth", and accordingly acted like [...] "a religious fanatic". Similarly, Bertrand Russell felt that Lenin exhibited [...] "unwavering faith – religious faith in the Marxian gospel". Biographer Christopher Read suggested that Lenin was [...] "a secular equivalent of theocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the [...] truth of their doctrines, not popular mandates". Lenin was nevertheless an atheist and a critic of religion, believing that socialism was inherently atheistic; he thus considered Christian socialism <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> terms.|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet's soliloquy, but in Brooke's {{version of the}} story, her {{declaration}} is done alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually, a woman was required to be modest and shy {{to make sure that}} her suitor was sincere, but breaking this rule serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip courting and move on to plain talk about their relationship— agreeing to be married after knowing each other for only one night. In the final suicide scene, there is <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the message—in the Catholic religion, suicides were often thought to be condemned to hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the [...] "Religion of Love" [...] are joined with their loves in paradise. Romeo and Juliet's love seems to be expressing the [...] "Religion of Love" [...] view rather than the Catholic view.

500|$|According to {{a letter}} by Pieter Janszoon Schagen, Peter Minuit and Dutch colonists {{acquired}} Manhattan on May 24, 1626, from unnamed Native American people, which {{are believed to have}} been Canarsee Indians of the Lenape, in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders, often said to be worth US$24. The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch Estates General and {{member of the board of}} the Dutch West India Company, Pieter Janszoon Schagen, to the Estates General in November 1626. In 1846, New York historian John Romeyn Brodhead converted the figure of Fl 60 (or 60 guilders) to US$23. [...] " [...] variable-rate myth being <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> terms, the purchase price remains forever frozen at twenty-four dollars," [...] as Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace remarked in their history of New York. Sixty guilders in 1626 was valued at approximately $1,000 in 2006, according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam. Based on the price of silver, Straight Dope author Cecil Adams calculated an equivalent of $72 in 1992. Historians James and Michelle Nevius revisited the issue in 2014, suggesting that using the prices of beer and brandy as monetary equivalencies, the price Minuit paid would have the purchasing power of somewhere between $2,600 and $15,600 in current dollars. According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the Canarsees, who were willing to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for the island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.|$|E
