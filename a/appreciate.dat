5|$|Historians Hitchcock and Downs {{emphasized}} the far-reaching {{effects of the}} ongoing depression, inflation, rapidly increasing commodity prices, and mass unemployment, {{as well as the}} failure of the strikers to <b>appreciate</b> that these conditions affected the employer as well as the employee.|$|E
5|$|In watchmaking, Vacheron Constantin, Patek Philippe, Rolex, Breitling, {{and other}} {{companies}} use platinum for producing their limited edition watch series. Watchmakers <b>appreciate</b> the unique properties of platinum, as it neither tarnishes nor wears out (the latter quality relative to gold).|$|E
5|$|It is, as I may say, the key {{to unlock}} and detect almost all the {{impositions}} that have, at various times, arrested so much of public attention. It is a witness that can refute all false evidence, and will satisfy every discerner, how to <b>appreciate,</b> how to convict.|$|E
5000|$|Do the {{constituent}} {{parts of the}} group feel <b>appreciated</b> by their leadership? No human will work to their full potential {{if they do not}} feel <b>appreciated,</b> but those who feel <b>appreciated</b> will contribute remarkable amounts, including sacrifice of life.|$|R
50|$|The lion {{is a very}} <b>appreciated</b> animal, {{especially}} in the European heraldry, it {{was used as a}} decorative element in Asuncion’s architecture. A concrete lion is <b>appreciated</b> in the Museum.|$|R
50|$|Mushrooms {{are very}} much <b>appreciated,</b> oven baked, fried, with or without sauce to {{accompany}} meats, and the wild asparagus, very <b>appreciated</b> in the oliaigua (local soup) or simply with a tortilla.|$|R
5|$|Sicilian Baroque {{is today}} {{recognised}} as an architectural style, {{largely due to}} the work of Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 was the first book to <b>appreciate</b> the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 {{is rated}} well by car critics, who <b>appreciate</b> the car's {{interior}} and exterior design. In spite of comments regarding the DB9's weaker engine and handling, reviewers liked the car's ride and driving experience. Some also held issue with the DB9's small rear seats, cargo space and poor satnav.|$|E

50|$|The U350 was {{released}} in July 2009 to mixed reviews from different publications. LAPTOP Magazine <b>appreciated</b> the laptop’s design and low starting price, but was disappointed by the low battery life. Computer Shopper discounted the laptop’s performance but <b>appreciated</b> the light weight and affordable price. Stark Insider <b>appreciated</b> the laptop’s price, performance, keyboard, display and speakers. The negative points noted were the fan noise and heat on the left palm rest.|$|R
5|$|According to British filmmaker Tony Rayns the film's {{presentation}} of the vanity of a man, neglecting his family, is a critique of historic men in feudal Japanese culture. In his relationship with Wakasa, Genjurō is insignificant and is seduced by something greater, that he can never comprehend. However, by neglecting his family, Genjurō failed to <b>appreciate</b> he has already been blessed with a good life, and in the process, loses it.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community to <b>appreciate</b> {{the potential of}} electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or <b>appreciate</b> nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
5000|$|Namma Tamil Cinema <b>appreciated</b> {{the film}} saying [...] "Manal Naharam will truly fills joy for cine-goers". The film was <b>appreciated</b> for {{the content and}} execution. The gulf law, the Indians in gulf {{countries}} and the touching climax stands out as per Namma Tamil Cinema portal. They <b>appreciated</b> the directorial skill of Oru Thalai Raagam Shankar for extracting good performance from the actors and mentioned Vinod Kumar (VK)'s performance as outstanding.|$|R

25|$|All the {{varieties}} were <b>appreciated,</b> but the hot ones are particularly <b>appreciated</b> {{because they can}} enliven otherwise monotonous diets. This was of some importance during dietary restrictions for religious reasons, such as Lent in Christian countries.|$|R
5|$|Hašek {{is known}} to <b>appreciate</b> humor to keep team spirits up, and often jokes about his {{resemblance}} to Cosmo Kramer of Seinfeld. In the late 1990s, he was featured in a MasterCard commercial that praised his flexibility. On November 26, 2006, Mark Parisi's comic panel off the mark featured a comic about Hašek's childhood.|$|E
5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI researchers had failed to <b>appreciate</b> {{the difficulty of the}} problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught the Classics and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could <b>appreciate</b> Musidora as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.|$|E

6000|$|We need hardly say, after this, {{that those}} Dogrib Indians spent an excited and {{agreeable}} evening with the fur-traders. They <b>appreciated</b> the dancing, undoubtedly, though {{very few of}} them would condescend to join. They <b>appreciated</b> the plum-duff and the greasy cakes highly, and they more than <b>appreciated</b> the tea--especially the women--which MacSweenie took care to provide hot, strong, and sweet. But {{there is no doubt that}} the lion of the evening was--the [...] "fuddle." ...|$|R

5|$|My {{heart goes}} out to the {{families}} of those lost in the Challenger disaster. The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and <b>appreciate</b> every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E
5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to <b>appreciate</b> {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was {{particularly}} vocal about increased African {{representation in the}} Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the federation was never a goal of its proponents, it was there primarily {{because it was not}} economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or <b>appreciate</b> the party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being.|$|E

5|$|The {{children}} were {{taught how to}} read by a system devised by the school's founder, Valentin Haüy. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who {{devoted his life to}} helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters. Readers would trace their fingers over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could <b>appreciate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{critically}} acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned {{that not all}} players would <b>appreciate</b> the level of difficulty. The game was a commercial success, and sold {{more than one million}} copies as of January 2012. A sequel, Super Meat Boy Forever, is currently in development for release in 2018.|$|E
5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency <b>appreciate</b> relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{proved to}} be average. In their review, various critics <b>appreciated</b> Bhosle's {{performance}} but criticised the film for clichéd plot. Filmfare also <b>appreciated</b> Bhosle by writing that she [...] "weaves magic {{but not enough to}} save a mediocre movie".|$|R
50|$|Effective {{exchange}} rates {{are useful for}} gauging whether a currency has <b>appreciated</b> overall relative to trading partners. For example, in 2015 the Chinese RMB depreciated about 8% against the US dollar. However, more of China's trade is with Asia and Europe than with the United States, and the dollar <b>appreciated</b> against those currencies. The net effect was that once weighted by trade shares {{the value of the}} Chinese currency actually <b>appreciated</b> approximately 10% relative to its trading partners.|$|R
