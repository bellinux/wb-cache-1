At first Jacqui is not happy to see her but the two {{sit down and have}} a conversation. Mercedes admits that at first the {{kidnapping}} was a scam to get back <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Browning (Joe Thompson) for supposedly cheating on her and apologizes to Jacqui. At first Jacqui is furious at Mercedes for this and yells at her causing them both to start crying. After insulting Mercedes Jacqui forgives her and tells her that she love her. Jacqui is last seen relaxing by the pool on a sun lounger drinking a cocktail with Mercedes whilst they talk and say their final goodbyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, {{the team}} played the Bengals in the playoffs, this time <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Brown Stadium, and secured a 24–14 victory over Cincinnati. That victory {{meant that the}} Jets would travel to San Diego to play the Chargers, who had won eleven straight games, in the divisional round. Strong performances by Sanchez, running back Shonn Greene, and the Jets defense helped the Jets to a 17–14 win over the Chargers. New York played the top-seeded Colts in the AFC Championship Game and secured an early 17–6 lead. They had little luck {{in the second half}} as the Colts went to the Super Bowl with a 30–17 victory.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} also adapted into a play in two acts by James W. Rodgers. It was first {{performed}} on December 15, 1993 <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Laurence Dunbar High School. The play opens with George Bailey contemplating suicide {{and then goes}} back through major moments in his life. Many of the scenes from the movie are only alluded to or mentioned in the play rather than actually dramatized. For example, in the opening scene Clarence just mentions George having saved his brother Harry after the latter had fallen through the ice.|$|E
25|$|In January 1987, Spacemen 3 {{commenced}} work {{on their}} second album, The Perfect Prescription. This was recorded <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Atkins' VHF Studios, near Rugby. VHF had been recommended to the band by in-house sound engineer Graham Walker with whom they had worked previously when recording their first demo tape. The first set of demo recordings they made at VHF Studios relating to the new album were dubbed the 'Out Of It Sessions'. Procurable only as bootleg, this work shows the transition in Spacemen 3's musical style that was occurring around winter 1986/87.|$|E

25|$|Brinkley {{was born}} Christie Lee Hudson in Monroe, Michigan, the {{daughter}} of Marjorie (née Bowling) and Herbert Hudson. Her family moved to Canoga Park, Los Angeles, California, where her mother Marjorie later met and married television writer Don Brinkley in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Don adopted Christie and her brother Gregory Donald Brinkley. During this time, the family lived in Malibu and then the Brentwood neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Brinkley was educated <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Revere Junior High School and attended Le Lycée Français de Los Angeles from 9th to 12th grade. After graduation in 1973, she moved to Paris, France, to study art.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} expressionist use of {{monolithic}} materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not {{to be missed}} was a pun on the towers namesake, Einstein, and {{an attempt to make}} the building out of one stone, Ein stein. Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of an 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E

25|$|While some Austrian leaders proved irresolute, Schwarzenberg thrust boldly <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Grenier's {{left wing}} {{divisions}} of Louis Bastoul and Michel Ney. Gavasini's Gemmingen Regiment quickly seized {{the village of}} Forstern {{and had to be}} driven out. Schwarzenberg's fight centered on a series of hamlets north of Hohenlinden. The Murray Regiment carried Kronacker in an impetuous assault, lost it to Ney's counterattack, and captured it again. Later in the day, the French retook Kronacker before losing it again to a charge by the Murray Regiment. By this time, Kienmayer found out that the French had smashed Johann Kollowrat's Left Center Column and he issued orders to retreat. In spite of the difficult tactical situation, Schwarzenberg was able to withdraw his division in good order.|$|E
25|$|In March 1986, Frank Williams {{faced the}} most serious {{challenge}} of his life. While returning to the airport at Nice, France, after pre-season testing <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Ricard, {{he was involved in}} a road accident which left him paralysed. He did not return to the pit lane for almost a year. Despite the lack of his trackside presence, the Williams team won nine Grands Prix and the Constructors' Championship and came close to winning the Drivers' Championship with Nigel Mansell, but the British driver's left-rear tyre blew at the , the final round of the season, while his fellow championship rival and teammate, Nelson Piquet made a pitstop shortly after Mansell's retirement as a precaution. This left Alain Prost to defend his title successfully, despite being in an inferior car.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{schedule}} for the TS030s consisted {{of participation in the}} May pre-qualifying and testing session at Le Mans in preparation for the race in June. It was scheduled to make its début in the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, but its heavy testing crash <b>at</b> <b>Paul</b> Ricard in April, while performing an endurance test, damaged the chassis beyond repair and the team was forced to delay the TS030's first race appearance until the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June because of the time needed to produce a new monocoque. The ACO and world motorsport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), persuaded Toyota to expand their presence in the World Endurance Championship (WEC) by extending the deadline for entries following Peugeot's withdrawal from sports car racing, but the manufacturer elected not to enter the 12 Hours of Sebring because of time constraints.|$|E
