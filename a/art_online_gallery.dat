40|$|Abstract. Humans name things. Naming is {{essential}} for pointing to recognizable images, sounds, and emotions. In every culture throughout history certain stereotypical images have emerged to indicate grounded truths for the people. Today, where images are ubiquitous in their billions, available for use at a price, it becomes important to provide a balancing counterpart of high quality, royalty free images, under an appropriate creative commons licence. In addition to the usual folksonomical tagging it is recommended to have, in addition, a formal support vocabulary {{for which there is}} an appropriate formal reasoning system. In this paper we continue the pragmatic exposition of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, supported by the Erlangen OWL encoding, and exercised through the Protégé editor. Examples of keyimages are drawn from Television programs, <b>online</b> <b>Art</b> <b>Galleries,</b> and ordinary printed photographs. Vocabulary data are normally provided in both Bulgarian and English. Data in other languages, such as Gaeilge, French, German and Russian, are entered as needed...|$|R
