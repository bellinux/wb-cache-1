500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the book was positive, particularly regarding the depth the book added to the Halo universe. Reviewer Eric Qualls commented that [...] " [...] interesting to read <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> much greater understanding" [...] to the universe. Qualls made a positive comparison to Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers regarding the manner of story telling. GameCritics' Brad Gallaway also praised the back-story the book adds {{and the quality of}} the story. Fellow reviewer Gene Park noted the descriptions in the book went beyond what was presented in the game calling them [...] "vibrant and rousing." [...] He also complimented the characters presented in the novel saying they all [...] "fit nicely into the Halo universe" [...] but some times there were too many characters to remember. Sal Accardo of 3D Action Planet said of the book; [...] " [...] isn’t going to win any Pulitzers anytime soon. It’s well written, and a solid page-turner, but it’s still basically an action movie presented in book form" [...] but praised the gritty presentation of the Spartans. Don D'Ammasa of the Science Fiction Chronicle called the book [...] "competently written", but stated the plot was [...] "simpleminded".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{embarked}} on The Velvet Rope Tour, visiting Europe, North America, Japan, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia. It used an autobiographical theme derived from elements of Broadway theater. She stated, [...] "To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I {{know there are}} people who just walk onstage <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> show by just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra". She added, [...] "I knew what I wanted everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I wanted everyone to wear. I visualized the whole thing". Among the first tours to use LED technology, Mark Fisher stated, [...] "She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen".|$|E

[...] Jackson tattooed the symbol onto her wrist and used the image frequently throughout the tour's promotional imagery.|$|E
