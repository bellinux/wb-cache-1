We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>better</b> band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but I think it is great." ...|$|E

It was reported on 19 August 2007 that Kensit's casting had [...] "boosted the series' appeal" [...] {{to such an extent}} that for the first time, a Holby City calendar had been commissioned. [...] The report quoted a series insider as stating: [...] "Patsy has really set the show off this year, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>better</b> way to thank the dedicated fans?".|$|E

He also received assistance from Cuban composer Rudy Pérez and Dominican singer-songwriter Juan Luis Guerra with the songwriting. Recording began on 4 July 1992. Miguel had difficulty finding a suitable producer for the record; he initially worked with American audio engineer Bruce Swedien, {{but decided to}} re-record the whole album after disagreements with Swedien's direction. Unable to find a producer, he decided to co-produce the album with his long-time associate Kiko Cibrian. Recording the album took almost a year and was affected by several complications, including its high budget of over US$1.5 million, his father's death, and an appendectomy. Miguel announced that {{the name of the}} album would be Aries during a presentation at the 1993 Festival Acapulco. About the naming of the album he said, [...] "This album expresses my personal self. I had a lot to do. I produced everything and wanted {{to have a lot of}} fun, take what I like, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>better</b> than the zodiacal sign representing what one is." ...|$|E

500|$|Lagaan was {{met with}} high {{critical}} acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals." [...] Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it [...] "could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as [...] "a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines" [...] Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, [...] "Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as [...] "a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling." [...] Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that [...] "Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is [...] "an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it {{to the level of}} an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view." [...] Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that [...] "the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be." [...] The Times of India wrote, [...] "Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping." [...] Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote [...] "a masterpiece ... <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>better</b> way to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film." ...|$|E

2500|$|TouchArcade {{noted that}} VA-11 HALL-A {{also has a}} more [...] "salacious side", due to the {{presence}} of sexually suggestive character interactions that was present in the game's demo. In an interview between Ortiz and Siliconera, Ortiz said that the game also has [...] "waifu" [...] elements, inspired by the [...] "classic otaku getting strongly attached to a character"; the developers sought to recreate these relationships through characterization and not so much through looks, though there are [...] "a fair share of beautiful people." [...] In another interview between Christopher Oritz and Kill Screen, Ortiz remarked how [...] "this game is all about exploring what's up with the characters that you always see in the background who are never fleshed out [...] ", and due to this, the characters were designed to be average non-heroes; Jill, for example, was described by Ortiz as the cliche [...] "bartender who’s always there in the background" [...] as opposed to a [...] "hero" [...] who is always at [...] "the center of the universe, with everyone else with a supporting role." [...] Adding that [...] "you can see it as early as the premise: [...] not a hero, but the bartender", Ortiz further explains that all the game's characters, from the [...] " [...] staples like mercenaries and hackers" [...] to [...] "common folk like veterinarians, journalists, or couriers", were deliberately made to be everyday [...] "people, each with their opinion and lives", making them relatable to the player despite the futuristic setting. To help with this relatability, many of the characters and subplots in VA-11 HALL-A were based on the experiences of the developers themselves or people they know, since [...] "We want the characters to feel as real as possible, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>better</b> reference for real things than reality itself?".|$|E
