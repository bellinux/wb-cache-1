As of mid-2012, most of the former were legally registered with the UNHCR in Islamabad. The agency offered skills-training programs in English, primary education courses, as well as provisions to cover basic amenities and living expenses. Members of the community sought {{to improve the quality}} and consistency of these services by raising their concerns with the relevant authorities. Additionally, the UNHCR issued Proof of Registration (POR) Cards to the secondary migrants in conjunction with NADRA. Others wielded a National <b>Aliens</b> <b>Registration</b> Authority (NARA) Card. A section of the younger generation among this group {{was born and raised in}} Pakistan. The expiration of the POR Cards in December 2012 saw a more expedited movement of the transient migrants from Pakistan to other countries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{census of}} islanders the Germans ordered in autumn 1941, {{combined}} with the pre-war <b>aliens</b> <b>registration</b> records, the police records of enemy aliens who had been detained in May/June 1940 {{combined with the}} German requirement for people of the Jewish faith to register, gave the Germans the names {{of most of the}} Jews in Guernsey and the nearby island of Sark. Three Jews were deported to German-occupied France in April 1942, where they took jobs and from where, several months later they were picked up in a roundup of French Jews and were eventually killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau. [...] After the war a British Military Intelligence report said “when the Germans proposed to put their anti-Jewish measures into force, no protest whatever was raised by any of the Guernsey officials and they hastened to give the Germans every assistance”.|$|E
5000|$|... 1914 {{marked a}} {{landmark}} in UK immigration control {{in that it}} was only from this point that every person entering the country had to produce evidence of identity. The 1914 <b>Aliens</b> <b>Registration</b> Act was rushed through Parliament in a single day {{on the eve of the}} First World War and allowed stricter controls than before including the power to make aliens aged over 16 register with the police. The power still remains in use. Although the 1905 Act technically survived until its repeal in 1919, it was, in practice, submerged by the far more stringent powers of the Aliens Restriction Act of 1914. The 1914 Act contained a clause which gave the Home Secretary power to prevent the entry and order the deportation of aliens if it was deemed 'conducive to the public good'. For the purposes of the 1914 legislation immigration officers were re-titled Aliens Officers and the service was a compound of Home Office staff and Customs staff.|$|E

40|$|The {{whereabouts}} of migrants: {{a comparison of}} Dutch migrant registration systems. Today, one way of visualising the current refugee and migrant crisis on the outer borders of Europe is by showing a bottleneck in the processing of migrant flows: large groups of people waiting endlessly for their registration before {{they are allowed to}} enter ‘the promised land’. But registering and mobility is not a new phenomenon: With the emergence of the modern nation-state, the distinction between ‘foreigner’ and ‘national’ became more important. States started to set up information systems. From 1840 onwards population registers in western European countries were introduced, which made it possible to monitor mobility of individuals, residents or aliens, over time and to discern specific migrant streams (Moch 2003). National consular services, responsible for issuing visas registered citizens abroad, while national security and <b>aliens</b> <b>registration</b> services collected information on inward migrants. During World War II, the allies started to coordinate attempts to establish migration management on a global scale. These were continued after 1945, when countries were confronted with new and large groups of displaced persons, demographic problems, security issues and questions of manpower. With millions of people on the move who wanted to leave Europe, it resulted in multilateral collaboration to regulate migration and a plethora of more specific migrant registration systems. In these years the Dutch government started their so called active migration policy, facilitating emigration, in close collaboration with civil society organizations. Migration studies usually have a strong focus on the inward movement. As a result the data (and policy files) of the <b>aliens</b> <b>registration</b> services, collected with the purpose of ‘control’ and ‘monitoring’, are best known. The aim {{of this paper is to}} make a comparative analysis of migrant registration systems in order to asses a Dutch registration system of Dutch nationals to Australia (1946 - 1991). Records with data on over 50, 000 migrant units (90 % of the Dutch-Australian migrants) were kept from the moment they applied to the moment that they settled – and sometimes even long afterwards. What kind of information was registered, by whom and what was the original purpose of this system? Why wanted the Dutch authorities to monitor citizens who left? And what can we discern today from the different layers of information about the bureaucratic habits of civil servants? I will argue that the original function of the cards was no more than an index on personal files of selected migrants, which developed into a system that was deliberately used by Dutch authorities for migration policy goals...|$|E
