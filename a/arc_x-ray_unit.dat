40|$|Clinical {{experience}} {{indicates that}} newly available portable hand-held <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> provide advantages compared to traditional fixed properly installed and operated <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> in dental radiography. However, concern that hand-held <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> produce higher operator doses than fixed <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> has caused regulatory agencies to mandate requirements {{for use of}} hand-held units that go beyond those recommended by the manufacturer and can discourage {{the use of this}} technology. To assess the need for additional requirements, a hand-held <b>x-ray</b> <b>unit</b> and a pair of manikins were used to measure the dose to a simulated operator under two conditions: exposures made according to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations and exposures made according to manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation except for the removal of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>unit</b> 2 ̆ 7 s protective backscatter shield. Dose to the simulated operator was determined using an array of personal dosimeters and a pair of pressurized ion chambers. The results indicate that the dose to an operator of this equipment will be less than 0. 6 mSy y(- 1) if the device is used according to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations. This suggests that doses to properly trained operators of well-designed, hand-held dental <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> will be below 1. 0 mSv y(- 1) (2...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{development}} of modern imaging methods, the radiography {{has remained the}} basic tool in radiodiagnostics. Individual radiography laboratories need adequate instrumentation for their flawless operation. The parameters of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> must correspond to the type and quantity of its output required. The {{first part of the}} dissertation describes an <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> and its individual structural units, including their principle of function. The necessary X-ray equipment and tools are also described, as well as the generation of a radiographic image in film and digital radiography. The next part of the dissertation presents the questionnaire inquiry performed. The objective of the inquiry was to obtain data on the specifics of various types of radiographic laboratories and the <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> used. The qualitative and quantitative statistical data obtained are presented, and the effects of the units various parameters on the laboratorys workflow are evaluated, taking the users judgement of the instruments into account. On the basis of the number of exposures and other data, the basic types of radiography laboratories are specified. In conclusion, the optimum configuration of the parameters of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> for individual types of laboratories is proposed.

40|$|Background: X-ray {{examination}} {{is associated}} with patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Dose values depend {{on the type of}} medical procedure used, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> technical condition and exposure conditions selected. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the dose value received by patients during certain conventional radiography X-ray examinations and to assess the technical condition of medical equipment used for this purpose. Material and Methods: The study covered the total number of 118 conventional diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> located in the Masovian Voivodeship. The methodology used to assess the conventional diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> technical condition and the measurement of the radiation dose rate received by patients are based on test procedures developed by the Department of Radiation Protection and Radiobiology of the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (Warszawa, Poland) accredited for compliance with PN-EN 17025 standard by the Polish Centre for Accreditation. Results: It was found that 84. 7 % of <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> fully meet the criteria set out in the Polish legislation regarding the safe use of ionizing radiation in medicine, while 15. 3 % of the units do not meet some of them. The broadest dose value range was recorded for adult patients. Particularly, during lateral (LAT) lumbar spine radiography the recorded entrance surface dose (ESD) values ranged from 283. 5 to 7827 μGy (mean: 2183. 3 μGy). Conclusions: It is absolutely necessary to constantly monitor the technical condition of all <b>X-ray</b> <b>units,</b> because it affects population exposure to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, it is essential to raise radiographers’ awareness of the effects that ionizing radiation exposure can have on the human body. Med Pr 2014; 65 (6) : 715 – 72...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the dose received by patients during dental X-ray examination and the assessment of the technical condition of medical equipment. Materials and Methods: The study included a total number of 79 dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> located in the region of Mazovia.

Results: The research found that 69. 6 % fully meets the criteria set out in the Polish legislation regarding the safe use of ionizing radiation in medicine, while 30. 4 % did not meet some of them. A tenfold difference in the size of the dose received by patients during dental X-ray examinations was discovered. For example, during a radiography of the canine teeth of a child, the recorded entrance surface dose (ESD) ranged from 72. 8 to 2430 μGy with the average value of 689. 1 μGy.

The energy spectra were characterized by performing half value layer measurements and by performing a spectral analysis. Two spectral reconstruction techniques were investigated and compared. One involved using a previously determined detector response matrix and a backstripping technique. The other reconstruction technique was developed for this research using neural computing. A neural network was designed and trained to reconstruct measured X-ray spectra from data collected with a high- purity germanium spectroscopy system. Five X-ray beams were successfully characterized and found to replicate the ANSI N 13. 11 and the National Institute of Standards Technology X-ray beam codes. As a result, these prepared X-ray beams have been used for reference dosimetry. It has been shown that a neural network can be used as a spectral reconstruction technique, which contributes less error to the lower energy portion of the spectrum than other techniques...|$|R
