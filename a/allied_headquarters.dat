5|$|Napoleon's lure did {{not stop}} at that. On 25 November, General Savary {{was sent to the}} <b>Allied</b> <b>headquarters</b> at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while {{secretly}} examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, {{concurrent}} with No.1 Wing and {{its three}} Supermarine Spitfire squadrons becoming operational in the Darwin area, No.77 Squadron {{was transferred to}} Milne Bay in New Guinea. Along with Nos.6, 75 and 100 Squadrons it came {{under the control of}} the newly formed No.71 Wing, which was part of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the South West Pacific Area. No.77 Squadron registered its first daytime victory on 11April, when a Kittyhawk shot down a Mitsubishi Zero taking part in a raid on Allied shipping near Buna. Three days later the Japanese attacked Milne Bay; the squadron claimed four bombers and a fighter for the loss of one Kittyhawk. By this time, <b>Allied</b> <b>headquarters</b> had finalised plans for a drive north to the Philippines involving heavy attacks on Rabaul and the occupation of territory in New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomon Islands.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Japanese {{forces were}} taking over Java and {{threatening}} the <b>Allied</b> <b>headquarters</b> at Bandung. On 5 March, the Allied command decided that several senior RAF and RAAF officers {{had to be}} evacuated from Bandung. Winckel {{was chosen as the}} pilot. He protested the decision, arguing that his lack of rest would hinder his chances of finding Bandung in the dark as he did not have any electronic aids. However, Winckel was seen {{to be one of the}} most experienced pilots because of his terrain knowledge as a flight instructor at Bandung and his recent refugee flights. Another factor was that his Lodestar, although it had been damaged in the attack on Broome, was considered the most suitable plane for the evacuation mission. Winckel flew to Java, where he managed to land his plane on a road lit by jeep headlights. He picked up fourteen passengers, refuelled the plane and successfully returned to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{decryption}} of German radio communications, the <b>Allied</b> <b>headquarters</b> {{became aware}} of the German withdrawal plan. They recognized the open German flank to the east of the Rhône at Grenoble due the retreat of the 157th Infantry Division towards the Alps. To seize this opportunity, Taskforce Butler was ordered to advance in this direction, paralleling the German evacuation effort and ultimately cutting them off further north. While doing so, it fought some scattered German resistance, and finally, after turning left, found itself near Montélimar, a small city on the east bank of the Rhône River. This town lay directly on the German escape route. Following Taskforce Butler was the 36th Infantry Division. Together, they were tasked on 20August to block the German force at Montélimar as well as continue the northward advance to Grenoble, while VICorps was pursuing the Germans from behind. However, after this speedy advance, the forward Allied forces suffered now from a serious lack of fuel and supplies, which made this task difficult.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} forward from Waigani to {{enable it to}} join the {{fighting}} later as a counterattacking force. They, along with the 2/9th, were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from No. 3 Airstrip to KB Mission. Meanwhile, the Japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and Mikawa decided to reinforce the forces that were already ashore. These reinforcements, consisting of 567 men from the 3rd Kure SNLF and 200 from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF, left Rabaul on 28 August. At around 4:30pm an RAAF patrol spotted the Japanese convoy– consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers– and subsequently reported this to the <b>Allied</b> <b>headquarters.</b> Believing that further landings were about to occur, Clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with the troops from the 18th Brigade. Orders were also passed for the 30 Kittyhawks at Gili Gili to be flown off to Port Moresby in case the Japanese succeeded in breaking through to the airfield. The attack did not take place, though, and consequently {{early in the morning}} on 29 August they returned, albeit minus two aircraft which had crashed during the move.|$|E

5|$|When the Second World War {{began in}} September 1939, Hill was {{recalled}} to his regiment and given {{command of the}} 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers' advance party when the battalion left for France during the same month. The battalion {{was assigned to the}} 12th Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Infantry Division. He then commanded a platoon for several months, when the battalion was stationed along the Maginot Line, before being promoted to the rank of Captain in January 1940 and joining the staff at <b>Allied</b> <b>Headquarters.</b> The Battle of France began in May 1940, by which time Hill was attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort; during this period he was involved in planning the evacuation of the civilian population of Brussels, and also carried Gort's dispatches to Calais ordering the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). At the end of the campaign, he took command of the evacuation of the beach at La Panne, and was on the last destroyer to leave Dunkirk. For these actions, he was awarded the Military Cross. On his return to Britain, he was promoted to Major and travelled to Dublin in the Irish Free State, where he planned for the evacuation of British citizens from the city should German forces land there. When this task was completed, he volunteered for the fledgling Parachute Regiment, part of the British Army's growing airborne forces, and undertook parachute training; when the 1st Parachute Battalion was formed on 15 August 1941, he was appointed as its second-in-command.|$|E

By doing so, LXXXVCorps {{as well as}} the IVLuftwaffe Field Corps were able to successfully retreat from the Allied advance at the Rhône. The Allies were unsure about the German intentions, and Truscott decided to try to trap the Germans with a right flank movement whilst pursuing the Germans with his three divisions from VICorps.

500|$|The {{story of}} Kuhl's {{slapping}} broke in the U.S. when newspaper columnist Drew Pearson revealed {{it on his}} 21 November radio program. Pearson received details of the Kuhl incident and other material on Patton from his friend Ernest Cuneo, an official with the Office of Strategic Services, who obtained the information from War Department files and correspondence. Pearson's version not only conflated details of both slapping incidents but falsely reported that the private in question was visibly [...] "out of his head", telling Patton to [...] "duck down or the shells would hit him" [...] and that in response [...] "Patton struck the soldier, knocking him down." [...] Pearson punctuated his broadcast by twice stating that Patton would never again be used in combat, {{despite the fact that}} Pearson had no factual basis for this prediction. In response, <b>Allied</b> <b>Headquarters</b> denied that Patton had received an official reprimand, but confirmed that Patton had slapped at least one soldier.|$|E
500|$|One {{significant}} {{achievement for}} the resistance in Visayas was {{the capture of}} the [...] "Koga Papers" [...] by Cebuano guerrillas led by Lt. Col. James M. Cushing in March 1944. Named after Admiral Mineichi Koga, these papers contained vital battle plans and defensive strategies of the Japanese Navy codenamed the [...] "Z Plan", information on the overall strength of the Japanese fleet and naval air units, and most importantly that the Japanese have already deduced MacArthur's initial plans to invade the Philippines through Mindanao. These papers came into the possession of the Filipino guerrillas when the seaplane of Admiral Koga, which was en route to Davao, crashed into the coast San Fernando, Cebu, killing Koga and many others. After Koga's body and many surviving Japanese were washed ashore, the guerrillas found them and captured 12 high-ranking officers including Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukodome. The papers were inside a briefcase which was fished {{out of the sea}} by Cebuano fishermen before being handed down to the guerrillas. The Japanese ruthlessly hunted down the documents and their captured officers; burning villages and detaining civilians in their search. The guerrillas were ultimately forced to release their captives in order to stop the aggression, but unknown to the Japanese Cushing managed to request for a submarine to take the documents to <b>Allied</b> <b>headquarters</b> in Australia. The discovery of the papers allowed MacArthur to move his invasion from Mindanao to Leyte and also aided the Allies in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.|$|E

Still, he strongly suggested Patton apologize to all involved. On 21 August, Patton brought Bennett into his office; he apologized and the men shook hands. On 22 August, he met with Currier {{as well as the}} medical staff who had witnessed the events in each unit and expressed regret for his [...] "impulsive actions." [...] Patton related to the medical staff a story of a friend from World War I who had committed suicide after [...] "skulking"; he stated he sought to prevent any recurrence of such an event. On 23 August, he brought Kuhl into his office, apologized, and shook hands with him as well. After the apology, Kuhl said he thought Patton was [...] "a great general," [...] and that [...] "at the time, he didn't know how sick I was." [...] Currier later said Patton's remarks sounded like [...] "no apology at all, an attempt to justify what he had done." [...] Patton wrote in his diary that he loathed making the apologies, particularly when he was told by Bennett's brigade commander, Brigadier General John A. Crane, that Bennett had gone absent without leave (AWOL) and arrived at the hospital by [...] "falsely representing his condition." [...] Patton wrote, [...] "It is rather a commentary on justice when an Army commander has to soft-soap a skulker to placate the timidity of those above." [...] As word of the actions had spread informally among troops of the Seventh Army, Patton drove to each division under his command between 24 and 30 August and gave a 15-minute speech in which he praised their behavior and apologized for any instances where he had been too harsh on soldiers, making only vague reference to the two slapping incidents. In his final apology speech to the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, Patton was overcome with emotion when the soldiers supportively began to chant [...] "No, general, no, no," [...] to prevent him from having to apologize.|$|E

On 12 May an Allied liaison team arrived in Flensburg and took quarters aboard the passenger ship Patria. The liaison officers and the Supreme <b>Allied</b> <b>Headquarters</b> soon realized that they had no need to act through the Flensburg government and that its members should be arrested. On 23 May, acting on SHAEF's orders and with the approval of the Soviets, American Major General Rooks summoned Dönitz aboard the Patria and communicated to him that he and all the members of his Government were under arrest, and that their government was dissolved. The Allies had a problem, because they realized that although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, SHAEF had failed to use the document created by the [...] "European Advisory Commission" [...] (EAC) and so there had been no formal surrender by the civilian German government. This was considered a very important issue, because just as the civilian, but not military, surrender in 1918 had been used by Hitler to create the [...] "stab in the back" [...] argument, the Allies did not want to give any future hostile German regime a legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.|$|E
2500|$|Together with Gladwyn Jebb {{he helped}} to {{negotiate}} the Italian armistice in August 1943, between the fall of Sicily and the Salerno Landings. This caused friction with Eden and the Foreign Office. He was based at Caserta {{for the rest of}} the war. He was appointed UK High Commissioner for the Advisory Council for Italy late in 1943. He visited London in October 1943 and again clashed with Eden. Eden appointed Duff Cooper as Ambassador to France (still under German occupation) and Noel Charles as Ambassador to Italy to reduce Macmillan's influence. In May 1944 Macmillan infuriated Eden by demanding an early peace treaty with Italy (at that time a pro-Allied regime under Badoglio held some power in the southern, liberated, part of Italy), a move which Churchill favoured. In June 1944 he argued for a British-led thrust up the Ljubljana Gap into Central Europe (Operation [...] "Armpit") instead of the planned diversion of US and Free French forces to the South of France (Operation Dragoon). This proposal impressed Churchill and General Alexander, but did not meet with American approval. Eden sent out Robert Dixon to abolish the job of Resident Minister, there being then no job for Macmillan back in the UK, but he managed to prevent his job being abolished. Churchill visited Italy in August 1944. On 14 September 1944 Macmillan was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Allied Central Commission for Italy (in succession to General Macfarlane).
