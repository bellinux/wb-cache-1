To {{the extent that}} these projects have higher risks, {{we need to make}} sure that the regulatory frameworks also incentivize investment at the high end of the risk spectrum. • In this brief we discuss whether an adequate framework for projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> implies moving towards a dedicated regulatory framework, concluding that this is not necessarily necessary. • Some Member States might prefer to apply their default regulatory framework to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest.</b> This approach avoids the additional costs of administering another framework. However, the conventional default framework provides the same return for all infrastructure investment, implying a risk of underpaying for high-risk investment and overpaying for low-risk investment. • Other Member States might prefer to apply a dedicated regulatory framework for important infrastructure investment to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest.</b> These dedicated frameworks allow dealing with underpaying for important investment as well as mitigating the risk of overpaying by adjusting incentives to the value and risk of a project. • In both cases, the EU and ACER have important roles to play in ensuring that the regulatory framework applying to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> is adequate. Their roles could include assessing the applicable frameworks, assisting NRAs with multi-jurisdictional coordination, ensuring dedicated frameworks for investment of national importance apply also to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest,</b> and assisting NRAs on a voluntary basis with performing case-by-case assessments...|$|R
