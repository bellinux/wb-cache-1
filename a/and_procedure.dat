This was done by a thorough review of the relevant literature, by interviewing the institution's staff (mainly faculty) members and by conducting focus groups in which faculty members of the institution participated. The research was conducted by employing an action research approach. The initial findings confirmed that a number of the institution's original policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> needed in-depth revisions (e. g. were out of date and needed to be written more clearly and concisely) and suggested the kind of revisions that needed to be made. In addition, they pointed out that the institution lacked policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> on many faculty issues and identified these issues. Finally, they stressed the need to have online policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures.</b> The analysis of the data and findings of the literature review, interviews and focus groups {{led to the development of}} model faculty policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> on a number of issues. These policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> are the outcome of this research project. Following the development of the policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures,</b> their content <b>and</b> structure was found to be satisfactory and acceptable. In addition, it was found that they created a framework based on which, staff members of the institution could take informed actions and decisions. They fostered stability, continuity, uniformity, consistency, simplicity and accountability. They were better organised, clear and more user-friendly. The research project concluded that the policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> developed achieved the institution's strategic objectives and informed the institution's faculty members on the issues for which the policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> were developed. The model policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> helped the institution to operate more efficiently and productively. In addition, they had a positive impact on faculty members' work-related behaviour (greater motivation, lower employee turnover, greater employee commitment, more research accomplishments. greater accountability and development). Additionally, the online policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> proved extremely beneficial due to their timely updating, their ease of access, reduction of printing costs and their ability to respond to the institutions changing needs immediately. The policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> developed led to their increased usage since they could be more easily understood and be accessed easily online. Moreover, they led to the professional development of the staff members and the researcher. Finally, this research report emphasises the importance of developing policies <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> provides a number of recommendations to the institution, higher education institutions, other organisations and the Cyprus Council for Educational Evaluation-Accreditation for utilising this report and for further research and development in this area.  EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
