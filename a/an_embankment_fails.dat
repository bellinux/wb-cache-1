50|$|On 1 April 1997, a Convair CV-580 (registered 9Q-CRU) was {{destroyed}} at Tshikapa Airport when it overshot the runway and hit <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> following <b>a</b> <b>failed</b> take-off abortion. There were fourteen occupants {{on board the}} scheduled flight to Mbuji-Mayi.|$|R
50|$|The would-be assassins {{supposedly}} {{rolled a}} large wooden log onto the tracks {{when it was}} dark and wedged it into place. According to retired Detective Superintendent Cliff McHardy, it was meant to de-rail the train and, if it did, it would have smashed into <b>an</b> <b>embankment.</b> It <b>failed</b> because, at the time, the train was travelling unusually slowly when it struck the blockage, though it still slid for 700 metres before coming to a stop.|$|R
50|$|The Zeyzoun Dam is <b>a</b> <b>failed</b> <b>embankment</b> dam in Hama Governorate, Syria. It impounded water pumped {{from the}} nearby Orontes River. The dam was {{completed}} in 1996 and its primary purpose was the irrigation of about 14000 ha. The dam's reservoir was filled {{in the winter and}} expended its water during the summer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory model tests and corresponding numerical analyses carried out on a model slope representing <b>an</b> actual <b>embankment,</b> which <b>failed</b> on several occasions after overnight heavy rainfall. A study is performed by reinforcing the slope with thin jute strips of 1 mm diameter. The numerical simulation of the model tests is performed by a commercial program called FLAC. The responses of the model slope with the jute strips are observed under different intensities and duration of rainfall. Significant improvement in the deformation and the factor of safety of the slope is observed both in the numerical analyses and the laboratory experiments when jute strips are utilized as a slope protection measure. The study indicates that the stability of the embankment can be improved significantly at a low cost by reinforcing it with jute strips...|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} a threat due to the {{tailings}} dam. An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s <b>embankment</b> <b>failed.</b> The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the <b>embankment</b> <b>failed,</b> investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report {{out of the public}} eye.|$|R
500|$|Three {{locations}} between Spitak and Nalband (to the west) {{that were}} within several kilometers of the fault were examined for ground disturbances and each site was scrutinized {{for the effects}} of liquefaction. The first site was on the highway that linked the three most damaged cities and was adjacent to a tributary of the Pambak river where the water table was close to the surface. The highway's <b>embankment</b> <b>failed,</b> and though the site was repaired immediately, the resulting damage to the highway caused considerable delay in getting people and supplies {{into and out of the}} area following the disaster. Numerous sand boils were seen in the region northwest of Spitak including within [...] of the <b>failed</b> <b>embankment.</b> <b>A</b> second site that was close to the fault, also near the Pambak river and with similar soil deposits, did not experience liquefaction, though it would have experienced the same high peak ground accelerations as the <b>failed</b> highway <b>embankment.</b>|$|R

The breach was blamed on rats and foxes digging holes in the embankments causing water seepage and the <b>embankment</b> <b>failed.</b> The other reason for the failure was given {{that because of the}} bad road conditions, the boulders could not be brought to the site.|$|R

50|$|A recent {{fact finding}} {{report for the}} Kosi floods of 2008, {{prepared}} by a civil society organization by various experts like Dr. Sudhir Sharma, Dr. Dinesh Kumar Mishra, and Dr Gopal Krishna, highlighted that although India has built over 3000 km of embankments in Bihar {{over the last few}} decades, the flooding propensity has increased by 2.5 times during the same time period, not to mention that <b>embankments</b> <b>failed</b> during each major flooding event.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 August 2008 {{one of the}} {{man-made}} <b>embankments</b> <b>failed.</b> The river reverted {{from the}} prescribed western channel to an old channel near the centre of its alluvial fan. The river spread out widely and flooded towns, villages, and cultivated fields on the densely populated alluvial fan. Recurrent flooding on the lower Kosi contributes largely to India's history of suffering more flood deaths {{than any other country}} except Bangladesh, and has earned the Kosi the epithet [...] "The Sorrow of Bihar".|$|R
