Methodologically, it was a documentary research (Systematic Literature Review), with a qualitative and quantitative approach (content analysis and bibliometric techniques), which enabled the triangulation and complementarity. As a result of the research could be mentioned the construction of six interpretive categories that emerged from the data itself: <b>information</b> <b>as</b> a right, <b>information</b> <b>as</b> an ontological concept, <b>information</b> <b>as</b> a dispositive of power, <b>information</b> <b>as</b> a semiotic concept, <b>information</b> <b>as</b> a set of organized data, and <b>information</b> <b>as</b> documentary record...|$|R

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote <b>as</b> <b>information</b> is often questioned.|$|E

5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing.

There are other possible advantages: colonies may act <b>as</b> <b>information</b> centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
