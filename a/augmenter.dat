25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation <b>augmenter,</b> a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E

But why were this great king's good deeds towards the Pope and the Catholic faith rewarded, by what we can only call detestable intrigue and treachery? ...|$|E
60|$|Female pigeons {{occasionally}} feel {{a strong}} antipathy towards certain males, without any assignable cause. Thus MM. Boitard and Corbié, whose experience extended over forty-five years, state: “Quand une femelle éprouve de l’antipathie pour un mâle avec lequel on veut l’accoupler, malgré tous les feux de l’amour, malgré l’alpiste et le chènevis dont on la nourrit pour <b>augmenter</b> son ardeur, malgré un emprisonnement de six mois et même d’un an, elle refuse constamment ses caresses; les avances empressées, les agaceries, les tournoiemens, les tendres roucoulemens, rien ne peut lui plaire ni l’émouvoir; gonflée, boudeuse, blottie dans un coin de sa prison, elle n’en sort que pour boire et manger, ou pour repousser avec une espèce de rage des caresses devenues trop pressantes.”[169] On the other hand, Mr. Harrison Weir has himself observed, and has heard from, several breeders, that a female pigeon will occasionally take a strong fancy {{for a particular}} male, and will desert her own mate for him. Some females, according to another experienced observer, Riedel,[170] are of a profligate disposition, and prefer almost any stranger to their own mate. Some amorous males, called by our English fanciers “gay birds,” are so successful in their gallantries, that, as Mr. H.

40|$|According to reducer/augmenter theory, <b>augmenters</b> {{are assumed}} to react to sensory stimuli with {{enhanced}} responsiveness, whereas reducers respond to the same stimuli with dampened responsiveness. Due to their generally understimulated condition, reducers are motivated to seek out stronger or more intense forms of sensory stimulation. When emotion {{is viewed as a}} source of stimulation, it becomes plausible to hypothesize that reducers and <b>augmenters</b> may differentially utilize their emotions to modulate stimulation level. Results from Study 1 show that, after a period of boredom, reducers chose more frequently than <b>augmenters</b> to participate in an arousing, emotion-induction experiment, even though they believed the experience would involve the induction of negative affect. Reducers also found the initial boredom-induction task to be significantly more boring and less interesting than the <b>augmenters.</b> Study 2 found that reducers were more likely than <b>augmenters</b> to engage in activities that have a higher probability of evoking emotion in their natural, ongoing lives. Reducers also exhibited episodes of stronger affect and more frequently novelty- and sensation-seeking in their ongoing natural lives than <b>augmenters.</b> Implications of these results for reducer/augmenter theory and for understanding the role of emotion in arousal regulation are discussed, and directions for future research are proposed...|$|R

50|$|Another {{feature of}} pulsejet engines {{is that their}} thrust can be {{increased}} by a specially shaped duct placed behind the engine.

40|$|Starting {{off from}} {{the notion that the}} {{cerebral}} hemispheres differ in their processing mode, this paper reports on stimulus intensity modulation of auditory evoked potentials recorded from hemispheric leads (C 3 and C 4 referenced to ipsilateral mastoid processes) in a sample of 40 male Ss between 18 to 40 years of age. The experimental set up involved the recording of series of 100 trials to binaural clicks of 63. 5, 74. 6 and 85 dB AL. Ss who were <b>augmenters</b> at the vertex showed positive Amplitude-Intensity function slopes over the left hemisphere; when Ss were Reducers at the vertex, the slopes were negative on the right hemisphere. These results are interpreted in terms of attention deployment or allocation to one or the other hemispheric processing mode.

Initially, non-dimensionalization of the jet ejector as a gas compressor was performed with respect to scale, fluid, and operating pressure. Surprisingly, rather than the conventional parameters like Mach or Re number, the results showed a completely new parameter (christenedGM- Gauge Mach) that when kept constant will result in non-dimensionalization. Non-dimensionalization of a jet ejector for watercraft propulsion was conducted using 2 D axis symmetric, steady-state flow modeling using the ??kmethod (including wall functions).

40|$|In lean {{premixed}} combustors of {{gas turbine}} engines, fuel-air mixing is considered vital for controlling pollutant emissions {{as well as}} combustion instability. Enhancement in mixing may be obtained by modulating the fuel flow rate. Modulation of fuel flow is also a useful technique to actively control combustion instabilities arising from the pressure oscillations in the combustor and thrust <b>augmenters.</b> Effectiveness of the forced oscillations depends {{on the level of}} dispersion present in the system. Knowledge of dispersion levels is also important in determining the degree of mixing and therefore, the effectiveness of a premixer. This paper presents the experimental efforts undertaken to study the spatial and temporal dispersion of fuel flow rate oscillation introduced at the premixer inlet. Effects of oscillation amplitude and frequency are investigated at different bulk flow rates and at various locations in the premixer. Also presented is a review of the in-house numerical work done towards this end, using three computational methods.

40|$|Abstract Background Plants {{containing}} compounds {{such as the}} isoflavonoids, {{with female}} hormone-like effects that bind to human estrogen receptors, are known. But none has been previously shown to have corresponding male hormone-like effects that interact with the human androgen receptor. Here, we report that the tree bark (cortex) of the Gutta-Percha tree Eucommia ulmoides possesses bimodal phytoandrogenic and hormone potentiating effects by lipidic components. Methods The extracts of E. ulmoides were tested using in-vitro reporter gene bioassays and in-vivo animal studies. Key compounds responsible for the steroidogenic effects were isolated and identified using solid phase extraction (SPE), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), electron spray ionisation-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Results The following bioactivities of E. ulmoides were found: (1) a phenomenal tripartite synergism exists between the sex steroid receptors (androgen and estrogen receptors), their cognate steroidal ligands and lipidic <b>augmenters</b> isolated from E. ulmoides, (2) phytoandrogenic activity of E. ulmoides was mediated by plant triterpenoids binding cognately to the androgen receptor (AR) ligand binding domain. Conclusion In addition to well-known phytoestrogens, the existence of phytoandrogens is reported in this study. Furthermore, a form of tripartite synergism between sex steroid receptors, sex hormones and plant-derived lipids is described for the first time. This could have contrasting clinical applications for hypogonadal- and hyperlipidaemic-related disorders. </p...|$|R
40|$|Augmenting/reducing of the evoked {{potential}} {{has been shown}} to be related to sensation seeking (SS) and specific clinical disorders. Buchsbaum demonstrated that patients with bipolar affective disorders (BAD) tend to be <b>augmenters,</b> as is the case with sensation seekers, and patients with unipolar affective disorders (UPD) tend to be reducers. In addition, he reported that prophylactic medication reduced the tendency to augment in bipolar patients. However, evidence for these relations is restricted to a few studies. This study explores whether Buchsbaum’s initial findings can be found in a naturalistic clinical setting. Acoustic {{evoked potential}}s were recorded for six levels of intensity (59, 71, 79, 88, 92, 96 dB SPL) from 24 healthy adults, 21 unipolar depressed patients, and 21 patients with BAD. Participants also completed personality questionnaires, especially the Sensation Seeking Scales Form V. Results revealed a positive correlation between SS and augmenting/reducing in healthy controls, thereby replicating earlier findings. Bipolar depressed patients showed larger P 1 /N 1 slopes than healthy controls, when medication was statistically controlled. Unipolar depressed patients showed smaller P 2 slopes, but only when medication was not controlled. Implications of these results for further research on augmenting/reducing and affective disorders and their relationship to SS are discussed.
