5|$|Bosman and Kolben's {{descriptions}} went largely unnoticed until 1771, {{when the}} Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, {{as well as}} his personal experience with a captive specimen, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> consistently differentiating the spotted hyena from the striped. The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> {{his theory}} of game strategies, which is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states {{that it is possible to}} solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E

For instance, Tokushi Kasahara claims that Nanking's population in 1937 included 400,000 to 500,000 civilians and 150,000 soldiers, whereas David Askew believes it was 200,000 to 250,000 civilians and 73,790 to 81,500 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a screenplay, written {{as early as}} 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent}} that Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E

In this case, public interest was distinguished <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> legislation.|$|E
