5|$|Investigators {{immediately}} began to question Sharon Kinne, James Boldizs, and Walter Jones. All three were questioned on May 28. Jones and Boldizs both gave written statements admitting to have been dating Sharon Kinne and both agreed to lie detector tests; Kinne gave an oral statement to police but declined to sign a written one or take <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test.</b> Kinne was questioned again {{on the morning of}} May 30, and Boldizs on May 31. The scheduled polygraphs for the two men were performed on June 1, and both men were deemed to have been truthful in their statements. Kinne's brother Eugene was also questioned on May 31, but declined to answer questions.|$|E

The test that Bruno and Buffalmacco submit Calandrino to was really <b>a</b> medieval <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> and the tale is consistent with {{what we know about the}} characters of the three painters.|$|R
50|$|At the Byrnes' home, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro), mother Dina (Blythe Danner) {{and their}} beloved cat Mr. Jinx. Jack takes an instant dislike to Greg and openly criticizes {{him for his}} choice of career as a male nurse and {{whatever}} else he sees as a difference between Greg and the Byrnes family. Greg tries to impress Jack, but his efforts fail. Greg becomes even more uncomfortable after he receives <b>an</b> impromptu <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> from Jack and later learns from Pam that her father is a retired CIA counterintelligence officer.|$|R
25|$|On November 3, 1998, around 5:00pm, Maddie Clifton disappeared. The first suspect {{named in}} the case was {{neighbor}} Larry Grisham. Grisham had been arrested twice in the past, both times between 15 and 20 years earlier, in sexual battery cases, but in both incidents, charges were dropped. Grisham failed <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> in relation to Maddie's disappearance, but provided an alibi.|$|E
25|$|Although Shockley {{was never}} {{diagnosed}} by psychiatrists, historians characterized Shockley's {{state of mind}} in 1956–1957 as paranoia or autism. All phone calls were recorded, and the staff {{was not allowed to}} share their results with each other, which was not feasible since they all worked in a small building. Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking. At some point he sent the entire lab for <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test,</b> though everyone refused.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{at first}} focused on Emile and Roldan, since {{both of them}} {{might have had a}} motive to harm Bethany due to the love {{triangle}} they were involved in. With the help of the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), they were able to reach Emile at his remote post in Afghanistan and talk to him on the phone. Later they were able to have him return to the U.S., where he spoke with police at length and took <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
50|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials collected evidence from Bryant {{and he agreed}} to submit to a rape test kit and <b>a</b> voluntary <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test.</b> On July 4, Sheriff Joe Hoy issued an arrest warrant for Bryant. Bryant flew from Los Angeles back to Eagle, Colorado to surrender to police. He was immediately released on $25,000 bond, and news of the arrest became public two days after that. On July 18, the Eagle County District Attorney's office filed a formal charge against Bryant for sexual assault. If convicted, Bryant faced probation to life in prison.|$|R

When Edgerly's attorney was incapacitated by a heart attack, Bailey took over the defense. Edgerly—whose story was one of several that served {{as the basis for the}} television series and film The Fugitive—was acquitted.|$|R

A {{lot of men}} — {{especially}} around our age — were so stunned when he lost that they figured he must have tanked. Budge is convinced of that. But what motive would Riggs have for that? Bobby Riggs, the biggest ham in the world, gets his greatest audience — and purposefully looks bad? There's no way. If he had beaten Billie Jean, he could have kept the act going indefinitely.

25|$|The cadaver dogs {{searched the}} woods around Vortex Spring without success. Assisted by helicopters, they searched the swamps along the spring's outflow into Blue Creek and Sandy Creek to the Choctawhatchee River. Thirty {{separate}} {{tests of the}} water {{over the next several}} months showed no sign of an increase in the bacteria that would indicate the presence of a decomposing human body. Taran, who said he had let Ben into the cave despite knowing he lacked certification to dive in it, passed <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> of his account.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} further about this, Biryukova {{took her}} Fifth Amendment rights {{and refused to}} take <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test.</b> Biryukova did, however, give investigators permission to search the car, her computer and her home. There {{was no sign of}} Sky at or near the latter location. Her car was unlocked and did not show any signs of forced entry. Police searched Solomon's house, too, and found nothing. After a lie-detector test he took the night after the disappearance proved inconclusive, Solomon took another one the next day, although neither he, his attorney, nor the police shared the results with the public.|$|E
25|$|Although the McDaniels {{continue}} to believe Ben's body is {{in an area of}} the cave beyond the reach of current search capabilities, they have also entertained the possibility that his death was not an accident but the result of foul play. A private investigator they hired believes that his body may have been removed before any authorities were contacted, or that he may even have been murdered on land and the narrative of his disappearance fabricated as a cover story. The family believes that the suspicious, supposedly accidental, death of Vortex Spring's owner late in 2011 is related to the case. They have also criticized the local police investigation as inadequate, particularly <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> passed by the employee who was the last person known to have seen Ben alive.|$|E
500|$|At the Byrnes' home, Greg meets Pam's {{overbearing}} father Jack, mother Dina {{and their}} cat, Jinxy, a seal-point peke-faced Himalayan with an all-black tail. Jack takes an instant dislike to Greg and openly criticizes {{him for his}} choice of career as a male nurse and whatever else he sees as a difference between Greg and the Byrnes family. Greg tries to impress Jack, but his efforts fail after he recites the lyrics to [...] "Day by Day" [...] from [...] "Godspell" [...] when asked to say grace at dinner (as he is Jewish), making up a story of milking a cat, finding out Pam was engaged and (while popping the cork of a bottle of champagne) accidentally breaking an urn holding the remains of Jack's mother which Jinx then urinates in. Greg becomes even more uncomfortable after he receives <b>an</b> impromptu <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> from Jack and later learns from Pam that her father is a retired CIA counterintelligence officer.|$|R
5000|$|In November, 2010, the Sanford Police Department {{moved to}} a new $20 million, 76,000-square-foot Public Safety Complex, which it shares with the Sanford Fire Department and a five-bay fire station. Built to {{withstand}} 150 mph hurricane winds, the two-story complex also houses Sanford's emergency operations center. [...] The police and fire departments have separate and much larger facilities with a shared atrium, and there is a public meeting room. The police department also has a room specifically to conduct voice stress analysis, <b>a</b> type of <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test,</b> and the fire department's communication system is integrated with a new dispatching system in Seminole County.

Renee starts telling Haley about her and Nathan having sex and Haley hits Renee, making her fall to the ground. Renee decides to press charges on Haley for {{slapping}} her and Haley is arrested, spending {{a few hours in}} jail before Renee decides to drop the charges. Renee visits her while she's in jail and continues to tell Haley that Nathan is the father. Renee writes her phone number down and tells Haley to look at Nathan's old cell phone bills to prove that they knew each other. After she gets out, she fights with Nathan after she slowly starts realizing Renee's accusations may be true. He holds a press conference to take the claims head-on and he thinks Haley won't show after their fight, but she does come to support her husband, though she is seen {{at the end of the}} episode looking at the old phone bills, and she finds Renee's number on them. She confronts Nathan, and he tells her girls get hold of his phone number all the time and it was nothing. They are angry with each other, especially after Haley decides to pay off Renee after Nathan loses his endorsement deals. Renee has decided to demand $250,000, and Haley decides not to pay her off. Haley and Nathan later reconcile, and Nathan encourages her that she made the right choice. Renee then agrees to come onto Dan's television show to reveal her pregnancy to the world. In a surprising turn of events, Dan submits Renee to <b>a</b> surprise <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test,</b> and all of the answers she gives come across true, which appears to shock her. He goads her into revealing that she did have sex the night of the party and got knocked up, but not by Nathan.|$|R
500|$|To Bamber's supporters, who {{over the}} years have {{included}} MPs and journalists, he is a victim of one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice. The Guardian took up his case at one point. One or more Guardian journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing him as [...] "clever and strategic", they wrote that there was something about him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference.... Like Meursault in the Camus novel L'Etranger, he did not seem to display the appropriate emotions." [...] He is reported to have passed <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> in 2007.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, the Bruins offered Orr US$600,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) per season, but {{he would}} have to pass a {{physical}} examination at the start of each season's training camp. Only the first year's money was guaranteed. Eagleson was quoted at the time as saying, [...] "There is only one way that Bobby Orr will ever be back with the Bruins. And that's if Jeremy Jacobs asks him for another meeting and straightens out the whole situation. Otherwise he's gone." [...] Instead, Orr became a free agent, with Boston to receive compensation. Orr and Eagleson whittled down a list of potential teams to St. Louis and Chicago. Chicago offered a five-year guaranteed contract with the Black Hawks, and on June 8, 1976, he officially signed with the Black Hawks. The Bruins' general manager, Harry Sinden complained of tampering by the Black Hawks, and demanded that Chicago owner Bill Wirtz submit to <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test.</b> According to documents held by Orr, they had a valid case. Orr signed with the Black Hawks at a secret meeting in May 1976, prior to becoming a free agent.|$|E

Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were [...] "in denial". On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word [...] "incest" [...] could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the [...] "darkest time" [...] in her life. She told Oprah, [...] "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to {{deal with the fact that}} I had some mental illness... I totally lost touch with reality... (and) I didn’t know what the truth was... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family". She added that not everything was [...] "made up", saying, [...] "Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification". Geraldine said they did not speak for 12 years, but had recently reconciled.|$|E

500|$|Hartford, Connecticut gangster Robert [...] "Bobby the Cook" [...] Gentile {{has been}} {{suggested}} on multiple occasions as knowing {{the location of the}} Gardner works. In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in Manchester, Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor {{with the help of his}} son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the black market. In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art. [...] In 2015, Gentile submitted to <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test,</b> denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful. According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works. Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago. On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.|$|E

Later, Elaine triumphantly announces to Jerry that Robert has defected from his team and that the conversion went perfectly ("Sex and shopping"). Afterwards, Kramer is still doing police lineups. Jerry takes the <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test,</b> but quickly cracks under the pressure of clever questions regarding controversial plot developments in Melrose Place, which provoke him to vent his strongly held opinions on those controversies, thereby exposing his familiarity with the series and presumably ending his relationship with Sgt.

2500|$|Paul Kemp, Ivins' attorney, {{stated that}} the government's case against Ivins was [...] "not convincing". Department of Justice {{official}} Dean Boyd stated that Ivins mailed anthrax to NBC in retaliation for an investigation of Ivins' laboratory's work on anthrax conducted by Gary Matsumoto, a former NBC news journalist. [...] At the time, however, Matsumoto was working for ABC, not NBC. Also, Ivins passed <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> {{in which he was}} questioned about his possible participation in the anthrax attacks. [...] Boyd responded by saying that the FBI now believes that Ivins used countermeasures to deceive the polygraph examiners. [...] "There are clearly a lot of unanswered questions," [...] said Senator Chuck Grassley, who called for a congressional investigation into the allegations that Ivins was the anthrax killer.|$|E
2500|$|With Season six, Andy Ackerman {{replaced}} Tom Cherones {{as director}} of the show. The series remained well-regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as [...] "The Beard" [...] in which Jerry is put through <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> to make him admit that he watched Melrose Place, [...] "The Switch" [...] in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo, and [...] "The Understudy" [...] in which Elaine meets J.

This was the first season win which Seinfeld reached No. 1 in the Nielsen Ratings. The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined with the end stand-up segment no longer appearing, as the storylines for all four characters grew denser.|$|E
