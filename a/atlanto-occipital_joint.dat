The jaw {{mechanics of the}} plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known, {{and is one of}} the most highly adapted. Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50° above horizontal through the flexing of the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint</b> between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck. As the skull is raised, the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward. Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls, but they are not as well adapted for such movement. D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls. He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus, a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax, was able to make the same movement. Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959, suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way. At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles, but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle. Plagiosuchus, a close relative of Gerrothorax, also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to. Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull, suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth.|$|E

30|$|Although {{believed}} to play very little part in {{stability of the}} atlantooccipital articulation, the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane {{is important because it}} is highly visible on MRI assessment and also exhibits some specific anatomical features which may be misinterpreted on imaging as traumatic disruption. This broad ligament attaches the posterior arch of the atlas to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum and is continuous with the posterior atlantoaxial membrane and, subsequently, the ligamentum flavum [14, 19, 25] (Fig.  1). Laterally, it may extend over the capsules of the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joints.</b> Posteriorly, it is related to the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle and, anteriorly, to the dura mater. Interdigitations with both the dura mater and the related rectus capitis posterior minor muscle parenchyma may be present in this ligament; additionally, a connective tissue bridge (exhibiting increased vascularity) joining the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle to the spinal dura is frequently present, particularly in the midline [14, 26 – 28]. This myoligamentous complex (comprising the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane, interspinous ligament, ligamentum nuchae, rectus posterior major and minor muscles and obliquus capitis supripr and inferior muscles) adds further stability to the craniocervical junction [29]. An important consideration in trauma of this component of the craniocervical junction is the vertebral artery which pierces the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane and then the dura mater before entering the posterior fossa.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} biomechanical {{properties}} of a ventral transarticular lag screw fixation technique, a new dorsal atlantoaxial instability (AAI) clamp, {{and a new}} ventral AAI hook plate under sagittal shear loading after transection of the ligaments of the atlantoaxial joint. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric biomechanical study. ANIMALS: Canine cadavers (n[*]=[*] 10). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The occipitoatlantoaxial region of Beagles euthanatized for reasons unrelated to the study was prepared leaving only ligamentous structures and the joint capsules between the first 2 cervical vertebrae (C 1 and C 2). The <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joints</b> were stabilized with 2 transarticular diverging positive threaded K-wires. The occipital bone and the caudal end of C 2 were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate and loaded in shear to a force of 50 Newtons. The range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ) of the atlantoaxial joint were determined after 3 loading cycles with atlantoaxial ligaments intact, after ligament transection, and after fixation with each implant. The testing order of implants was randomly assigned. The implants tested last were subjected to failure testing. RESULTS: All stabilization procedures decreased the ROM and NZ of the atlantoaxial joint compared to transected ligament specimens. Only stabilization with transarticular lag screws and ventral plates produced a significant reduction of ROM compare to intact specimens. CONCLUSION: Fixation with transarticular lag screws and a ventral hook plate was biomechanically similar and provided more rigidity compared to dorsal clamp fixation. Further load cycling to failure tests and clinical studies are required before making clinical recommendations...|$|R
50|$|There {{are seven}} {{cervical}} vertebrae (but eight cervical spinal nerves), designated C1 through C7. These bones are, in general, small and delicate. Their spinous processes are short (with {{the exception of}} C2 and C7, which have palpable spinous processes). C1 is also called the atlas, and C2 is also called the axis. The structure of these vertebrae {{is the reason why}} the neck and head have a large range of motion.

40|$|Purpose: The {{morphology}} of the alar ligaments {{has been}} inconsistently described, {{particularly with regard}} to the existence of an atlantal portion. Despite these inconsistencies, these descriptions have been used to develop physical tests for the integrity of these ligaments in patients with cervical spine problems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the detailed macrostructure of the alar ligaments. Methods: The alar ligaments of 11 cervical spine specimens from embalmed adult cadavers were examined by fine dissection. A detailed description of the macrostructure of these ligaments and their attachment sites was recorded. Measurements were performed with respect to ligament dimensions and relations with selected bony landmarks. Results: No atlantal portion of the alar ligament was viewed in any specimen. The attachment of the ligaments on the odontoid process occurred on its lateral and posterolateral aspects, frequently below the level of the apex. The occipital attachment was on the medial surface of the occipital condyles in close proximity to the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joints.</b> The orientation of the ligaments was primarily horizontal. The presence of transverse bands extending occiput to occiput with minimal or no attachment to the odontoid process was a common variant. Conclusions: The absence of findings with respect to the atlantal portion of the alar ligament suggests that it may be considered an anatomical variant, not an essential component for stability of the craniocervical complex. These findings may inform the use and interpretation of clinical tests for alar ligament integrity...|$|R

Moreover ease of intubation with Truview evo 2 in terms of absolute time requirement was also aimed at. Patients for elective surgery requiring endotracheal intubation were initially assessed for three PDI parameters - modified Mallampati test, thyro-mental distance& <b>Atlanto-occipital</b> (AO) <b>joint</b> extension. Patients with cumulative PDI scores of 2 to 5 (in a scale of 0 to 8) were evaluated for Cormack& Lehane (CL) grading by Macintosh blade after standard induction. Cases with CL grade of two or more were further evaluated by Truview evo 2 laryngoscope and corresponding CL grades were assigned. Intubation attempted under Truview evo 2 vision and time required for each successful tracheal intubation (i. e. tracheal intubation completed within one minute) was noted. Total fifty cases were studied. The CL grades assigned by Macintosh blade correlated well with the cumulative PDI scores assigned preoperatively, confirming there predictability. Truview evo 2 improved laryngeal view in 92 % cases by one or more CL grade. Intubation with Truview evo 2 was possible in 88 % cases within stipulated time of one minute and mean time of 28. 6 seconds with SD of 11. 23 was reasonably quick. No significant complication like oro- pharyngeal trauma or extreme pressor response to laryngoscopy was noticed.

40|$|Study Design: Atlas {{fractures}} {{are evaluated}} {{according to the}} fracture type and ligamentous injury. External immobilization may result in fracture nonunion. Objective: The ideal treatment method for non-stabilized atlas fractures is limited fixation without restricting the range of motion of the atlantoaxial and atlantooccipital joints. Summary of Background Data: Such a result can be established by using either anterior fixation or posterior lateral mass fixation. However, none of these techniques can fully address anterior 1 / 2 atlas fractures such as in this case. Materials and Methods: A transoral technique in which bilateral screws were placed intralaminarly and connected with wire was used to reduce and stabilize an anterior 1 / 2 fracture of C 1. Result: Radiological studies after the surgery showed good cervical alignment, no screw or wire failure and good reduction with fusion of anterior arcus of C 1. Conclusions: Internal immobilization by this screw and wire osteosynthesis technique protects the mobility of the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> and atlantoaxial <b>joints.</b> The main advantage is that neither the twisted wires inserted under the anterior lamina, nor the laterally placed screw heads interfere with midline wound closure; unlike the plate/cage and rod systems used together with anterior screws. A computer navigation system with intraoperative 3 D imaging facilities will be of benefit for safe placement of the screw, however we preferred a free-hand technique, {{as the starting point}} was at the fracture line along the trajectory of the routinely accessible anterior lamina...|$|R

40|$|The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and tissue fragility. This communication briefly reports upon the neurological manifestations that arise including {{the weakness of}} the ligaments of the craniocervical junction and spine, early disc degeneration, and {{the weakness of the}} epineurium and perineurium surrounding peripheral nerves. Entrapment, deformation, and biophysical deformative stresses exerted upon the nervous system may alter gene expression, neuronal function and phenotypic expression. This report also discusses increased prevalence of migraine, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Tarlov cysts, tethered cord syndrome, and dystonia, where associations with EDS have been anecdotally reported, but where epidemiological evidence is not yet available. Chiari Malformation Type I (CMI) has been reported to be a comorbid condition to EDS, and may be complicated by craniocervical instability or basilar invagination. Motor delay, headache, and quadriparesis have been attributed to ligamentous laxity and instability at the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> and atlantoaxial <b>joints,</b> which may complicate all forms of EDS. Discopathy and early degenerative spondylotic disease manifest by spinal segmental instability and kyphosis, rendering EDS patients prone to mechanical pain, and myelopathy. Musculoskeletal pain starts early, is chronic and debilitating, and the neuromuscular disease of EDS manifests symptomatically with weakness, myalgia, easy fatigability, limited walking, reduction of vibration sense, and mild impairment of mobility and daily activities. Consensus criteria and clinical practice guidelines, based upon stronger epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence, are needed to refine diagnosis and treatment of the various neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} of the cervical region of the vertebral column at eight post-ovulatory weeks is the first such study based on precise reconstructions of staged embryos. At {{the end of the}} embryonic period proper, a typical vertebra is a U-shaped piece of cartilage characterized by spina bifida occulta. The notochord ascends through the centra and leaves the dens to enter the basal plate of the skull. The median column of the axis comprises three parts (designated X, Y, Z) which persist well into the fetal period. They are related to the first, second and third cervical nerves, respectively. Part X may project into the foramen magnum and form an occipito-axial joint. Part Z appears to be the centrum of the axis. The articular columns of the cervical vertebrae are twofold, as in the adult: an anterior (atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial) and a posterior (from the lower aspect of the axis downwards). Alar and transverse ligaments are present. Cavitation is not found in the embryonic period in either the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> or zygapophysial <b>joints,</b> and is generally not present in the median atlanto-axial joint either. Most of the transverse processes exhibit anterior and posterior tubercles. An 'intertubercular lamella' {{may or may not be}} present, i. e. the foramina transversaria are being formed around the vertebral artery. The spinal ganglia are generally partly in the vertebral canal and partly on the neural arches, medial to the articular processes. During the fetal period, the articular processes shift to a coronal position and this alteration appears to be associated with a corresponding change in the location of the spinal ganglia...|$|R
40|$|Background: Majority of C 1 {{fractures}} can {{be effectively}} treated conservatively by immobilization or traction {{unless there is}} an injury to the transverse ligament. Conservative treatment usually involves {{a long period of}} immobilization in a halo-vest. Surgical intervention generally involves fusion, eliminating the motion of the upper cervical spine. We describe the treatment of unstable Jefferson fractures designed to avoid these problems of both conservative and invasive methods. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 12 patients with unstable Jefferson fractures treated with transoral osteosynthesis of C 1 between July 2008 and December 2011 was performed. A steel plate and C 1 lateral mass screw fixation were used to repair the unstable Jefferson fractures. Our study group included eight males and four females with an average age of 33 years (range 23 - 62 years). Results: Patients were followed up for an average of 16 months after surgery. Range of motion of the cervical spine was by and large physiologic: Average flexion 35 ° (range 28 - 40 °), average extension 42 ° (range 30 - 48 °). Lateral bending to the right and left averaged 30 ° and 28 ° respectively (range 12 - 36 ° and 14 - 32 ° respectively). The average postoperative rotation of the atlantoaxial joint, evaluated by functional computed tomography scan was 60 ° (range 35 - 72 °). Total average lateral displacement of the lateral masses was 7. 0 mm before surgery (range 5 - 12 mm), which improved to 3. 5 mm after surgery (range 1 - 6. 5 mm). The total average difference of the atlanto-dens interval in flexion and extension after surgery was 1. 0 mm (range 1 - 3 mm). Conclusions: Transoral osteosynthesis of the anterior ring using C 1 lateral mass screws is a viable option for treating unstable Jefferson fractures, which allows maintenance of rotation at the C 1 -C 2 joint and restoration of congruency of the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> and atlantoaxial <b>joints...</b>|$|R

The patients were then randomly divided into a treatment/adjustment group and a control group. Each group consisted of fifty patients. Both groups were then further divided into athletes without pain, athletes with pain, nonathletes without pain and non-athletes with pain. A full cervical spine regional examination was performed on each patient to isolate <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint</b> dysfunction and to rule out any contra-indications to treatment. The quadriceps muscle strength was measured three times at one-minute intervals in both groups. The treatment/adjustment group was then treated with a single chiropractic adjustment, specifically the superior condyle technique, to the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint</b> and the control group rested for one-minute. Three quadriceps muscle strength readings were taken again in both groups. Each patient was treated once. The results from the two groups were then statistically analysed.

The condylar fossa forming the external occipital surface of the jugular tubercle is located supero-posterior to the occipital condyle. The fossa is limited laterally by the sigmoid sulcus and the jugular foramen. The posterior condylar canal communicating anteriorly with the distal end of the sigmoid sulcus, the jugular foramen, or the hypoglossal canal opens {{at the bottom of the}} fossa. The condyle is situated inferior to the posterior condylar and hypoglossal canals, and the jugular tubercle is located superior to them. In the transcondylar fossa approach the posterior part of the jugular tubercle is extradurally removed, but the condyle and the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint</b> are untouched. On the other band, in the transcondylar approach the medial parts of the condyle and the lateral mass of Cl are removed. The latter approach offers better visualization of the inferior part of the foramen magnum. The essential difference of the two approaches is in the direction of looking and the extent of resection of the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint.</b> Both approaches offer excellent view of the ventral dural space in the lower clivus and the foramen magnum, but the level of exposure differs somewhat between them. In the lateral {{approaches to}} the foramen magnum, the condylar fossa, the posterior condylar canal, and the posterior condylar emissary vein all play an important role as intraoperative anatomical landmarks...|$|E

A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} at the Chiropractic Clinic at the University of Johannesburg in Doornfontein {{on the effects}} of chiropractic spinal therapy and the autonomic nervous system with specific reference to the eye and the effects on the visual fields. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the immediate effects of chiropractic adjustments on the visual fields in comparison to a placebo group in individuals with asymptomatic cervical facet joint dysfunction at the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint</b> complex. This was achieved through the examination of peripheral visual field testing using the Humphrey Field II 740 analyser. The sample size and selection of subjects were recruited at the University of Johannesburg clinic in Doornfontein and conducted over a period of four months. These patients were recruited by the use of advertisements placed in the Chiropractic Day Clinic on the Doornfontein Campus and by word of mouth. Any patient volunteering for the study had to meet the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria required the patients to present with asymptomatic cervical facet joint dysfunction at the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint</b> complex. They were also to be between the ages of eighteen and thirty five years of age, have 20 / 20 vision as determined by the Near Snellen Chart and have no contra-indication to the chiropractic adjustment. For all research patients, the same treatment protocol was adhered to Objective data was obtained by the Humphrey II Field Analyzer, model 740, which determined the patients’ visual fields before and after the chiropractic adjustments and placebo treatment was administered. The objective results of this dissertation demonstrated that there was no statistical significance between the male and female groups. However the results collected vii may suggest that there was a minimal increase in responsiveness following placebo the treatment. In conclusion, it was shown that no statistical difference occurred with regards to the immediate effects of the chiropractic adjustment on the visual fields in comparison to the placebo group in individuals with asymptomatic cervical facet joint dysfunction at the <b>atlanto-occipital</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|E
