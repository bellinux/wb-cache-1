5|$|In October 2010 Manchester City Council {{announced}} that it was in discussion with a developer to renovate the building <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> into use. In August 2013 the council received a planning application from the Church Converts (Manchester) to repair the building and convert it into apartments; the application was granted in February 2014. The redevelopment by CZero Developments consists of 73 private apartments in both the chapel and the Sunday school, with the redevelopment due to be completed by Summer 2017.

5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies {{that he must}} be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E

5|$|In May 1942, Gens secured German {{permission}} for {{residents of the}} ghetto to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside the ghetto. The proceeds were to be split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept {{more than half the}} value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property they no longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the ghetto. In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.|$|E

The team designated one member to enter the temple first; that team member carried one of the team's full pendants. The other team member held the remaining pendant, half pendant, or no pendant at all and stood by to enter if the first team member {{was taken out of}} the temple by a temple guard. Before starting, Olmec would explain the rooms in the temple and the necessary tasks in each room. During season 1, Fogg asked who would go first and explained about the temple guards and, if necessary, the extra half pendant. Beginning in season 2, Olmec himself explained these things.|$|E
500|$|The {{value of}} horses {{was known to}} all. In 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, men at the front {{understood}} that [...] "at this stage to lose a horse was worse than losing a man because after all, men were replaceable while horses weren't." [...] For Britain, horses were considered so valuable that if a soldier's horse was killed or died he was required to cut off a hoof <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to his commanding officer {{to prove that the}} two had not simply become separated.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes {{the cargo}} was not there: {{it may have}} been delayed, or lost at sea due to the war. In this case, the Irish captains would load a [...] "cargo of opportunity" [...] <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Ireland. This might be wheat or oranges; on occasions, they even {{purchased}} their own cargo of coal. [...] was fortunate to have a cargo of coal when two unidentified aircraft attacked her with cannon fire. The shells lodged in the coal, rather than piercing her hull. Britain denied involvement, but when the coal was discharged shell fragments of British manufacture were found. The attackers were de Havilland Mosquitos of the Polish squadron of the RAF.|$|E

500|$|While Disney {{executives}} {{had discussed}} closing Feature Animation as redundant, Catmull and Lasseter refused and instead resolved {{to try to}} turn things around at the studio. Lasseter said [...] "we weren't going to let that [...] happen on our watch. We were determined to save the legacy of Walt Disney's amazing studio <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> up to the creative level it had to be. Saving this heritage was squarely on our shoulders." [...] Lasseter and Catmull set about rebuilding the morale of the Feature Animation staff, and rehired a number of its 1980s [...] "new guard" [...] generation of star animators who had left the studio, including Ron Clements, John Musker, Eric Goldberg, Mark Henn, Andreas Deja, Bruce W. Smith, and Chris Buck. To maintain the separation of Feature Animation and Pixar despite their now common ownership and management, Catmull and Lasseter [...] "drew a hard line" [...] that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and {{would not be allowed to}} borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other. Catmull said that he and Lasseter [...] "make sure the studios are quite distinct from each other. We don’t want them to merge; that would definitely be the wrong approach. Each should have its own personality." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Crystal Grab", the {{contestant}}s must fight to collect all the Crystals in the arena. When a contestant is attacked, they will drop any Crystals they've gathered, allowing opponents to steal them. This mode {{can be played}} free-for-all or with teams. In [...] "Capture the Flag", two teams attempt to capture each other's flag <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to their respective flags. Players must race to their opponents' side of the map and drive over their flag to grab it. They must then drive over their own flag's base to score a point from the flag they've captured. A flag that has been stolen can be dropped if the thief is hit with any weapon. Stolen flags that have been dropped can be returned to their respective bases. Due to {{the weight of the}} flags, any kart with a flag will be slowed down. The game ends when time runs out or when one of the teams has gotten enough points. This mode can only be played in teams. [...] "Steal the Bacon" [...] is a variation of [...] "Capture the Flag" [...] in which two teams fight over one flag that is situated {{in the middle of the}} arena. The teams must attempt to take the flag and bring it to their respective base.|$|E

2500|$|Foragers collect {{food that}} {{is around the}} nesting area <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the colony {{to share with the}} other ants. [...] T. sessile has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has {{multiple}} nests. Because of this, T. sessile is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce food transport cost. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'. It was also found that the nest half-life was about 12.9 days.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{recording}} of the Gorillaz album Plastic Beach, Humperdinck was asked by Damon Albarn {{to contribute to the}} album as a guest artist.

Describing the event, Humperdinck stated that the missed opportunity was, [...] "the most grievous sin ever committed", and that he would have gladly collaborated with the Gorillaz. He added that he had since parted ways with his then-management, handing over duties to his son, Scott Dorsey. At the end of the interview, Humperdinck observed: [...] "I'd really like to rekindle that suggestion again <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> Hopefully they will ask me again. My son Scott will definitely say yes".|$|E
2500|$|The Engineering Department also {{established}} an aircraft salvage and repair facility in Building B-1 to salvage, reclaim and repair crashed airplanes retrieved from the front. All aircraft engine installation {{was done by}} this department, however engines salvaged from crashed aircraft were {{turned over to the}} Engine Overhaul Shop. When an aircraft was damaged in combat, or would crash on our side of the front line, a crew would be sent from the 1st Air Depot to dismantle the plane <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to be repaired, if possible. [...] French aircraft were taken to Colombey, while American aircraft were sent to Romorantin.

50|$|Hoffmann’s pikas {{are similar}} in feeding {{behavior}} to other Asian pikas, especially the Alpine pikas. Hoffmann’s pikas collect vegetation by ripping plants {{out of the ground}} with their mouths <b>and</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to their claimed territory. This behavior is known as haying. This practice allows them to save food during periods of sparse vegetation. However, Hoffmann’s pikas can over-harvest, which can cause them to run out of food.|$|R

2500|$|Columbia’s 'career' {{would have}} started to wind down after STS-118.

Following the Columbia accident, NASA flew the STS-125 mission using Atlantis, combining the planned fourth and fifth servicing missions into one final mission to Hubble. Because of the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, the batteries and gyroscopes that keep the telescope pointed will eventually fail {{also because of the}} magnifier screen, which would result in its reentry and break-up in Earth's atmosphere.
