5|$|Also in the off-season, Luongo {{resigned}} {{his team}} captaincy. As Canucks management {{waited until the}} beginning of the 2010–11 season to announce his replacement, Kesler was seen by media <b>and</b> <b>fans</b> as a strong candidate, alongside Henrik Sedin. Henrik was eventually named captain prior to the season-opener and Kesler retained his alternate captaincy.|$|E
40|$|Tetrandrine (TET) <b>and</b> fangchinoline (<b>FAN)</b> are {{two major}} {{components}} of the radix of Stephania tetrandra. The effects of TET <b>and</b> <b>FAN</b> on human platelet aggregation and formation of thromboxane (TX) B 2, a stable metabolite of TXA 2, were examined in the aspect of platelet aggregation. TET <b>and</b> <b>FAN</b> inhibited platelet-activating factor (PAF) -induced human platelet aggregation. IC 50 values for TET <b>and</b> <b>FAN</b> were 28. 6 ± 3. 24 μM and 21. 7 ± 2. 61 μM, respectively. In the PAF-receptor binding assay, neither TET nor FAN showed any inhibitory effects on the specific bindings of PAF to its receptor. TET <b>and</b> <b>FAN</b> also inhibited PAF-, thrombin- and arachidonic acid- induced thromboxane B 2 formation in human washed platelet. These results indicate that TET <b>and</b> <b>FAN</b> inhibit the platelet aggregation by interfering with the intracellular messengers system, but not by inhibiting the binding of PAF to PAF-receptor on the platelet membrane directly, and the suppression of TXA 2 formation by TET <b>and</b> <b>FAN</b> {{may be responsible for}} their inhibitory activities on the platelet aggregation and further on the thrombosis. ope...|$|R

40|$|The {{electric}} energy use in Swedish non-industrial buildings is 71 TWh per {{year out of}} which 30 TWh per year {{is used for the}} operation of technical systems. A significant part of those 30 TWh/year is used for pump <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> operation. The Swedish parliament decided in 2009 on a national energy and climate plan. By the year 2050 the energy use per unit conditioned floor area in the Swedish building stock must be halved compared to the year of 1995. The objective of this thesis is to find means to reduce pump <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> energy in the non-industrial buildings. The aim is to find systems and components that can provide energy reduction in pump <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> systems by 50 %. In the thesis the current situation in non-industrial buildings regarding pump <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> systems has been described and the energy saving potentials, both at component and at system level, have been identified and discussed. Furthermore, the possibility of decentralized pump <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> systems has been examined. The calculated saving potential is 50 % and 40 % respectively for pump <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> operation in non-industrial buildings. This may be achieved by improving pump efficiency <b>and</b> specific <b>fan</b> power to state-of-the-art efficiency and recommended SFP values. System changes can also provide major additional energy savings in pump <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> operation. A decentralized pump heating system has been implemented in real life and results show a reduction of pump energy by 70 %. The theoretical parts of the thesis are supported by four case studies in real buildings and by three laboratory studies...|$|R

Even with a common heat sink <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> attached, typical processor operating temperatures may still reach up to 70 °C (160 °F). A thermosiphon can efficiently transfer heat over a much wider temperature range and can typically maintain the processor temperature 10-20 °C cooler than a traditional heat sink <b>and</b> <b>fan.</b> In some cases, {{it is also possible}} that a thermosiphon may be more compact than an appropriately sized conventional heat sink <b>and</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|R
