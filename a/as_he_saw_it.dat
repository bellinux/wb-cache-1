5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval Office at the time. Given {{the dominance of}} the British Royal Navy and the impossibility, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> of competing with it, Hollmann envisaged a small fleet consisting of torpedo boats and coastal defense ships to be based in German waters. This would be supplemented by a number of cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations instituted {{mandatory}} {{economic sanctions}} against Rhodesia in December 1966. Over the next year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished; the UK government's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR—"no independence before majority rule". Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence, attempting to reconcile the Smith administration's control over {{the country with the}} unconstitutional nature of UDI. Erwin Griswold, the United States Solicitor General, wrote to him that <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post-UDI government as de facto while also claiming to act under the Queen's commission.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} in that emphasized 'What,' which absurdly frightened the figure. As often as {{the person of the}} house worked her way round to it--even <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> was coming--he collapsed in an extra degree.|$|R
5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in about 1790.|$|E
5|$|In August 1995, Ranariddh {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} {{the political and economic}} systems of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> these countries, characterised by hybrid regimes, active economic interventionism and limited press freedom, served as good models to propel Cambodia's socio-economic growth. Ranariddh espoused the view that economic development should take precedence over democratic and human rights. In the initial months of the administration, he actively courted political leaders from various regional countries, including Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, with a view to encouraging investment in Cambodia. In early 1994, Ranariddh established the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) to encourage foreign investment, and served as its chairperson. The Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, supported Ranariddh's plans, and encouraged Malaysian businessmen to invest and assist in developing the tourism, infrastructural development and telecommunications industries.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E
60|$|Malchus {{watched for}} {{the light on the}} {{following}} evening with but faint hope of seeing it, but at about the same hour <b>as</b> before <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> suddenly appear again. Wondering what had brought Nessus before his time, he paddled to the stairs.|$|R
60|$|By some queer {{flash of}} intuition {{it came to}} Benham that even if this was not Prothero, still Prothero did these things. It {{might very well be}} Prothero even, though, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> now <b>saw,</b> <b>it</b> wasn't. Everybody did these things....|$|R

5|$|Until about 1571/1572 Dudley {{supported}} Mary Stuart's succession {{rights to}} the English throne. He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> the Protestant interest. After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil, in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the Duke of Norfolk. In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity. By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with James VI, her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy. She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne, and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, Leicester's Commonwealth, was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.|$|E
5|$|By {{his next}} time in Trondheim, the Gestapo had gained {{knowledge}} of Gjems-Onstad's activities, and did their outermost to capture him. Gjems-Onstad {{went back to}} Trondheim {{at the end of}} October. He was to establish a new radio station, and investigate if Milorg and Lark could be rebuilt, as the organisation had been severely damaged by multiple arrests and murders. Durham was however largely intact. The mission went into a new phase, as the Norwegian resistance started organising defence against potential destructions during the now largely inevitable German withdrawal. A continuation of the scorched earth policy practiced in Northern Norway was particularly feared. Gjems-Onstad and Lark were not to lead the defence, but rather to organise it and train new recruits. In November he authorised the creation of the illegal newspaper For Friheten by his own initiative, the first in Trondheim in years. He also operated the paper DFP, or Deutsche Freiheitspartei, a form of black propaganda distributed to German soldiers and officers. He became increasingly frustrated with the damages caused by Rinnan and his gang of Nazi collaborators, and he vocally advocated their assassination. He reported back to Stockholm in November, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> little remained of Milorg in Trøndelag after this. He however noted the importance of Durham, which he considered to have grown very powerful.|$|E
5|$|Sherman paid greater {{attention}} to foreign affairs {{during the second half}} of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> was not the national origin of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|E
60|$|Knight stood staring blindly {{at where}} the hearse had been; <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> or some one, there. Then he turned, and beheld the lithe form of Stephen bowed down like that of an old man. He took his young friend's arm, and led {{him away from the}} light.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel {{took the}} torch with {{trembling}} fingers and knelt {{down on the}} floor to examine it closely.

60|$|Though {{originally}} a farm-house, the cottage was {{no larger than}} Aaron's, and of its two front windows only one showed a light, and that through a blind.

60|$|The key {{turned in}} the lock beneath the gentle {{pressure}} of her fingers, the bolt slipped quietly back and she pushed the door ajar.

25|$|In {{the modern}} times, {{according}} to Merezhkovsky, both monastic and ascetic Christianity {{will cease to}} exist. Art would not just adopt religious forms, but {{become an integral part}} of religion, the latter taken in broader concept. Human evolution <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> would lead to merging of whatever had been polarized: sex and spirit, religion and culture, male and female, et cetera — bringing about Kingdom Come, not 'out there', but 'here on Earth'.|$|E
25|$|While John Birt was Director General of the BBC, the British press {{from time}} to time {{reported}} Paxman's criticism of his boss. The former, suspected at first to be an outsider brought in by a hostile government to supervise the BBC's break-up and ultimate sell-off, in turn publicly questioned the confrontational approach, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> of certain TV and radio interviewers. This was seen at the time as coded criticism of Paxman himself and of his BBC colleague John Humphrys.|$|E
25|$|Some {{argue that}} Rabbi Shneur Zalman's {{opposition}} stemmed from Napoleon's attempts to arouse a messianic view {{of himself in}} Jews, opening {{the gates of the}} ghettos and emancipating their residents as he conquered. He established an ersatz Sanhedrin, recruiting Jews to his ranks, and spreading rumors about his conquest of the Holy Land to make Jews subversive for his own ends. Thus, his opposition was based on a practical fear of Jews turning to the false messianism of Napoleon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} when Charlie awoke, two men were {{standing}} beside him. His eyes first fell on {{the one who had}} been to the town, and who held a large bundle in his hand. Then he turned his eyes to the other, and gave an exclamation of pleasure, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> was Stanislas. He looked pale and weak, and was evidently just recovering from a severe illness.|$|R
25|$|Tjalie Robinson {{developed}} a life philosophy that evolves around {{the nature of}} the Hunt, regularly writing about the practice of hunting as a parable for 'real' and 'truthful' living <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> In his stories the Hunt often returns as a theme to intellectually explore 'dangerous' and 'courageous' life and particularly to depict the life and culture of Indos. In the Netherlands he emerged as a sharp critic of assimilation, putting the hunting lifestyle of the Indo opposite to mundane lifestyle in the West.|$|E
25|$|By then, Baciu {{was also}} {{involved}} with the anti-authoritarian left-wing movement on the South American continent. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> the caudillo regimes of Alfredo Stroessner, Juan Perón or Anastasio Somoza were generally equivalent to Eastern European Stalinism. Together with Salvadorean diplomat Rafael Barraza Monterrosa, the Bacius managed a Panhispanist association, called Ruy Barbosa Circle, building personal contacts with Juan Bosch, the exiled Dominican socialist, and Carlos Mérida, the Guatemalan painter. In 1956, he had an encounter with Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro, and became a sympathizer of his 26th of July Movement.|$|E
25|$|The other {{principal}} thread {{within the}} civil-military theoretical debate was that generated in 1960 by Morris Janowitz in The Professional Soldier. Janowitz agreed with Huntington that separate {{military and civilian}} worlds existed, but differed from his predecessor regarding the ideal solution for preventing danger to liberal democracy. Since the military world <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> was fundamentally conservative, it would resist change and not adapt as rapidly as the more open and unstructured civilian society {{to changes in the}} world. Thus, according to Janowitz, the military would benefit from exactly what Huntington argued against – outside intervention.|$|E

A pair of vicious, half-broken bronchos were backing a light waggon away from the locomotive {{on the other side of}} the track, and a fur-wrapped figure sat stiffly on the driving seat.
