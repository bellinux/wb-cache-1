Students must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a word, form an image of that word in their minds {{and be able to}} recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E

25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E
25|$|In {{racing and}} very-high-performance road cars, other disc {{materials}} have been employed. Reinforced carbon discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking {{systems such as}} those used on Concorde were introduced in Formula One by Brabham in conjunction with Dunlop in 1976. Carbon–carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing unsprung weight, giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high operating temperature before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is easily visible during night racing, especially at shorter tracks. It {{is not uncommon to}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the cars, either live in person or on television and see the brake discs glowing red during application.|$|E

500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right.

500|$|The idea of {{the need}} to gain popular support for a new monarch by making the {{ceremony}} a spectacle for ordinary people, started with the coronation in 1377 of RichardII who was a 10-year-old boy, thought unlikely to command respect simply by his physical appearance. On the day before the coronation, the boy king and his retinue were met outside the City of London by the lord mayor, aldermen and the livery companies, and he was conducted to the Tower of London where he spent the night in vigil. The following morning, the king travelled on horseback in a great procession through the decorated city streets to Westminster. Bands played along the route, the public conduits flowed with red and white wine, and an imitation castle had been built in Cheapside, probably to represent the New Jerusalem, where a girl blew gold leaf over the king and offered him wine. Similar, or even more elaborate pageants continued until the coronation of CharlesII in 1661. Charles's pageant was watched by Samuel Pepys who wrote: [...] "So glorious was the show with gold and silver that we were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it". James II abandoned the tradition of the pageant to pay for jewels for his queen and thereafter there was only a short procession on foot from Westminster Hall to the abbey. For the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1831, a state procession from StJames's Palace to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 20th century {{there was a}} gradual [...] "retreat" [...] from this rule; in Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation, the courts allowed Hansard {{material}} to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation (but not to interpret the statute), and in Pickstone v Freemans plc, it was allowed {{to assist in the}} understanding of delegated legislation. A noted attack on the rule was made by Lord Denning in Davis v Johnson, where he said that asserting that the courts could not use Hansard was similar to saying that the judges [...] "should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be. It is on that footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to. It is on that understanding that an amendment is not pressed. In such cases I think the court should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the proceedings." [...] Despite these exceptions, the courts regularly maintained that {{it was not possible to}} use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation. The result of Pepper was a reversal of that rule; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to [...] "the very point in question in the litigation", where a piece of legislation is [...] "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity", with the intention being to understand [...] "the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words".|$|E

2500|$|In short, Netscape {{focused on}} {{creating}} software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing {{it to the}} end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with Google, a company that did not at the time focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data such as the links Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web search based on reputation through its [...] "PageRank" [...] algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called [...] "the perpetual beta". A similar difference can be seen between the Encyclopædia Britannica Online and Wikipedia: while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and releases them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the open source software adage [...] "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". This maxim is stating that if enough users are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any [...] "bugs" [...] or other problems.
