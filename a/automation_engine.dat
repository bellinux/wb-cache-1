30|$|Many {{transforms}} can be automated. Some transforms are simple, like approximating height {{from hand}} length or acquiring a social media avatar given a user name; they’re simple functions that are easily {{performed by a}} computer. More importantly, they are rudimentary tasks for a user, {{and they should be}} relieved of such duties. Some transforms are not simple but can still be automated—for example, performing facial recognition or social network traversals. From our use case, automating the transformation from the swipe gestures on a phone to indicate handedness is automatable but would require specialized software. Transforms of this category require more sophisticated <b>automation</b> <b>engines</b> and likely more sophisticated interfaces for the user to interact with. Some transforms cannot be reasonably automated.|$|R

This article points out that CRM should not be primarily understood as software only, but increasingly as management philosophy.

One part of the research deals with connections, problems and possibilities of use of CRM in practice, in particular with customers ́ lifetime values (CLV), implementation of CRM in a company and problems and expectations {{from the point of}} view of the company ́s marketing activities and focused on the process of evaluation of the efficiency of CRM implementation, particularly on the metric of successful implementation and its effects [...] However, organizations are still awaiting the improv ed market share promises and are rather slower at acquiring new customers. The speed of development in technologies such as the Inter- net, <b>automation</b> <b>engines,</b> interaction management and mobile communications is enabling this to happen, changing the way businesses interact and communicate with their customers but slower than in other European countries.

40|$|In {{domestic}} {{automotive industry}} {{the need for}} transition from transmission with manual control to automatic gearboxes (GB) emerged long ago. Regarding the leading foreign manufacturers (Allison, ZF, Eaton, etc.), an experience in design of automatic transmissions {{and the level of}} technological development is incomparably small. Thus, to have an informed choice of the gearbox structure types and control system is a relevant problem. Application efficiency of this or other gearbox depends both on its adaptability to the actual operating conditions and on the quality of transition refinement. This paper analyzes the special features of the gear change process in the most common types of automatic gearboxes. Constructive feasibilities of an "ideal" gear change (without power loss) and strategies for gear shifting are compared. The paper offers an overview of common problems when achieving these goals and the ways to solve them. An automatic transmission of the particular type used in the wheeled vehicles under off-road conditions determines the probability of maintaining their mobility. This is due to the phenomenon of wheel`s breakdown to slipping caused by sharp increase of torque on the wheel. Planetary hydromechanical transmissions (AT) provide continuous input torque to the wheels, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture and use. Besides, to provide a high number of density ratios in them is more complicated than in the automated and manual transmissions (AMT). This is important when moving long in the lower gears under difficult conditions. Compared with AT dual clutch transmissions due to design features require even more precise and fast control system of actuators and <b>engine.</b> <b>Automation</b> of constant-mesh or synchromesh transmissions provides a significant reduction in the duration of interruption in torque delivery. If {{it is not enough to}} increase mobility in the harsh conditions, a rational choice is to use a transmission type of TCCT (torque converter – clutch – (constant-mesh or synchromesh) transmission). Adding the torque converter to AMT increases the durability of clutch and synchronizers. It reduces the amount of gear changes and duration of interruption in torque delivery. Thus, the cost and repair complexity of such a transmission is much lower than those of AT. For almost 15 years there were no domestic scientific publications about economically perspective TCCT transmission. The fully automatic TCCT has been never investigated in domestic science...|$|R

40|$|Flexure-based mechanisms, also {{referred}} to as flexures, are widely being used as motion-guidance, or bearing, elements in applications requiring multi-degree-of-freedom positioning and alignment. Unlike friction-bearings (such as sliding or rolling contact bearings), flexures can be designed to offer, to a large extent, reliable linear elastic motion with a high resolution (on the order of nanometers) over small ranges of motion (on order of micrometers). Example applications include positioning a probe or sample in atomic force microscopy, alignment of tool and sample in stamping processes, and fine-positioning of wafer steppers in semiconductor manufacturing. These applications are often required satisfy critical functional requirements, such as load-capacity, bandwidth, resolution, and range. A systematic approach is needed to simultaneously address the design and control challenges involved, starting from the initial design concept generation stage to the final control implementation and testing. In this paper, we present an integrated design and control method for implementing flexurebased nanopositioning systems. We discuss the need for varying design topology and order of a controller in design and control optimization. An <b>automation</b> <b>engine</b> generates a set of flexurebased design topologies and also controllers of varying order in the optimization. A simple 1 -DOF example is worked out to illustrate the steps involved in using this methodology. The outcome of the exercise is a novel design topology, with it shape and size optimized, and a controller synthesized such that a desired control bandwidth and design requirements of strength and modal separation are met...|$|E
