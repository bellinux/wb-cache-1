5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> show {{complete}} {{separation of}} the heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E

5|$|Being {{relatively}} small, Knoetschkesuchus {{would have}} mainly fed on invertebrates and possibly small vertebrates (including amphibians <b>and</b> <b>mammals).</b> The same diet is observed in modern juvenile crocodilians {{of the same}} size class.|$|E

5|$|It {{and similar}} animals may {{possibly}} be the common {{ancestors of the}} broad swath of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds, <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> The first well-preserved Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.|$|E
5|$|The first {{vertebrates}} appeared over 500million {{years ago}} (Mya), during the Cambrian period, {{and may have}} resembled the modern hagfish in form. Sharks appeared about 450Mya, amphibians about 400Mya, reptiles about 350Mya, <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> about 200Mya. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain {{the same set of}} basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{are also}} eaten by various wild birds <b>and</b> <b>mammals,</b> {{including}} pronghorn, desert bighorn sheep, and deer. The thorny plants provide escape for cover for many small animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} features of vesivirus infection include intensely itching vesicles with clear fluid-containing blisters that erode into shallow ulcers. The vesiculating blisters {{have been observed}} on hands (humans), flippers (sea-lions), hooves (livestock), and the throat and neck (primates). Additional symptoms of vesivirus infection can include hepatitis (human), abortions (livestock), pneumonia (livestock <b>and</b> marine <b>mammals),</b> diarrhea (livestock), gingivitis (primates), myocarditis (livestock <b>and</b> sea <b>mammals),</b> <b>and</b> encephalitis (primates, livestock <b>and</b> sea <b>mammals).</b>|$|R
50|$|Larval {{lone star}} ticks {{have been found}} {{attached}} to birds <b>and</b> small <b>mammals,</b> <b>and</b> nymphal ticks have been found on these two {{groups as well as}} on small rodents. Adult lone star ticks usually feed on medium <b>and</b> large <b>mammals,</b> <b>and</b> are very frequently found on white-tailed deer. Lone star ticks will also feed on humans at any stage of development.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} home to a small group of fauna {{including}} three species of birds, six types of reptile, one species of frog <b>and</b> <b>mammal.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fish do {{not possess}} {{parathyroid}} glands; several species {{have been found to}} express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> It has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.|$|E
5|$|Individual F. aurea {{trees are}} common on dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and Santa Elena in Costa Rica, {{since they are}} often spared when forest is {{converted}} to pasture. In interviews, farmers identified the species as useful for fence posts, live fencing and firewood, and as a food species for wild birds <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E

5|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{of local}} oceanic fauna {{is not well}} understood. Sea turtles <b>and</b> <b>mammals,</b> including monk seals, fin whales (only 1 sighting and 5 strandings have been documented in Turkish waters), and dolphins are considered to reside in the park area, although regularity of occurrences are unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{circuits}} in the cerebellum {{are similar}} across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> There {{is also an}} analogous brain structure in cephalopods with well-developed brains, such as octopuses. This has been taken {{as evidence that the}} cerebellum performs functions important to all animal species with a brain.|$|E
5|$|The hippocampus, {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates. There is evidence that {{this part of the}} brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{youngest}} sediments {{are found}} deepest {{in the basin}} and consist of claystones and greenish matrix-supported conglomerates. Rootlets <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> fossils are more abundant in this layer.|$|R

5|$|Vertebrates {{including}} {{several species of}} frog put on warning displays; some of these species have poison glands. Among the mammals, deimatic displays are found in species with strong defences, such as in foul-smelling skunks and spiny porcupines. Such displays are often combined with warning coloration. Thus these displays in both frogs <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> are {{at least in part}} aposematic.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
50|$|Primarily nocturnal, these snakes {{shelter in}} rock crevices <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> burrows during {{the heat of}} the day. They become more diurnal during the cooler months of the year.|$|R
