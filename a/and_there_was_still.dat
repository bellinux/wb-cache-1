5|$|The injured Lindwall {{came out}} to bat at 365/7 without a runner to join Hassett, and {{appeared}} to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Bradman fell for 138 with the score at 5/305. Yardley again pinned Hassett down with more leg theory. Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and {{employed}} a pure ring field. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. The injured Ray Lindwall came out to join Hassett at 7/365 without a runner. Hassett—who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the morning—swept Laker for four and then hit {{him for the first}} six of the match. Hassett added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. Australia were unhurried and remained patient in the face of Yardley's defensive tactics because they had bowled England out on the first day <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> sufficient time to force a result. After the break, Hassett reached his first Test century on English soil. from 305 minutes. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes, before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. This ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall with the score at 8/473; Australia ended at 509 to take a 344-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21 in an eight-wicket win.|$|E

25|$|Bradford/Leeds UCCE's {{last game}} against {{first-class}} {{opposition of the}} season was against Yorkshire at Headingley. The first day was washed out by rain, before both teams subsided for low scores on the second day. First Bradford/Leeds UCCE were all out for 105 with Yorkshireman David Lucas taking 6 for 20 off his 9 overs. In reply Yorkshire managed only 151, despite Simon Guy adding 51 for the sixth wicket with Lucas, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> time for Bradford/Leeds to lose 3 wickets for 12 runs before close on the second day. On the third day there was some resistance from James Duffy (49, the highest score of the match) and Mohammed Ali (47), but the students could only make it to 161, leaving Yorkshire a target of 116. They lost 5 wickets in knocking off the runs.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1949 {{owing to}} shared nuclear research, France and Israel {{started to move}} towards an alliance. Following the {{outbreak}} of the Algerian War in late 1954, France began to ship more and more arms to Israel. In November 1954, Shimon Peres visited Paris, where he was received by the French Defense Minister Marie-Pierre Kœnig, who told him that France would sell Israel any weapons it wanted to buy. By early 1955, France was shipping large amounts of weapons to Israel. In April 1956, following another visit to Paris by Peres, France agreed to totally disregard the Tripartite Declaration, and supply even more weapons to Israel. During the same visit, Peres informed the French that Israel had decided upon war with Egypt in 1956. Peres claimed that Nasser was a genocidal maniac intent upon not only destroying Israel, but also exterminating its people, and as such, Israel wanted a war before Egypt received even more Soviet weapons, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a possibility of victory for the Jewish state. Peres asked for the French, who had emerged as Israel's closest ally by this point, to give Israel all the help they could give in the coming war.|$|E

500|$|On the ABC versions, ten contestants {{competed in}} a {{preliminary}} [...] "Fastest Finger" [...] round {{for the right to}} play the main game on each episode. The contestants were presented with a question and a list of four answers which needed to be put in a specific order. Using keys on their podiums, each of the contestants attempted to enter the correct order in the shortest amount of time, with a maximum time limit of 20 seconds. If the main game ended <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> time available for another game, the remaining contestants played another Fastest Finger round for a chance to play the main game. In the event of a tie between two or more contestants, those contestants played an additional Fastest Finger question to break the tie. If all contestants answered the question incorrectly, the round was repeated with another question. Fastest Finger was eliminated from the gameplay when the syndicated version premiered in 2002.|$|E
500|$|One of Dorgon's first {{orders in}} the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire {{northern}} part of Beijing {{to give it to}} Bannermen, including Han Chinese Bannermen. The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace, followed by the White Banners east, the Red Banners west, and the Blue Banners south. This distribution accorded with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which [...] "each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass." [...] Despite tax remissions and large-scale building programs designed to facilitate the transition, in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> animosity between the two groups. Agricultural land outside the capital was also marked off (quan 圈) and given to Qing troops. Former landowners now became tenants who had to pay rent to their absentee Bannermen landlords. This transition in land use caused [...] "several decades of disruption and hardship." ...|$|E

The show had Lennon singing live over the backing tracks of [...] "Stand by Me" [...] and [...] "Slippin' and Slidin'". Lennon also appeared on Salute to Sir Lew – The Master Showman singing live again over backing tracks, this time for three songs: [...] "Stand by Me", [...] "Slippin' and Slidin'" [...] and [...] "Imagine". A second single, [...] "Slippin N Slidin"/"Ain't That a Shame" [...] (Apple 1883), was announced, promotional copies were pressed, but was never released. [...] "Ya Ya", backed with [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula", was released as a single only in Germany, peaking at number 47 on the Media Control Charts. Lennon said the following about Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "It started in '73 with Phil and fell apart. I ended up as part of mad, drunk scenes in Los Angeles and I finally finished it off on me own. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> problems with it up to the minute it came out.

I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the {{popularity}} of cunning folk continued, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a large and lucrative market for their services, for instance in 1816, there were eight different wise women working independently in the English coastal town of Whitby. Nonetheless, the nineteenth century also saw an increase in the numbers of those cunning folk being prosecuted under the Witchcraft Act of 1736, possibly because [...] "members of the social elite came to perceive that a faith in magic [...] seemed to be as prevalent among the populace as it had been a hundred years before, even while a growing political turbulence among commoners gave their rulers a new interest in the idea of education and civility as stabilizing forces." [...] Soon after this, in 1824, a new law commonly referred to as the Vagrancy Act 1824 was introduced, bringing about a further blow to the cunning profession by outlawing [...] "persons pretending or professing to tell fortunes, or using any subtle craft, means and device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and impose." [...] The enacting of the law led to the increased prosecutions of cunning folk, something that would only begin to wane in the 1910s.|$|E
