40|$|Today, {{technology}} enables {{companies to}} extend their reach in managing the supply chain and operating it in a coordinated fashion from raw materials to end consumers. Order promising and order fulfillment have become key supply chain capabilities which help companies win repeat business by promising orders competitively and reliably. In this dissertation, we study two issues related to moving a company from an <b>Available</b> <b>to</b> <b>Promise</b> (<b>ATP)</b> philosophy to a Profitable to Promise (PTP) philosophy: pseudo order promising and coordinating demand fulfillment with supply. To address the first issue, a single time period analytical ATP model for n confirmed customer orders and m pseudo orders is presented by considering both material constraints and production capacity constraints. At the outset, some analytical properties of the optimal policies are derived and then a particular customer promising scheme {{that depends on the}} ratio between customer service level and profit changes is presented. To tackle the second issue, we create a mathematical programming model and explore two cases: a deterministic demand curve o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mixed model {{assembly}} lines (MMAL) are {{a type of}} production line where a variety of product models similar in product characteristics are assembled. The effective design of these lines requires that schedule for assembling the different products is determined. In this paper we tried to fit the sequencing problem with the main characteristics of make to order (MTO) environment. The problem solved in this paper is a multiple objective sequencing problem in mixed model {{assembly lines}} sequencing using weighted Sum Method (WSM) using GAMS software for small problem and an effective GA for large scale problems {{because of the nature}} of NP-hardness of our problem and vast time consume to find the optimum solution in large problems. In this problem three practically important objectives are minimizing: total utility work, keeping a constant production rate variation, and minimizing earliness and tardiness cost which consider the priority of each customer and different due date which is a real situation in mixed model assembly lines and it is the first time we consider different attribute to prioritize the customers which help the company to reduce the cost of earliness and tardiness. This mechanism is a way to apply an advance <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>promise</b> (<b>ATP)</b> in mixed model assembly line sequencing which is the main contribution of this paper.

40|$|We examine leadtime-quoting polices for {{minimizing}} average {{lead time}} subject to customer service constraints on fill rate, tardiness, or relative tardiness in simple systems with exponential and normal processing times. By studying the resulting safety leadtimes implied by each policy we {{gain insight into}} why some policies perform more robustly with respect to different measures of customer service than do others. This analysis suggests that a simple constant safety leadtime policy should work reasonably well under most conditions. A series of simulation experiments of more complex production environments indicates that the constant safety leadtime policy does indeed exhibit robust performance. This, plus {{the fact that it}} is extremely simple to adapt to a wide range of production environments, makes it an attractive basis for real-world leadtime-quoting systems.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a framework for}} solving a sealed-bid, multi-issue, and multi-sourcing reverse auction problem in which negotiation takes place between the buyer and the suppliers during the bidding process. The problem is formulated as a bi-level distributed programming model in which the buyer is the upper level decision maker, while suppliers at the lower level make decisions independent of each other. The negotiation process between the buyer and the suppliers is facilitated via the iterative exchange of decision information between {{the upper and lower}} levels of the model. The outcome of the sealed-bid auction is determined using an algorithm designed to establish the optimum quantity allocation and delivery time at the upper level and the corresponding optimized production plans at the lower level. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated via an illustrative example.

In the viewpoint of scheduling technique, we are using the capability and contribution of BFS to reduce the job shop problem into a station of parallel machines scheduling problem.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{rationing}} common components among multiple products in a configure-to-order system with order configuration uncertainty. The objective of this problem is to maximize expected revenue by implementing a threshold rationing policy. Under this policy, a product is <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>promise</b> if fulfilling the order for the product will not cause the inventory of any one of its required components to fall below the component's threshold level for that product. The problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic integer program and solved using the sample average approximation approach. A heuristic is developed to generate good feasible solutions and lower bound estimates. Using industry data, we examine the benefit of component rationing as compared to a First-Come-First-Served policy and show that this benefit is correlated to the average revenue per product and the variability in the revenue across products whose components are constrained.

40|$|Through a {{research}} collaboration with Atomos SpA, an Italian software vendor of Advanced Planning Systems (APS), authors {{have developed a}} tool in order to perform a tactical finite capacity planning over a multi-site production system {{as well as to}} optimize outsourcing volumes in order to drive supply logistics chain. The main objective of this tool, called Expert Plan (EP), is to balance capacity over different resources and to plan production supply requirements {{in order to determine the}} minimum cost for Master Production Schedule (MPS) and to match internal and external capacity of production system with customer and supplier constraints. Production balance is obtained through a performance driven analysis by using On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) server allowing users to compare the result of each planned scenario.

In general, the polarizing and depolarizing properties are small so that inversion of the system Mueller matrix will permit the accurate measurement of Stokes profiles for vector magnetic field determination.
