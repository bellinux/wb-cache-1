This standard is further superseded by MFRS 119 (i. e. {{as amended by}} IASB in June 2011) with effect from 1 January 2013. Hence, the present study provides evidence on the practice of pension accounting disclosures after the implementation of FRS 119 ‘Employee Benefits’ and their stock market reactions ‘cumulative market adjusted return’. The study reveals that seventy (70) companies have adopted Defined Benefit (DB) pension schemes based on the annual reports for the year 2009. Among these companies, seven (7) companies have pension <b>assets</b> <b>disclosures</b> while another 63 companies pension liabilities disclosures. The pension accounting disclosures related to {{actuarial gains and losses}} are only provided by 29 Malaysian companies. In addition, multivariate analysis provides interesting results that indicate pension liabilities disclosures are significant variables in relation to CMAR. These findings may suggest that DB pension schemes with high disclosures of pension liabilities are less likely contributing to high value of CMAR. In this context, the users of corporate financial statements could be expected (1) to value the amount of pension liabilities more than amount of pension assets among DB pension schemes adopters; and (2) higher amount of pension liabilities may result in lower CMAR among DB pension schemes adopters in Malaysia. On the other hand, pension <b>assets</b> <b>disclosures</b> which are positively and significantly associated to CMAR indicate that the higher of pension assets disclosed in by DB pension adopters in the financial statements, the higher of CMAR will be offered by Malaysian listed companies.

40|$|Special {{interest}} money enters {{politics in}} a number of ways: Politicians solicit contributions that help in their election campaigns; they enrich themselves while in office by accepting bribes; or, increasingly in many countries, they go through the "revolving door" and take up lucrative post-government jobs in companies that were affected by their decisions in office. The central argument I make in this dissertation is that these different types of special interest money can act as functional substitutes and that their prevalence is a strategic choice. I examine this strategic choice theoretically and empirically, and provide insights into the consequences it has for policy and voters. I focus on two main factors: First, what consequences does the legal environment have? Second, what is the effect of the political environment? Chapter 1 lays the theoretical groundwork. I study a formal model of political competition that determines whether and how special interest money enters politics. I show that laws criminalizing bribery or restricting campaign contributions lead to substitution effects and make other types of special interest money more common, in particular the revolving door. I also study the effect of legal restrictions on equilibrium policy and demonstrate that it only moves policy towards the median voter under certain circumstances. Higher political competitiveness leads incumbents to solicit campaign contributions, whereas the absence of competitiveness provides leeway for personal enrichment. I test the effect of the legal and the political environment on the types of special interest money empirically, using newly assembled data from the world's two largest democracies. Chapter 2 examines the effect of the degree of political competition on the choice between personal enrichment while in office and campaign spending in India. Making use of detailed mandatory <b>asset</b> <b>disclosure</b> data of state assembly members that run in consecutive elections, I show that candidates with ties to business groups increase their wealth to a higher degree when they are electorally secure. Conversely, they hold larger cash reserves, which are crucial in campaigns, the less electorally secure they are. Using a survey experiment, I show that the way special interest money is used matters to voters. Chapter 3 asks where tougher regulations of money in politics comes from. I argue that political entrepreneurs running on an anti-corruption platform play an important role and provide a simple formal exposition of the conditions under which voters are willing to vote for them. The implications of the model are tested {{for one of the most}} successful electoral performances of an anti-corruption party of our time: the 2013 debut of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in state elections in Delhi in India. Analyzing three rounds of pre-election surveys with a total of more than 40, 000 respondents and election outcomes at the polling-booth level, I provide empirical support for the central insights of the formal model. Finally, in Chapter 4 I study the effect of stricter regulations of bribery and campaign contributions on the revolving door, exploiting regulatory variation among the 50 state legislatures of the United States. Using a series of multilevel regression models, I show that former legislators are more likely to go through the revolving door and become lobbyists in states that make politicians less dependent on campaign contributions from special interests and that make it harder to earn money while in office. This suggests that politicians' movement into the private sector upon exiting office can act as a substitute for other types of special interest money. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the nature of Australian public companies’ voluntary environmental management disclosures for companies making disclosures about their greenhouse gas emission performance and management in the year before and the year after the introduction of Australia’s National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting legislation, and to empirically test the hypothesized influence of several company characteristics on the quality of these disclosures. Design/methodology/approach The content of GHG performance and management disclosures made in annual reports and stand-alone sustainability reports of 1, 766 (1, 853) publicly listed Australian companies in 2007 (2009) is determined using an index of quality based on GRI guidelines. The relationship among the quality of disclosures and various company characteristics taken from information asymmetry, agency, political cost and proprietary cost theories is examined using an OLS-regression model. Findings Results indicate that voluntary disclosure of GHG information is significantly related to companies requiring increased debt and having higher leverage, companies belonging to some politically sensitive industries and to the age of companies’ fixed <b>assets.</b> <b>Disclosure</b> of greenhouse gas emission information is also significantly associated with lower ROA, higher Tobin’s q and with having dual (overseas) stock exchange listings...|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 1979, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 {{required}} federal officials, {{including the}} justices, to file annual disclosures {{of their income}} and <b>assets.</b> These <b>disclosures</b> provide a snapshot into {{the wealth of the}} justices, reported within broad ranges, from year to year since 1979. In the first such set of disclosures, only two justices were revealed to be millionaires: Potter Stewart and Lewis F. Powell, with Chief Justice Warren Burger coming in third with about $600,000 in holdings. The least wealthy Justice was Thurgood Marshall.|$|R
40|$|Highlights: Despite strong {{performance}} in many areas, Canada continues {{to struggle with}} controlling the influence {{of money in the}} political process. There are no limits on loans to political parties or candidates, and in nomination and political party leadership races, loopholes allow for secrecy when it comes to financial contributions to candidates. Despite cooling-off periods for officials leaving the executive branch, Members of Parliament and their staff are not subject to any post-government employment restrictions, encouraging a revolving door effect between lawmakers and lobbyists. Meanwhile, the personal <b>assets</b> <b>disclosures</b> of Canadian Senators remain confidential and inaccessible to the public, a bizarre exception for one of the world's wealthier and more developed democracies. Judicial accountability is also weak, with no <b>disclosure</b> of personal <b>assets</b> or gifts, no restrictions on receiving gifts, and a complaints process in which judges judge other judges. Overall, government accountability watchdog agencies (including the police) either lack powers to enforce laws or have a weak enforcement record.

30|$|Security {{requirements}} and threat analysis on CPSs Several authors {{have studied the}} requirements {{to take into account}} the new security issues when designing security mechanisms for cyber-physical systems. In [28], Cardenas et al. define the issue of secure control by analyzing separately the problem first from an information security point of view and then by looking at specific control issues. In [29], the same authors outline for the first time the difference between corporate ICT security and cyber-physical system security, and the importance of explicitly considering the interactions of the control system with the plant. In [30], Wang et al. provide a classification of threats and possible attacks against CPS. They also introduce a taxonomy of adversaries by classifying them into several categories depending on skills and motivation. A different perspective is taken in [15] where Texeira et al. propose to classify attacks according to a three-dimensional cyber-physical attack space; disruption of <b>assets,</b> <b>disclosure</b> of resources, and adversary knowledge. Cyber attacks specific to SCADA systems are addressed in [31, 32]. In [31], Ten et al. carry out a quantitative assessment of vulnerability of SCADA systems. Zhu et al. analyze in [32] some attacks toward SCADA systems by making a distinction between hardware, software, and communication stack threats. In a complementary research direction, the issue of designing testbeds to experimentally evaluate both threats (and their countermeasures) has been carried out by Hahn et al. and Mallouhi et al. in [33, 34].|$|R
