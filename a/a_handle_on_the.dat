25|$|Grafting to {{involves}} the strong adsorption or chemical bonding of a polymer molecule to a surface from solution. This process is typically achieved through a coupling agent that links <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface to a reactive group on {{either of the}} chain termini. Although simple, this approach suffers from the disadvantage of a relatively low grafting density {{as a result of}} steric hindrance from the already-attached polymer coils. After coupling, as in all cases, polymers attempt to maximize their entropy typically by assuming a brush or mushroom conformation. Thus, potential binding sites become inaccessible beneath this “mushroom domain”.|$|E
500|$|Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media named [...] "Liquorice" [...] the [...] "Best New Track" [...] {{following}} its release; he praised {{the use of}} [...] "Pineapple Crush" [...] on the song, commenting: [...] "Lone's bright tones and winding sense of melody meshes well with Banks' light, airy vocals, while Azealia spits quick over 'Pineapple Crush's breakbeat rhythmic pattern without losing <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beat, unleashing clever rhymes [...] without breaking a sweat." [...] In a mixed review, Alex Macpherson from Fact wrote that Banks [...] "feels slightly overwhelmed by its broad synth brushstrokes." ...|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E

500|$|Bizenghast {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The September 2005 issue of Teen People listed Bizenghast as the Hot Book of the Month. [...] Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart praised {{the first volume}} as [...] "a highly enjoyable read". Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux described the series as [...] "belong to a fantasy subgenre {{sometimes referred to as}} 'pop Gothic' and relying on atmosphere and looks. Critics praised the art of Bizenghast as detailed, but did not see it as manga-styled. Anime Jumps Chad Clayton called the series [...] "heavily steeped in the gothic tradition" [...] and commented that the series [...] "successfully develops an inventive visual style all its own. It seems to owe more to classical art, gothic comics, and even artists like Edward Gorey than it does to manga." [...] Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly, found the art reminiscent [...] "of classic fantasy indy comics" [...] and noted [...] "stock elements" [...] in the story. Reviewers found Dinah's character design [...] "striking" [...] and with the potential to appeal to fans of the Gothic Lolita fashion. Criticism focused on the writing, [...] "uneven pacing", flat characters, and the varying quality of the art. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy heavily criticized Bizenghast for the [...] "slightly modified generic monster-of-the-week cliché" [...] plot, one-dimensional characters, and art. David Welsh compared Bizenghast to [...] "a cosplay of a horror manga", and wrote: [...] "It’s got <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cosmetics, but central elements of story and character are vague and underdeveloped." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1775, Lord Stanhope of the United Kingdom {{designed}} a pinwheel machine. It {{was set in}} a rectangular box with <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side. He also {{designed a}} machine using Leibniz wheels in 1777. [...] "In 1777 Stanhope produced the Logic Demonstrator, a machine designed to solve problems in formal logic.

2500|$|Fly reels are {{normally}} manual, single-action designs. Rotating <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} reel rotates the spool which retrieves the line, usually at a 1:1 ratio (i.e., one complete revolution of the handle equals one revolution of the spool). [...] Fly reels {{are one of the}} simplest reels and have far fewer parts than a spinning reel. [...] The larger the fish the more important the reel becomes. [...] On the outside of the reel there are two levels of knobs these are the spool release and the drag adjustment.|$|E
50|$|Cutting {{away with}} the 3-ring release is done by pulling <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main lift web of the harness. In some cases, parts of the {{malfunctioning}} main parachute may be tangled with the skydiver, in which case {{it may be necessary}} to use a hook knife to literally cut away the main.|$|R
50|$|Mobile storage {{systems are}} usually {{constructed}} with <b>a</b> rotary <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exterior accessible face. When rotated, the handle operates the mechanism which winds the single, connected, filing unit either left or right, depending on a clockwise or counter-clockwise {{rotation of the}} <b>handle.</b> In <b>an</b> office, for example, several stacks of moveable filing cabinets may be accommodated in a limited space.|$|R
5000|$|The TM-41 was a circular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} landmine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mines case consisted of a short cylinder with the entire top surface {{being used as a}} pressure plate. The mine has <b>a</b> carrying <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the mine. It was normally painted olive drab and was broadly similar to the larger, later, TM-44 mine.|$|R
2500|$|The present {{centre of}} {{traditional}} production of adinkra cloth is Ntɔnso, 20km northwest of Kumasi. Dark Adinkra aduro pigment for the stamping is made there, by soaking, pulverizing, and boiling the inner bark and {{roots of the}} badie tree (Bridelia ferruginea) in water over a wood fire. Once the dark colour is released, the mixture is strained, and then boiled for several more hours until it thickens. The [...] stamps are {{carved out of the}} bottom of a calabash piece. They measure between five and eight centimetres square. They have <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back, and the stamp itself is slightly curved, so that the dye can be put on with a rocking motion.|$|E
2500|$|When Erin {{started the}} {{audition}} process, the producers told her, [...] "Yeah she's a bad girl. We're gonna make her edgier." [...] While {{those were the}} intentions for the character, during Alderson's tenure, the writing strayed from that path. Hayley Erin found it easy to get <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character describing Kiki as being [...] "so relatable." [...] She continued and compared Kiki to her former role as Abby Newman on The Young and the Restless: [...] "Abby was very one-dimensional... Kiki's got layers" [...] Erin said. The actress described the character as [...] "kind of tough" [...] yet [...] "sensitive." [...] Of the writings bringing back the character's edge, Erin said [...] "Now, it's fun" [...] and [...] "they made a character that a little foggy seem clearer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wesley {{undergoes}} {{yet another}} drastic personality change in Angels fifth season {{following the death}} of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably [...] "unbalanced". [...] "By the time we get to the last few episodes, he's got <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way," [...] says Denisof. [...] "But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart and it makes it possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, the stage is set for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there's nothing more for him to lose." [...] Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a [...] "much deeper, darker place" [...] than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, [...] "The Girl in Question". Denisof continues, They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. And then we would have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having these two people that he was having these strong feelings about. That {{was going to be a}} fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [...] decided to cancel the show. The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley's death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, [...] "It was very upsetting to read. It's too good a story because it hurts." ...|$|E

60|$|Ricardo disregarded the question. The {{material}} {{vision of}} the spoil absorbed all his faculties. A great vision! He seemed to see it. A few small canvas bags tied up with thin cord, their distended rotundity showing the inside pressure of the disk-like forms of coins--gold, solid, heavy, eminently portable. Perhaps steel cash-boxes with a chased design, on the covers; or perhaps a black and brass box with <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top, and full of goodness knows what. Bank notes? Why not? The fellow had been going home; so it was surely something worth going home with.|$|E
