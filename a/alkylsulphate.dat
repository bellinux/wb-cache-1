40|$|The {{lithium salts}} of 4 -methoxy-derivatives of pyrimidinic bases undergo chemoselective N 1 -methylation or ethylation when {{treated with the}} {{appropriate}} <b>alkylsulphate</b> in dry dioxane. Under the same conditions, 4 -unprotected pyrimidinic bases afford mixtures of N 1 -, O 2 - and N 1,N 3 -alkylation products. This is {{explained in terms of}} HSAB principle. ...|$|E
40|$|Sulphate esters {{make up a}} large {{proportion}} of the available sulphur in agricultural soils, and many pseudomonads can desulphurize a range of aryl- and <b>alkylsulphate</b> esters to provide sulphur for growth. After miniTn 5 transposon mutagenesis of Pseudomonas putida S- 313, we isolated 19 mutants that were defective in cleavage of the chromogenic sulphate ester 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indoxylsulphate (X-sulphate). Analysis of these strains revealed that they carried independent insertions in a gene cluster that comprised genes for a sulphate ester/sulphonate transporter (atsRBC) a LysR-type regulator (sftR), an oxygenolytic alkylsulphatase (atsK), an arylsulphotransferase (astA) and a putative TonB-dependent receptor (sftP). The SftP protein was localized in the outer membrane, and the arylsulfphotransferase was identified as an intracellular enzyme. Expression of sftR was repressed in the presence of inorganic sulphate, and the sftR gene was required for the expression of atsBC, atsRK and sftP-astA. An sftR mutant was unable to grow with aryl- or <b>alkylsulphate</b> esters in laboratory media and showed significantly reduced survival compared with the parent strain during incubation in Danish agricultural and grassland soils. This effect suggests that sulphate esters are an important sulphur source for microbes in aerobic soils and highlights the importance of the microbial population in the soil sulphur cycle...|$|E
40|$|Density {{and sound}} {{velocity}} data for aqueous solutions at 298. 2 K containing alkyltrimethylammonium bromides and sodium alkylsulphates were analysed to yield partial molar volumes and isentropic compressions. The calculated contributions of methylene groups to {{the properties of}} alkyltrimethylammonium cations and <b>alkylsulphate</b> anions show no dependence on position in the alkyl chains and a common contribution to the ionic partial molar volumes over the range methyl ≤ n-octyl for the sulphates and n-propyl ≤ n-hexyl for the alkyltrimethylammonium ions. However, a switch in head group from trimethylammonium to sulphate changes the contribution of methylene groups to estimated partial molar isentropic compressibilities. The reasons for this sensitivity are {{discussed in terms of}} hydration characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{well known}} algistatic effect of {{cationic}} surfactants was not exhibited by homologous series of amphoteric, anionic and non-ionic types assayed with Chlamydomonas reinhardi. Sulphobetaine amphoterics, 3 -(octyl-octadecyldimethylammonio) - 1 -propanesulphonates, caused growth inhibition when the lipophile contained twelve or more carbon atoms, {{but only at}} micellar concentrations. Critical micelle concentration (CMC) of sulphobetaines decreases logarithmically with increasing alkyl chain length and derivatives having eight and ten carbons in the lipophile were below the CMC at the highest concentration tested. Despite their pronounced protein-denaturing properties, sodium higher <b>alkylsulphates</b> did not materially inhibit the growth of Chlamydomonas. This {{may be due to}} the fact that the Kraft points of these anionics having fourteen or more carbon atoms were above the culture temperatures, thereby reducing their solution properties. Although less inhibiting than the sulphobetains, the non-ionic alcohol ethoxylates decreased growth with increasing hydrophilicity. The most lipophilic non-ionic showed growth-promoting effects. © 1983...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that metallo-organics as {{additives}} to engine oils such as the <b>alkylsulphates,</b> the dialkylphenyldithiophosphates etc [...] have some inconveniences that appear during the lubrication {{and particularly in the}} case where the oil is used under severe conditions, this can cause its decomposition as ashes leading to eventual engine wear. The specifications of new engines, working under severe conditions constitute an imperative of the synthesis of additives with high thermal and oxidative stabilities, longer lubrication life, universal application and a lower consumption of the additives. Today's engines requirements on lubrication oils with more and more performance have attracted our interest to synthesize a series of metallo-organic products used as polyfunctional additives for engine oils. Their synthesis is carried out following three steps namely: alkenylation, amidation and esterification of alkenylmaleic anhydride, and finally neutralization. The different metals used are Ca, Mg, Ba, Cu, Zn, Hg. The synthesized products have been identified using physical and chemical analysis methods, and their use as additives for engine oils confirmed through exploitation testing. This permitted to propose them as polyfunctional additives for lubricating oil...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence probing, {{viscosity}} {{and light}} scattering measurements have been combined {{to study the}} aggregation of different anionic surfactants mainly in dilute solutions (0. 5 % w/v) of (hydroxypropyl) cellulose (HPC MW 173, 000), in moderate ionic strength (NaCl 0. 1 mol. L- 1). The set of surfactants includes natural cholesterol derivatives, sodium cholate (CS) and sodium deoxycholate (DC), and the <b>alkylsulphate,</b> sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS). At 298 K the critical surfactant concentration related to aggregate/HPC formation (C 1) decreases for SDS and DC whereas it increases slightly for CS. At 312 K the C 1 values for CS and DC are slightly shifted toward higher values whereas it is not changed for SDS. All surfactant/HPC systems increase C 1 values as the HPC concentration increases to 1. 2 %. Above C 1 the viscosity increases for all surfactant/HPC systems but it is sharper in the increasing order CS, DC and SDS. The hydrodynamic behavior indicates that CS induces higher diffusion to HPC than SDS and DC. The aggregation in the surfactant/HPC systems is analyzed through the feature of surfactant/aggregate structure (size, charge density, etc) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{inducible}} S 3 secondary alkylsulphohydrolase of {{the soil}} bacterium Pseudomonas C 12 B was purified to homogeneity (683 -fold from cell-free extracts {{by a combination of}} column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Sephadex G- 100 and Blue Sepharose CL- 6 B. The enzyme has a molecular weight in the region of 40000 [...] 46000, and is active over a broad range of pH from 5 to 9, with maximum activity at pH 8. 2. The preferred substrates of the enzyme are the symmetrical secondary <b>alkylsulphate</b> esters such as heptan- 4 -yl sulphate and nonan- 5 -yl sulphate and the asymmetric secondary octyl and nonyl sulphate esters with the sulphate group attached to C- 3 or C- 4. However, for each asymmetric ester, the L-isomer is much more readily hydrolysed than the D-isomer. This specificity is interpreted in terms of a three-point attachment of the substrate to the enzyme's active site. The alkyl chains {{on either side of the}} esterified carbon atom are bound in two separate sites, one of which can only accommodate alkyl chains of limited size. The third site binds the sulphate group. Enzymic hydrolysis of this group is accompanied by complete inversion of configuration at the asymmetric carbon atom. The implied cleavage of the C [...] O bond of the C [...] O [...] S ester linkage was confirmed by 18 O-incorporation studies...|$|E
