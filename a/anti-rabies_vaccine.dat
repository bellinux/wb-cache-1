50|$|Roux and Yersin grew the {{bacillus}} {{that causes}} it and studied, thanks to various experiments {{they did on}} rabbits, its pathogenic power and symptoms, like the paralysis of the respiratory muscles. It is this last consequence of the diphtheria that provided the two researchers with a valuable clue {{of the nature of}} the disease, since it is caused by an intoxication due to a toxin introduced into the organism by the bacillus, that while secreting this particular venom is able to multiply itself: they were therefore inclined to think that the bacillus owed its virulence to the toxin. After filtrating the microbial culture of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae and injecting it into the lab animals, they were able to observe all the typical signs of the sickness. Roux and Yersin established that they were dealing with a new type of bacillus, not only able to proliferate and abundantly reproduce itself, but also capable of spreading at the same time a powerful venom, and they deduced that it can play the role of antigen, that is if they could overcome the delicate moment of its injection, made especially dangerous by the toxin.Some German researchers had also discovered the diphtheria toxin and were trying to immunize some guinea pigs through the use of a vaccine: one of them, Von Behring, Robert Koch's student, stated that he was able to weaken small doses of the toxin. Nonetheless Roux was not convinced by this result, since no-one knew the collateral effects of the procedure, and preferred to use serotherapy since more than one lab study - like the one accomplished by Charles Richet - demonstrated that the serum of an animal vaccinated against the disease included the antibodies needed to defeat it. The anti-diphtheria serum which was able to agglutinate the bacteria and neutralize the toxin was supplied by a horse inoculated with the viral germs, and it was separated from the blood drawn from the horses’ jugular vein. Like it happened for his teacher with the <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine,</b> Roux needed to test the effectiveness of the product he elaborated, and endured all the stress and ethical dilemmas that the first use of such a risky but also groundbreaking procedure implied. To test the serum two groups of children were chosen from two different hospitals: in the first one, which received the serum, 338 out of 449 children survived, in the latter one, treated with the customary therapies, only 204 out of 520 survived. Once the results were made public by Le Figaro newspaper, a subscription fund was opened to raise the money needed to provide the Institute the amount of horses necessary to produce enough serum to satisfy the national demand.|$|E

40|$|Post-exposure {{prophylaxis}} (PEP) against rabies infection {{consists of}} a combination of passive immunisation with plasma-derived human or equine immune globulins and active immunisation with vaccine delivered shortly after exposure. Since anti-rabies immune globulins are expensive and scarce, {{there is a need for}} cheaper alternatives that can be produced more consistently. Previously, we generated potent virus-neutralising VHH, also called Nanobodies, against the rabies glycoprotein that are effectively preventing lethal disease in an in vivo mouse model. The VHH domain is the smallest antigen-binding functional fragment of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies that can be manufactured in microbial expression systems. In the current study we evaluated the efficacy of half-life extended anti-rabies VHH in combination with vaccine for PEP in an intranasal rabies infection model in mice. The PEP combination therapy of systemic anti-rabies VHH and intramuscular vaccine significantly delayed the onset of disease compared to treatment with anti-rabies VHH alone, prolonged median survival time (35 versus 14 days) and decreased mortality (60 % versus 19 % survival rate), when treated 24 hours after rabies virus challenge. Vaccine alone was unable to rescue mice from lethal disease. As reported also for immune globulins, some interference of anti-rabies VHH with the antigenicity of the vaccine was observed, but this did not impede the synergistic effect. Post exposure treatment with <b>vaccine</b> and human <b>anti-rabies</b> immune globulins was unable to protect mice from lethal challenge. <b>Anti-rabies</b> VHH and <b>vaccine</b> act synergistically to protect mice after rabies virus exposure, which further validates the possible use of anti-rabies VHH for rabies PEP...|$|R
40|$|Post {{exposure}} prophylaxis {{using one}} of the WHO-approved vaccines is the method of choice for preventing rabies. Abnormal immune function in patients with some specific medical conditions, such as pregnancy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, different types of cancers like lymphoma, diabetes I and II, corticosteroid consumption by patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus, could impair the immunologic response to various vaccines. The immune response to rabies vaccination has never been examined in patients with any of these described medical conditions. This study purposed to evaluate the neutralyzing antibody response after vaccination with purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV) according to the WHO-recommended Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) "ESSEN" regimen. Thirty healthy volunteers and 50 volunteers with different medical conditions who were exposed to a suspected rabid animal in the 2 nd or 3 rd category of exposure received 5 doses of PVRV under the ESSEN protocol. Three blood samples were collected on days 0 (before the first dose), 14, and 35. The anti-rabies antibody titer was measured using the Rapid Fluorescent Foci Inhibition Test (RFFIT) and an ELISA Bio-Rad, Platelia, Rabies II kit. All subjects reached NAb titers above 0. 5 IU/ml by day 14 after vaccination. On day 35 (1 week after receiving the last rabies <b>vaccine),</b> <b>anti-rabies</b> antibodies were in the protective level (> 0. 5 IU/ml) in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in anti-rabies antibody response due to the type of exposure (category 2 or 3), and successful seroconversion was confirmed in both groups. In conclusion, the ESSEN protocol using the PVRV vaccine is sufficient for rabies prophylaxis in patients with specific medical conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Rabies {{is a major}} public-health {{problem in}} {{developing}} countries such as China. Although the recent re-emergence of human rabies in China was noted in several epidemiological studies, little {{attention was paid to}} the reasons behind this phenomenon paralleling the findings of the previous reports. The {{purpose of this study is}} thus first to characterize the current trends of human rabies in China from 1990 to 2007, and then to define better recommendations for improving the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) schedules delivered to rabies patients. Methods The most updated epidemiological data for 22527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007, retrieved from the surveillance database of reportable diseases managed by the Ministry of Health of China, were analysed. To investigate the efficiency for the post-exposure treatment of rabies, the details of 244 rabies patients, including their anti-rabies treatment of injuries or related incidents, were ascertained in Guangdong provincial jurisdiction. The risk factors to which the patients were predisposed or the regimens given to 80 patients who received any type of PEP were analysed to identify the reasons for the PEP failures. Results The results from analysis of the large number of human rabies cases showed that rabies in China was largely under control during the period 1990 – 1996. However, there has been a large jump in the number of reported rabies cases since 2001 up to a new peak (with an incidence rate of 0. 20 per 100000 people) that was reached in 2004, and where the level has remained until present. Then, we analysed the PEP in 244 rabies cases collected in the Guangdong province in 2003 and 2004, and found that 67. 2 % of the patients did not seek medical services or did not receive any PEP. Further analysis of PEP for the 80 rabies patients who received any type of PEP indicated that almost all of the patients did not receive proper or timely treatment on the wounds or post-exposure vaccination or rabies immunoglobulins. Conclusion While the issue of under-reporting of rabies in previous years may well be a factor in the apparent upwards trend of human rabies in recent years, the analysis of PEP in the Guangdong province provides evidence that suggests that the failure to receive PEP was a major factor in the number of human cases in China. Thus, the data underline the need for greatly improved availability and timely application of high-quality <b>anti-rabies</b> biologicals, both <b>vaccines</b> and immunoglobulins, in the treatment of human bite victims. Controlling dog rabies through pet vaccination schemes may also play a huge role in reducing the rate of human exposure. Education of the public, health care staff and veterinarians will also help to change the current situation. </p...|$|R

The goals {{of the present study}} is to compare the NIH ("National Institute of Health") and the indirect ELISA tests to the Habel test and produce the National Reference Vaccine (VRN) experimentally, {{to be used in the}} NIH. Two hundred and ten 10 ts of vaccine have been tested by the NIH test parallel to the Habel testo The NIH test, following the limits 0, 9 UI; 0, 97 UI; 0, 98 UI; 1,OUI and 1, 1 UI approved, respectively, 77, 62 %; 75, 71 %; 75, 23 %; 73, 81 %; 71, 90 %, while the Habel test approved 82, 38 % ofthe 10 ts. The cut offvalue determined for the NIH was more than 0, 98 DI so 1, 0 UI is recomended as the official cut-offvalue. The indirect ELISA was applied in seras of mice immunized with 70 lots of vaccines with varied results in the Habel. The cut off values, the sensibility (8), the specificity (E), the predictable values for positive (VPRP) and negative (VPRN) results and the ratio between positive standard sera and no vaccinated mice sera were determined, so it was decided to adopt in this method the dilution of 1 / 400 that presents cut-off value of 0, 225; 8 = 97 %; E= 1 O 0 %; VPRP= 100 % and VPRN= 78 %. The National Reference Vaccine (VRN) was produced in BHK cells, C 13, with the Pasteur vírus (PV). The viral suspensions (5 !!!

40|$|Background The {{outbreak}} of rabies in human in Bali-Indonesia is causing an extraordinary pressure {{for the government}} in providing adequate doses of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Here, we directly compare the immune response and benefit of the intradermal (ID) protocol for rabies vaccine delivery with the intramuscular (IM) route. Methods: Sixty health workers {{who were willing to}} participate in this study have been randomly selected and grouped into ID, IM, and control groups, each with 20 volunteers. The Thai Red Cross ID- and Zangreb IM-protocols have been applied to the respective group. The sera of the volunteers were collected at day 0, week 1, week 3, week 4, month 3, month 6, month 9, and month 12 after the first vaccination. Anti-rabies virus IgG was detected using Platelia TM Rabies II Kit (Bio-Rad). Results: Anti-rabies IgG could be detected in the ID-group at one week. The ID-vaccine delivery induced a slightly higher maximum antibody titer compared to IM, though not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). ID vaccination caused less adverse reactions and produces longer lasting protective immune response.  Cost minimization analysis (CMA) on the provincial and national PEP data in 2009 - 2011 shows that the ID-delivery will reduce the total cost for a completed regimen by USD 28. 5, and would have saved the Indonesian government budget approximately USD 3. 6 and 4. 3 million for complete regimens in Bali and Indonesia, respectively. Conclusion: The ID administration of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> induces a similar immune response compared to that of intramuscular injection. It also produces longer lasting protective immune response. It offers additional advantages of potential net cost savings as well as decreasing the pressure on vaccine availability due to the high number of dog bite cases. </p...|$|E

A total of 683 persons (51. 1 % females, 73 % children) with animal- related bites were included in the retrospective, registry-based study. The most common site of exposure was the leg (66. 8 %). In children under 8 years of age the face was more often involved than in adults (9. 5 % vs. 4. 8 %; p= 0. 03). The main type of exposure was a bite with bleeding (66. 3 %) followed by contamination of mucous membranes with saliva (19. 7 %). The primary sources were dogs (93. 4 %) followed by cats (2. 6 %). Children under 15 years {{were more likely to be}} exposed to dogs (94. 9 %) than adults (88. 7 %) (p= 0. 01). The most common way of coming in contact with animals was ‘walking by’ (83. 9 %). Children came in contact with animals while ‘playing with’ (10. 7 %) more often than adults (1. 1 %) (p&amp;lt; 0. 001). All the patients received an anti-rabies nervous-tissue vaccine, 99 % of whom completed the vaccination course. Animal bites continue to be a problem in rural Ethiopia, mainly among children. Efforts to protect children against animal bites must be of paramount importance in preventing rabies in this population...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rabies, a {{viral disease}} that affects all warm-blooded animals, is {{widespread}} {{in many regions}} of the world. Human rabies, transmitted by dogs is an important public health issue in Ethiopia. To-date, effective rabies control program still remains to be a reality {{and needs to be}} strengthened [...] Objective: Reviewing of recorded data to generate information on the status of rabies in Ethiopia for the year 2001 - 2009. Methods: A retrospective data were used from the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute rabies case record book registered between 2001 and 2009. Results: The fatal human cases during the period of study were 386 humans with annual range of 35 to 58. The over all post exposure treatment for humans was 17, 204 within and around Addis Ababa. During the same period, 20, 414 suspected rabid animals were clinically examined; nevertheless, only 10 %were positive for rabies. Among 3, 460 animal brains investigated in the laboratory with FAT, 75 % were confirmed as rabies positive. The production and distribution of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> reached 130, 673 treatment doses for human vaccine and 85, 055 doses for animal vaccine respectively in the period of 2001 - 2009. Conclusion: The recorded data showed the underestimate of rabies diagnosis, post exposure prophylaxis and fatal human cases, which could be attributed due to the absence of national rabies surveillance system. Therefore, It is of paramount importance to assess and map the national picture of rabies within a given time interval to launch a national rabies control strategy. [Ethiop. J.

40|$|AbstractPrevention {{and control}} of rabies {{in the world will}} require {{international}} efforts to increase the availability and use of high quality cell-culture rabies vaccines for use in human and veterinary. An important aspect of activities to ensure such availability is transfer of technologies to developing countries for production of these vaccines. Methods for Rabies Virus manipulation have changed fundamentally from random attenuation to defined modifications. In 2001, WHO issued a resolution for the complete replacement of nerve tissue vaccines by 2006 with cell-culture rabies vaccines. However, sheep brain derived Fermi type rabies vaccine is still being manufactured and utilized for the majority of exposed patients in Ethiopia. Therefore, production of a safer and effective cell culture based <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> is needed. Currently the Ethiopian government has heavily invested in upgrading the facilities required to produce a rabies vaccine in keeping with WHO recommendation. Rabies virus suspensions were obtained from vero cells cultivated on roller bottles after infection with the Pasteur virus strain (PV) and Evelyn Rokitniki Abelseth (ERA). Initially the titer of the obtained virus and multiplicity of infection of the viruses had to be optimized; therefore in rabies virus infected cultures, higher virus yields was obtained when infected with 0. 001 ERA virus/cell and incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 96 hr and 0. 01 PV/cell incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 48 hr. Based on the results it is conclude that, ERA virus 0. 001 ID/cell with incubation period of 96 h and was selected as best titer for rabies vaccine production...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{costs to the}} state government of implementing different interventions for controlling rabies among the entire human and animal populations of Tamil Nadu. This built upon an earlier assessment of Tamil Nadu’s efforts to control rabies. Anti-rabies vaccines were made available at all health facilities. Costs were estimated for five different combinations of animal and human interventions using an activity-based costing approach from the provider perspective. Disease and population data were sourced from the state surveillance data, human census and livestock census. Program costs were extrapolated from official documents. All capital costs were depreciated to estimate annualized costs. All costs were inflated to 2012 Rupees. Sensitivity analysis was conducted across all major cost centres to assess their relative impact on program costs. It {{was found that the}} annual costs of providing <b>Anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> alone and in combination with Immunoglobulins was $ 0. 7 million (Rs 36 million) and $ 2. 2 million (Rs 119 million), respectively. For animal sector interventions, the annualised costs of rolling out surgical sterilisation-immunization, injectable immunization and oral immunizations were estimated to be $ 44 million (Rs 2, 350 million), $ 23 million (Rs 1, 230 million) and $ 11 million (Rs 590 million), respectively. Dog bite incidence, health systems coverage and cost of rabies biologicals were found to be important drivers of costs for human interventions. For the animal sector interventions, the size of dog catching team, dog population and vaccine costs were found to be driving the costs. Rabies control in Tamil Nadu seems a costly propositio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dog bites {{in humans}} are {{a public health}} problem worldwide. The issues of {{increasing}} stray dog populations, rabies outbreaks, {{and the risk of}} dogs biting humans have been frequently reported by the media in Bhutan. This study aimed to estimate the bite incidence and identify the risk factors for dog bites in humans, and to estimate human deaths from rabies in rabies endemic south Bhutan. Methods: A hospital-based questionnaire survey was conducted during 2009 – 2010 among dog bites victims who visited three hospitals in Bhutan for <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> injection. Decision tree modeling was used to estimate human deaths from rabies following dog bite injuries in two rabies endemic areas of south Bhutan. Results: Three hundred and twenty four dog bite victims were interviewed. The annual incidence of dog bites differed between the hospital catchment areas: 869. 8 (95 % CI: 722. 8 – 1022. 5), 293. 8 (240 – 358. 2) and 284. 8 (251. 2 – 323) per 100, 000 people in Gelephu, Phuentsholing and Thimphu, respectively. Males (62 %) were more at risk than females (P, 0. 001). Children aged 5 – 9 years were bitten more than other age groups. The majority of victims (71 %) were bitten by stray dogs. No direct fatal injury was reported. In two hospital areas (Gelephu and Phuentsholing) in south Bhutan the annual incidence of death from rabies was 3. 14 (95 % CI: 1. 57 – 6. 29) per 100, 000 population.

40|$|Rabies is a fatal {{disease that}} affects {{the central nervous system}} of all warmblooded mammals. The rabies virus belongs to the order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. This virus has a {{negative}} single-stranded RNA genome and the virions are bullet-shaped. Rabies is reported in many countries throughout the world and has been registered in all continents except Australia, where only the bat Lyssaviruses have been found, and in Antarctica where the main vectors of rabies are absent. Russia and most of the bordering countries are affected by rabies. Finland was a rabies-free country from 1959 to 1988, when a sylvatic rabies epidemic appeared with raccoon dogs as the main host and vector of infection. That epidemic was eradicated by the oral vaccination of wild carnivores and the parenteral immunization of dogs and cats; and Finland has been rabies-free since 1991. However, this status is constantly under threat because rabies is endemic in Russia and Estonia. In June 2003, a horse imported to Finland from Estonia was clinically and laboratory diagnosed as rabies positive. The close relationship of the isolated equine virus strain with the current Estonian strains was verified during subsequent molecular epidemiological studies. Because the case was imported, it did not affect Finland’s rabies-free status. Also in 2007 another 2 imported cases of rabies were recorded: one in a human being from Philippines and the other in a dog from India. Five different antigenic variants of the rabies virus were identified among rabies positive field samples from Russia, Finland, and Estonia by using antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies. Two rabies virus field isolates showed a different reaction pattern that was {{similar to that of the}} vaccine strains of the SAD group, which might suggest a new antigen variant or reverted vaccine strain. Nevertheless, the sequence analysis showed that the vaccine strains RV- 97 and SAD B 19 included in the oral <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> “Sinrab” (Russia) and “Fuchsoral” (Germany), respectively, differ considerably from all the field strains. Field rabies viruses collected in recent years from different regions of the Russian Federation were chosen on the basis of mAb studies and geographical origin for molecular epidemiological studies to characterize their genetic heterogeneity and to study their molecular epidemiology. In addition to the Russian viruses, archival samples from Estonia and Finland and Russian vaccine strains were also included in this study. Among the field viruses studied, two main phylogenetic groups were found, and designated as the Pan-Eurasian and Caucasian based on their geographical origin. The Pan-Eurasian 7 group including some reference viruses from Europe was further divided into four subgroups. All the vaccine strains were clearly different from the field strains. No recombination between the field and vaccine virus strains was observed. The critical roles of geographical isolation, the limitation of the genetic clustering, and the evolution of the rabies virus were shown during this study. The rabies virus vaccine strain RV- 97 is widely used in Russia as a component of the oral <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> “Sinrab”. To characterize the molecular properties of this strain, entire genome sequencing was conducted. A simple technique was developed to obtain this sequence, including the 3 ’- and 5 ’- ends. The entire genome sequence and deduced amino-acid sequences of the major viral proteins were compared with the sequences of other known fixed rabies viruses. The strain RV- 97 formed a separate phylogenetic branch and seems to be more related to the group of Japanese strains. The field strains from the Caucasian group seem to be phylogenetically the nearest group to the RV- 97 strain. The data shown herein makes it possible to develop molecular methods for distinguishing between the field rabies viruses from the vaccine strains for the rapid recognition of the vaccine strains that are unstable or have reverted back to their pathogenic form.

40|$|Malaria {{transmission}} is in decline {{in some parts}} of Africa, partly due to the scaling up of control measures. If the goal of elimination is to be achieved, additional control measures including an effective and durable vaccine will be required. Studies utilising the prime-boost approach to deliver viral vectors encoding the pre-erythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP (multiple epitope thrombospondin-related adhesion protein) have shown promising safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in sporozoite challenge studies. More recently, a study in Kenyan adults, similar to that reported here, showed substantial efficacy against P. falciparum infection. One hundred and twenty healthy male volunteers, living in a malaria endemic area of Senegal were randomised to receive either the Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd 63) ME-TRAP as prime vaccination, followed eight weeks later by modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) also encoding ME-TRAP as booster, or two doses of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> as a comparator. Prior to follow-up, antimalarials were administered to clear parasitaemia and then participants were monitored by PCR for malaria infection for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was time-to-infection with P. falciparum malaria, determined by two consecutive positive PCR results. Secondary endpoints included adverse event reporting, measures of cellular and humoral immunogenicity and a meta-analysis of combined vaccine efficacy with the parallel study in Kenyan adults. We show that this pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine is safe and induces significant immunogenicity, with a peak T-cell response at seven days after boosting of 932 Spot Forming Cells (SFC) / 106 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells(PBMC) compared to 57 SFC/ 106 PBMCs in the control group. However, a vaccine efficacy was not observed: 12 of 57 ME-TRAP vaccinees became PCR positive during the intensive monitoring period as compared to 13 of the 58 controls (P = 0. 80). This trial confirms that vaccine efficacy against malaria infection in adults may be rapidly assessed using this efficient and cost-effective clinical trial design. Further efficacy evaluation of this vectored candidate vaccine approach in other malaria transmission settings and age-de-escalation into the main target age groups for a malaria vaccine is in progress...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Pre-clinical {{toxicology}} {{evaluation of}} biotechnology products {{is a challenge}} to the toxicologist. The present investigation is an attempt to evaluate the safety profile of the first indigenously developed recombinant DNA <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> DRV (100 mu g) ] and combination rabies vaccine CRV (100 mu g DRV and 1. 25 IU of cell culture-derived inactivated rabies virus vaccine) ], which are intended for clinical use by intramuscular route in Rhesus monkeys. Methods: As per the regulatory requirements, the study was designed for acute (single dose - 14 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose - 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose - 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels, viz. therapeutic, average (2 x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in monkeys. The selection of the model i. e. monkey was based on affinity and rapid higher antibody response during the efficacy studies. An attempt was made to evaluate all parameters which included physical, physiological, clinical, haematological and histopathological profiles of all target organs, as well as Tiers I, II, III immunotoxicity parameters. Results: In acute toxicity there was no mortality in spite of exposing the monkeys to 10 XDRV. In sub chronic and chronic toxicity studies there were no abnormalities in physical, physiological, neurological, clinical parameters, after administration of test compound in intended and 10 times of clinical dosage schedule of DRV and CRV under the experimental conditions. Clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights and histopathology studies were essentially unremarkable except the presence of residual DNA in femtogram level at site of injection in animal which received 10 X DRV in chronic toxicity study. No Observational Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) of DRV is 1000 ug/dose (10 times of therapeutic dose) if administered on 0, 4, 7, 14, 28 th day. Interpretation & conclusions: The information generated by this study not only draws attention to the need for national and international regulatory agencies in formulating guidelines for pre-clinical safety evaluation of biotech products but also facilitates the development of biopharmaceuticals as safe potential therapeutic agents...|$|E
40|$|Rabies is a vaccine-preventable viral {{zoonosis}} {{belonging to}} the group of neglected tropical diseases. Exposure to a rabid animal may result in a fatal acute encephalitis if effective post-exposure prophylaxis is not provided. Rabies occurs worldwide, but its burden is disproportionately high in developing countries, including Nepal. We aimed to summarize current knowledge on the epidemiology, impact and control of rabies in Nepal. We performed a systematic review of international and national scientific literature and searched grey literature through the World Health Organization Digital Library and the library of the National Zoonoses and Food Hygiene Research Centre, Nepal, and through searching Google and Google Scholar. Further data on animal and human rabies were obtained from the relevant Nepalese government agencies. Finally, we surveyed the archives of a Nepalese daily to obtain qualitative information on rabies in Nepal. So far, only little original research has been conducted on the epidemiology and impact of rabies in Nepal. Per year, rabies is reported to kill about 100 livestock and 10 - 100 humans, while about 1, 000 livestock and 35, 000 humans are reported to receive rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. However, these estimates are very likely to be serious underestimations of the true rabies burden. Significant {{progress has been made in}} the production of cell culture-based <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> and rabies immunoglobulin, but availability and supply remain a matter of concern, especially in remote areas. Different state and non-state actors have initiated rabies control activities over the years, but efforts typically remained focalized, of short duration and not harmonized. Communication and coordination between veterinary and human health authorities is limited at present, further complicating rabies control in Nepal. Important research gaps include the reporting biases for both human and animal rabies, the ecology of stray dog populations and the true contribution of the sylvatic cycle. Better data are needed to unravel the true burden of animal and human rabies. More collaboration, both within the country and within the region, is needed to control rabies. To achieve these goals, high level political commitment is essential. We therefore propose to make rabies the model zoonosis for successful control in Nepal...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rabies is {{an acute}} {{encephalitis}} that causes more than 60, 000 deaths worldwide. The {{only way to}} save individuals bitten by a rabies-infected animal is the timely use of effective vaccines. Treatment with new generation vaccines is expensive. Therefore, there is a global movement towards the production of less expensive vaccines which retain and improve upon the quality and effectiveness of the vaccine. Production and evaluation of non-classical vaccines {{is one of the}} approaches taken in this regard. In this study, we describe a new eukaryotic expression system to express the nucleoprotein N gene of rabies virus which, if suitable, may be evaluated for <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> production. Methods: The complete sequence of the N gene of rabies virus PV subtype was amplified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pCDNA 3. 1 (+) vector. The cloned gene was excised from the vector by restriction enzyme digestion and sequenced. Due to mutations detected in the N gene, the gene coding sequence was purchased as a recombinant pGH/N vector. Vector pGH/N was amplified and following enzymatic digestion, the excised N gene was once again cloned into vector pCDNA 3. 1 (+). Successful cloning was confirmed using restriction digests and quick check. The recombinant vector pCDNA 3. 1 (+) /N was transformed into cultured BSR cells and protein N expression was analyzed using fluorescent antibody test (FAT). Results: Electrophoresis confirmed amplification of the nucleoprotein N gene and subsequent restriction enzyme digestion showed that the N gene had been successfully cloned into the recombinant pCDNA 3. 1 (+) /N vector. However, DNA sequencing revealed the presence of mutations within the N gene. Restriction digest of the commercial pGH/N vector showed that the N gene had been excised from the vector. Successful cloning of the N gene into the pCDNA 3. 1 (+) expression vector was confirmed using restriction digests and quick check. Protein expression in BSR cells was assayed by immunostaining with anti-ribonucleocapsid FITC-conjugated antibody and visually confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Conclusion: This study showed that the protein N of rabies virus subtype PV can be expressed in a eukaryotic expression system using the pCDNA 3. 1 (+) expression vector...|$|E
