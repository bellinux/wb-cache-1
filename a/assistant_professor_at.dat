Developed versions of some of the thesis's chapters were later published as chapters 2, 3 and 4 Varner's first book, In Nature's Interests?. His doctoral research was supervised by Jon Morline, who continued as a supervisor even after leaving Madison to work at St. Olaf College. Graduating from Madison in 1988, Varner had a number of short-term jobs in the late 1980s; he lectured in philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point from 1987 to 1988, acted as a visiting <b>assistant</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Madison's Institute of Environmental Studies in the Summer of 1988, and took up the same role, this time in philosophy, at Washington University in St. Louis from 1988 to 1990.|$|E

Ross moved back to Chicago and led the mathematics department at an experimental school started by Ph.D.s during the Great Depression, People's Junior College, where he also taught physics. Ross became an <b>assistant</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> St. Louis University in 1935 and stayed for about 11 years. In an interview, he said he advocated for a student who became the first black woman in the South to receive a master's degree in mathematics. This exception led the university to admit black students despite the idea's widespread unpopularity. During World War II, Ross served as a research mathematician for the U.S. Navy. He befriended Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő while in St. Louis, who recommended Ross for a 1941 Brown University summer school that prepared young scientists to assist in the war, a program Ross attended. He occasionally worked on proximity fuzes for Stromberg-Carlson's laboratory from 1941 to 1945 before accepting a position as head of University of Notre Dame's mathematics department in 1946. He set out to change the school's research climate by inviting distinguished mathematicians including Paul Erdős, whom Ross made a full professor.|$|E
5|$|Struggling {{to fit in}} at Howard, {{unable to}} make tenure, and with {{concerns}} about the increasing crime rates in Washington, in 1977 the family decided to move once again, this time to Athens, Georgia. Shortly after the move Jarrell became an <b>assistant</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Georgia. He and his wife started a high-end educational toy company that stemmed from their children's love for similar toys when living in Washington, D.C.. They opened a small shop called Tadpole Toys and Hobby Center in Athens to great reception. However, {{as a result of}} poor sales in May1982 they were forced to close it. Soon afterwards, Jarrell received tenure at the University. In 1988, he retired from his position and from teaching as a whole in order to focus on his creative work. By 1994 all three children were grown; the two daughters attended the Art Institute of Chicago, and Wadsworth Jr. became a seafarer. That year, Jae and daughter Jennifer moved to New York {{to find a place to}} live, settling in SoHo, where they were joined by Jarrell a few months later. Currently, Jarrell and Jae live and work in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
