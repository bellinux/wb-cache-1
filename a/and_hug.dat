25|$|Branching off HS1, {{it would}} briefly follow the WCML and GWML, {{branching}} {{off at the}} connection with the Central line, going to Northolt Junction, where it will follow the Chiltern Main Line and have a triangular junction serving a branch to Heathrow. The line will be tunnelled at Chiltern stations, up till Princes Risborough, where it will incorporate itself with the intercity line, up to Banbury, where it will branch off <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> the M40 and M42, before joining the Birmingham Loop, at Birmingham International/NEC. Links to Milton Keynes and Oxford via the Varsity Line, and Banbury {{in the middle of}} the Line, would experience a growth in services. Local services on Chiltern, WCML south of Rugby, and Banbury–Coventry–Birmingham could be intensified.|$|E
25|$|With Peter I also on board, {{as well as}} many {{distinguished}} noblemen and knights, the Castilian fleet {{set sail}} from Seville in April. Traversing the coast of Valencia and forcing the surrender of the Castle of Guardamar, it appeared before Barcelona on June 9. The king, Peter IV of Aragon and III of Barcelona, who was present at the city, organized the defense, together with the counts, Bernat III of Cabrera <b>and</b> <b>Hug</b> II of Cardona. The Catalans disposed of ten galleys, a nau, and several small craft garrisoned by companies of crossbowmen, besides a line of siege weapons. Despite its inferior size, the fleet managed to repulse the Castilian attacks in a two-day battle that saw the first use of naval artillery: a bombard was mounted aboard the Catalan nau and her shots heavily damaged one of the biggest naus of Peter I.|$|E

500|$|On September 11, 2017, {{the sixteenth}} {{anniversary of the}} crash, Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the memorial, to a {{gathering}} of relatives {{and friends of the}} victims. [...] Pence, a member of Congress on the date of the crash, stated that the victims may have saved his life. [...] Learning that the Capitol was a possible target of the hijacked plane and only 12 minutes away by air, he said, [...] "It was the longest 12 minutes of my life... Without regard to personal safety, they [...] rushed forward to save lives... I will always believe that I and many others in our nation's capital were able to go home that day <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> our families because of the courage and sacrifice of the heroes of Flight 93." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{expansion}} of the holodeck technology also received negative critical feedback. National Reviews Jonah Goldberg wrote that the frequent use of the holodeck was [...] "an outrage, seemingly conceived for actors and costume designers to indulge themselves at the audience's expense". Nowalk described the various appearances of the holodeck in Voyager as representing how the writers were [...] "fascinated with, concerned by, and curious about virtual reality {{in the early days}} of the Internet". Murray expanded on theoretical physicist Lawrence M. Krauss' determination that creating tactile simulations through the holodeck is an example of unrealistic technology to write that Janeway would have been unable to drink tea <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> Lord Burleigh in reality. Green was critical of how the holodeck technology was written as a means for [...] "personal gratification" [...] rather than as a space to further develop a skill or hobby.|$|E
500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer <b>and</b> <b>hug.</b> You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E

500|$|Walker {{released}} his twenty-third single, [...] "Say No More", for Giant in early 2001. It {{was the first}} single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write [...] "If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's [...] "La Bamba." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that [...] "the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it {{makes you want to}} run right out <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> the one you love." [...] Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being [...] "full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés." ...|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive.

2500|$|On March 26, 2012, Richie {{released}} his tenth studio album, Tuskegee.

2500|$|In 1896, Edwardes engaged Wright {{for regular}} {{work in his}} musical comedies at Daly's Theatre in London. [...] According to The Times, [...] "it is on that 10 years' {{engagement}} at Daly's, from 1896 to 1905, that the memories of his many devoted admirers most fondly dwell." [...] Wright performed and created characters in many of Edwardes's most famous musical comedies, including: The Geisha (1896, as Wun-Hi), A Greek Slave (1898, as Heliodorus), San Toy (1899, as Li), A Country Girl (1902, as Barry), The Cingalee (1904, as Chambhuddy Ram), The Little Michus (1905, as Bagnolet) and See-See (1906, as Hang-Kee). The Times also said of this period of his career, [...] "those who remember the neat, perky, birdlike little man in these musical comedies, with his precise diction and his finished movements, will quote to each other his drolleries, <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> his memory in unashamed, selfish, and inexhaustible enjoyment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theatre {{writer and}} {{historian}} John Kenrick wrote, [...] "the {{bad news is}} that this Follies is a dramatic and conceptual failure.

Marge Champion and Donald Saddler are endearing as the old hoofers. ... I dare you not {{to fall in love with}} Betty Garrett's understated [...] "Broadway Baby" [...] – you just want to pick her up <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> her. Polly Bergen stops everything cold with [...] "I’m Still Here," [...] bringing a rare degree of introspection to a song that is too often a mere belt-fest.... he emotional highpoint comes when Joan Roberts sings 'One More Kiss'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1957, when Bosworth's family {{thought it}} was his time to go, Branham visited his bedside, prayed with him, and was greatly {{encouraged}} by his testimony. [...] Bosworth recovered his strength {{and it was not}} until several months later, in 1958, when he eventually died, again with an outstanding testimony. [...] According to his son's description in the 9th edition of [...] "Christ the Healer", the family was gathered around Bosworth's bedside talking, laughing, and singing about three weeks after Bosworth was in bed full-time, [...] Bosworth then looked up, never saw the family members present, and began [...] "to greet <b>and</b> <b>hug</b> people - he was enraptured ... He did this for several hours", then with {{a smile on his face}} he laid back and went to sleep. [...] When Bosworth died, Branham was asked by the family to come to preach his funeral but was unable to attend because he was in the middle of a campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The {{naval forces}} {{gathered}} {{at the port of}} Barcelona consisted of ten well-armed galleys, several sailing ships and a very large vessel following the appearance of Peter I in the city. The forces were under the command of the generals, Bernat III of Cabrera <b>and</b> <b>Hug</b> II of Cardona, with Bernat and Gilabert de Cruilles, Bernat Margarit, and Pere Asbert as captains. The king, Peter of Aragon, took the command of the fleet and detached the galleys in a line along the beach, with the huge nau in middle of the line. All the vessels were covered by a shoal known as [...] "Las Tascas", which stretched from just before the Convent of Sant Nicolau de Bari to the road of Regomir. Four machines named brigoles were installed near the shores to give additional coverage to the ships, which were reinforced by many companies of crossbowmen who had come from the Vallès under the command of several knights including Ramón de Pujol, Ramón and Bernat Planella, Bernat de Perapetusa, Ramón Berenguer de Vilafranca and Humbert de Ballestar. Armed parties of Barcelona's civilians organized according to their office were also divided along the perimeter to support the fleet.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{full and}} clear {{knowledge}} of {{the circumstances under which}} the Peshitta was produced and came into circulation. Whereas the authorship of the Latin Vulgate has never been in dispute, almost every assertion regarding the authorship of the Peshitta and its time and place of its origin, is subject to question. The chief ground of analogy between the Vulgate and the Peshitta is that both came into existence {{as the result of a}} revision. This, indeed, has been strenuously denied, but since Hort maintained this view in his Introduction to New Testament in the Original Greek, following Griesbach <b>and</b> <b>Hug</b> at the beginning of the 19th century, it has gained many adherents. As far as the New Testament writings are concerned, there is evidence, aided and increased by recent discoveries, for the view that the Peshitta represents a revision, and fresh investigation in the field of Syriac scholarship has raised it to a high degree of probability. The very designation, [...] "Peshito," [...] has given rise to dispute. It has been applied to the Syriac as the version in common use, and regarded as equivalent to the Greek [...] "koiné"(κοινἠ) and the Latin [...] "Vulgate" [...] (Vulgata).|$|E
