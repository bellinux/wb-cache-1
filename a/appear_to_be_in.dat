5|$|Myrmecia {{contains}} {{a total of}} nine species groups. Originally, seven species groups were established in 1911, but this was raised to 13 in 1951; Promyrmecia had a total of eight while Myrmecia only had five. M. maxima does not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a species group, as no type specimen is available.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{mountains}} <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> some {{stage of}} degradation. Large landslide deposits are common {{at the base}} of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation. Scalloped margins are common among Io's mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.|$|E
5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} Local Group has an associated group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether {{it would be possible to}} age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> her 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, the United States Government {{intended}} {{to present a}} set of then-current US coins to four Asian rulers the US had either made agreements with or else hoped to treat with. Neither the silver dollar nor the eagle had been struck since 1804, {{but they were still}} considered current coins. Putting the date of striking on the pieces would make them <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> violation of Jefferson's prohibition which remained in force. Mint Director Moore decided to strike 1804-dated dollars and eagles for the sets, and four 1804 eagles were struck. They differ from the pieces struck thirty years earlier, lacking a crosslet {{on the right side of}} the crossbar of the 4. Two were presented, to the Sultan of Muscat and the King of Siam, before the diplomat in charge of the expedition, Edmund Roberts, died of disease in Macao, and his mission was abandoned. The remaining two sets were returned to the United States.|$|E

25|$|This new realism is {{especially}} evident in Unkei's non-Buddha statuary. His Kongō Rikishi guardians stand contrapposto with dramatic stances. Their musculature, though anatomically incorrect, is well detailed, making them <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> mid-movement. These Niō reflect the warrior lifestyle and samurai ideals to which Unkei was exposed in Kamakura.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, Tassel and Sash figures {{appear to}} be {{involved}} in either dancing, ecstatic behaviour, or both which, {{according to a study by}} Michaelson et al., may represent shamanistic rituals or creation ceremonies.

25|$|Facial nerve paralysis* is most {{commonly}} caused in dogs by trauma, otitis media, {{or as an}} idiopathic condition.

25|$|Ultimately {{paralysis}} {{becomes so}} severe that an animal is unable to stand or even lift its head. The breathing becomes slow, exaggerated and gasping. A foul odor on the breath can signal aspiration pneumonia. Although pain is not regarded as being a feature of tick paralysis animals would <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> severe distress. Finally, the mucous membranes develop a bluish hue (cyanosis) and a state of coma indicates that death is imminent.|$|E
25|$|A {{large scale}} study in 2008 {{provided}} {{strong evidence that}} ITQ's can help to prevent fishery collapse and even restore fisheries that <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> decline. Other studies have shown negative socio-economic consequences of ITQs, especially on small-sclale fisheries. These consequences include concentration of quota in that hands of few fishers; increased number of inactive fishers leasing their quotas to others (a phenomenon known as armchair fishermen); and detrimental effects on coastal communities.|$|E

25|$|When young, {{the common}} stingaree preys {{almost entirely on}} shrimp; as it matures it comes to feed {{predominantly}} on polychaete worms. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females usually bear two pups at a time. The common stingaree contributes substantially to the bycatch of commercial trawl and other fisheries within its range, and is also caught regularly by recreational fishers. It survives capture fairly well, but tends to abort any gestating young; it may also suffer persecution by fishery workers. Nevertheless, the common stingaree population does not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> decline, and thus it has been listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
25|$|Two crewmen <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a zombie-like state, {{generating}} copious {{amounts of}} water. One of Adelaide's team gets infected, and they quarantine her while sealing off the biodome. From observation, they {{discover that the}} infection is by the intelligent virus, the Flood, and now seeks to get to Earth. The Doctor suspects the Flood were sealed in the glacier the base was using for water by the Ice Warriors aeons ago, and a bad filter allowed the virus to infect the crew. Adelaide realises the remaining crew have not yet touched that source of water and are uninfected, and orders the crew to evacuate to their rocket back to Earth while setting the base to self-destruct. Before departing, the Doctor is forced to explain to Adelaide what he knows happens and why he cannot get involved.|$|E
