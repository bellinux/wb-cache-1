Intravenous <b>adrenolytic</b> potency was determined in cats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and prepared to record carotid blood pressure by means of a mercury manometer. One hour after injection of the <b>adrenolytic</b> agent into a femoral vein, the degree of blockade was determined by successive administration of four standard doses of 12. 5, 50. 0 and 500 microgm. total and 1000 microgm. per kgm. of body weight of epinephrine intravenously. The blood pressure was allowed to return to normal or stabilize at a new level between each injection.

RNA isolated from cultures treated for 48 and 72 h was subjected to Agilent 4 × 44 K microarray platforms. Microarray results were validated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Results: Altogether, 117 significantly differentially expressed genes were detected at 48 h and 72 h (p < 0. 05) in mitotane-treated samples relative to controls. Three significantly underexpressed genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis (HSD 3 B 1, HSD 3 B 2 and CYP 21 A 2) and four significantly overexpressed genes (GDF 15, ALDH 1 L 2, TRIB 3 and SERPINE 2) have been validated.

Later chemical purification of the crude drug resulted in the isolation of five alkaloids: ergot-amine (2), ergobasine (3), ergokryptine, ergocor-nine and ergocristine (4).

The rats' differential responses to alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic drugs injected into different hypothalamic sites indicate the following: (1) the lateral hypothalamic „feeding” center contains beta receptors, the activation of which produces satiation, presumably by inhibition of the lateral „feeding” cells; (2) the ventromedial hypothalamic „satiety” center contains alpha receptors, the activation of which produces eating, presumably by inhibition of the ventromedial „satiety” cells; and (3) the medio-lateral perifornical area of the hypothalamus contains both alpha and beta receptors, which lead to inhibition of the ventromedial or lateral hypothalamic centers respectively. It is suggested that the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus are connected by reciprocal circuits, so that activation of the ventromedial center results in stimulation of the lateral beta receptors which inhibit the lateral „feeding” cells, and activation of the lateral center results in stimulation of the ventromedial alpha receptors which inhibit the ventromedial „satiety” cells...|$|E

The The prognosis in ACC relates to tumour stage (Icard et al. 2001, Abiven et al. 2006) and certain histopathological features, e. g. high mitotic count (O 20 mitoses per 50 high-power fields; Weiss et al. 1989). According to the Mac Farlane staging (Mac Farlane 1958) modified by Sullivan et al. (1978), the low stages (I and II) represent small (! 5 cm) or large (O 5 cm) resection (Icard et al. 1992, Bellantone et al. 1997, Schulick & Brennan 1999). Adjuvant treatment with the <b>adrenolytic</b> drug mitotane (o,p 0 -DDD), which blocks etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin (EDP-regimen) versus streptozotocin is currently under investigation for palliative purposes in the FIRM-ACT stud...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on chloralose anaesthetized cats. A 2 -cm segment of the proximal duodenum was isolated between two luminally situated balloons and perfused with isotonic saline containing [14 C]-PEG 4000 as a non-absorbable marker. The perfusate was analysed with regard to alkalinity (back titration) and concentration of marker (liquid scintillation). Net alkalinization and net fluid transport were calculated with conventional equations. Motor activity in the duodenal wall was recorded as changes in volume of the proximal balloon. In presence of sympathetic neural activity (spontaneous or electrically stimulated) basal motor activity and mucosal alkaline secretion was low and increased minimally in response to luminal HCl (30 mM). Net fluid transport was in an absorptive state and shifted to a small secretion upon the acid-exposure. Subsequent to bilateral acute splanchnicotomy, or {{the administration of the}} <b>adrenolytic</b> guanethidine (3 - 4 mg kg- 1, i. v.), spontaneous duodenal contractions occurred and the alkaline secretion was increased. Furthermore, both parameters were then markedly stimulated by luminal perfusion with 30 mM HCl. Basal net fluid transport was zero and turned into secretion upon the acid-exposure. No morphological changes of the duodenal surface epithelium could be detected. The study demonstrates the existence of splanchnic nerve-mediated, adrenergic inhibition of basal, as well as of acid-induced duodenal motility, fluid and alkaline secretion...|$|E
40|$|Ectopic adrenocorticotropin {{secretion}} (EAS) {{accounts for}} 10 - 15 % {{of cases of}} Cushing's syndrome and comprises a spectrum of tumours from undetectable isolated lesions to widespread metastatic and aggressive malignancies. EAS {{is often associated with}} severe hypercortisolaemia causing hypokalaemia, diabetes, generalized infections, hypertension and psychotic reactions. Surgical resection of the primary lesion, achievable with a curative intent in about 40 % of patients with EAS, is associated with complete remission in up to 80 % of such cases. It is therefore mandatory to localize the source of ectopic ACTH hypersecretion in order to stage the disease and adopt optimal treatment modalities. Modern cross-sectional imaging techniques can identify the majority of the ACTH secreting lesions, either initially or at follow-up reassessment. However, in approximately 10 - 20 % of patients with EAS, the source of ACTH hypersecretion remains occult in spite of extensive investigation and prolonged followup. In such cases, control of the hypercortisolemia can be achieved with long-term <b>adrenolytic</b> medication. When conditions require a prompt and definitive resolution of the hypercortisolaemia (i. e. as in pregnancy), bilateral adrenalectomy remains an alternative option. This review focuses on the clinical features, diagnostic pitfalls, management and long-term followup of the EAS based on the extensive experience of major referral centres...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{therapy for}} Cushing's disease (CD) is {{currently}} based on agents mainly targeting adrenocortical function. Lately, pituitary-directed drugs have been developed, with limited efficacy. Mitotane, a potent <b>adrenolytic</b> drug, has been recently investigated {{for the treatment}} of CD, but the direct pituitary effects have not been clarified so far. The aim of our study was to investigate whether mitotane may affect corticotroph function and cell survival in the mouse pituitary cell line AtT 20 /D 16 v-F 2 and in the primary cultures of human ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas, as an in vitro model of pituitary corticotrophs. We found that in the AtT 20 /D 16 v-F 2 cell line and in primary cultures, mitotane reduces cell viability by inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis and reduces ACTH secretion. In the AtT 20 /D 16 v-F 2 cell line, mitotane reduces Pomc expression and blocks the stimulatory effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone on cell viability, ACTH secretion, and Pomc expression. These effects were apparent at mitotane doses greater than those usually necessary for reducing cortisol secretion in Cushing's syndrome, but still in the therapeutic window for adrenocortical carcinoma treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that mitotane affects cell viability and function of human and mouse ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma cells. These data indicate that mitotane could have direct pituitary effects on corticotroph cells...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A 24 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a 12. 5 kg weight gain over 6 months (mostly abdominal), hirsutism, acne, ankle edema, polydipsia, nocturia, back pain, pigmentation, poor libido and lightened menses to our hospital in May 1986. She had been treated for the previous 2 years with furosemide and spironolactone for peripheral edema, and had stopped the combined oral contraceptive 2 months previously. She did not take tobacco, recreational drugs or alcohol. Upon physical examination she was grossly Cushingoid with florid clinical manifestations. INVESTIGATIONS: Serum potassium and bicarbonate, circadian rhythm of cortisol, low-dose and high-dose dexamethasone suppression tests, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticotropin releasing-hormone stimulation test, CT scan of the pituitary, plain chest radiology, CT scan of the chest and abdomen, trans-sphenoidal pituitary biopsy and histology, CT scan and MRI of the thorax, MRI of the pituitary, octreotide scintigraphy, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, gut peptides, tumor markers, urine 5 -hydroxyl-indole-acetic acid, resection, histology, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. DIAGNOSIS: Occult ectopic ACTH syndrome from a presumed appendiceal neuroendocrine tumor. The tumor was only identified some 20 years from initial presentation. MANAGEMENT: <b>Adrenolytic</b> therapy before bilateral adrenalectomy to cure Cushing's syndrome, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy, and then repeated surveillance over 20 years to locate the ectopic source of ACTH. This was finally identified by CT scan and excised at laparotomy...|$|E
