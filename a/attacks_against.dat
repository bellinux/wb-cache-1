From the frontier area with Syria, they staged hit-and-run <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> French forces. With 100 of his fighters, al-Sa'dun entered Jabal Zawiya in the summer of 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance.

5|$|In some areas, {{systematic}} <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> tribespeople {{in or near}} mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between {{natives and}} settlers.Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities. Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that {{there were times when}} miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Native populations, at times tribes or villages not involved in the original act. During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.|$|E

Newsom received 41.9 {{percent of the vote}} to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6 {{in the first round of}} balloting, but he faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff when many of the city's liberal groups coalesced around Gonzalez. The race was partisan with <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election and <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt that they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National figures from the Democratic Party, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned on Newsom's behalf.
