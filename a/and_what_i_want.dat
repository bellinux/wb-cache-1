Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{described}} the album {{as being a}} [...] "soul-satisfying project that won't pay the bills". It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to let people know is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there.

2500|$|Boros {{preferred}} {{to refer to}} himself an advocate of base running: [...] "I've always been a strong advocate of base running, not necessarily base stealing, but base running. Because ultimately, you win because you score more runs, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> is to be 90-feet smarter and 90-feet more aggressive than the other team." [...] Always {{a student of the}} game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986. In an interview that year, Boros said: [...] "The science against stealing has evolved radically in {{the last four or five}} years. That has made it tougher than ever to steal. Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick pitch, hold the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often. Now you've got pitching coaches with stopwatches timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base." ...|$|E
