5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E

5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E

40|$|In 2009, a {{commercial}} airplane crashed near Amsterdam. This longitudinal study aims to investigate (1) {{the proportion of}} survivors of the airplane crash showing a probable posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) or depressive disorder, and (2) whether symptoms of PTSD and depression were predicted by trauma characteristics. Identifying these trauma characteristics is crucial for early detection and treatment. Of the 121 adult survivors, 82 {{participated in this study}} 2 months after the crash and 76 participated 9 months after the crash. <b>Risk</b> <b>for</b> PTSD and depression was measured with the self-report instruments Trauma Screening Questionnaire and Patient Health Questionnaire- 2. Trauma characteristics assessed were Injury Severity Score (ISS), hospitalisation, length of hospital stay, and seating position in the plane. Two months after the crash, 32 participants (of N = 70, 46 %) <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> PTSD and 28 (of N = 80, 32 %) <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression. Nine months after the crash, 35 participants (of N = 75, 47 %) <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> PTSD and 24 (of N = 76, 35 %) <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression. There <b>was</b> a moderate correlation between length of hospital stay and symptoms of PTSD and depression 9 months after the crash (r =. 33 and r =. 45, respectively). There were no differences in seating position between participants <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> vs. participants <b>at</b> low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> PTSD or depression. Mixed design ANOVAs showed also no association between the course of symptoms of PTSD and depression 2 and 9 months after the crash and ISS or hospitalisation. This suggests that health care providers need to be aware that survivors may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> PTSD or depression, regardless of the objective severity of their physical injuries...|$|R
