5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests such <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed {{weaknesses of the}} Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Greek mathematicians {{calculated}} {{not with}} quantities and equations <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> today, but instead they used proportionalities {{to express the}} relationship between quantities.

Statistical mechanics fills this disconnection between the laws of mechanics and the practical experience of incomplete knowledge, by adding some uncertainty about which state the system is in.|$|E

25|$|All Roman cities had {{at least}} one Thermae, a popular {{facility}} for public bathing, exercising and socializing. Exercise might include wrestling and weight-lifting, as well as swimming. Bathing was {{an important part of the}} Roman day, where some hours might be spent, at a very low cost subsidized by the government. Wealthier Romans were often accompanied by one or more slaves, who performed any required tasks such as fetching refreshment, guarding valuables, providing towels, and at the end of the session, applying olive oil to their masters' bodies which was then scraped off with a strigil, a scraper made of wood or bone. Romans did not wash with soap and water <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> now.|$|E
25|$|We have {{mentioned}} that natural selection has not played its part {{for a long}} while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved {{through the efforts of}} hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} {{the nature of the}} Tarquinian hegemony over the Latins, we cannot tell how the terms of the Cassian treaty {{differed}} from those imposed by the Tarquins. But it is likely that Tarquin rule was more onerous, involving the payment of tribute, while the Republican terms simply involved a military alliance. The impetus to form such an alliance was probably provided by the acute insecurity caused by a phase of migration and invasion of the lowland areas by Italic mountain tribes in the period after 500 BC. The Sabines, Aequi and Volsci neighbours of Latium assailed the Latins, the Samnites invaded and subjugated the Greco-Etruscan cities of Campania, while the Messapii, Lucani and Bruttii in the South attacked the Greek coastal cities, crippling Tarentum and reducing the independent Greek cities on the Tyrrhenian coast to just Neapolis and Velia.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, as long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not detect and come to know other forms {{of life in the}} galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E

"Jesus, Friend of Sinners" [...] "admonishes the Christian {{church to}} show compassion" [...] and [...] "laments {{how the world}} knows many Christ {{followers}} more by what they are against than what they are for".

500|$|While {{there is}} no direct {{evidence}} for Tyrannosaurus rex having had feathers, many scientists now consider it likely that T.rex had feathers on at least parts of its body, due to their presence in related species. Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History summarized the balance of evidence by stating that: [...] "we have as much evidence that T.rex was feathered, at least during some stage of its life, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that australopithecines like Lucy had hair." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} of osteo- and chondrogenic cells from periosteum in callus formation following long-bone fractures {{has been previously}} demonstrated [11]. Periosteum can drive direct expansion of the original cortical bone without a fibrocartilaginous intermediate stage. We believe this was the mechanism of healing in our model, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not see a fibrocartilage core in histology. Endochondral ossification cannot be entirely ruled out, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not examine healing earlier than 2  weeks postfracture.|$|R

[...] He enjoyed the way the show {{presented}} the story as one wherein, [...] "we spend as much time watching Mulder from the outside <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> seeing events from his perspective," [...] because it [...] "makes things interesting." [...] Handlen also wrote that while the episode did not hit the emotional notes that its predecessor, [...] "Deadalive", did, it was nonetheless [...] "stronger plotwise" [...] and built to an [...] "inevitable conclusion in classic X-Files style".|$|E
500|$|The episode's premise {{was based}} on an extinct type of beetle, which caused trouble for guest actor Kirk Acevedo, as he had a fear of bugs.

But he was game and heroic despite. He conquered his fears, which was awesome". Upon discovering her character Fauxlivia would be pregnant, Wyman described Anna Torv's reaction, [...] "She was up for it! All our cast has such a terrific attitude.

500|$|On August 1, 1895, {{the first}} part of The Woman's Bible was published, {{covering}} the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The text went through seven printings in six months; it was a best-seller. In January 1898, the second part was published, covering the rest of the Old Testament as well as all of the New Testament. It included a Preface written by Stanton in which she acknowledged that [...] "Both friend and foe object to the title." [...] Nevertheless, she praised the Revising Committee for showing [...] "a more worshipful reverence for the great Spirit of All Good than does the Church." [...] Stanton wrote: [...] "We have made a fetich [...] of the Bible long enough.

500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But {{it is also clear that}} a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Elgar was in poor health. His wife {{thought it}} best for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, but <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type." ...|$|E
500|$|The Romanian writer {{also spent}} the Dada period issuing {{a long series}} of manifestos, which were often {{authored}} as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by [...] "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected [...] "the language of a sophisticated savage". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for [...] "compress what we think and feel", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre [...] "suited Tzara perfectly." [...] Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: [...] "Dada means nothing", adding [...] "Thought is produced in the mouth." [...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that [...] "as long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society." ...|$|E
