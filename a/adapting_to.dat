50|$|Usually, null tetrads <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> spacetime {{properties}} are employed {{to achieve the}} most succinct NP descriptions. For example, a null tetrad can be <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> principal null directions once the Petrov type is known; also, at some typical boundary regions such as null infinity, timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, black hole horizons and cosmological horizons, tetrads can be <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> boundary structures. Similarly, a preferred tetrad <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> on-horizon geometric behaviors is employed in the literature to further investigate NEHs.|$|R
5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|The THSR 700T {{trainset}} {{is based}} on the 700 Series Shinkansen trainset used by JR Central and JR West in Japan. This marked the first time Shinkansen technology was exported to a foreign country. Customization was focused on <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> Taiwan's climate and geography, and the nose shape was optimized for tunnels wider than those in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Ape Escape {{is played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{use a variety}} of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, {{traversing}} across several environments. The game's controls are heavily centred around the analog sticks, being the first game to require the use of the PlayStation's DualShock. Development of Ape Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> the use of the controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|His {{performances}} merited {{inclusion in}} the national team and {{attracted the attention of}} Liverpool's manager Graeme Souness, who bought Bjørnebye for £600,000 less than one year after moving to Rosenborg. Signed as a replacement for David Burrows, Bjørnebye debuted inauspiciously on 19 December 1992 in a 5–1 defeat to Coventry City. Initial difficulties <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> the Premier League caused many fans to question his displays on the pitch and he returned to Norway on loan to Rosenborg in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Most of Carabane {{is covered}} in mangroves, forming an impassable jungle {{that can only be}} crossed in {{constructed}} passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> the highly saline environment, where the quantity of oxygen in the soil is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.|$|E

5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> the teaching style of his grammar school.

When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E

An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, Harvey had become {{the youngest}} Australian to score a Test century, by making 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer. However, Harvey struggled early in the tour and had difficulty <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team in the early part of the tour, Harvey's performances improved with increasing familiarity with local conditions, and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test, where he batted at No. 5 behind Miller and in front of Loxton due to the injury to Barnes. Upon Barnes’ return for the Fifth Test, the trio were each pushed down one position.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E

40|$|Biotic {{response}} of calcareous nannoplankton to abrupt warming across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary reflects a primary response to climatically induced parameters including increased continental runoff of freshwater, global acidification of seawater, high sedimentation rates, and calcareous nannoplankton assemblage turnover. We identify ecophenotypic nannofossil species <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> low pH conditions (Discoaster anartios, D. araneus, Rhomboaster spp.), excursion taxa <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> the extremely warm climatic conditions (Bomolithus supremus and Coccolithus bownii), three {{species of the}} genus Toweius (T. serotinus, T. callosus, T. occultatus) <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> warm, rather than cool, water conditions, opportunists <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> high productivity conditions (Coronocyclus bramlettei, Neochiastozygus junctus), and species <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> oligotropic and/or cool‐water conditions that went into refugium during the PETM (Zygrablithus bijugatus, Calcidiscus? parvicrucis and Chiasmolithus bidens). Discoaster anartios was <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> meso- to eutrophic, rather than oligotrophic, conditions. Comparison of these data to previous work on sediments deposited on shelf settings suggests that local conditions such as high precipitation rates and possible increase in major storms such as hurricanes resulted in increased continental runoff and high sedimentation rates that affected assemblage response to the PETM...|$|R
