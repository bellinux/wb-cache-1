500|$|After World War II engulfed Britain, Gandhi {{actively}} campaigned {{to oppose}} any {{help to the}} British war effort and any Indian participation in the war. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi believed that his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism. Gandhi's position was not supported by many Indian leaders, and his campaign against the British war effort was a failure. The Hindu leader, Tej Bahadur Sapru declared in 1941, states Herman, [...] "A good many Congress leaders <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> <b>up</b> with the barren program of the Mahatma". Over 2.5million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined on the British side. They fought and died {{as a part of}} the allied forces in Europe, North Africa and various fronts of the World War II.|$|E

500|$|Six out {{of eight}} areas in Knowle West are ranked as being {{economically}} deprived. The {{closure of the}} Imperial Tobacco factory at nearby Hartcliffe in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A House of Commons report noted that this had a seriously {{negative effect on the}} area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for [...] "manual and semi-skilled employment". The Independent in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems. In 2006, BBC News said [...] "Knowle West has {{more than its share of}} social problems. [...] The highest number of kids in care of any council ward in Bristol. [...] The lowest number of young people with any qualifications (under half). [...] A major petty crime problem, drug addiction, and add to that people <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> <b>up</b> with bad housing." [...] Shawnie, a 2006 novel by social worker Ed Trewavas, written from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl living in Knowle West, documents some of the deprivation he encountered in his work. One of the novel's characters [...] "describes Knowle West ... as a 'shit hole' populated by 'yokels, cider-heads, junkies, dole-scammers, slappers and failed wide boys, all interbreeding and nicking their cruddy possessions off of each other in some giant, dismal rota.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Four days later, the DA {{submitted}} a complaint to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) about censorship {{by the public}} broadcaster after the SABC informed the DA it would not continue broadcasting a DA television advert titled [...] "ANC Ayisafani", meaning [...] "the ANC's not the same", and five DA radio adverts aired on 8 and 9 April 2014. According to the DA's Mmusi Maimane, who appears in the television advert, the SABC banned all DA adverts from 11 public radio stations {{as well as the}} television advert. ICASA announced that it would hold public hearings on the matter on Thursday the 17th, 6 days after the DA lodged their complaint. Following the DA's announcement that it would submit an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court requesting a ruling on the adverts before the long Easter weekend commencing Good Friday, the day after ICASA's proposed public hearing date, the ICASA hearings commenced 2 days earlier than originally scheduled. On the day after the hearing, the ban was lifted temporarily as the SABC had failed to provide reasons for the ban during the ICASA hearings and requested more time to prepare a response. The DA also objected to the SABC not allowing the national official opposition party to participate in a televised election debate on land reform on SABCin the first 2 weeks of April. On 25 April, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the television advert finding that it contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. ICASA ordered that a photograph taken by The Citizen photographer Alaister Russell of a police officer firing rubber bullets at unarmed residents during the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest be removed from the advert as [...] "the police should not be seen {{as a threat to the}} community". In the advert, Maimane says [...] "We've seen a police force killing our own people" [...] while the photograph is shown on the screen. The South African Police Service had earlier {{submitted a}} complaint to ICASA that this footage would incite violence against police officers.On 15 April 2014, a protest campaign against corruption with the slogan [...] "Vukani! Sidikwe! (Wake up! We <b>are</b> <b>Fed</b> <b>up!)</b> Vote No", supported by over 100 ANC veterans, was launched by former government ministers Ronnie Kasrils and Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. The IEC has requested a legal opinion on whether the campaign contravenes the Electoral Act. The campaign urges ANC supporters to either spoil their votes or vote for a smaller party. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu welcomed the campaign, and human rights activist and cleric Barney Pityana describes it as [...] "a campaign to bring rationality, order, morality and decency back into our electoral system" [...] in a Mail & Guardian opinion piece.|$|E

2500|$|Matters {{deteriorated}} in 1929, {{when the}} three Ipswich clubs (Bundamba Rangers, Dinmore Bush Rats and St Helens) withdrew from the semi-final round, leaving only Brisbane club Latrobe. The reason given in a newspaper report was [...] "because they {{were not allowed to}} share the profits of the matches which were to have been played at the Cricket Ground." [...] However, the report also noted [...] "they were parties to the original arrangement ... The four Brisbane clubs alone are responsible for the rent of the Brisbane Cricket Ground, and these semi-finals were to help liquidate the liability."

To put the matter bluntly, the Brisbane clubs <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> <b>up</b> with these incessant rows with Ipswich, and desire to end the business once and for all ..." [...] The Ipswich clubs were fined and suspended and, despite attempts at mediation, {{were not included in the}} Brisbane competition for 1930 (see below).
