5000|$|The most {{developed}} smart fluids {{today are}} fluids whose viscosity increases when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. Small magnetic dipoles are suspended in a non-magnetic fluid, and the applied magnetic field causes these small magnets to line up and form strings that increase the viscosity.

Depending on road conditions, the damping fluid's viscosity is adjusted. This is more expensive than traditional systems, but it provides better (faster) control.

40|$|While {{remanufacturing}} is a-concept {{that has}} been around for some time, it is not a widely understood one. In fact, the word doesn't even appear in the current edition of the American Production and Inventory Control Society Dictionary [12]. It is not simply the repairing of a broken item, nor the "reconditioning " of a product: Remanufacturing is an industrial process in which wom-out products are restored to like-new condition. Through a series of industrial processes in a factory environment, a discarded product is completely disassembled. Usable parts are cleaned, refurbished, and put into inventory. Then the new product is reassembled from both old and, where necessary, new parts to produce a unit fully equivalent-and sometimes superior-in performance and expected lifetime to the original new product. In contrast, a repaired or rebuilt product normally retains its identity, and only those parts that have failed or are badly wom are replaced or serviced [7 l.

50|$|Flowering dogwood {{does best}} horticulturally in moist, acidic soil in a site with some {{afternoon}} shade, but good morning sun. It {{does not do}} well when exposed to intense heat sources such as adjacent parking lots or <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>compressors.</b> It also has a low salinity tolerance. The hardiness zone is 5-9 and the preferred pH is between 6.0-7.0. In urban and suburban settings, care should be taken not to inflict mower damage on the trunk or roots, as this increases the tree’s susceptibility to disease and pest pressure. The common flowering dogwood {{has been placed on}} the endangered species list in Ontario.In regions where dogwood anthracnose is a problem, homeowners and public land managers are encouraged to know the symptoms and inspect trees frequently. The selection of healthy, disease-free planting stock is essential and transplanting trees from the forest should be avoided. Sites should be selected for reasonably well-drained, fertile soils; full sun is recommended in high-hazard areas (such as stream or pond banks). New plantings should be mulched to a depth of 2 to 4 in, avoiding the stem. Dead wood and leaves should be pruned and completely removed and destroyed yearly. Plants should be watered weekly during droughts, with watering done in the morning, avoiding wetting the foliage. Registered fungicides can be applied when necessary, according to manufacturers instructions and advice of local Extension Service.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Industrial Research Ltd (IRL) has {{developed}} a novel metallic-diaphragm pressure wave generator technology for large high-frequency (30 - 60 Hz) pulse tube cryocoolers. A diaphragm pressure wave generator, using a conventionally lubricated motor-crank drive, provides a clean pressure wave for a cryocooler. High frequency pulse tubes are at their most efficient when closely coupled to pressure wave generators. There are, however, many applications which require the physical separation of the compressor from the cold head such as a Gifford McMahon (GM) system. Furthermore, GM cryocoolers perform well at low temperatures {{due in part to}} their low frequency (~ 1 Hz) operation. GM cryocoolers typically employ <b>compressors</b> related to <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>compressors</b> which need filters to remove the compressor oil from the helium flow, thus increasing maintenance. This paper describes the development of an oil free compressor for GM cryocoolers fabricated by fitting a reed valve assembly to the outlet of a 200 ml swept-volume diaphragm pressure wave generator. The system was designed to charge a high pressure tank to 16 bar drawing gas from a low pressure tank held at 5 bar. Helium mass flow rate was predicted to be 3. 5 g/s.

40|$|Studies {{to better}} {{understand}} scuffing began approximately sixty years ago, when it was postulated that scuffing occurs when a critical temperature of the surface is reached, at which desorption of surface films occurs. An extension to this hypothesis was proposed suggesting interaction of chemically active species with the metal surfaces, notably oxygen and thus scuffing {{would be associated with}} the rate of oxide formation and destruction. In the 1950 ???s another major development in the field of tribology was started which recognized and understood elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) became the focus of study and it was assumed that a system is in danger of scuffing when the thickness of the fluid film between the surfaces. Recent fundamental scuffing studies related to <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>compressors</b> under dry sliding conditions were performed by Sheiretov, who proposed a process leading to subsurface failure, which eventually led to scuffing. Further studies carried by Yoon focusing on scuffing under starved lubrication conditions (typical conditions for <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>compressors),</b> suggested that scuffing was related to shear failure of the bulk material which was caused by formation of macroscopic adhesions at the sliding interface. In these recent studies the effect of surface topography on scuffing has not been treated thoroughly. Further more their approach was based on macro -tribological experiments and meso-to-micro analysis methods. This was intentional since the surface roughness of typical engineering surfaces is large with Ra values from 0. 1 to 1 mm, thus the previous researchers were seeking average effects in their studies. Also earlier studies did not examine the progression leading to scuffing. In the present study we investigate, first; the progression of surface topography and respective change in surface parameters with tribological testing leading to scuffing; second, changes in chemical composition of the surface and near surface layers of the sample at the micro and nano-meter scales, and investigate its relation to scuffing, this study differs from the ones carried out by its predecessors (Sheiretov, Yoon) in that it tracks topographical and chemical changes of the interface surface of the (softer) aluminum disc as it progresses form its virgin state to its scuffed state. Furthermore the analyses are carried out using macro to nanometer scales and techniques. To our knowledge this is the first such comprehensive study that will investigate the use of techniques that are typically used in semi -conductors and MEMS applications, whose surfaces are by several orders smoother than the engineering surfaces that will be used in this study. A shoe-on-disc geometry, which is used to carry out the experiments consists of a steel shoe on aluminum disc and in an approximate simulation of a swash-plate/shoe contact in an automotive swash [...] plate compressor. The High Pressure Tribometer (HPT) is used to simulate the progression of wear conditions. The refrigerant used in this case is R 410 A with a POE lubricant. Once the experimental samples have been tested on the HPT, two sets of analytical tests are run, the first to measure the surface roughness and extract the statistical parameters, and the second to analyze chemical composition of the surfaces and the nano-meter range sub-surfaces. Based on the study it is suggested that the use of the micro to nano meter range scales in analyzing engineering surfaces is appropriate and correlates well to the macro to meso scale wear results. Thus the goal of this thesis Is to investigate the evolution of both the topographical and chemical characteristics as the surface of an aluminum alloy is worn out in a swash plate compressor using macro to nano-scales. <b>Air</b> <b>Conditioning</b> and Refrigeration Project 12...|$|R
