2500|$|To {{avoid the}} safety issues, Karl Albert, then {{director}} at the Krefeld Tramway, developed the Albert coupler during 1921, a key and slot [...] coupler with two pins. Cars to <b>be</b> coupled <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> both couplings moving to the same side. One pin <b>was</b> inserted, then the cars <b>were</b> pulled to straighten the coupling and the other pin inserted. This operation required less exact shunting. Due to the single piece design, only minimal slack <b>was</b> possible. The system became quite popular with tram systems and narrow gauge lines.|$|R
50|$|Contact {{adhesives}} must <b>be</b> {{applied to}} both surfaces and allowed {{some time to}} dry before the two surfaces <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together.</b> Some contact adhesives require as long as 24 hours to dry before the surfaces <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> held <b>together.</b> Once the surfaces <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> the bond forms very quickly. It <b>is</b> usually not necessary to apply pressure for a long time, so there <b>is</b> less need for clamps.|$|R

50|$|An {{interference}} fit, {{also known}} as a press fit or friction fit <b>is</b> a fastening between two parts which <b>is</b> achieved by friction after the parts <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> rather than by any other means of fastening.|$|R
50|$|The {{documents}} <b>are</b> {{stored on}} mobile shelving - double-sided shelves, which <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> {{so that there}} <b>is</b> no aisle between them. A large handle {{on the end of}} each shelf allows them to <b>be</b> moved along tracks in the floor to create an aisle when needed.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the mission}} models, the Alliance Habitation Module, {{straddles}} both fields in the center. This model can earn points for both teams when the two halves <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together.</b> The touch penalty objects <b>are</b> four boulders, worth up to 14 points each depending on location. One <b>is</b> removed from the field each time the robot <b>is</b> touched outside of base.|$|R
5000|$|Emma in Winter {{gives some}} {{explanation}} for the time travel phenomenon seen in both this book and in [...] "Charlotte Sometimes". Emma and Bobby sneak into Grandfather Elijah's study, and read an article where time <b>is</b> described as being like a coiled spring, which can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> so that some moments in time can <b>be</b> very near a moment in another time.|$|R
60|$|With this {{he caught}} up {{two of the}} piglets and <b>pushed</b> them <b>together,</b> so that the two <b>were</b> one. Then he caught up another piglet and pushed it into the first, where it disappeared. And so, one by one, the nine tiny piglets <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> until but {{a single one of}} the creatures remained. This the Wizard placed {{underneath}} his hat and made a mystic sign above it. When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappeared entirely.|$|R
50|$|Compression members <b>are</b> {{structural}} elements that <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> or carry a load, more technically they <b>are</b> subjected only to axial compressive forces. That <b>is,</b> the loads <b>are</b> applied on the longitudinal axis through the centroid {{of the member}} cross section, and the load over the cross sectional area gives the stress on the compressed member. In buildings posts and columns <b>are</b> almost always compression members as <b>are</b> the top chord of trusses.|$|R
50|$|The {{documents}} <b>are</b> {{stored on}} electrically powered mobile shelving - double-sided shelves, which <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> {{so that there}} <b>is</b> no aisle between them. A large handle {{on the end of}} each shelf allows them to <b>be</b> moved along tracks in the floor to create an aisle when needed. The units have a small AC or DC motor hidden in the base that automatically moves the units when a single button <b>is</b> pressed.|$|R
60|$|Still {{holding the}} faint wax-light {{in his hand}} Louis turned {{to the door of}} Lady Constantine's chamber, where he {{observed}} first that, though it <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> so as to appear fastened to cursory view, the door <b>was</b> not really closed by about a quarter of an inch. He dropped his light and extinguished it with his foot. Listening, he heard a voice within,--Viviette's voice, in a subdued murmur, though speaking earnestly.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{non-linear}} sequels have <b>been</b> published following HERO's Hearts. The most popular being Hero's Defiant which introduces more complex {{objects such as}} lasers, mirrors, missiles, and smileys. The third installment sports a lesser number of classes, but introduces gravity and 2-dimensional player aspect. The fourth and final installment, Hero's Friends takes the game {{in a bit of}} a different direction removing nearly all classes and introducing Aliens which much <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> to complete a level.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{different}} socket and seals exist. The most modern <b>is</b> the 'push-joint' or 'slip-joint', whereby the socket and rubber seal <b>is</b> designed to allow the pipe spigot to <b>be,</b> after lubrication, simply <b>pushed</b> into the socket. Push joints remain proprietary designs. Also available <b>are</b> locking gasket systems. These locking gasket systems allow the pipe to <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> but do not allow the joint to come apart without using a special tool or torch on the gasket.|$|R
40|$|Observations <b>are</b> {{presented}} of a large, active sunspot {{group which}} show oppositely-directed vertical-field inversions separated by very narrow elongated channels of intense horizontal fields. When newly emerging sunspots move through older magnetic-field configurations, the poles <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> {{and the field}} lines turn sharply along the inversion line to reconnect with the vertical field some distance away. These observations show {{that almost all of}} the larger flares in this region occur in highly convoluted, multiple-channeled horizontal fields with substantial electric current...|$|R
5000|$|Several Jewish localities have <b>been</b> {{built on}} al-Mansura's lands, {{including}} Elkosh established in 1949, the military base Biranit {{in the early}} 1950s, Netu'a in 1966, Mattat in 1979 and Abirim in 1980. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi whose researchers visited the village before 1992, [...] "The village houses have <b>been</b> completely leveled. Much of the resulting debris has <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> in heaps along {{the northern edge of}} the site." [...] The only structure remaining <b>was</b> the partially collapsed church.|$|R
50|$|The Richmond Basin <b>is</b> 205 to 245 {{million years}} old. Pangea divided and many small rifts split {{opened in the}} earth in {{addition}} to the large one that became the Atlantic Ocean. When Richmond rift opened and filled with swamps from water in the Pamunkey River, sediment filled in over the swamps and the sedimentary pressure converted organic plant material into coal. This weight <b>is</b> less pressure than coal deposits created when the continents <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>together</b> and raising up mountains. Semi-anthracite and anthracite <b>are</b> often created by such tectonic squeezing when continents <b>push</b> <b>together.</b> The Richmond Basin has Bituminous coal, created by the sedimentary weight only.|$|R
50|$|Charlotte Sometimes {{continues}} the theme, begun in Emma in Winter, of time travel into the past. While this <b>is</b> unexplained in Charlotte Sometimes, a theorised explanation <b>is</b> given in Emma in Winter. Emma and Bobby <b>are</b> reading journals in Emma and Charlotte's grandfather Elijah's study, where they find an article theorising the non-linear nature of time. It describes time as being like a coiled spring, which can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> {{so that some}} moments in time can <b>be</b> very near a moment in another time.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of their {{deposition}} the rocks of the Northern Limestone Alps <b>were</b> located several hundred kilometres south of their present position. About 35 million years ago, tectonic forces, that <b>are</b> still active today, began to push these geological units northwards. At that time several kilometres of rock and several hundred metres of water lay on top of the rocks visible today. As a result there <b>was</b> a massive overlapping pressure that prevented the formations underneath from breaking up as they <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 9, 1982, in the Hill House on Beacon Hill, {{members from}} the Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco Pride {{committees}} gathered in response to Levine's mailing. Three long tables <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> to make a triangular seating area. For two days many topics concerning coordinating LGBT prides <b>was</b> discussed, and while each city had different events, they discovered much of the planning and logistics <b>was</b> surprisingly similar. They voted to hold a second conference in San Diego the next year.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} <b>is</b> {{played with}} a stick in one hand, while the other hand (usually the left) controls the grip. The two metal discs <b>are</b> then <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> to create a sound {{similar to that of}} a milk bottle being hit.|$|R
50|$|The couple <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> by Leah, {{who asked}} Charlotte to tutor Matt. Charlotte {{realised}} {{that she should}} not <b>be</b> with Matt, but could not help herself when he kissed her. As Charlotte and Matt continued seeing each other, Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) soon {{found out about the}} relationship and urged Matt to end it. Reflecting on the storyline in December 2015, Snow told Bianca La Cioppa from the Daily Mail that he and Heynatz really tried to make their on-screen romance appear truthful and to justify their relationship.|$|R
5000|$|To couple the two parts, the pin(s) on {{the male}} <b>are</b> {{aligned with the}} slot(s) on the female and the two <b>pushed</b> <b>together.</b> Once the pins reach {{the bottom of the}} slot, one or both parts <b>are</b> rotated so that the pin slides along the {{horizontal}} arm of the L until it reaches the [...] "serif". The spring then pushes the male connector up into the [...] "serif" [...] to keep the pin locked into place. A practised user can connect them quickly and, unlike screw connectors, they <b>are</b> not subject to cross-threading. To disconnect, the two parts <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> to move the pin out of the [...] "serif" [...] while twisting in the opposite direction than for connecting, and then pulling apart.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "dual piezo cooling jet", {{patented}} by GE, uses vibrations to pump air through the device. The initial device <b>is</b> three millimeters thick {{and consists of}} two nickel discs that <b>are</b> connected on either side to a sliver of piezoelectric ceramics. An alternating current passed through the ceramic component causes it to expand and contract at up to 150 times per second so that the nickel discs act like a bellows. Contracted, {{the edges of the}} discs <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> and suck in hot air. Expanding brings the nickel discs together, expelling the air at high velocity.|$|R
50|$|They type {{of objects}} in the collection, {{available}} space, and need for ease of accessibility tend to determine what type of storage system <b>is</b> utilized for a particular collection. There <b>are</b> many generic storage systems that can <b>be</b> purchased and modified to fit {{the needs of a}} specific collection, and this <b>is</b> generally more cost effective than having a system specially built. In small storage areas many institutions will utilize mobile systems that have shelving units on a track, which allows access to a desired aisle {{while the rest of the}} shelving units <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Intercontainer <b>was</b> established, originally, as a not {{for profit}} {{cooperative}} partnership between principal European rail companies, in 1967. In 1993 the business acquired and operations <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> {{with those of}} another not for profit cooperative partnership called Interfrigo which had <b>been</b> founded in 1949 and specialised in timely refrigerated rail transport of high volume goods, notably bananas carried from the port of Rotterdam to principal European markets such as Germany and Switzerland. The resulting combination now became known as Intercontainer-Interfrigo. In 2003 the company <b>was</b> converted into an [...] "Aktiengesellschaft" [...] (a form of Joint-stock company) as defined under Belgian law.|$|R
25|$|A {{bifold door}} <b>is</b> {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood <b>is</b> the most common material, and doors may also <b>be</b> metal or glass. Bifolds <b>are</b> most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also <b>be</b> used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors <b>are</b> essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) <b>is</b> accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> {{familiar}} {{images in}} these potato pieces but they evoke those contadini themes of Christian faith and rural labor {{in a new}} context. Like the saints that <b>are</b> now the supporting structures for the potatoes, the themes {{of the past decade}} <b>are</b> now the backdrop for another extended reality in the everyday life of the peasant—the political divisions of the working and privileged classes. The [...] "Potato Famine" [...] sculptures <b>are</b> restorations of political events that occurred over a century ago. The images and symbols <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> by the sculptor to achieve a new tension, a different syntax to convey some of the original essence of oppression.|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{detection}} <b>is</b> a {{very important}} tool for every application field that includes monitoring and detection of radiation sources. In the case of gamma and X-ray detectors, a wide number of application fields <b>are</b> involved in the detector developing, this list comprehends medical imaging, environmental monitoring, homeland security and astrophysics. In recent years CdZnTe(CZT) has emerged as an interesting material for the realization of room temperature X- and gamma ray detectors. In this work IMEM grown CZT ingots and detectors <b>were</b> studied with several techniques, {{in order to understand}} the mechanisms occurring in the device functioning.

50|$|Weaving <b>is</b> the {{procedure}} of <b>pushing</b> {{the ends of}} two halves of a deck {{against each other in}} such a way that they naturally intertwine. Sometimes the deck <b>is</b> split into equal halves of 26 cards which <b>are</b> then <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> in a certain way so as to make them perfectly interweave. This <b>is</b> known as a Faro Shuffle.|$|R
50|$|Breeding pairs <b>are</b> monogamous and nests <b>are</b> built together. The {{breeding}} season <b>is</b> related to rainfall and {{varies according to}} local conditions. Nest materials <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> not interwoven, to form an oval 570 mm wide. A short entrance tube opens downwards and <b>is</b> about 2 to(-) 4 m above the ground. Soft materials line the inner portions of the nest, which usually has several rooms, with defensive thorny branches on the outside. A large tree will have several of their nests, which other birds, such as the African pygmy-falcon, <b>are</b> known to use instead of building their own. The female incubates 3-5 greyish to pale blue eggs with red, brown and olive markings for 11-14 days. Both parents feed the chicks.|$|R
50|$|The MC4 system {{consists}} of a plug and socket design. Oddly, the plugs and sockets <b>are</b> placed inside plastic shells that appear to <b>be</b> the opposite gender - the plug <b>is</b> inside a cylindrical shell {{that looks like a}} female connector but <b>is</b> referred to as male, and the socket <b>is</b> inside a square probe that looks male but <b>is</b> electrically female. The female connector has two plastic fingers that have to <b>be</b> pressed toward the central probe slightly to insert into holes {{in the front of the}} male connector. When the two <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> the fingers slide down the holes until they reach a notch cut into the side of the male connector, where they pop outward to lock the two together.|$|R
30|$|Quarter-sawn and {{plain-sawn}} {{specimens of}} Scots pine <b>were</b> semi-isostatically compressed at 5, 15, 50, and 140 [*]MPa in a Quintus press. Elastic strain <b>was</b> measured using a telescope device that <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> when wood <b>was</b> compressed and remained {{in this position}} at release of pressure. Delayed elastic and plastic strains <b>were</b> assessed through repeated callipering during 5 years after densification. At 140 [*]MPa, wood reached an almost compact structure (ρ ≈ 1450 [*]kg/m 3) {{but as a result}} of elastic springback the density decreased to just below 1000 [*]kg/m 3. At 140 [*]MPa, the elastic and delayed elastic strains <b>were</b> 14.6 % and 1.8 %, respectively, in quarter-sawn specimens, and <b>were</b> 13.1 % and 0.8 %, respectively, in plain-sawn specimens. The higher elastic strains in quarter-sawn specimens can <b>be</b> attributed to elastic springback in the tangentially deformed latewood bands.|$|R
25|$|In the 14th century, necklines <b>were</b> lowered, clothes <b>were</b> {{tightened}} {{and breasts}} <b>were</b> once again flaunted. It <b>was</b> during the Renaissance period that the corset <b>was</b> born. Breasts <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> up, <b>pushed</b> <b>together</b> and molded into firm protruding decorations that emphasized breasts to the maximum. In 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, <b>is</b> credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the French court. Other aristocratic {{women of the}} time who <b>were</b> painted with breasts exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts <b>was</b> painted by Piero di Cosimo in c.1480.|$|R
50|$|Western Turkey <b>is</b> mainly fault-block terrain with steep-sided ridges running east-west {{and rivers}} in the rifts. The {{source of the}} {{faulting}} <b>is</b> the closing of Tethys Sea and the collision of the African and Arabian plates with the Eurasian plate. The smaller Turkish and Aegean plates <b>are</b> being <b>pushed</b> <b>together,</b> generating ridges in Turkey. This orogenic belt <b>was</b> in place by 1.6 mya and continues to <b>be</b> a hot spot of earthquakes and volcanos.|$|R
