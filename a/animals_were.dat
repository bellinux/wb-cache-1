5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> slain during the games.|$|E
5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is {{an antique}} {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It {{was installed in}} 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. The <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company some time before 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E
5|$|Game hunting was a {{familiar}} beneficial skill to the colonists when they immigrated to the New World. Most northern colonists depended upon hunting, whether they hunted themselves or purchased game from others. As a method of obtaining protein for consumption, hunting was preferred over animal husbandry as domestic <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> expensive and more work was required to defend domestic animals against natural predators, Native Americans, or the French. Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of the <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> roasted and served with currant and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, sausages, pies, and pasties.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} the dietary habits of the wildebeest, the <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> found to be feeding on the three {{dominant}} grasses of the area, namely : Themeda triandra, Digitaria macroblephara and Pennisetum mezianum. The time spent grazing increased by about 100% during the dry season. Though the choice of diet remained the same in both the dry and the wet season, the <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> more selective during the latter.|$|E

5|$|Both Dio and Suetonius {{agree that}} gladiatorial {{contests}} and a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also {{took place at}} the lake area, but they again disagree on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.|$|E
5|$|Hedgehogs are not {{native to}} the Outer Hebrides—they were {{introduced}} in the 1970s to reduce garden pests—and their spread {{poses a threat to}} the eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003, Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area although these were halted in 2007 due to protests; trapped <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> instead relocated to the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} Anomalocaris, also from the Burgess Shale. Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods are not a single phylum.|$|E

5|$|In the Andes {{region of}} South America, with civilizations {{including}} the Inca, the major crop was the potato, domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. Coca, still a major crop to this day, was domesticated in the Andes, {{as were the}} peanut, tomato, tobacco, and pineapple. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. <b>Animals</b> <b>were</b> also domesticated, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.|$|E
5|$|Many Smilodon {{specimens}} {{have been}} excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. <b>Animals</b> <b>were</b> accidentally {{trapped in the}} seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.|$|E
5|$|Parish records {{exist for}} Navenby from 1681, {{although}} bishops' transcripts {{go back to}} 1562.

In the European Middle Ages, a lightweight war horse became known as the rouncey.|$|E
5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as matériel during wartime became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> stallions, {{and there was no way}} to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E
