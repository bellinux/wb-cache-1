There were few trees in the area, but as wood was needed in the drying process, he undertook extensive tree-planting in the area. [...] He built a [...] "stately house", Edgeley House, which was {{the home of the}} family for succeeding generations until it became Alexandra Park. Wells were sunk including the [...] "Silver Well", and by 1830 these had quadrupled the water supply. Reservoirs were also built. These undertakings were of great value to people in the area in times of excessive drought. The Sykes originally owned most of the land in Edgeley, and employed many people.

The 7 km² of buildings was just 1/20 of the existing Polish capital city and was very different from the actual existing road network of 1939. The whole town center was to be built into a net of narrow, picturesque streets, resembling the planning of a typical German town. The modern and wide Polish capital avenues (like Ulica Marszałkowska, Twarda, Mokotowska, Dzika, Oś Saska, Oś Stanisławowska) would have been erased forever with all their monumental and beautiful buildings and palaces. Only the remains of the Old Town district (without the Polish King’s Castle), the King’s Baths Palace (Łazienki Królewskie) and Belvedere (Belweder), and modified parts of the Vistula riverside buildings would have been saved.|$|E
