She was an important member of my Grey's family. This was not an easy decision. But it was a decision that Chyler <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> together. We had a lot of thoughtful discussion about it and ultimately we both decided this was the right time for her character's journey to end.
