The conservation and sustainable use of local aquatic ecosystems, ponds, rivers, coastal commons by <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolk</b> and smallholder farmers is important to the survival of both humans and the environment. Since aquatic organisms, including fish, provide much of our food supply as well as underpinning the income of coastal peoples, it is critical that fisherfolk and smallholder farmers have genetic reserves and sustainable ecosystems to draw upon as aquaculture and marine fisheries management continue to evolve.|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to poverty reduction in low-income countries {{known as the}} 'sustainable livelihoods approach' is applied to understanding the strategies of <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolk</b> confronted by fluctuating fisheries resources. The livelihood approach is explained, and the insights it provides into conventional fisheries management policies in developing countries are explored. It is argued that both state-led management {{and some of the}} newer, community or territorial use-rights approaches, if predicated on an incomplete understanding of livelihoods, can result in management directives incompatible with both resource conservation and the social and economic goals of management. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{livelihood}} diversification and operational techniques of the <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolks</b> in the coastal region of Ondo state, Nigeria. Both secondary and primary data were used. A multistage sampling techniques was used to select 400 respondents from Ilaje and Ese-Odo LGAs, these LGAs were purposively selected because they fall within the core coast of the state which is about 180 km. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the socioeconomic characteristics and operational techniques the sufficiency of the survey instruments. Analysis showed that 82 % {{of the respondents were}} married, majority of the respondents (67 %) were males while others (33 %) were females. The operational techniques for fishing occupation reveals that 85 % of the respondents make use of dugout canoe to carry out their fishing, 10 % of the respondents make use of motorized canoe to carry out their fishing activities. The fish capturing techniques employed in the study area include active and passive methods.

40|$|The {{artisanal fishery}} {{occupies}} a significant {{position in the}} Nigerian economy providing employment for about 5. 8 % of the Nigerian population and supplying 81. 9 % of the total domestic fish production. However, climate change is modifying the distribution of fish species with changes in habitat, size, species diversification and productivity. The study, therefore, examined {{the potential impact of}} climate change on livelihood and food security of <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolks</b> in Lagos State, Nigeria A stratified sampling technique was used to select 88 fishing communities in Lagos State. A total of 311 respondents were interviewed using structured questionnaire. Data collected include socio-economic characteristics, livelihood parameters, fish species and productivity data while climatic data was obtained from the weather station and meteorology department. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and stochastic frontier catch function analysis. The result of the analysis showed that there were changes in temperature and rainfall pattern which is a deviation from the normal trend. Variation in species diversity and abundance was also observed. There were other sources of livelihood engaged in either as primary or secondary occupation.

40|$|Artisanal Fish Societies {{constitutes}} one of {{the poorest}} societies in the developing world. Attempts to harness the potentials of such societies have often failed due to the enormity of the problem of poverty. This study was conducted in four major fishing villages namely: Abule Titun, Apojola, Imala Odo and Ibaro in order to investigate the occupational practices and the problems of rural <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolks</b> in Oyam's Dam, area of Ogun State. Eighty respondents were randomly selected among the artisanal fisher folks for interview using interview guide. The findings revealed that 43. 8 % of the fisherfolks are within active age range of 31 - 40 years while 30 % are within 21 - 30 years range. Also 31 % had no formal education indicating a relatively high level of illiteracy among the fisherfolks while majority of the respondents practice fishing activities using paddle and canoe. It was similarly discovered from the study that the most pressing problems of the fishfolks is the lack of basic social amenities like electricity, potable water, access roads, hospital and markets. It is therefore recommended that basic social infrastructures be provided for the artisanal fishing communities in order to improve their social welfare, standard of living and the capacity to have a sustainable fishing occupation in the interest of food security and poverty alleviatio...|$|R
40|$|Faustino Torrez {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} the Agrarian Reform Commission of La Via Campesina, an international peasant movement that initiated the Global Campaign for Agrarian Reform. The process included a global encounter with the landless peoples in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the La Via Campesina conferences, and the global fora in Valencia and Porto Alegre. La Via Campesina has been developing a new concept of agrarian reform that recognizes the socio-environmental aspects of land, the sea and natural resources, in the context of food sovereignty. Integral agrarian reform encompasses policies of redistribution, just, equitable access and control of natural, social and productive resources (credit, appropriate technologies, health, education, social security etc.) by peasants and their families, indigenous people, landless workers, <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolk,</b> pastoralists, the unemployed, Dalit communities, Afrodescendents and other rural peoples. He argues that development policies should be based on agro-ecological strategies centred on family and peasant agriculture and artisanal fishing; trade policies that oppose dumping of products in the market and favour peasant and family farm production oriented towards local, national and international markets; and public policies in the areas of education, health and infrastructure for the countryside that complement trade and other policies. ...|$|E
40|$|The Al-Batinah {{coast is}} home to around 35 % of the Sultanate of Oman's <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolk,</b> who account for 28 % of {{national}} landings by traditional means. Over the last 10 years, the region has experienced a general decline in its fishery with a consequence of socio-economic disturbance and increased fishing pressure. The present study was undertaken to gain base line socio-economic information upon the region and to examine the industry's structure and co-management strategies. Fisherfolk (mean age: 44. 4 Â± 8. 77 {SD}) were from large families (avg. 12. 4), educationally challenged (1. 10 Â± 2. 58 Â yr formal education), and had limited opportunity for alternative employment. Mean crew size of fishing vessels was 1. 86 Â± 0. 63 (SD) and two different systems were employed for calculating crew earnings. Average income per person was approx. US$ 5000 per annum although there was significant disparity in income distribution between villages. Traditionally, fisherfolk have employed the Senat Al-Bahar ("code of the sea"), in efforts to distribute and manage coastal fisheries. However, change in fishery management, away from local, to a more centralised style, has undermined {{the effectiveness of this}} system. This has resulted in alterations in fisherfolk behaviour, with some employing illegal mesh sizes, poaching and fishing in prohibited areas.

Similar studies were undertaken in Guatemala and Nepal, and related work was carried out in Afghanistan and diverse mountainous areas in connection with the International Year of Mountains (2002). The report describes the livelihood strategies of four vulnerable groups (small farmers in the Red River and Mekong Deltas, small farmers in the Northern Region, <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolk</b> in Central Coastal Region, and urban workers without stable employment), investigates the characteristics and causes of their vulnerability and how they cope, and recommends specific options to reduce their vulnerability. Given the scope and focus of this study, it could be particularly useful in supporting implementation of the national Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), which seeks inter alia to enhance food security and reduce vulnerability, as well as other national programmes like the 1 715 Poor Communes Programme (Programme 135, 1998 - 2005).

40|$|Poster session. In {{developing}} countries {{the framework for}} institutional engagement in small-scale fishing communities needs to consider the regional, social, economic and environmental complexities of informal resource-based economies. The combination of socio-economic trajectory of <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolks,</b> {{their relationship with the}} environment, the economic pressures and the public policy framework, which often regarded fishing communities as desolate and in a permanent state of deficiency, resulted in a paradigm that reinforced social exclusion and further degradation of the environment. This context is further aggravated by gender inequalities, which turn the role of fisherwomen in small scale fisheries and community development invisible. Within this negatively charged context, the challenge of fostering a socially just, environmentally sustainable and economically viable livelihood relies on institutional interventions that are able to identify the endogenous potential for change within the community. As such, a community-based development approach aims to build opportunities for multi-stakeholder engagement to socially embed the economic and resource-management tools. The paper describes the conceptual framework and the participatory methodology applied by the "Gente da Maré" (The People of the Tide) Project in Brazil. This methodology involves the participatory development of value chain mapping and economic feasibility study towards sustainable livelihoods for small-scale coastal fishing communities. A special focus is placed on the "marisqueiras" – shell fisherwomen that live from the extraction of clams and oysters in coastal communities spread across Brazil‘s North-eastern Region, {{as well as on the}} intervening institutions. The paper concludes with reflections on the community-based inter-institutional approach to participatory value chain mapping and economic feasibility studies, the challenges that lay ahead in the application of participatory economic development tools and on future directions for further research...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} pond aquaculture as {{a development}} {{strategy in the}} Philippines, with particular reference to {{its impact on the}} local environment and the livelihoods of local people. A theoretical framework is provided by recent literature in development studies and human geography, which attempts to move away from an essentialist and ethnocentric development praxis, and towards a locally-based, participatory process of empowerment. From the perspective of such 'alternative' development ideas, orthodox strategies involving modernization, formalization of economic activities, and resource mobilization, can be reassessed. The promotion of pond aquaculture [...] and the widespread mangrove deforestation associated with it [...] is shown to be a strategy endorsed and supported by national and international development agencies. What is often overlooked, however, is the local ecological and economic importance of mangrove ecosystems. This study examines the effects of mangrove removal and fishpond development on the entitlements of people in three coastal communities in the Philippines. Aquacultural development is shown to have detrimental effects on the integrity of the coastal ecosystem and the livelihoods of certain groups of local residents; a rich common property resource is converted into a privately-owned system of cultivation. While benefits accrue to those with access to the capital necessary for the construction of fishponds, the costs of development are borne largely by mangrove gatherers and <b>artisanal</b> <b>fisherfolk,</b> whose share of a diminishing resource base is steadily declining. For these marginal groups, aquaculture is shown to provide few compensating economic benefits. The study supports, through concrete local evidence, the criticisms made of orthodox approaches to development, and the need to construct attitudes and strategies which are more attuned to local sustainability and equity...|$|E
