5|$|Clark is {{best known}} as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero</b> of the Revolutionary War in the West, {{especially}} {{as the leader of the}} secret expeditionary forces that captured Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in 1778–79. Some historians have suggested that the campaign supported American claims to the Northwest Territory during negotiations that resulted in the Treaty of Paris (1783).|$|E
5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero,</b> Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E
5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After {{a lull in}} hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems that}} he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E

5|$|Harrison lost {{a bid for}} Senate in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support to mount {{a run for the}} House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as the}} Whig Party. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero</b> with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E
5|$|Kent Hughes was Chairman of the Organising Committee for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. His {{chairmanship}} {{was widely}} judged a success, {{and he left}} a lasting legacy by engineering the sale of television rights, an Olympic first. Despite his high profile, Menzies removed Kent Hughes from his ministry in early 1956. He {{spent the rest of}} his career as a backbencher, dying in office in 1970. Kent Hughes was famous for his stubbornness and abrasive personality, particularly the insults he directed at opponents. He was sympathetic towards fascism early in his career (generally overlooked due to his later status as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero),</b> and later became an ardent anti-communist.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the guests}} arrive, they then begin eating their meal, when {{suddenly}} another guest {{arrives at the}} door. It is revealed to be Kevin Swanson, the son of Joe and Bonnie Swanson, whom they had presumed had died fighting {{in the war in}} Iraq. Overjoyed, they ask why the army had reported that he had died in action. Kevin then tells them a story that he was in a coma following a bomb that had been placed inside a turkey during Thanksgiving years before. Later, while having dessert, Kevin voices his distaste of the war, and reveals several inconsistencies about his time in Iraq. Kevin then tells his father that he had actually gone A.W.O.L., and because most of his unit was killed in the bombing but he miraculously survived, he faked his own death in order to leave the war and return home. Angered by his son's confession, Joe arrests him for the crime of desertion and handcuffs him {{with the rest of the}} family criticizing him for lying about being <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite this failure, {{which was}} {{lightened}} {{by the fact}} that he only kept one part of the ship, Almeida recovered quickly. As captain of the schooner Caroline, and later the Kemp, Almeida captured over 35 British ships and earned $300,000 in net profit.

25|$|When {{he succeeded}} {{to the throne}} in January 1848, he was almost at once met by the demands for a constitution. The Schleswig-Holsteiners wanted an {{independent}} state while the Danes wished to maintain South Jutland as a Danish area. The king soon yielded to the Danish demands, and in March he accepted the end of absolutism, {{which resulted in the}} June Constitution of 1849. During the First War of Schleswig against the German powers in 1848–51, Frederick appeared as ”the national leader” and was regarded almost as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero,</b> despite having never taken any active part in the struggles.|$|E
25|$|Geary {{was active}} in the state militia as a teenager. In December 1846, during the Mexican-American War, he was {{commissioned}} in the 2nd Pennsylvania Infantry, serving as lieutenant colonel. He led the regiment heroically at Chapultepec, and was wounded five times in the process. Geary was an excellent target for enemy fire: a huge man for that era, he stood six feet six inches tall, 260 pounds (118kg) and solidly built. Altogether, he was wounded at least ten times in his military career. Geary's exploits at Belén Gate earned him the rank of colonel and he returned home <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E
