25|$|As well as {{sharing the}} same seven actors, the trilogy was also written {{to use the same}} set: a flat in the London Docklands, where Ayckbourn himself owns a flat. Beyond that, there was no {{intentional}} link between the plays, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> the name Damsels in Distress was chosen was that the plays all happened to include a female character in some sort of trouble. However, there were nonetheless a number of common themes that arose from the plays' settings: flats owned by well-to-do Londoners who know little of who their neighbours are or what they do; and seedy vices left behind from London's old East End coming back to haunt them. The plays also shared themes common to most Ayckbourn plays.|$|E
25|$|On the December 11, 1995 {{episode of}} Monday Nitro, Orndorff confronted Brian Pillman after Pillman made {{derogatory}} comments about Orndorff. After telling Flair and Anderson {{how much he}} respected them, Orndorff told Pillman {{that he could have}} been a Horseman <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> Pillman was a Horseman was because he turned it down. Anderson and Flair tried to calm Orndorff down but Orndorff lost his temper and attacked Pillman. Pillman, Flair, and Anderson attacked Orndorff and then Arn Anderson and Ric Flair delivered a spike piledriver to Orndorff on the arena floor during the attack. WCW later explained that Orndorff had been seriously hurt in the attack and that his career was over. In actuality, Orndorff was forced to retire due to his previous injuries in the WWF, with the entire right side of his body beginning to atrophy (eventually causing his arm and leg muscles to shrink). It was something he had worked through as best he could {{but by the end of}} 1995 he was forced to retire and started to work as a trainer and a road agent for WCW. At the 2000 Fall Brawl, in a match between The Filthy Animals and The Natural Born Thrillers, Orndorff suffered a neck injury after delivering a piledriver. The referee, Charles Robinson stopped the match as a result.|$|E

[...] "We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: {{a day and a half}} for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing." ...|$|E

50|$|The Anglos in Texas were Americans, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> {{they had}} not been annexed by the United States in 1836 were {{northern}} Congressional resistance to another slave state and a dispute with Mexico over the southern boundary of Texas.
