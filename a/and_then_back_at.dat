25|$|In 1995, Finch and Morgan-McClure {{decided to}} resurrect the No. 4 Kodak Busch Series car. Purvis would drive {{the car in}} nine races, the most starts in a season to date. Purvis had a career season, {{finishing}} ninth at Atlanta and Charlotte, 12th at Michigan, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Charlotte, he set his career best finish of third. He also won the pole at Talladega once again, setting his sights on a full 1996.|$|E

She then sailed to Bougie, Algeria, arriving on 1 April.|$|E
60|$|Captain Jim {{looked at}} them all affectionately <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> Leslie's vivid face and glowing eyes.|$|R

2500|$|In January 1933 monthly talks by Ford {{began with}} a {{regional}} conference of five communities held in Yonkers, New York. In February she spoke at the Bahá'í Center, March at a chapter of the Women's International League for Peace, April to the All-Gandhi World Fellowship, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the Bahá'í Center, May at the [...] "World's Good Will Day" [...] observance, June back at the Bahá'í Center, and in July, before going on to give talks at Green Acre later in July, and a Race Amity conference there in August, which is her last known appearance there. It was in July that she published recollections of her pilgrimage, and this race amity conference was noted in the Baha'i News as well. In August/September attended the 1933 World Parliament of Religions. In October Ford was at the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition {{as one of the}} representatives of the national community, as well as at a local community meeting in Toledo, Ohio.

60|$|The miner glanced {{round at}} the heap of ore which betrayed his craft, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the dark, bearded, impassive face.|$|E
60|$|She {{threw back}} the curtain {{and took his}} arm. The table was laid for two. He looked at it in bewilderment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... "And ugly. Don't forget that--and ugly. Look {{where you}} like. Look near you, here abroad where you are, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> home, whence you came." ...|$|R
50|$|In March 1993, {{in order}} to switch from 89.1 to 91.9 and reduce {{interference}} to WECT, WFSS signed off for five days <b>and</b> <b>then</b> came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 30,000 watts before finally going back to 100,000 watts.|$|R
60|$|The blow {{from the}} bully angered Tom greatly, and skating forward {{he made a}} pass at Koswell. But the latter ducked, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Tom with a blow that sent the fun-loving Rover into several {{students}} standing by.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Dixon {{tried to}} speak, but 'er temper {{was too much}} for 'er. She looked from her 'usband to Charlie and Bob <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 'im agin and caught 'er breath.|$|E
60|$|He departed, {{closing the}} door behind him. Francis held out his hands to Margaret. She rose slowly to her feet, looked in the glass helplessly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. She was very {{beautiful}} but a little dazed.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{mind was}} evidently {{occupied}} with watching Rollo. She looked {{first at the}} rock and island, where Mr. Holiday was pointing, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Rollo, until at length Mr. Holiday, perceiving that her mind was disturbed by Rollo's motions, said to him, ...|$|E
60|$|Arthur Inglewood glanced curiously for {{an instant}} at the huge {{creature}} {{at the foot of}} the table, who was fitting a paper figure with a cocked hat, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Dr. Pym, who was concluding in a quieter tone.|$|R
60|$|He laughed. It was {{absurd to}} admit it, but nothing had pleased {{him so much}} since the coming of his misfortune! She was {{thoughtful}} for some time, every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> glancing <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the newspaper. Over their coffee she broke into a little reminiscent laugh.|$|R
60|$|James Van Teyl glanced curiously at the small, dark figure {{standing}} patiently before him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> {{the wireless}} cable which he {{held in his}} fingers. He was just back from a tiring day in Wall Street, and was reclining in the most comfortable easy-chair of his Hotel Plaza sitting-room.|$|R
6000|$|They {{looked at}} each other, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the closed door. “That man can {{scarcely}} hobble, and his hands are tied,” said one. “Go back and rattle at the lock, and he will {{think it is the}} key. Then if you are quick you may find Tomasa while I tell the Alcalde.” ...|$|E
60|$|His friend {{stared at}} him aghast, but made no movement. He looked at the {{unconscious}} Poppy, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the mouthing figure seated on the scuttle. His brain was numbed. Then a little performance on Charlie’s part {{a week or two}} before, which had cost that gentleman his berth, occurred to him, and he moved slowly forward.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that they}} were where the scheme could be carried into execution, Carrots {{was by no means}} {{confident}} it would be a success, and actually felt rather timid about making the attempt; but, urged on by Teenie, he finally mustered up courage to open the door of the office. He stood on the threshold, gazing first at the attorney <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> his friend.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} his residency, Fallon {{spent six years}} practicing emergency medicine, first in the Atlanta, Georgia area, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> in Denver <b>at</b> Exempla Lutheran emergency group.|$|R
60|$|When {{he reached}} the spot and heard that Harry {{had been brought to}} bank, he leapt out, climbed the mound, wrapped him in his coat, carried him down to his gig, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> drove <b>back</b> <b>at</b> full speed to Stokebridge, where with the aid of hot {{blankets}} and stimulants the lad was brought back to consciousness.|$|R
50|$|Danby's {{atmospheric}} work An Enchanted Island, successfully {{exhibited in}} 1825 at the British Institution <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> in Bristol <b>at</b> the Bristol Institution, was in turn particularly influential on other Bristol School artists.|$|R
60|$|A little {{spiral of}} curling smoke rose from {{one corner of}} the pyre--the flames licked upward, crackling. La stood there like a {{beautiful}} statue of despair gazing at Tarzan and at the spreading flames. In a moment they would reach out and grasp him. From the tangled forest came the sound of cracking limbs and crashing trunks--Tantor was coming down upon them, a huge Juggernaut of the jungle. The priests were becoming uneasy. They cast apprehensive glances {{in the direction of the}} approaching elephant <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> La.|$|E
60|$|Next {{they turned}} to the {{business}} table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor's hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, {{to serve as a}} testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.|$|E
60|$|Her {{husband was}} pleased that she should remain so long before them. And for a while, as she stood lost in contemplation, he did not speak. Once she glanced at him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the stern face of the General,--stern, yet kindly. The eyes, deep-set under bushy brows, like Hugh's, were full of fire; and yet the artist had made them human, too. A dark, reddish brown, close-trimmed {{mustache}} and beard hid the mouth and chin. Hugh had inherited the nose, but the father's forehead was wider and fuller. Hugh was at once a newer type, and an older. The face and figure of the General were characteristic of the mid-century American of the northern states, a mixture of boldness and caution and Puritanism, who had won his battles in war and commerce by a certain native quality of mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they are}} not foundered already they will be unless we do {{something}} for them at once. Let's rub them down thoroughly, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> start them <b>back</b> <b>at</b> a walk." ...|$|R
50|$|Werner Gerlach, the German consul, {{was also}} alerted to the aircraft. Suspecting {{what was about}} to happen, he drove down to the harbour with a German associate. With the use of binoculars, he {{confirmed}} his fears <b>and</b> <b>then</b> hurried <b>back.</b> <b>At</b> home, he arranged for the burning of his documents and tried unsuccessfully to reach the Icelandic foreign minister by telephone.|$|R
50|$|An {{illusion}} turn (or simply illusion) {{is performed}} {{by keeping the}} working leg aligned with the torso while, simultaneously, a 360 degree spin is executed while the torso pivots down <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> up <b>at</b> the hip. An illusion can be performed by turning toward or away from the working leg; the latter {{is known as a}} reverse illusion. Illusions are commonly performed in jazz dance and rhythmic gymnastics.|$|R
6000|$|The {{newcomer}} {{looked at}} him and then at the two figures upon the floor, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him again with eyes at once quizzical and cunning. Then his face broke into a grin that might hardly be called of drollery. [...] "Accident!" [...] quoth he. [...] "By the blood! d'ye see 'tis a strange accident, indeed, that lays two men by the heels and lets the third go without a scratch!" [...] Delivering himself thus, he came forward into the room, and, taking the last victim of Jonathan's adventure by the arm, with as little compunction as he would have handled a sack of grain he dragged the limp and helpless figure from where it lay to the floor beside the first victim. Then, lifting the lighted candle, he bent over the two prostrate bodies, holding the illumination close to the lineaments first of one and then of the other. He looked at them very carefully for a long while, with the closest and most intent scrutiny, and in perfect silence. [...] "They are both as dead," [...] says he, [...] "as Davy Jones, and, whoever you be, I protest that you have done your business the most completest that I ever saw in all of my life." ...|$|E
60|$|Garvell was {{patting the}} neck of his horse, which was {{inclined}} to fidget, and disregarding me. He nodded {{over his shoulder and}} followed. His movement seemed to release a train of memories in her. She glanced suddenly at him <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me with a flash of recognition that warmed instantly to a faint smile. She hesitated as if to speak to me, smiled broadly and understandingly and turned to follow the others. All three broke into a canter and she did not look back. I stood for a second or so at the crossing of the lanes, watching her recede, and then became aware that my uncle was already some paces off and talking over his shoulder in the belief that I was close behind. I turned about and strode to overtake him. My mind was full of Beatrice and this surprise. I remembered her simply as a Normandy. I'd clean forgotten that Garvell was the son and she the step-daughter of our neighbour, Lady Osprey. Indeed, I'd probably forgotten at that time that we had Lady Osprey as a neighbour. There was no reason at all for remembering it. It was amazing to find her in this Surrey countryside, when I'd never thought of her as living anywhere in the world but at Bladesover Park, near forty miles and twenty years away. She was so alive--so unchanged! The same quick warm blood was in her cheeks. It seemed only yesterday that we had kissed among the bracken stems....|$|E

60|$|A {{week later}} Frank and Harry and Jake sailed {{out in the}} sloop to {{intercept}} the south-bound steamer. She came up, with side-wheels churning a broad track of foam and her smoke trail streaming astern. When her engines stopped, Frank and Harry dropped into the canoe {{and in a few}} minutes they were alongside. Frank swung himself up on board <b>and</b> <b>then</b> looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the canoe.|$|R
5000|$|The tour {{began on}} 1 July 2017 in Germany, with an {{individual}} time trial that started and finished in Düsseldorf. The flat course started alongside the Messe Düsseldorf and followed the right bank of the Rhine, southwards, before crossing the river at the [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> crossing <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the [...] After the intermediate time check at the Königsallee, the route headed back towards the Messe Düsseldorf.|$|R

He took a basic {{training}} as an electrician, beginning an apprenticeship in 1950. After four years of apprenticeship at Dalen Portland Cementfabrikk, he took one year at the Oslo School of Elementary Technics and learned strong current. He worked at sea for one year, <b>and</b> was <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Dalen Portland from 1958 to 1962.|$|R
