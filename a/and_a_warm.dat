5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, a warm sector, {{a region of}} warm surface air between a cold front <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> front, was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front. Large scale lift {{was supported by a}} very strong jet stream aloft, with strong vertical shear evident, conducive for rotating thunderstorms and tornadoes. Instability increased overnight with temperatures and dew points increasing through the pre-dawn hours. For example, northwest of Orlando, temperatures were still at , which was about 3 degrees warmer than the average high for the day and 14 degrees warmer than the average low. The conditions helped to form a long-tracked supercell thunderstorm that traveled from Sumter County to the coastal waters of Volusia County during {{the early morning hours of}} February 2, 2007, producing three tornadoes along its track.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, {{that he would}} find better prospects <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> welcome in Australia, {{and he decided to}} emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} possessed {{a combination of}} tropical and subtropical characteristics; it remained attached to a nearby frontal zone, though {{the organization of the}} convection <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> core within the system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone. Forecasters had predicted {{the depression}} would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). However, the depression steadily organized and had strengthened into Tropical Storm Juan by early September25. Juan moved northwestward at around 10mph (16km/h) in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east. On September26, an eye feature developed, and very deep convection increased around the circulation. The cloud pattern continued to consolidate, and Juan attained hurricane status later on September26 while located 165mi (270km) southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear, allowing for additional strengthening; by September27, Juan had attained a peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) while located 635mi (1,020km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. At this peak strength, the eye of the hurricane was distinct and embedded within a well-defined and round central dense overcast.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} Hurricane Alice on January 3 and confirmed {{the existence of}} the tropical cyclone by reporting winds between 60 and 65mph (95 to 105km/h) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> core center. It is estimated Alice continued to intensify as it tracked southwestward in the Caribbean Sea, and attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) while located about 95miles (150km) west-northwest of Montserrat. While near its peak the hurricane developed a ring of convection around its eye, and Alice maintained peak winds for about 24hours until cold air from the north weakened it. Extratropical cyclogenesis occurred north of Bermuda on January 3, which weakened the high pressure system to the north of Alice and turned the flow in the Caribbean Sea to that of cold northwesterly winds. Alice turned to the southeast on January 4 and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Convection gradually became disorganized, and after weakening to a tropical depression on January 5, Alice dissipated on January 6 while located about 100miles (160km) west-northwest of Grenada.|$|E

25|$|The {{company had}} a strict policy {{that they would}} not {{purchase}} any horses that were broke. The company wanted their horses trained exclusively for staging, a process that generally took three months, even then they were never truly broken and had to be expertly handled. A hostler would lead the teams out to the stages only once the baggage had been secured and the passengers and driver were safely seated. Once harnessed to the stage, the reins were given to the driver and he could release the brake. The stage horses often leaped and reared {{at the start of a}} trip, but settled into a smooth trot once they were underway. The whip rarely had to be used to encourage them, as they knew the next station meant a good feed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> stable.|$|E
25|$|Early on 13 March, Gafilo {{arrived at}} the Indian Ocean as a {{tropical}} disturbance; JTWC cancelled a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system because of the less organised low-level circulation centre and moderate vertical wind shear. Gafilo transferred into a subtropical depression south of La Réunion on 14 March, when the deep convective activity was intensifying with better organisation of a small cluster above the low-level circulation centre due to good upper-level divergence <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> sea surface temperature of 26°C to 29°C. After attaining minor peak intensity in its subtropical period late on 14 March, Gafilo began to track eastward and transitioned into an extratropical depression on 15 March. Owing to a building subtropical ridge located to the southwest, the extratropical depression slowed down and turned northwestwards on 16 March. After slowly weakening, the system completely dissipated on 18 March.|$|E

500|$|Fronts are {{generally}} guided by winds aloft, {{but do not}} move as quickly. [...] Cold fronts and occluded fronts in the Northern Hemisphere usually travel from the northwest to southeast, while warm fronts move more poleward with time. In the Northern Hemisphere a warm front moves from southwest to northeast. In the Southern Hemisphere, the reverse is true; a cold front usually moves from southwest to northeast, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> front moves from northwest to southeast. Movement is largely caused by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the Coriolis effect, which is caused by Earth's spinning about its axis. Frontal zones can be slowed down by geographic features like mountains and large bodies of warm water.|$|E
500|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{activity in}} a tropical cyclone produces intense rainfall, potentially resulting in flooding, mudslides, and landslides.

[...] The wet environment {{in the aftermath of}} a tropical cyclone, combined with the destruction of sanitation facilities <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> tropical climate, can induce epidemics of disease which claim lives long after the storm passes. [...] Infections of cuts and bruises can be greatly amplified by wading in sewage-polluted water. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding also contribute to mosquito-borne illnesses. Furthermore, crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation.|$|E

500|$|The storm system {{responsible}} for the tornado outbreak resulted from the unusual congruence of a cold, dry system, originating in the Four Corners <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm,</b> moist system, moving north out of Texas. Complicating factors included daytime heating and a strong wind field favorable {{to the creation of}} circulating thunderstorms. On the second day, the stronger cold front limited discrete supercell activity and the risk of tornadoes decreased significantly. A squall line, however, produced high winds and rain along the river valleys, primarily those of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. This squall line continued to renew its energy as it passed through the Midwest, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and New England, causing wind and water damage, and dumping [...] of snow in central and eastern Massachusetts.
