5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and <b>adolescents</b> <b>are</b> negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, <b>adolescents</b> <b>are</b> more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The {{present study was}} con-ducted in the year 2008. 116 children in {{the age group of}} 10 to 19 years studying in high school of peri urban area Wardha were examined.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the relationships of locus of control with personal beliefs about superstition and luck expressed by Sicilian middle and late adolescents enrolled from two Public Senior High Schools in East Sicily (Italy). A self- report questionnaire formed by two Semantic Differentials, referred to the concepts of “luck” and “superstition”, the Locus of Control of Behavior Scale (LoC: Craig et al., 1984), the Personal Beliefs in Superstition Scale, and the Personal Beliefs in Good Luck Scale (Darke & Freedman, 1997) were used. Results showed that late <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> more internally LoC-believers than middle ones, while middle <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> more externally LoC-believers than late ones. Middle <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> more superstitious and greatly believed in good luck than late ones. The more the <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> internally LoC-believers, the less they believed in superstition; on the contrary, the more the <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> externally LoC-believers, the more they’ve put their faith in superstition and good luck. Future researches could be addressed toward the influence of personality factors and resilience on beliefs about superstition and luck...|$|R
5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and <b>adolescents</b> <b>are</b> negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or <b>adolescents</b> <b>are</b> given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E
