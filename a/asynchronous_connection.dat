40|$|Active {{systems are}} {{a class of}} discrete-event systems modeled as {{networks}} of nondeterministic automata communicating through either synchronous or <b>asynchronous</b> <b>connection</b> links. The model-based diagnosis of an active system is carried out by first reconstructing its behavior based on the observation, from which faults are later derived. The complexity of behavior reconstruction is exacerbated {{by the possibility of}} queuing events within links, thereby making essential the simulation of the order in which events are buffered within links. Unfortunately some sequences of events may lead to blind alleys in the search space. This is especially critical if events exchanged among components are assumed to be uncertain, as the number of alternative sequences of queued events is still larger. Therefore, behavior reconstruction without any prospection in the search space is generally bound to detrimental backtracking. To make diagnosis of active systems more efficient, we present an off-line technique for processing the models inherent to the system at hand so as to automatically generate prospection knowledge relevant to the mode in which events are produced and consumed over links. Such a knowledge is then exploited on-line, when the diagnostic engine is running, to guide the search process, thus reducing both time and space...|$|E

This is an overhead of 20%, so a 9,600 bit/s asynchronous serial link will not transmit data at 9600/8 bytes per second (1200 byte/s) but actually, in this case 9600/10 bytes per second (960 byte/s), which is considerably slower than expected.|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} devices {{making use of}} Bluetooth cable-replacement {{technology}} has rapidly increased in numbers thanks {{to the amount of}} implementations in cellular telephones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. Instead of the point-to-point technique used today the wireless community demands more sophisticated solutions to transmit information between two devices, e. g. using a chat program within an ad-hoc network. However, Bluetooth provides neither a routing protocol, nor is the slave/slave bridge, which is an important enabler for point-to-multipoint communication in so-called scatternets, implemented in hardware. Another issue relates to the time-to-connect which determines the usability of Bluetooth in scenarios where the units move around. In order to build research on these topics on trustworthy ground, we first address the validation of a Bluetooth simulation model, implementing the Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) technique of Bluetooth version 1. 1 in a correct way. A potential source of problems in reference simulation models has been identified and corrections are described. Next, an improvement is presented for the pseudo random hop sequence regarding the distribution of frequencies used in the Adapted Channel Hopping (ACH) scheme for Bluetooth version 1. 2. Further, the impact of the random backoff boundary, which determines the duration of the inquiry procedure and thus of the time-to-connect, is studied by simulation. Obviously, the settings of this parameter contained in the specification leads to suboptimal behaviour. In this thesis, a lower random backoff boundary parameter is suggested, which yields much faster time-to-connect. Finally, the Modified Reverse Path Forwarding (MRPF) routing algorithm for Bluetooth is proposed. This algorithm reduces the amount of connections needed to transmit <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Connection</b> Less (ACL) data packets as compared to the standard RPF, at the cost of additional overhead. Altogether, especially with the proposed improvements of Bluetooth performance, this technology can be considered to be well suited for nomadic scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The wind {{electricity}} generated has increased {{significantly in the}} last decade, the causes for this increase are many, such as, {{it has been used}} to meet CO 2 and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals set by the World governments; it {{can be used as a}} safe guard against fuel price volatility; and its competitiveness with conventional electricity generation in term of cost of electricity and construction. With increased wind power penetration into the grid, its influence on the power system operation is becoming significantly and requirements for its integration are becoming more restricted. The main two requirements are: 1. Capable of providing voltage/reactive power support to the grid. 2. Capable of riding through the faults (fault ride-through capability). Synchronous connection of offshore wind farms using ac submarine cable has several shortcomings, such as flow of charging current in the cables which increase the power losses and reduces its current carrying capability; fault in the grid may significantly affect wind farm operation due to its poor fault ride through capability and increases the risk of voltage collapse due to lack of reactive power support; and it has distance limitations. It has been recognized that the grid integration of a large offshore wind farms using dc transmission systems (HVDC) based on voltage source converters (VSC) has several features, such as: 1. Ability to transmit large amount of power over long distances with minimum losses. 2. Converter stations can be used as (STATCOM) to regulate voltage of both AC sides. 3. It improves fault ride-through capability of the wind farms; in other words, fault in the grid side will not affect the wind farm operation due to decoupling feature of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>connection.</b> In this paper, grid integration of a large offshore wind farm using VSC-HVDC transmission system in parallel with ac subsea cable is presented. The converter stations of dc transmission are used as static synchronous compensators to provide dynamic reactive power support in both sides of the ac submarine cable. Whilst the ac submarine cable provides a reference frequency to the wind farm and simplifies its converter control. The advantages of the proposed configuration are: it improves system stability and reliability, It eliminates the need for STATCOM in the wind farm side in order to increase the effective short circuit ratio and potential lose of supply due to fault in dc or ac transmission system is minimal. Computer simulation in MATLAB-SIMULINK environment will be used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed configuration...|$|E

However, the bytes are normally gathered together, so that even with a maximal overhead of 64 bits, frames carrying more than 24 bytes are more efficient than <b>asynchronous</b> serial <b>connections.</b> As frames can vary in size because they can have different numbers of bytes being carried as data, this means the overhead of an HDLC connection is not fixed.|$|R

30|$|From the {{analysis}} of the harmonic transfer through the VSC, the origins of inter-harmonics in the ac systems and the dc grid of a multi-terminal VSC-based HVDC system are pointed out in this paper. Because the system has <b>asynchronous</b> HVDC <b>connections</b> whose ac grids differ from frequency, dc-side characteristic harmonics of one end converter will be the ripples to the other end converter. Consequently, these ripples could induce inter-harmonics in every ac system. Moreover, a background harmonic in one end ac system will be transferred to produce a series of inter-harmonics in the other end ac systems with different fundamental frequencies. The magnification of these inter-harmonics strongly depends on the operating configurations of the dc grid. One further important point to note is that the dc capacitors of the three-level NPC VSCs could cause low-frequency inter-harmonics to be produced in every ac system, especially the negative-sequence sub-harmonics, which have smaller frequencies than the system frequency. In all cases, the power contribution of all connected ac systems also has certain influence on the harmonic interaction in the entire system.|$|R
