5|$|Nicholas had {{no impact}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, and impact {{from the low}} that <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> storm was limited to rainfall, gusty winds, and rough surf. Nicholas extended the above-average levels of tropical cyclone activity throughout the 2003 season, {{and was one of}} fourteen seasons to reach fourteen storms. The low that <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> storm nearly developed into a tropical cyclone, which would have been called Odette. However, moderate wind shear prevented further development.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, {{to combat the}} threat posed by the Soviet Navy and other fleets of the Warsaw Pact. It ceased to exist in 1969 when it was subsumed into the newly formed Strike Command, which had also <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later also absorbed Air Support Command, the former Transport Command.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, Thanos {{learns that}} the only way for him to repair the flaw in the {{universe}} would be to destroy the universe and re-construct it. He is finally driven to mindless rage by the attempt of the cosmic powers to usurp his reign, and decides in one fateful, final moment to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> entirety of the universe back into himself, so that none might ever again threaten his reign. Thanos is thus able to use the Heart's power to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> cosmic beings into himself—and, in doing so, he <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> entire multiverse.|$|R

5|$|Among Episcopalians, Qualified Chapels {{used the}} English Book of Common Prayer. They {{installed}} organs and hired musicians, following {{the practice in}} English parish churches, singing in the liturgy as well as metrical psalms, while the non-jurors had to worship covertly and less elaborately. When the two branches united in the 1790s, the non-juring branch soon <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.|$|E
5|$|Fausto's {{regeneration}} {{north of}} Hawaii was unusual but not unprecedented. The other time this happened since 1966 {{was in the}} 1975 season. That time, another TUTT <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> remnant of Hurricane Ilsa, {{which led to the}} formation of an unnamed hurricane at high latitude. Other tropical cyclones have strengthened north of Hawaii, but the actual formation of one is rare.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{competition}} from small unregulated bus operators reduced {{the profitability of}} the road transport operations, leading the UERL's directors to seek government regulation.

While the total land area was recorded as 14,735 dunams (14.7km² or 1,473.5 hectares) in 1997, the total built-up {{areas of the}} city consist of between 7,000 and 8,000 dunams (7–8km² or 700-800 hectares.) Deir al-Balah is divided into 29 administrative areas.|$|E
5|$|Three {{long-lived}} anticyclonic features termed white ovals {{were observed}} in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> third in 2000, becoming Oval BA.|$|E
5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of its}} {{establishment}} in 1973, the British Library <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near Boston Spa in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the site had housed a World War II Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Thorp Arch, which closed in 1957. When the NLL {{became part of the}} British Library in 1973 it changed its name to the British Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the British Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the British Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.|$|E
5|$|As the Mongols of the Ilkhanate {{continued}} {{to move towards}} the Holy Land, city after city fell to the Mongols. The typical Mongol pattern was to give a region one chance to surrender. If the target acquiesced, the Mongols <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> populace and warriors into their own Mongol army, which they would then use to further expand the empire. If a community did not surrender, the Mongols forcefully took the settlement or settlements and slaughtered everyone they found. Faced with the option of subjugation to or combat with the nearby Mongol horde, many communities chose the former, including some Christian realms.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} {{construction}} of the MR extension from London to Aylesbury was underway, and on 1 July 1891 the MR <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. Sir Harry Verney died on 12 February 1894, and on 31 March 1894 the MR took over services on the A from the GWR. On 1 July 1894 the MR extension to Aylesbury was completed, giving the MR a unified route from London to Verney Junction. The MR embarked on upgrading and rebuilding stations along the line.|$|E
