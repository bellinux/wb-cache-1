40|$|We haveâ€˜implemented'a {{software}} package for our IBM 360 / 370 system at SLAC, which we {{use in the}} development of stand alone LSI- 11 software systems. Included in this package are: * XASMll- a cross assembler which handles a substantial subset of MACRO- 11 * PL- 11 - a cross compiler for a structured programming language designed around the PDP- 11 instruction set * FORTRAN- FORTRAN code is compiled under RT: 11, and the object modules are transmitted to the IBM 360 / 370 for translation and integration * XLCVT- a conversion program which takes as input standard DEC DOS/RT- 11 object modules or LIBR files, or object modules produced by PL- 11 and XASMll; it converts them to a form suitable for input to XLINKll * XLINKll- a cross linker which takes in relocatable object modules and outputs a DEC DOS/RT- 11 <b>absolute</b> <b>loader</b> format module, or a format suitable for an IBM 360 / 370 PDP- 11 simulator * REFORM/EPROM- conversion programs which take as input a DEC DOS <b>absolute</b> <b>loader</b> format module generated by XLINKll and convert it to a format suitable for downloading into an LSI- 11 or for burning into EPROM's * XREF- a cross reference program which takes as input a PDS of XLINKll type object modules, and outputs cross reference tables and information on each of the modules * WYLBUR execute files- several files of commands which may be executed from the terminal to create jobs in response to simple prompts * KERNEL- a set of MACRO- 11 and PL- 11 routines which have been burnt into 2708 EPROM's and include a terminal emulator, a down line loader, and several utility routines for the LSI- 11 All of this was accomplished by using the facilities already available on our IBM 3601370 system. Most of this package has been in regular use since Spring 1976, although new features are still being added. The manpower cost of researching, organizing, developing, and integrating the tools has paid off well in terms of programmer productivity, source code readability, accessibility, and integrity...|$|E
