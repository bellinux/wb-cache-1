25|$|The {{launch of}} the Stock Exchange <b>Automated</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>System</b> (SEATS). It {{was a far cry}} from the {{original}} system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based call system, which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each listed security in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It was replaced by the 'post' system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on 'posts' or 'boards'. 'Chalkies' were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the bids and offers of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Everything {{came to a}} {{standstill}} after the Islamic Revolution leading in a prohibition against interest-based activities and nationalization of major banks and industrial giants. [...] Mobilization of all resources towards the war effort during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war did not help matters. Following {{the end of the}} war, the 1988 Budget Act re-established activity on the TSE, and within eight years the exchange saw its numbers rise to 249 companies listed. The Government fully embraced economic reforms and a privatization initiative in 1989 with a surge of activity in share activity of many state-owned companies through the defined targets in the first [...] "Five-Year Economic Reform" [...] where the Government together with the Parliament defined the economic prospects of the country for the coming five years. Attention to promotion of the private sector and new interest in the TSE brought life back to the market. However, lack of regulation and out-of-date legal framework led to crisis in the market leading to certain [...] "meltdowns". Over the 1996 to 2000 period an <b>automated</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> was introduced, and a number of important regulatory mechanisms were strengthened. The market has experienced its share of highs and lows in the past years including topping the World Federation of Exchanges' list in terms of performance in 2004. [...] As of May 2014, TSE has had three bear market in its history: August 1996-July 1998 (-32%); December 2004-July 2006 (-34%); and during the financial crisis of 2007–08 (-38%). In 2014, after reaching historic highs, TSE lost a quarter [...] of its total market capitalization because of the collapse of the Iranian rial and the slump in oil prices. It was also decided in 2014 that some banks and financial institutions attached to the government inject money into the stock market through a fund called the Market Development Fund which is aimed at market making and decreasing the fluctuations in the stock market.|$|E

50|$|The {{change in}} United States' {{teaching}} and becoming more technology based, {{is due to}} the changing environment on Wall Street and other financial markets.

40|$|Software agents, auctions, {{financial}} markets, <b>automated</b> <b>trading,</b> computational finance, ExPo. <b>Automated</b> <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> in {{the global}} financial markets are increasingly being deployed to do jobs previously done by skilled human traders: very often a human trader in the markets simply cannot tell whether the counter-party to a trade is another human, or a machine. Clearly, <b>automated</b> <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> can easily be considered as “intelligent ” software agents. In this paper we report on experiments with software traderagents running the well-known “AA ” and “ZIP ” strategies, often used as reference benchmarks in previously published studies; here we suggest disambiguated standard implementations of these algorithms. Then, using Exchange Portal (ExPo), an open-source financial exchange simulation platform designed for real-time behavioural economic experiments involving human traders and/or trader-agents, we explore the impact of introducing a new method for assignment adaptation in ZIP. Results show that markets containing only assignmentadaptive (ASAD) agents equilibrate more quickly after market shocks than markets containing only “standard” ZIP agents. However, perhaps counter-intuitively, in mixed heterogeneous populations of ASAD agents and ZIP agents, ZIP agents outperform ASAD agents. Evidence suggests that the behaviour of ASAD agents act as a new signal in the market that ZIP agents then use to beneficially alter their own behaviour, {{to the detriment of}} the ASAD agents themselves. ...|$|R
