It differs from <b>a</b> fallout <b>shelter,</b> in that its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure instead of from radioactive precipitation, as <b>a</b> fallout <b>shelter</b> does. It is also possible for <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> to protect from both blasts and fallout.|$|R

5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{but these}} are hard to obtain. Seeds do not require any {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 37 to 40 days to germinate. Propagation by cutting has not been attempted, but might be possible, since the closely related B.cuneata has been propagated this way, albeit with unpredictable results. The plant should be grown in deep, acidic to neutral sand at <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> site. It is recommended to prune it when young, to encourage branching.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} Corfu alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> French sea {{from which they}} could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with only}} two {{teachers}} and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> workshop at Geylang, a residential home at Tampines {{as well as their}} main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.|$|E

50|$|A Stevenson {{screen or}} {{instrument}} <b>shelter</b> is <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> or <b>an</b> enclosure to shield meteorological instruments against precipitation and direct heat radiation from outside sources, while still allowing air to circulate freely around them. It forms {{part of a}} standard weather station. The Stevenson screen holds instruments that may include thermometers (ordinary, maximum/minimum), a hygrometer, a psychrometer, a dewcell, a barometer and a thermograph. Stevenson screens may also be known as <b>a</b> cotton region <b>shelter,</b> <b>an</b> instrument <b>shelter,</b> <b>a</b> thermometer <b>shelter,</b> <b>a</b> thermoscreen or a thermometer screen. Its purpose {{is to provide a}} standardised environment in which to measure temperature, humidity, dewpoint and atmospheric pressure.|$|R
5|$|In November 1907 {{six more}} {{families}} consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, which has <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> beach. Meanwhile, {{the plight of}} the Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster. Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced to two months in prison. Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living there. Only six families remained on Mingulay itself, and all of them planned to leave.|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> position, and {{generally}} require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Martinique of 1809 {{was a successful}} British amphibious operation against the French West Indian island of Martinique that took place between 30 January and 24 February 1809 during the West Indies Campaign 1804–1810 of the Napoleonic Wars. Martinique, like nearby Guadeloupe, was {{a major threat to}} British trade in the Caribbean, providing <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> base from which privateers and French Navy warships could raid British shipping and disrupt the trade routes that maintained the British economy. The islands also provided a focus for larger scale French operations in the region and in the autumn of 1808, following the Spanish alliance with Britain, the Admiralty decided to order a British squadron to neutralise the threat, beginning with Martinique.|$|E

5|$|The keep was {{surrounded}} by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle. The marshes nearby were drained turning the village of Orford into <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, with the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth. Some of the timbers were brought {{from as far away as}} Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously from local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|Until the 18th century, Bombay {{consisted}} of seven islands separated by shallow sea. These seven islands {{were part of}} a larger archipelago in the Arabian sea, off the western coast of India. The date of city's founding is unclear—historians trace back urban settlement to the late 17th century after the British secured the seven islands from the Portuguese to establish a secure base in the region. The islands provided the British with <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> harbour for trade, in addition to a relatively sequestered location that reduced the chances of land-based attacks. Over the next two centuries, the British dominated the region, first securing the archipelago from the Portuguese, and later defeating the Marathas to secure the hinterland.|$|E
5|$|A halt {{was called}} for Christmas while {{supplies}} were brought up. Units had a rest day. Most dined on turkey, ham, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding, and Christmas services were held. General Blamey insisted that Christmas fare be available to all units, and extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} carry out his directive. In one instance, a Piper Cub of No. 4 Squadron RAAF dropped Christmas fare to a Papuan Company on a long range patrol. The advance resumed on 27 December, preceded by air strikes by 18 B-25 Mitchell and 12 Boston bombers. The 2/15th Infantry Battalion and tanks of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion took the lead on 31 December; they reached Sialum on 2 January 1944. This had <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> beach which served as a maintenance area. That day, the American landing at Saidor placed a large force across the Japanese escape route.|$|E

5|$|After passing The Lizard {{the path}} turns northwards, {{continuing}} past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed {{at very low}} tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round {{the head of the}} creek to reach Dennis Head {{at the mouth of the}} Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through Manaccan.|$|E
5|$|Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912– 30 April 1945) was the {{longtime}} companion of Adolf Hitler and, for fewer than 40 hours, his wife. Braun met Hitler in Munich {{when she was}} a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer; she began seeing him often about two years later. She attempted suicide twice during their early relationship. By 1936, she was a part of his household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden and lived <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> life throughout World War II. Braun was a photographer, and many of the surviving colour photographs and films of Hitler were taken by her. She was a key figure within Hitler's inner social circle, but did not attend public events with him until mid-1944, when her sister Gretl married Hermann Fegelein, the SS liaison officer on his staff.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on <b>a</b> <b>sheltered</b> ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|E
