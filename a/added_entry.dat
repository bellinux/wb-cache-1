30|$|The content {{retrieval}} in CCN is as follows. When {{an interest}} packet arrives on any face, a lookup at the CS {{is done on}} the basis of its content name. If the matched content data is found in the CS, then the data packet is served that consumes the interest packet. If the content is not found in the CS, it is compared against the PIT to check whether it has already received another request for the same content. If a match is found in the PIT, then the CCN device adds the face on which the new interest packet arrived. When the data packet that consumes the interest arrives at the device, it is replicated and sent out on all faces in the PIT entry for the content. If the content name matches neither the CS nor the PIT, then the FIB is referenced to determine the outgoing face where the interest packet should be forwarded. Moreover, an entry is added to the PIT for the forwarded interest packet. From the <b>added</b> <b>entry,</b> the received data packet can be sent back to the original content requester. That is, data packet processing is relatively simple since data is not routed but simply follows the chain of PIT entries back to the original requestor.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new characteristic of jets called mass area. It is defined so as to measure the susceptibility of the jet's mass to contamination from soft background. The mass area is a close relative of the recently introduced catchment area of jets. We define it also in two variants: passive and active. As a preparatory step, we generalise the results for passive and active areas of two-particle jets to the case where the two constituent particles have arbitrary transverse momenta. As a main part of our study, we use the mass area to analyse a range of modern jet algorithms acting on simple one and two-particle systems. We find {{a whole variety of}} behaviours of passive and active mass areas depending on the algorithm, relative hardness of particles or their separation. We also study mass areas of jets from Monte Carlo simulations as well as give an example of how the concept of mass area can be used to correct jets for contamination from pileup. Our results show that the information provided by the mass area can be very useful in a range of jet-based analyses.

40|$|IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PRACTICE FOR GOVERNMENT-DESIGNATED PARKS, FORESTS, ETC. In September 2004, the Cataloging Policy and Support Office {{announced}} a proposed {{change in policy}} regarding the establishment of headings for government-designated parks and forests. The proposal was intended to address {{the fact that these}} headings are most often needed as subject headings for works about these parks and forests, but are occasionally needed as main or added entries for works emanating from the administrative entities that manage or oversee them. The essential point of the proposal was that any such park or forest could potentially be represented by two separate headings, one designating the physical, geographic entity (established as a subject heading tagged 151, usually with a geographic qualifier), and one designating the corporate, administrative entity (established as a name heading tagged 110, with the qualifier (Agency)). CPSO invited comments on the proposal for a ninety-day period, with a deadline date of December 31, 2004. A substantial plurality of those who submitted comments supported the proposal. Most of those who did not support it favored instead the establishment of only a single heading for each park or forest. This might be either a name heading that would be usable also as a subject heading, or a subject heading that would be coded as also valid for use as a main or <b>added</b> <b>entry...</b>|$|E
40|$|We present {{methods to}} control the lexicon size when {{learning}} a Combinatory Categorial Grammar semantic parser.
