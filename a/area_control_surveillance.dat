The system consists of two applications. In the scheduling application, inputs from various sources are compiled, allowing both a powerful query capability and the production of a weekly schedule of activities for the facilities and personnel assigned to FACSFAC. The exercise results application provides an automated method of gathering and querying pertinent tactical employment and range utilization data for required weekly, monthly and quarterly reports.

50|$|Navy {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} perform duties similar to civilian {{air traffic controllers}} and {{play a key role}} in the effective use of naval airpower throughout the world in operational and training environments. Navy ACs are responsible for safely and effectively directing aircraft operating from airfields or the decks of aircraft carriers. They also control the movement of aircraft and vehicles on airfield taxiways and issue flight instructions to pilots by radio. Air traffic controllers provide air traffic control services in air traffic control towers, radar air traffic <b>control</b> facilities, fleet <b>area</b> <b>control</b> and <b>surveillance</b> facilities, and air operations offices ashore and afloat. They also operate radio communication systems and light signals, direct aircraft under visual flight rules and instrument flight rules conditions, and operate surveillance radar, precision radar, data link approach systems and secondary surveillance radar (IFF) equipment. Other tasks include operation of ground and shipboard controlled approach systems, response to emergency air traffic situations, maintenance of current flight planning information and reference material, assistance of pilots in preparation and processing flight plans and clearances. Standards for entry into the AC field are high, but once accepted into the field, Navy ACs enjoy a demanding and highly rewarding career. This is a five-year enlistment program.|$|R

40|$|Robust {{communications}} {{are key to}} {{the success}} of naval operations such as <b>area</b> <b>surveillance,</b> <b>control,</b> and interdiction. Communication and sensor networks allow the flow of data and critical information that is necessary for conducting an operation from both the tactical and strategic perspectives. In naval operations, the platforms are hardly stationary, as the networking infrastructure operates from a variety of platforms in motion on the sea, above the sea, and from space, in the case of satellite support. Sensor networks consist of nodes made up of small sensors that are able to monitor, process, and analyze phenomena over geographical regions of varying sizes and for significant periods. Some categories of these small, and sometimes low-cost, sensors are able to collect and transmit, or relay, sensor data about physical values (e. g., temperature, humidity, and sea state), or dynamic attributes of objects, such as speed, direction, and the existence of dangerous substances (e. g., radioactive materials and explosives). The objective of this thesis is to examine how unstructured sensor networks, known also as ad-hoc sensor networks, can effectively support maritime interdiction operations and regional security by providing reliable communications and flow of information.

40|$|The malaria burden in Viet Nam {{has been}} in decline in recent decades, but {{localised}} areas of high transmission remain. We used spatiotemporal analytical tools to determine the social and environmental drivers of malaria risk and to identify residual high-risk <b>areas</b> where <b>control</b> and <b>surveillance</b> resources can be targeted. Counts of reported Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria cases by month (January 2007 -December 2008) and by district were assembled. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models were developed in a Bayesian framework. Models had {{the percentage of the}} district's population living below the poverty line, percent of the district covered by forest, median elevation, median long-term average precipitation, and minimum temperature included as fixed effects, and terms for temporal trend and residual district-level spatial autocorrelation. Strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in counts of malaria cases was apparent. Poverty and forest cover were significantly associated with an increased count of malaria cases but the magnitude and direction of associations between climate and malaria varied by socio-ecological zone. There was a declining trend in counts of malaria cases during the study period. After accounting for the social and environmental fixed effects, substantial spatial heterogeneity was still evident. Unmeasured factors which may contribute to this residual variation include malaria control activities, population migration and accessibility to health care. Forest-related activities and factors encompassed by poverty indicators are major drivers of malaria incidence in Viet Nam. © 2010 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc...|$|R
