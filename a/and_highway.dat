5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length).

The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges <b>and</b> <b>highway</b> infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The hurricane's heavy {{rainfall}} resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain. This, combined with strong winds, damaged 60,475homes, of which 3,481 were completely destroyed.

High winds downed power lines, trees, and telephone poles, leaving many in eastern Cuba without electricity {{in the aftermath of}} the storm. Along the coast, severe flooding washed out railroad <b>and</b> <b>highway</b> bridges. Though eastern Cuba was the area most affected, the central and western portion of the island, including Havana, experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts. There, strong waves broke over the seawall, and caused heavy flood damage to some of the town's old buildings.|$|E
