5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnace.</b> The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%.

40|$|AbstractCarbon oxides (COx) have a {{negative}} impact on the steelworkers, environment and populations. The aim of this paper is to assess the COx emissions from steelmaking in the electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnaces,</b> in order to improve the gaseous emissions management, an essential factor for sustainable development, by identifying the most polluting technological stages of this process. The experimental researches were carried out on two electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnaces</b> with alkaline lining. The measurement of COx emissions was performed using a Maxilyzer computer for burned gases automated analysis. After evaluating the emissions of COx during steelmaking in electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnaces,</b> it results that: the most significant emissions have been generated at the end of the melting and refining stage; in terms of pollution by COx, the most polluting stages are melting and refining; the level of COx emissions from electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnaces</b> depends on the carbon content of material input. The reduction of COx emissions to the steelmaking in the electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnaces</b> is possible by charge component selection and by the use of raw materials with reduced carbon content...|$|R

5|$|Annual world {{production}} of yttrium oxide had reached 600tonnes by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons. Global reserves of yttrium oxide were estimated in 2014 {{to be more}} than 500,000 tons. The leading countries for these reserves included Australia, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy. The temperature of an <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> of greater than 1,600°C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{neptunium}} carbides NpC, Np2C3, and NpC2 (tentative) {{have been}} reported, {{but have not}} characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel. NpC is a non-stoichiometric compound, and could be better labelled as NpCx (0.82 ≤ x ≤ 0.96). It may {{be obtained from the}} reaction of neptunium hydride with graphite at 1400°C or by heating the constituent elements together in an electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> using a tungsten electrode. It reacts with excess carbon to form pure Np2C3. NpC2 is formed from heating NpO2 in a graphite crucible at 2660–2800°C.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the basic}} oxygen process was {{introduced}} at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the basic Bessemer process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), {{reducing the amount of}} nitrogen uptake into the steel. The {{basic oxygen process}} is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where scrap steel only is melted with an electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnace.</b> These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.|$|E
25|$|Graphite {{electrodes}} {{carry the}} electricity that melts scrap iron and steel, and sometimes direct-reduced iron (DRI), in electric arc furnaces, {{which are the}} vast majority of steel furnaces. They are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch. They are then extruded and shaped, baked to carbonize the binder (pitch), and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000°C, at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite. They can vary in size up to 11feet long and 30 inches in diameter. An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> itself is getting more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode. An estimate based on USGS data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197,000 tonnes in 2005.|$|E

The earliest successes were reported by James Ballantyne Hannay in 1879 and by Ferdinand Frédéric Henri Moissan in 1893. Their method involved heating charcoal at up to 3500°C with iron inside a carbon crucible in a furnace. Whereas Hannay used a flame-heated tube, Moissan applied his newly developed electric <b>arc</b> <b>furnace,</b> in which an electric arc was struck between carbon rods inside blocks of lime. The molten iron was then rapidly cooled by immersion in water. The contraction generated by the cooling supposedly produced the high pressure required to transform graphite into diamond.
