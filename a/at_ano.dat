Simulation up to 6 Hz proves that the intensities of IX <b>at</b> the <b>Ano</b> Liosia suburban area was due to proximity and directivity of the source, as well as due to complex 3 D site effects. The simulated ground acceleration locally exceeds 0. 6 g, and the response spectra indicate major effects at 2 - 4 Hz...|$|R
