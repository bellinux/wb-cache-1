5|$|The 5th Mechanised Corps (Military Unit Number 4664) began forming on 1 July 1940 {{as part of}} the 16th Army in the Transbaikal Military District. The corps' {{headquarters}} and the 17th Tank Division were formed <b>at</b> <b>Crossing</b> 77 and the 13th Tank Division <b>at</b> <b>Crossing</b> 76 of the Molotov Railway. It was commanded by Lieutenant General Makar Teryokhin. The corps' headquarters was formed from the headquarters of the 51st Rifle Corps. The 13th Tank Division was formed from the 15th Light Tank Brigade. The 17th Tank Division was formed from the 37th Light Tank Brigade and included the 199th Flamethrower and 526th Transport Battalions. The 109th Motorised Division, formerly of the 12th Rifle Corps, joined the corps at Kharanor. On 11 March 1941 Major General Ilya Alekseyenko, the 17th Tank Division commander, became the corps' commander. The corps was ordered to redeploy west with the 16th Army on 25 May. It was loaded onto trains with the 57th Tank Division and moved west. On 12 June the corps arrived in the Kiev Military District and was unloaded from the trains. Corps headquarters, the 13th Tank Division, and the 109th Motorised Division were located at Berdichev. The 17th Tank Division was located at Isyaslav.|$|E
5|$|The large {{populations of}} {{tortoises}} and marine turtles on Rodrigues {{resulted in the}} export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.|$|E

5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Roma had {{a chance}} to equalise in the 27th minute, but Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar saved Conti's low shot. Neal was shown a yellow card in the 32nd minute for {{bringing}} down Conti, and a few minutes later Liverpool had an opportunity to extend their lead. Liverpool striker Rush charged down Dario Bonetti's clearance and ran onto the ball, but his shot was saved by Tancredi. With minutes remaining until half-time, Roma equalised. Sebastiano Nela passed to Conti, who ran down the left-hand side of the pitch. His first attempt <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> the ball into the penalty area was blocked by a combination of Neal and Mark Lawrenson, but his cross rebounded back to him. His second attempt found Roberto Pruzzo in the penalty area, whose glancing header went into the Liverpool goal to level the scores at 1–1.|$|E

25|$|The 17th Tank Division {{was formed}} in July 1940 <b>at</b> <b>Crossing</b> 77 with the 5th Mechanised Corps from the 37th Light Tank Brigade. It also {{included}} the 199th Flamethrower and 526th Transport Battalions. The 17th Tank Division's structure in 1941 included the 33rd and 34th Tank Regiments, the 17th Motor Rifle Regiment, the 17th Howitzer Artillery Regiment, the 17th Reconnaissance Battalion, the 17th Transport Battalion and the 17th Maintenance Battalion. The division was commanded by Major General Ilya Alekseyenko. On 1 March 1941 Colonel Ivan Korchagin took command. Beginning on 12 June 1941 the division was relocated to Izyaslav.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} {{colonization}} of America, the Northwest Passage {{had always been}} of special interest since it was speculated that it could offer a shortcut to Asia. Many attempts <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> were made but very few succeeded due to the very unforgiving conditions that prevail in the Canadian Arctic {{for most of the}} year. The British explorer Sir John Franklin actually found a passage between 1845 and 1847 but this achievement was not known until years later as he and his crew had perished on the journey. Robert McClure was the first explorer to survive the expedition in 1850 but he completed the journey on a sled. It is only in 1906 that the passage was navigated entirely on water by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. However, construction of the Panama Canal had already begun at that time and its completion in 1914 lessened the need for this route.|$|E
25|$|The {{state-owned}} company Russian Railways (abbreviated as РЖД) operates most of rail services {{across the country}} and is crucial for the rail transport in Russia. High-speed rail services are available between Moscow and St Petersburg, between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, and between St Petersburg and Helsinki (Finland). European Russia and the Russian Far East are connected by rail via the Trans-Siberian Railway. A train trip from Moscow to Vladivostok takes 6 days. Russia uses the 1,524mm (5ft) track gauge, which is also shared by all the former Soviet republics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan), Mongolia, and is practically identical with the rail gauge of Finland. Trains crossing the border between Russia (Belarus, Ukraine) and EU member states (except the Baltic states and Finland) or between Russia and China, stop at special crossing points where each carriage is lifted for its bogies to be changed. Trains remain <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> points for up to 2 hours.|$|E

500|$|The species' {{movements}} are poorly understood, variously described as resident, nomadic or migratory. [...] Population {{numbers have been}} reported as fluctuating in some areas with local movements possibly related to the flowering of preferred mangrove and Melaleuca food trees, {{and there is some}} indication that the birds can travel more widely. A single bird was recaptured after being banded nearly five years earlier, [...] from the original banding site, and the species' occupation {{of a large number of}} offshore islands suggests that the red-headed myzomela is effective <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> distances over water.

500|$|After the setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{took more}} than six weeks in {{planning}} and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> the Danube. From 30 June to {{the early days of}} July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, with more than [...] troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Charles received the French with [...] of his own men. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram, which also lasted two days, Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then. Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat. Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching well over [...] casualties. The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately, but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July.|$|E
500|$|The {{district}} {{has changed over}} the years as various architectural designs have evolved to compliment it. [...] The boulevard was widened between 1909 and 1910 causing the Art Institute of Chicago Building to have to move the lions guarding its entrance back 12 feet. [...] At that time, the Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue intersection (the end of route 66) was known as [...] "route center". [...] Also at that time, the boulevard had no streets crossing it and extending eastward, and thus, the Jackson intersection was a T intersection. [...] This was still true in 1920 when the Michigan Avenue Bridge opened and increased traffic by connecting this boulevard with the Magnificent Mile and the community north of the Chicago River a quarter mile to the north of this district. [...] The Fountain of the Great Lakes (installed in 1913) was highly visible from route center. [...] Today, four streets cross Michigan Avenue within the district (in addition to its northern and southern endpoints <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> streets). [...] Three of the four change names as they cross Michigan: eastbound East Monroe Street (100 south) becomes East Monroe Drive; eastbound East Jackson Boulevard (300 south) becomes East Jackson Drive; and two-way East Congress Parkway (500 south) becomes East Congress Drive as it crosses into Grant Park to the east. East Balbo Drive (700 south) does not change names as it crosses Michigan.|$|E

500|$|After {{the defeat}} at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{took more than}} six weeks in {{planning}} and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt <b>at</b> <b>crossing</b> the Danube. The French brought in more troops, more guns, and instituted better defensive measures to ensure {{the success of the}} next crossing. From 30 June to the early days of July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, no less than 188,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Immediate resistance to the French advance was restricted to the outpost divisions of Nordmann and Johann von Klenau; the main Habsburg army was stationed five miles (8km) away, centred on the village of Wagram. After a successful crossing, Napoleon ordered an attack along the entire line so as to prevent the Austrians from escaping during the night. Furious assaults by the [...] "Terrible 57th" [...] Infantry Regiment and the elite 10th Light Infantry Regiment against the village of Baumersdorf led to an almost immediate French victory, but ultimately, the Austrians did not budge and kept the French from pressing further. Incessant attacks by the heroic Austrian Vincent Chevaulegers' cavalry forced the 10th and the 57th to retreat, leaving the French with no gains. Further attacks {{to the left of the}} line by Eugène and MacDonald also produced nothing. Bernadotte's troops attacked later with equally disappointing results, and on the right Davout decided to disengage in the darkness of the night. The first day ended with the French on the Marchfeld but with little results to show for their efforts.|$|E
