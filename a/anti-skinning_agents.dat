40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the therapeutic properties of the seeds and leaves of Moringa oleifera Lam as herbal medi-cines. Ethanol extracts showed anti-fungal activities in vitro against dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagro-phytes, Epidermophyton Xoccosum, and Microsporum canis. GC–MS analysis of the chemical composition of the essential oil from leaves showed a total of 44 compounds. Isolated extracts could be of use for the future development of <b>anti-skin</b> disease <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of free radicals and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) {{in the skin}} plays {{a very important role}} in skin aging. Both are known to interact with each other. Therefore, natural compounds or extracts that possess both antioxidant and antiglycation activities might have great antiageing potential. Akebia quinata fruit extract (AQFE) has been used to treat urinary tract inflammatory disease in traditional Korean and Chinese medicines. In the present study, AQFE was demonstrated to possess antioxidant and antiglycation activity. AQFE protects human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) from oxidative stress and inhibits cellular senescence induced by oxidative stress. We also found that AQFE inhibits glycation reaction between BSA and glucose. The antiglycation activity of AQFE was dose-dependent. In addition, the antiglycation activity of AQFE was confirmed in a human skin explant model. AQFE reduced CML expression and stimulated fibrillin- 1 expression in comparison to the methyglyoxal treatment. In addition, the possibility of the extract as an <b>anti-skin</b> aging <b>agent</b> has also been clinically validated. Our analysis of the crow’s feet wrinkle showed that there was a decrease in the depth of deep furrows in RI treated with AQFE cream over an eight-week period. The overall results suggest that AQFE may work as an <b>anti-skin</b> aging <b>agent</b> by preventing oxidative stress and other complications associated with AGEs formation...|$|R
40|$|The antiaging {{effect of}} Inula britannica flower total {{flavonoids}} (IBFTF) on aging mice induced by D-galactose and its mechanism was {{examined in this}} study. From the results, the biochemical indexes and histological analysis of skin tissues showed that IBFTF could effectively improve the antioxidant enzyme activity of the aging mice, enhance the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) of skin tissue, and decrease the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Besides, IBFTF could maintain the skin collagen, hydroxyproline (Hyp), dermal thickness, and moisture content. Meanwhile, IBFTF could significantly {{reduce the number of}} cells arrested in G 0 /G 1 phase, and {{from the point of view}} of protein and mRNA expression level in skin tissue, IBFTF could significantly increase the expression of Sirt 1 and CyclinD 1 but decrease the expression of p 16 and p 21, and its effect was not less than that of the well-known vitamin E (VE). Overall, these results seem to be implying that IBFTF is a potential natural <b>anti-skin</b> aging <b>agent</b> with great antioxidant ability...|$|R

40|$|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate {{conjugate}} (DHEA-S) are {{the most}} abundantly produced human adrenal steroids to be reduced with age. DHEA {{may be related to}} the process of skin aging through the regulation and degradation of extracelluar matrix protein. In this study, we demonstrate that DHEA can increase procollagen synthesis and inhibit collagen degradation by decreasing matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) - 1 synthesis and increasing tisuue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease (TIMP- 1) production in cultured dermal fibroblasts. DHEA was found to inhibit ultraviolet (UV) -induced MMP- 1 production and the UV-induced decrease of procollagen synthesis, probably due to the inhibition of UV-induced AP- 1 activity. DHEA (5 %) in ethanol:olive oil (1 : 2) was topically applied to buttock skin of volunteers 12 times over 4 weeks, and was found to significantly increase the expression of procollagen α 1 (I) mRNA and protein in both aged and young skin. On the other hand, topical DHEA significantly decreased the basal expression of MMP- 1 mRNA and protein, but increased the expression of TIMP- 1 protein in aged skin. We also found that DHEA induced the expressions of transforming growth factor-β 1 and connective tissue growth factor mRNA in cultured fibroblasts and aged skin, which may play a role in the DHEA-induced changes of procollagen and MMP- 1 expression. Our results suggest the possibility of using DHEA as an <b>anti-skin</b> aging <b>agent...</b>|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{incidence}} of ultraviolet B (UVB) -related skin problems has been increasing. Damages induced by UVB radiation are related to mutations that occur {{as a result of}} direct DNA damage and/or the production of reactive oxygen species. We investigated the anti-oxidant effects of a Polygonum multiflorum thumb extract against skin damage induced by UVB irradiation. Female SKH- 1 hairless mice were divided into three groups: control (N = 7), distilled water- (N = 10), and P. multiflorum extract-treated (PM, N = 10) groups. The PM (10 g) was extracted with 100 mL distilled water, cryo-dried and 9. 8 g was obtained. The animals received a topical application of 500 µL distilled water or PM extract (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 %, w/v, dissolved in distilled water) for 30 min after UVB irradiation (wavelength 280 - 320 nm, 300 mJ/cm²; 3 min) of the dorsal kin for 14 days, and skin immunohistochemistry and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) activity were determined. SOD 1 immunoreactivity, its protein levels and activities in the skin were significantly reduced by 70 % in the distilled water-treated group after UVB irradiation compared to control. However, in the PM extract-treated groups, SOD 1 immunoreactivity and its protein and activity levels increased in a dose-dependent manner (1 - 16 %, w/v, PM extract) compared to the distilled water-treated group. SOD 1 protein levels and activities in the groups treated with 8 and 16 %, w/v, PM extract recovered to 80 - 90 % of the control group levels after UVB. These results suggest that PM extract strongly inhibits the destruction of SOD 1 by UV radiation and probably contains <b>anti-skin</b> photoaging <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Options {{for skin}} cancer {{treatment}} currently include surgery, radiotherapy, topical chemotherapy, cryosurgery, curettage, and electrodes-sication. Although effective, surgery is costly and unsuitable for certain patients. Radiotherapy can leave a poor cosmetic effect, and current chemotherapy {{is limited by}} low cure rates and extended treatment schedules. Here, we describe the preclinical activity of a novel topical chemotherapeutic agent {{for the treatment of}} skin cancer, 3 -ingenyl angelate (PEP 005), a hydrophobic diterpene ester isolated from the plant Euphorbia peplus. Three daily topical applications of 42 nmol (18 mug) of PEP 005 cured a series of s. c. mouse tumors (B 16 melanoma, LK 2 UV-induced squamous cell carcinoma, and Lewis lung carcinoma; it = > 14 tumors/group) and human tumors (DO 4 melanoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and PC 3 and DU 145 prostate carcinoma; it = > 4 tumors/group) previously established (5 - 10 mm(3)) on C 57 BL/ 6 or Fox 1 (nu) mice. The treatment produced a mild, short-term erythema and eschar formation but, ultimately, resulted in excellent skin cosmesis. The LD 90 for PEP 005 for a panel of tumor cell lines was 180 - 220 muM. Electron microscopy showed that treatment with PEP 005 both ill vitro (230 tot) and ill vivo (42 nmol) rapidly caused swelling of mitochondria and cell death by primary necrosis. Cr- 51 release, uptake of propidium iodide, and staining with the mitochondria dye JC 1, revealed that PEP 005 (230 muM) treatment of tumor cells ill vitro resulted in a rapid plasma membrane perturbation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. PEP 005 thus emerges as a new topical <b>anti-skin</b> cancer <b>agent</b> that has a novel mode of action involving plasma membrane and mitochondrial disruption and primary necrosis, ultimately resulting in an excellent cosmetic outcome...|$|R
