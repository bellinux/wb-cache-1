Adrika was transformed by a curse into a fish, and lived in the Yamuna river.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{differences}} between the northern and southern Betsimisaraka, many major aspects of their culture are similar. Major customs among the Betsimisaraka include sambatra (circumcision), folanaka (the birth of a tenth child), ritual sacrifice of zebu for the <b>ancestors,</b> <b>and</b> celebrating the inauguration of a newly constructed house. Marriage, death, birth, the New Year and Independence Day are also communally celebrated. The practice of tromba (ritual spirit possession) is widespread among the Betsimisaraka. Both men and women act as mediums and spectators in these events.|$|E

Other characters include the 300-year-old human {{leader of the}} Society of Leopold, Leo Allatius—who has unnaturally extended his lifespan by consuming vampire blood— and the Setite leader Lucretia. During his journey, Christof comes into conflict with Vukodlak, a powerful Tzimisce vampire intent on usurping the clans' <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> taking their power for himself.

5|$|Prior to the 19th century, all {{education}} in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills {{as well as}} social and cultural values, including respect for <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> elders. The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810–28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese Rites {{controversy}} was {{a dispute}} among Roman Catholic missionaries over the religiosity of Confucianism and Chinese rituals during the 17th and 18th centuries. The debate centered over whether Chinese ritual practices of honoring family <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> other formal Confucian and Chinese imperial rites qualified as religious rites and were thus incompatible with Catholic belief. The Jesuits argued that these Chinese rites were secular rituals that were compatible with Christianity, within certain limits, and should thus be tolerated. The Dominicans and Franciscans, however, disagreed and reported {{the issue to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Sihanaka have a {{generally}} egalitarian social structure, with the eldest male {{at the head}} of the family. Traditional beliefs predominate, although Christianity has also had an influence. Social life here, as elsewhere in Madagascar, is guided by the principles of respect for the <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> the fady (taboos) established by them. Traditional social practices include complex funeral and divorce rites and a strong and continuing prohibition on working in paddy fields on Tuesdays.|$|E

5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, have faith in gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> all guests.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{believed}} to have evolved from mainland-based <b>ancestors,</b> <b>and</b> may share ancestors with C. melanosterna and C. palearis, as it is phylogenetically closer to these two than it is to C. similis. Access to Utila may have involved over-water dispersal during hurricanes, as is known for Iguana iguana in the Lesser Antilles or a land bridge to the mainland lost during the close of the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the lights to be <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> gave the area a wide berth out of respect.|$|E

5|$|The tarpan or European {{wild horse}} (Equus ferus ferus) {{was found in}} Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the {{historical}} era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo. Thus, the genetic line was lost. Attempts {{have been made to}} recreate the tarpan, which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> not true wild horses.|$|E
5|$|Tongkonan are {{the center}} of Torajan social life. The rituals {{associated}} with the tongkonan are important expressions of Torajan spiritual life, and therefore all family members are impelled to participate, because symbolically the tongkonan represents links to their <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> to living and future kin. According to Torajan myth, the first tongkonan was built in heaven on four poles, with a roof made of Indian cloth. When the first Torajan ancestor descended to earth, he imitated the house and held a large ceremony.|$|E
5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered <b>ancestors</b> <b>and</b> departed loved ones. At other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E
