40|$|In Europe, {{environmental}} and economic considerations are driving a revolution in power transmission and distribution. Specifically of interest to this paper, utility companies are increasingly using information and communication technology (ICT) {{to increase the efficiency}} and reliability of the grid, as well as to incorporate smaller-scale sources of intermittent wind and solar power into our electricity supply. This should {{have a positive effect on}} Europe's energy policy objectives. However, developments in the field of international security have made clear that increased reliance on ICT within the electricity sector will create new vulnerabilities that may undermine these gains. This paper argues that the European Union (EU) has the opportunity to mitigate these vulnerabilities by virtue of its strengthening regulatory position in the European market, and its record of promoting energy technology research. However, the organization will need to act now in recognizing that cyber security as an essential dimension of its energy policy. This paper recommends that the Commission acts now to <b>appoint</b> <b>a</b> <b>coordinator</b> to accelerate the adoption of sensitive institutional changes in this vein. It also suggests that the EU would benefit from cooperation with the United States [...] a country with strong cyber capabilities that would complement the European program.
