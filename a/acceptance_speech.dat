Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

He storms off the stage amidst boos and thrown vegetables. Grampa gives the award to Bart and Lisa, and Bart swears never to watch an award show again, unless Billy Crystal is featured.|$|E
5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize <b>acceptance</b> <b>speech.</b>|$|E

5|$|Liu was {{the first}} person of Chinese {{nationality}} to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the first to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China.

After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.|$|E

5|$|Oldham's Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo-classical {{town hall}} built in 1841, {{eight years before}} Oldham {{received}} its borough status. One of the last purpose-built town halls in northwest England, it has a tetrastyle Ionic portico, copied from the temple of Ceres, on the River Ilissos, near Athens. Winston Churchill made his inaugural <b>acceptance</b> <b>speech</b> from {{the steps of the}} town hall when he was first elected as a Conservative MP in 1900. A Blue Plaque on the exterior of the building commemorates the event. Long existing as the political centre of the town, complete with courtrooms, the structure has stood empty since the mid-1980s and has regularly been earmarked for redevelopment as part of regeneration project proposals, but none have been actioned.|$|E

5|$|Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking {{re-election}} did not campaign, Taft spoke publicly only once, {{making his}} nomination <b>acceptance</b> <b>speech</b> on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded {{he could not}} win, and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had no illusions he would win his race. He had hoped to send his cabinet officers {{out on the campaign}} trail, but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him.|$|E
5|$|At their nominating {{convention}} in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat Simon B. Buckner, a former Confederate general. In his <b>acceptance</b> <b>speech,</b> Bradley implored Kentuckians {{to realize that}} the Civil War was over and to discontinue their practice of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office. His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high protective tariff, and developing the state's resources. He pointed out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than Pennsylvania, the state bought half of its coal from that state. A similar situation existed with regard to lumber. He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations. Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and {{the construction of a new}} state penitentiary. Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.|$|E
