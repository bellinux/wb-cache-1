5000|$|The {{function}} of a vapor barrier is to retard the migration of water vapor, which are not typically intended to retard the migration of air. This is the {{function of}} <b>air</b> <b>barriers.</b> [...] <b>Air</b> is mixed with water vapor.

In the strictest sense <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> are also vapor barriers when they control the transport of moisture-laden air. [...] It must be mentioned that the designated perm ratings do not reflect the diminished permeability of a given vapor retarder medium when affected by temperature differences on opposing sides of the medium.

50|$|Passive {{house is}} {{designed}} so {{that most of the}} air exchange with exterior is done by controlled ventilation through a heat-exchanger in order to minimize heat loss (or gain, depending on climate), so uncontrolled air leaks are best avoided. Another reason is the passive house standard makes extensive use of insulation which usually requires a careful management of moisture and dew points.

40|$|Magnetic {{circuitry}} computation {{is one of}} {{the central}} stages of designing a synchronous motor with incorporated magnets, which can be performed by means of a simplified method of the magnetic-circuits equivalent modeling. The article studies the magnetic circuit of the motor with the rotor-incorporated magnets, which includes four sectors: constant magnets with the field pole extension made of magnetically soft steel, magniflux dispersion sections containing <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> and steel bridges; the air gap; the stator grooves, cogs and the frame yoke. The authors introduce an equivalent model of the magnetic circuit. High-energy magnets with a linear demagnetization curve are employed in the capacity of constant magnets. Two magnets create the magnetic flux for one pole. The decline of magnetic potential in the steel of the pole is negligible consequent on the admission that the poles magnetic inductivity µ = ∞. The rotor design provides for the <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> and the steel bridges that close leakage flux. The induction-permeability curve linearization serves for the bridges magnetic saturation accountability and presents a polygonal line consisting of two linear sections. The estimation of the magnet circuit section including the cogs and the frame yoke is executed with account of the steel saturation, their magnetic conductivities thereat being dependent on the saturation rate. Relying on the equivalent model of the magnetic circuit, the authors deduce a system of two equations written from the first and the second Kirchhoff laws of the magnetic circuits. These equations allow solving two problems: specifying dimensions of the magnets by the preset value of the magnetic flow in the clearance and determining the clearance magnetic flow at the preset motor rotor-and-stator design. </p...|$|R

Two assemblies of simulated passenger bridge and aircraft were constructed, and airflow measurements were recorded to confirm airflow characteristics for several combinations of commercial units.

Batches of 20 or 200 insects of four species were released into the passenger bridge just before 25 persons passed through the assembly, then insects that entered the aircraft cabin were recovered.

50|$|Buildings {{designed}} with sustainable architecture principles use airtight technologies to conserve energy. Under low energy building, passive house, low-energy house, self-sufficient homes, zero energy building, and superinsulation standards, structures {{must be more}} air-tight than previously. <b>Air</b> <b>barriers,</b> careful sealing of construction joints and service penetrations (holes for pipes, etc.) achieve this. Airtightness minimizes the amount of warm (or cool) air that can pass through the structure, so the mechanical ventilation system can recover the heat before discharging air externally. Green buildings may include windows that combine triple-pane insulated glazing with argon or krypton gas to reduce thermal conductivity and increase efficiency. In landscape and exterior construction projects, airtight seals protect general service and landscape lighting electrical connections and splices. Many other specific applications must meet airtight standards to be waterproof or vapor-proof for human safety and proper function.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the {{performance}} of a 4 -pole SynRM is evaluated and compared to a reference 8 -pole PMSM of the same size, where the machines are used in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application. In order to perform a performance comparison between the machines, a design of the SynRM rotor is developed. The design is determined by using two different Mathematical Models that provides the size and position of the rotor <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> and iron segments. The final comparison between the SynRM and the PMSM shows that if the machines operates with the same current density in the stator windings, the average torque produced by the SynRM is approximately one third of the torque produced by the PMSM. If both machines are run with the same stator current, the average torque produced by the SynRM is slightly {{less than half of the}} torque in the PMSM and the torque ripple can be reduced to levels similar to the ones in the PMSM. The low performance is mainly due to rapid saturation along the d-axis, therefore, making the current angle one important factor. The efficiency is also slightly lower in the SynRM compared to the PMSM. As expected, when the machine is operated along the MTPA line, it shows improvement in efficiency and reduction in losses. The efficiency of the SynRM is only a few percent less than the efficiency of the PMSM. Overall, more study is needed in the field, mainly to see how an increased size and proper control affects the system. But also to see what impact higher insulation ratios have on the machine. The alignment of the <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> in the rotor against the stator slots is the single variable that effects the torque ripple the most. The SynRM also shows signs of saturation for low current, an issue that probably can be handled by the use of control strategies such as the MTPA combined with an increased rotor diameter. The saturation issue may also be reduced if it is being considered when developing a rotor design. Overall, the results in this thesis indicates that the SynRM is not a valid replacement for the PMSM in HEV applications with the design presented in this thesis...|$|R
