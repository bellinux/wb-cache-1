5|$|St-Calais {{was brought}} before the king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, before which the king seized his lands. At the trial, St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then asked for an <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> Rome, which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or lands, was forfeit. Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> Rome.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> {{social norms}} {{as a policy}} instrument to address consumption externalities. We explore whether <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> social norms can be an efficient policy instrument and compare the efficiency of such <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> the efficiency of taxation in addressing consumption externalities. We find that when the existing norm helps to shift consumption towards the socially optimal level of consumption, taxation welfare dominates <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> social norms as a policy tool. While previous {{studies have found that}} economic instruments are superior to information in other contexts, we arrive at a different conclusion for situations where the norm shifts behavior away from what is socially optimal. In such cases <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> social norms can be a better policy instrument than taxation. Social norms Policy instruments Externality...|$|R

5000|$|Intuitions are customarily <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> {{independently}} {{of any particular}} theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.

40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> intuition are weak {{arguments}} because intellectual intuition is an unreliable belief-forming process, since it yields incompatible verdicts {{in response to}} the same cases, and since the inference from 'It seems to S that p' to 'p' is unreliable. Since the reliability of intellectual intuition is a necessary condition for strong <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> intuition, it follows that <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> intuition are weak arguments...|$|R
