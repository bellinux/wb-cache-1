40|$|AbstractThe {{resilience}} {{literature is}} increasingly {{drawing attention to}} formal service provision {{as a means for}} social ecologies to support children's and youths' positive adjustment to challenging life circumstances. This article interrogates the universality and simplicity of this argument. Using a secondary data analysis of the life stories of 16 resilient, Black South African students from impoverished families, we show that education services predominated students' childhood and youth experience of formal support and that there was scant experience of other formal services. We theorise that contextual and cultural specifics informed the dominance of education services. However, this service did not consistently facilitate resilience processes. When it did, education services were characterised by active teacher–community connectedness and student responsiveness. Moreover, education service providers (i. e., teachers and principals) engaged in supportive actions that went beyond the scope of typical teacher tasks. Thus, we suggest that formal service facilitation of resilience processes is complex. It requires collaborative activity that might well demand <b>atypical</b> service <b>acts...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} the lingual and extralingual peculiarities of the performative speech acts of {{prohibition}} and permission in Ukrainian languages are investigated. Despite {{the presence of}} a significant amount of research on selected issues, we consider unsolved questions about the functioning of prohibition and permission acts as performative in Ukrainian speech, so this theme is still actual. The main task – to identify typical and <b>atypical</b> performative <b>acts</b> of prohibition and permission in Ukrainian language, full and modified syntactic constructions in which they operate, as well as contextual features, namely influence of extralinguistic factors on functioning of these acts, as appropriate. In the process of research we determined that the typical performative speech prohibition and permission acts are explicit performative verbs forbid, permit, allow, authorize, bless. The means of expression of so-called non-standard (non-typical) implementations serve performative modal verbs, verbs of denial, impersonal forms of the verb, passive verbs constructions, imperative forms of the verb, deverbalization. The full sentence form of implementation of these acts is complex sentences with subordinate elucidative part, modified form – asyndetic complex sentences, compound constructions, simple sentences.

To intensify actions adverbs are used, for its specificity – appeals, other nouns and phrases that serve to clarify individual speaker or addressee...|$|R
40|$|SummaryNeuronal growth cones select {{synaptic}} partners through {{interactions with}} multiple cell surfaces in their environment. Many of these interactions are adhesive, {{yet it is}} unclear how growth cones integrate adhesive cues to direct their movements. Here, we examine the mechanisms that enable photoreceptors in the Drosophila visual system to choose synaptic partners. We demonstrate that the classical cadherin, N-cadherin, and an <b>atypical</b> cadherin, Flamingo, <b>act</b> redundantly to instruct the targeting choices made by every photoreceptor axon. These molecules gradually bias the spatial distribution of growth cone filopodia, polarizing each growth cone toward its future synaptic target before direct contact with the target occurs. We demonstrate that these molecules are localized to distinct subcellular domains and create a network of adhesive interactions distributed across many growth cones. Because this network comprises multiple redundant interactions, a complex wiring diagram can be constructed with extraordinary fidelity, suggesting a general principle...|$|R
40|$|Asperger’s {{syndrome}} (AS) is under-recognized {{and may be}} misdiagnosed as schizophrenia {{in adults}} because of symptom overlap.

His impairing clinical features of AS improved markedly following treatment using aripiprazole, a novel <b>atypical</b> antipsychotic that <b>acts</b> as a partial agonist at dopamine D 2 receptors.

40|$|Once having {{defined the}} causa of an {{agreement}} (and, in general, of a juridical act, i. e. “negozio giuridico”) as its effective and objective purpose – the latter being the attitude of an act to realize a specific balance of interests (“causa concreta”) – the thesis is aimed at showing that the causa can be grounded (also) upon objective external referents, i. e. elements or circumstances which are able to constitute and influence the specific purpose of an act from an objective point of view, although they cannot per se be deduced from the subject matter (“oggetto”) {{and structure of the}} juridical act at hand. Such referents may consist in effects of different acts, or in facts and circumstances, including {{the context in which the}} act is concluded and will be performed. Through an analysis of different juridical figures – with particular regard to links between agreements, <b>atypical</b> gratuitous <b>acts</b> and “pagamento traslativo”, guarantees and unilateral obligations to keep harmless, and acts of waiver – the attention is focused on the relevance of concurrence of interests (also based on external referents) in order to assess the real and effective causa, even in absence of any exchange of counterperformances (“sinallagma”) or of any purpose of liberality. In light of the above, the thesis concludes dealing with some applicative consequences of the above-mentioned principles, with particular regard, on one side, to the assessment of validity and protectability of juridical acts and, on the other side, to the possibility to apply the remedies related to the termination of agreements when an external objective referent fails, even if the involved juridical act does not provide mutual counterperformances...|$|R
30|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) restricting subtype {{is defined}} as an {{individual}} that loses weight through dieting, fasting and/or excessive exercise over at least a three-month consecutive period. Characteristics of AN, such as the intense fear of gaining weight, disturbance {{in the perception of}} body shape and denial of the seriousness of extremely low body weight, have been compared to the signs of rigidity in psychosis and inflexibility of delusional disorders. Comorbid depression is also often seen in patients with AN. Therefore, <b>atypical</b> antipsychotics that <b>act</b> on both 5 -HT and dopamine receptors have recently been studied to monitor improvements in behavior and weight gain (Hagman et al. 2011). In addition, the minimal sedating effects of atypical antipsychotics may benefit patients that have concomitant anxiety, and could reduce or replace the use of SSRIs in the treatment of AN. Antidepressants have not been successful for weight gain in AN, yet are used to treat associated co-morbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. Current literature focuses primarily on short-term olanzapine use in patients with AN while they are admitted for inpatient therapy. This case report is a unique presentation of a female with AN that accomplished weight restoration with resumption of menses after long-term treatment with risperidone completely in an outpatient setting.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aripiprazole, a novel <b>atypical</b> {{antipsychotic}} that <b>acts</b> as {{a partial}} agonist at the dopamine D 2 receptors, {{has been reported}} to be effective in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. However, the risks and benefits of using aripiprazole in the acute hospital setting to treat severe psychotic disorders are unclear. This naturalistic study assessed the effectiveness of aripiprazole monotherapy in a group of actively psychotic male patients (n = 10) with schizophrenia who were admitted to an inner-city acute psychiatric unit. Most patients (n = 7) responded to aripiprazole treatment, which was well tolerated and significantly ameliorated psychotic symptoms after 2 – 3 weeks. Patients who responded to it could be safely discharged on aripiprazole monotherapy. Side effects observed were mostly mild and transient, and included extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 1) and neutropenia (n = 1). Aripiprazole also remarkably attenuated dyskinetic movements in 1 patient with severe tardive dyskinesia, thereby suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of other disorders that are also associated with dopamine dysfunction. Results showed that aripiprazole can be safely and effectively employed in the hospital setting to treat severely psychotic patients with schizophrenia, but further studies are required to establish the full range of adverse reactions and therapeutic indications associated with its use...|$|R

Patients and Methods We reviewed the case notes, radiology and histology of 75 patients, who had been treated for an ACT/grade I chondrosarcoma by curettage, phenolisation and bone allografting between 1994 and 2005. The first post-operative Gd-enhanced MRI scan was carried out within one year of surgery. Patients had {{a minimum of two}} scans and a mean follow-up of 72 months (13 to 169). Further surgery was undertaken in cases of suspected recurrence. Results In 14 patients (18. 6 %) a second procedure was undertaken after a mean period of 59 months (8 to 114). Radio frequency ablation (RFA) was used in lesions of = 10 mm. Only six of these (8 % of total) had a histologically-proven recurrence. No increase in tumour grade was seen at time of recurrence. Conclusion Based on this study, {{we have been able to}} classify the post-operative MRI appearances into four groups. These groups differ in follow-up, and have a different risk of recurrence of the lesion. Follow-up and treatment vary for the patients in each group.

40|$|Neuroleptic drugs, {{classified}} {{in typical}} and <b>atypical,</b> mainly <b>act</b> as D 2 dopamine receptor antagonists. D 2 and A 2 A receptors are co-expressed in the striatum where they structurally interact to form functional heterodimers. It {{has been demonstrated}} these receptors show a positive or negative functional cross-talk in dependence on their relative expression levels. To clarify the reciprocal interactions between adenosine and dopaminergic system in physiological conditions, we investigated the regulation of A 2 A adenosine receptor induced by D 2 receptor antagonists in PC 12 cells co-expressing both receptors in native conditions and in CHO cells co-expressing both receptors at levels comparable to those reported in striatum. In PC 12 {{we were able to}} detect both receptors in the monomeric and dimeric form. Moreover, after chronic treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol our results showed an increase of affinity and density of A 2 A receptor compared with the control, while treatment with atypical antipsychotics risperidone and clozapine did not show any significant difference. Treatment with haloperidol and risperidone showed an uncoupling of A 2 A receptor to G proteins and a significant decrease of cAMP levels. Chronic treatment with clozapine did not show any difference also in the G protein coupling and cAMP levels. In CHO cells our data showed that acute and chronic treatment with haloperidol increased the A 2 A AR affinity and responsiveness whereas no effects were detected with the atypical drug, clozapine. Otherwise, risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic but with high affinity for D 2 DR, after long treatment induced a significant decrease of A 2 A AR affinity and responsiveness. Our results ascertain that A 2 A receptors are modulated by typical antipsychotics and by risperidone which profile does not fully fit to the atypical antipsychotic profile and these effects depend on the receptor levels. Our data suggest adenosine system as an alternative target for pathologies characterized by dopamine system dysfunction. In the same way, since A 2 A receptors are involved in brain damage, individual control of antipsychotic therapy and the associated regulation of adenosine system, may represent an important goal to control neurodegenerative processes considered as an amplificatory loop in several psychiatric disorders...|$|R
40|$|Aripiprazole is an <b>atypical</b> {{antipsychotic}} that <b>acts</b> as {{a partial}} agonist at the dopamine D- 2 receptor. It has been mainly investigated in dopamine-based models of schizophrenia, while {{its effects on}} glutamate-based paradigms have remained to be further characterized. Due to its unique mechanism of action, aripiprazole has also been considered as a replacement medication for psychostimulant abuse. Thus, {{in the present study}} we tested the hypothesis that aripiprazole would prevent the motor hyperactivity induced by psychostimulant and psychotomimetic drugs that act either by dopaminergic or glutamatergic mechanisms. Male Swiss mice received injections of aripiprazole (0. 1 - 1 mg/kg) followed by drugs that enhance the dopamine-mediated neurotransmission, amphetamine (3 mg/kg) or cocaine (5 mg/kg), or by glutamate NMDA-receptor antagonists, ketamine (60 mg/kg) or MK- 801 (0. 4 mg/kg). Independent groups also received aripiprazole (0. 1 - 1 mg/kg) or haloperidol (0. 5 mg/kg) and were tested for catalepsy. All doses of aripiprazole were effective in preventing the motor stimulant effects of amphetamine and cocaine. Moreover, the higher dose also prevented the effects of ketamine and MK- 801. The present study reports the effects of aripiprazole in dopaminergic and glutamatergic models predictive of antipsychotic activity, suggesting that both may be useful for screening novel partial agonists with antipsychotic activity. It also shows that aripiprazole may prevent the acute effects of psychostimulant drugs without significant motor impairment. C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Tramadol is an {{unscheduled}} <b>atypical</b> analgesic that <b>acts</b> as an agonist at μ-opioid receptors and inhibits monoamine reuptake. Tramadol can suppress opioid withdrawal, {{and chronic}} administration can produce opioid physical dependence; however, diversion {{and abuse of}} tramadol is low. The present study further characterized tramadol in a three-choice discrimination procedure. Nondependent volunteers with active stimulant and opioid use (n = 8) participated in this residential laboratory study. Subjects were trained to discriminate between placebo, hydromorphone (8 mg), and methylphenidate (60 mg), and tests of acquisition confirmed that all volunteers could discriminate between the training drugs. The following drug conditions were then tested during discrimination test sessions: placebo, hydromorphone (4 and 8 mg), methylphenidate (30 and 60 mg), and tramadol (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg). In addition to discrimination measures, which included discrete choice, point distribution, and operant responding, subjective and physiological effects were measured for each test condition. Both doses of hydromorphone and methylphenidate were identified as hydromorphone- and methylphenidate-like, respectively. Lower doses of tramadol were generally identified as placebo, with higher doses (200 and 400 mg) identified as hydromorphone, or opioid-like. The highest dose of tramadol increased ratings on the stimulant scale, but was not significantly identified as methylphenidate-like. Tramadol did not significantly increase subjective ratings associated with reinforcement. Taken together, these results extend previous work with tramadol as a potential medication {{for the treatment of}} opioid dependence and withdrawal, showing acute doses of tramadol exhibit a profile of effects similar to opioid agonists and may have abuse liability in certain populations...|$|R
40|$|Background: A central <b>atypical</b> {{cartilaginous}} tumor (<b>ACT)</b> -formerly {{known as}} chondrosarcoma grade 1 (CS 1) -is a tumor of intermediate-type malignancy, often treated with surgery. The extent of surgery remains controversial, as some advocate resection and others favor local treatment by curettage. Because {{of the low}} prevalence of ACT/CS 1, the available data are limited and generally not uniform. The {{purpose of this study}} was to present the outcome for a large cohort of patients with ACT/CS 1 in the long bones who were treated with curettage and adjuvant phenolization and followed for a minimum of two years according to national guidelines. Methods: A retrospective study was designed to analyze data from 108 patients treated for central ACT/CS 1 in the long bones between 2006 and 2012. All patients were treated with curettage and adjuvant phenolization, and defects were filled with polymethylmethacrylate, bone graft, or bone substitutes. The primary end point was local recurrence or residual tumor. Secondary end points included the type and rate of complications and reoperations. Results: All patients were free from local recurrence at a mean follow-up of 48. 7 months (range, 24. 3 to 97. 5 months). Residual tumor was suspected in five patients, leading to a 95. 4 % disease-free survival rate. A fracture occurred in eleven patients (10. 2 %). Other complications were osseous penetration during the surgery (two patients), wound infection (one patient), arthrofibrosis (one patient), and skin necrosis (one patient). Tumor volume was related neither to the risk of fracture nor to the occurrence of residual tumor. Conclusions: In our experience, curettage of ACT/CS 1 in the long bones with adjuvant phenolization is safe, even with large tumors of up to 100 cm(3). Most worrisome is the risk of fracture, which occurred in 10. 2 % of our patients. Considering the relatively mild behavior of ACT/CS 1, less aggressive treatment, by observation or by minimally invasive surgery, could be the next step that should be evaluated prospectively...|$|R
40|$|The ectoparasitic monogenean fluke, Gyrodactylus salaris, is a {{parasite}} {{known to be}} highly pathogenic to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Although present in the environment of several neighbouring European countries, the UK {{is thought to be}} G. salaris-free, but, if national contingency plans to control this parasite are to be effective, it is vital that we understand the factors underlying its transmission from host to host. This study demonstrates that the majority of parasites transferring to new hosts are mature parasites that have reproduced at least once. Since, exploration and host transfer strategies pose a risk to survival; the parasite will endeavour to pass on its genes before attempting to transfer from one host to another. This study has also shown that when pregnant parasites are forced to leave their hosts, their offspring are aborted prematurely to ensure the survival of the mature parasite. Gyrodactylids do not possess a free-swimming stage in their life cycle, which allows for their migration between hosts. In spite of this, they are able to rapidly colonise naïve hosts, even in non-shoaling populations of fish. This study investigates the transmission strategies employed by detached parasites in the colonisation of new hosts. Observations of gyrodactylids collected from 3 -spine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus acuelatus, suggest that their activity increases as a stickleback approaches, alerting the host to its presence. The parasite is then ingested directly by the prospective host. A time series of experimental exposures and specimens prepared for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) suggest that once ingested, the parasites attach to the lining of the buccal cavity and then migrate out to their preferred colonisation site on the outer surface of the fish. It is proposed that this may be an alternative route for host infection. Similarly, direct ingestion by the scavenging on infected hosts by 3 -spine sticklebacks suggests another route of infection of new hosts. Although these routes of transmission may be of lesser significance, infections in the buccal cavity may be an important indicator for detection of infection and those personnel involved in screening fish for gyrodactylids should be aware that this is an area in which infections can occur. This study also demonstrated that the use of the anaesthetic 2 -phenoxyethanol does not affect the number of gyrodactylids which leave the host to colonise a new host. Additionally, observations of the transmission process suggest that turbulence produced by the movement of the fish’s fins may facilitate the transfer of detached parasites from the substrate. While this hypothesis appears to be supported by video evidence and photographic stills gathered throughout the duration of this study, further work should be conducted using particle tracking techniques to determine the efficacy of using a vortex effect as a means of colonising new hosts. Field sampling processes may have an effect on this type of research, giving rise to problems with the accurate diagnosis, management and control of gyrodactylids in a variety of fish. Gyrodactylus infected specimens of 3 -spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus L.) and stone loach (Barbatula barbatula L.) from one Scottish river were cohabited. The study found that small numbers of Gyrodactylus do transfer to atypical hosts. This study highlights that personnel involved in fish disease surveillance programmes {{should be aware of the}} consequences of transporting multiple species in the same transport vessel as gyrodactylids may infect species previously thought to be resistant. Equally, diagnosticians should be aware of the fact that <b>atypical</b> species may <b>act</b> as temporary hosts and that their gyrodactylid fauna should not be assumed. Non-feeding life-cycle stages, such as the dispersal stages of parasites, are dependant for survival upon finite energy reserves gathered during feeding phases. Thus, those individuals with more limited reserves will die sooner and consequently have less time available to find a new host once detached. At this stage, the principal energy reserves in gyrodactylids are stored as large lipids droplets. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has been used to investigate the distribution of lipid droplets in Gyrodactylus, which have migrated off their fish host, testing the hypothesis that these droplets function as a proxy for the nutritional state. This study, demonstrated that the lipid droplets were particularly associated with the gut and that there is a significant variability in the volume of stored lipid carried out by each individual. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that gyrodactylids carry lipid droplets at all stages of their life cycle, including at release from the birth pore. It is likely that transferring worms require stored energy reserves to survive in the event of failure to establish contact with a new host. These reserves could allow the parasite to survive without a host for several days. As gyrodactylids appear to respond to a range of stimuli including vibration and chemicals released from the host, the presence or absence of such cues may have consequences on the rates of Gyrodactylus transmission. If these chemical stimuli can be identified and then mimicked or blocked, then this may offer potential opportunities for the control of gyrodactylid behaviour and for disrupting their transmission to new hosts. Baseline gyrodactylid behaviour, in the absence of a host, was determined under white light and infrared. This was achieved using a specially constructed arena and purpose written image analysis software to analyse parasite movement under different lighting conditions. The study found that gyrodactylids were more active in the dark than in light conditions, typically displaying longer, more sinuous tracks under red light than under white light. To begin investigating the effect of chemical presence on gyrodactylid behaviour, the activity of octopaminergic agonists and antagonist which bind to muscle receptors and alter muscle activity, were assessed. The impact of octopamine hydrochloride, clonidine hydrochloride, amitraz and, a toxic reference, chlordimeform, over a range of concentrations (0. 2 to 3. 2 µM/L) were assessed on gyrodactylid behaviour. All of the four chemicals affected Gyrodactylus and produced muscle tetanus, causing muscle spasms when extension was attempted. Prolonged exposure resulted in death. Only the highest concentration of chlordimeform, the toxic reference, affected 100...|$|R
