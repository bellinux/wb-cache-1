5|$|The Lords of the Isles {{ruled the}} Inner Hebrides {{as well as}} part of the Western Highlands as {{subjects}} of the King of Scots until John MacDonald, fourth Lord of the Isles, squandered the family's powerful position. A rebellion by his nephew, Alexander of Lochalsh provoked <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> James IV to forfeit the family's lands in 1493.|$|E
5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame {{that they could}} be killed easily, while <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to mortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Brooke, {{persisting}} {{as quietly}} {{as if he were}} only discussing the nature of last year's weather, and nodding at the end with his usual amenity, was <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> form of obstinacy.|$|R
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>exasperated</b> Johnson {{resigned}} as New York's Indian commissioner in 1751. When Warren died in July 1752, he left nothing to Johnson {{in his will}}. Although Warren died a very wealthy man, in his will he required that Johnson repay the expenses incurred while settling Warren's land.|$|E
25|$|During November the {{parliament}} began to discuss plans {{to reduce the}} size of the army and the strength of garrisons. However, Cromwell listed Shrewsbury as one of those requiring further consideration, probably influenced by Mackworth's evaluation of its strategic importance. The parliament was to prove entirely fruitless, dismissed on 22 January 1655, with no legislation enacted, and with a final harangue from <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> Protector. However, Mackworth was dead and buried by this time.|$|E
25|$|Mulland took Gustav Sohon with him, and in October 1862 {{made the}} {{difficult}} stagecoach journey from San Francisco to St. Louis again. Mullan found {{working at the}} Topographical Engineers difficult. He wanted to work from home, but was forced {{to work in an}} office. He hired staff to assist him without authorization, tried to include extraneous material in his report, and began pressing for new funds to rebuild part of the Mullan Road. <b>An</b> <b>exasperated</b> department ordered him to complete his report as swiftly as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! But all {{the more}} {{you ought to have}} {{considered}} her helplessness. It ought to have made her the more sacred"--Jeff gave <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> shrug--"to you, and you ought to have kept away from her for decency's sake." ...|$|R
60|$|Jack {{is always}} so provokingly good-humoured. When you've taken pains and put {{yourself}} out--even {{to the extent}} of fibbing about <b>a</b> moustache--to <b>exasperate</b> <b>a</b> person, there is nothing more annoying than to have him keep perfectly angelic.|$|R
60|$|What I most fear is {{that the}} {{perpetual}} bluster of a party in the States will at last set the patient British back up. And if our people begin to bluster too, and there should come into existence <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> war-party on both sides, there will be great danger of a daily-widening breach.|$|R
25|$|According to {{the social}} mores {{represented}} in the show, a happy marriage {{is the cornerstone of}} successful middle-class family life, and June and Ward represent the warm, happily married, successful middle class couple. In contrast, the parents of Beaver's friend Larry Mondello are a husband frequently out of town on business and <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> wife struggling single-handedly to raise a son and sometimes depending on Ward to help discipline him. Singles like prim Aunt Martha and globe-trotting, yarn-spinning Uncle Billy are shown as either out-of-touch and irksome or untrustworthy. The one episode dealing with divorce shows it as having negative effects on children and family life.|$|E
25|$|The {{deterioration}} of crowd behaviour in Australia {{has been marked}} and easily observable {{over the last few}} years...Exhibitionists, generally in drunken stupor, invaded the pitches...attempted to run the gauntlet of policemen patrolling the perimeter. When they intruded upon the playing area to congratulate their heroes, their sincerity extended to trying to steal their caps or snitching a bail or stump whilst the umpire was distracted by his concern for the pitch...umpire Brooks and an intruder clashed physically in the centre of the Test pitch. The invader was sent sprawling in the centre of the wicket by <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> umpire, who was no doubt unwise to intrude into the domain of law and order.|$|E
25|$|The {{precursor}} {{of the present}} college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking {{the support of the}} trustees, the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> alum, Edward Harkness, finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.|$|E
60|$|Fordham was {{compelled}} to stay for an uncomfortable luncheon, when there were spasmodic jerks of talk about subjects {{of the day to}} keep up appearances before the servants, who flitted about in such <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> way that their mistress secretly rejoiced to think how soon she should be rid of the fine courier butler.|$|R
60|$|The stout fireman's natural amiability {{had been}} {{returning}} like a flood while he conversed with Fred, but this sharp summons rather checked its flow; {{and when he}} was told in <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> tone to hand the toast, and not look like a stuck pig, it was fairly stopped, and his spirit sank to zero.|$|R
60|$|For a {{practical}} man, {{it must be}} admitted that Mr. Plimpton had {{very little of the}} concrete to relate. And it appeared on cross-examination by Mr. Langmaid, who ate his cold meat and salad with <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> and undiminished appetite--that the only definite thing the rector had said was that he didn't intend to preach socialism. This was reassuring.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, Mikkelsen had a {{starring}} role as a young doctor {{who falls in love}} with the girlfriend of one of his patients in Open Hearts which earned him both Robert and Bodil nominations in 2003 for best actor. He also won best actor for this performance at the Rouen Nordic Film Festival in 2003. In 2003, Mikkelsen had a leading role as a man who leaves his wife and child in the short picture Nu. He starred opposite Kaas in The Green Butchers, playing an orphaned butcher's assistant in a small provincial Danish town, where human meat is a specialty. He won the Fantasporto Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the butcher. Later in 2003, he starred in Pablo Berger's Spanish film Torremolinos 73, about <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> encyclopedia salesman who exports pornographic films to Scandinavian countries under the pretense of being an audiovisual encyclopedia of human reproduction. Although a critical success in Spain, the film was poorly received in Scandinavian countries.|$|E
500|$|... "Some Girls" [...] was commercially {{successful}} in the United Kingdom, debuting at number two on the UK Singles Chart. The Shapeshifters' [...] "Lola's Theme" [...] kept the song from topping the chart; noting the song's lyrics about <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> singer whose [...] "dreams of number one last forever", The Guardian remarked that the song's chart performance was [...] "as if [...] following a script".|$|E
500|$|At {{the other}} end was January 1989, where the 26% {{achieved}} by Gleaming the Cube and the 0% awarded to DeepStar Six bracketed a 16% average. Five other January films joined it {{at the bottom of}} the scale. It was recognized as a nadir among Januarys even at the time. In a contemporary essay in The New York Times after the month had concluded, <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> Janet Maslin presciently noted that [...] "the January that has just ended really looks like one for the record books." ...|$|E

60|$|At last I {{was calm}} {{enough to get}} out of bed and ring up the round-eyed waiter for a flannel nightshirt, a soda and whisky, and some good cigars.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{with one}} detractor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} his [...] "favorite episode of season seven" [...] and that he wished that [...] "it had been the series finale" [...] for The X-Files. VanDerWerff argued that the episode possessed a [...] "warmth and tenderness" [...] that was missing from the following two seasons, after Duchovny left the series as a full-time star. He concluded that [...] "the genius of 'Je Souhaite' lies in how it embraces the inherent weirdness of the world this show is set in." [...] Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named [...] "Je Souhaite" [...] the second most funny X-Files episode, writing, [...] "Best line: When Scully, ever the skeptic, begins trying to rationalize her examination of an invisible body, Mulder replies with <b>an</b> <b>exasperated,</b> 'Oh!' It's {{what most of us}} had been thinking for years about Scully's refusal to acknowledge all the strange crap she had seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The album title {{led to a}} {{legal case}} that {{attracted}} considerable attention: a Virgin Records store in Nottingham that put the album in its window was threatened with prosecution for displaying [...] "indecent printed matter". The case was thrown out when defending QC John Mortimer produced an expert witness who established that bollocks was an Old English term for a small ball, that it appeared [...] "in place names without stirring any sensual desires in the local communities", {{and that in the}} nineteenth century it had been used as a nickname for clergymen: [...] "Clergymen are known to talk a good deal of rubbish and so the word later developed the meaning of nonsense." [...] In the context of the Pistols' album title, the term does in fact primarily signify [...] "nonsense". Steve Jones off-handedly came up with the title as the band debated what to call the album. <b>An</b> <b>exasperated</b> Jones said, [...] "Oh, fuck it, never mind the bollocks of it all." ...|$|E
500|$|The Lords of the Isles, {{a phrase}} first {{recorded}} in 1336, [...] {{would continue to}} rule the Inner Hebrides as well {{as part of the}} Western Highlands as subjects of the King of Scots until John MacDonald, fourth Lord of the Isles, squandered the family's powerful position. Through a secret treaty with Edward IV of England, negotiated at Ardtornish Castle and signed in 1462, he made himself a servant of the English crown. When James III of Scotland found out about the treaty in 1476, he issued a sentence of forfeiture for MacDonald's lands. Some were restored for a promise of good behaviour, but MacDonald was unable to control his son Aonghas Óg, who defeated him at the Battle of Bloody Bay fought of the coast of Mull near Tobermory in 1481. A further rebellion by his nephew, Alexander of Lochalsh provoked <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> James IV to forfeit the lands for the last time in 1493.|$|E

"Oh, you'll {{get over}} that," [...] responded Mattingly, with <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> {{confidence}} that drove her nearly frantic, from the manifest kindliness of intent {{that made it}} impossible for her to resent it.

You'll naturally stamp round and cuss a little--" [...] He stopped in conscious consternation.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{presently}} {{he slipped}} again, slipped {{back to the}} remorse and regrets of the morning time. He clutched at Baynes as a drowning man clutches at a rope, and recovered himself. For a time he meditated on Baynes. He {{had never seen the}} poet, so his imagination had scope. It appeared to him as <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> obstacle to <b>a</b> tragic avenging of his honour that Baynes was a mere boy--possibly even younger than himself.|$|R
5000|$|Potter {{began work}} on Tom Kitten {{in the summer of}} 1906, and used the gardens and {{interior}} of the farmhouse at Hill Top as the setting for the tale. A week after the letter to Millie Warne she wrote her publisher Harold Warne, [...] "I have not quite finished the Kitten, it is <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> model; and I always find it difficult to settle to work in the country. I hope I have not been inconveniently long about it." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{prelude to}} act 1 {{combines}} three recurrent themes: {{the entry of}} the bullfighters from act 4, the refrain from the Toreador Song from act 2, and the motif that, in two slightly differing forms, represents both Carmen herself and the fate that she personifies. This motif, played on clarinet, bassoon, cornet and cellos over tremolo strings, concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo. When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established, and pervades the opening scenes. The mock solemnities of {{the changing of the}} guard, and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls, precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen's entrance. After her provocative habanera, with its persistent insidious rhythm and changes of key, the fate motif sounds in full when Carmen throws her flower to José before departing. This action elicits from José a passionate A major solo that Dean suggests is the turning-point in his musical characterisation. The softer vein returns briefly, as Micaëla reappears and joins with José in a duet to a warm clarinet and strings accompaniment. The tranquillity is shattered by the women's noisy quarrel, Carmen's dramatic re-entry and her defiant interaction with Zuniga. After her beguiling [...] "Seguidilla" [...] provokes José to <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> high A sharp shout, Carmen's escape is preceded by the brief but disconcerting reprise of a fragment from the habanera. Bizet revised this finale several times to increase its dramatic effect.|$|E
2500|$|A {{contributory}} {{factor in}} his bowling success was his understanding with the Somerset wicketkeeper, Harold Stephenson. Somerset's cricket historian described it thus: [...] "The prodigious leg-break would beat the bat and 'Steve' would knock off the bails with the merest flick. The glee on Lawrence's face as <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> batsman pounded forward and missed..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 October, <b>an</b> <b>exasperated</b> Kilmaine {{wrote to}} a friend, [...] "Try {{in the name of}} heaven to rid me of this old general Beauregard, he is a true agent of the old regime, a dirty schemer who puts the entire {{division}} in confusion. I cannot do the Republic any good serving with him".|$|E
6000|$|I flushed again, and {{in anger}} and humiliation as before; for the {{language}} was hardly an exaggeration of some that I have uttered in my day, and moreover was {{delivered in a}} tone of voice and with <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> drawl that had the seeming of a deliberate travesty of my style. Now there is nothing I am quite so sensitive about as a mocking imitation of my drawling infirmity of speech. I spoke up sharply and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DUDGEON. Oh, {{one more}} or less will make no {{difference}} this morning, Mrs. Anderson. Now that you're here, you'd better stay. If you wouldn't mind shutting the door! (Judith smiles, implying [...] "How stupid of me" [...] and shuts it with <b>an</b> <b>exasperating</b> air of doing something pretty and becoming.) That's better. I must go and tidy myself a bit. I suppose you don't mind stopping here to receive anyone that comes until I'm ready.|$|R

Ah, but it was <b>an</b> <b>exasperating,</b> weary, endless night, to be lying at anchor close under that black coast! The {{agitated}} water made snarling sounds all round the ship. At times a wild gust of wind out of a gully {{high up on the}} cliffs struck on our rigging a harsh and plaintive note like the wail of a forsaken soul.|$|R
