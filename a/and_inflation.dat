30|$|In this context, {{the effects}} of crude oil and {{domestic}} gasoline price changes on consumer price <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> core <b>inflation</b> have been investigated with MS-VAR models in Turkey for the period October 2005 –December 2012. Two regimes have been determined for all variables, {{and the existence of}} different regimes has revealed that the series show different behaviors in each regime. This result indicates that the political targets should be changed depending on the change of the inflation rate. Additionally, the findings of the study show that Turkish policy makers should not ignore the pass-through of oil and domestic gasoline prices to macroeconomic variables such as consumer price <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> core <b>inflation.</b> Also, we find that, unlike the previous studies carried out for Turkey, the impact of sudden increases in gasoline prices on consumer <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> core <b>inflation</b> is more significant than shocks in crude oil prices. The probabilities of being in low <b>and</b> high <b>inflation</b> regimes <b>and</b> transition from one to another are very close in the inflation/crude oil price relationship. In the inflation/domestic gasoline price relationship, the probability is higher for remaining in high <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> for transition from low to high inflation. This indicates that increases in domestic gasoline prices affect the <b>inflation</b> rate <b>and</b> make a crisis impact.|$|R

Particularly, since July 21 st 2005, Chinese exchange rate regime reform happened, which made (Renmibi) RMB value depreciated <b>and</b> caused <b>inflation</b> pressure. In addition interest rate is an important instrument for government to control inflation, {{it is very important}} to analyze the relationship between <b>inflation</b> rate <b>and</b> interest rate. The purpose of this paper is to estimate whether there is a significant relationship between inflation (or expected <b>inflation)</b> <b>and</b> interest rate. If the relationship exists, is it positive or negative? Simultaneously, this paper investigates whether the Fisher effect exists in China. Secondary research and quantitative measure are conducted to identify the relationship between inflation (or expected <b>inflation)</b> <b>and</b> interest. Autoregressive model, Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and Co-integration test will be applied. The findings of this paper indicate that official interest rate have significant positive relationship with <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> expected <b>inflation,</b> while market interest rate have weak positive relationship with <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> expected <b>inflation.</b> However the one-to-one Fisher coefficient dose not establish in China...|$|R
5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration).

5|$|After the Planck epoch <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> {{came the}} quark, hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs {{encompassed}} less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

40|$|From 1975 to 1980, {{inflation}} in core (nonfood and nonenergy) consumer prices rose sharply as {{crude oil prices}} more than tripled. Yet, as crude oil prices quadrupled from late 2001 to 2007, core consumer price inflation remained essentially flat. Some observers have attributed the stability of consumer price {{inflation in}} the more recent episode {{to the influence of}} long-term inflation expectations. While inflation expectations rose significantly {{in the second half of}} the 1970 s, they remained largely unchanged from 2001 through 2007. The increased stability of <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> long-term expectations raises the possibility that the behavior of both variables has fundamentally changed.; Recent discussion has focused on two possible forms of change: the influence of long-run expectations on <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> the anchoring of <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> expectations. A third possible source of change is smaller shocks to <b>inflation,</b> expectations, <b>and</b> other macroeconomic variables. Any of these changes in the behavior of <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> long-term <b>inflation</b> expectations could have important implications for monetary policy.; Clark and Nakata find some evidence that the dynamics of <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> long-term <b>inflation</b> expectations have changed modestly. In particular, compared to 20 or more years ago, <b>inflation</b> <b>and</b> expectations appear to be slightly better anchored: Unexpected increases in inflation die out slightly faster and produce less of an increase in long-term expectations.

5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment <b>and</b> <b>inflation.</b> It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E

In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed. In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement <b>and</b> <b>inflation,</b> he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{restored}} {{many of the}} old {{financial institutions}} of his grandfather Henry I and undertook further, long-lasting reforms of the way that the English currency was managed; one result was a long-term increase in the supply of money within the economy, leading to a growth both in trade <b>and</b> <b>inflation.</b> Medieval rulers such as Henry enjoyed various sources of income during the 12th century. Some of their income came from their private estates, called demesne; other income came from imposing legal fines and arbitrary amercements, and from taxes, which at this time were raised only intermittently. Kings could also raise funds by borrowing; Henry did this far more than earlier English rulers, initially through moneylenders in Rouen, turning later in his reign to Jewish and Flemish lenders. Ready cash was increasingly important to rulers during the 12th century to enable the use of mercenary forces and the construction of stone castles, both vital to successful military campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E

40|$|Most {{countries}} experienced high <b>and</b> volatile <b>inflation</b> {{during the}} 1970 s {{and part of}} the 1980 s, and low <b>and</b> stable <b>inflation</b> thereafter.

The most recent period of low <b>and</b> stable <b>inflation</b> is characterised, in contrast, by positive real rates of interest. The experience of the past suggests that using monetary policy to support the economy in the face of negative productivity shocks had little success.
