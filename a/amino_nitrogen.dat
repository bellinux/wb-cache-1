5000|$|It {{is quite}} clear that the {{structure}} of the enzyme, to be specific the active site, is very important in understanding the mechanism of reaction. For this reason, Rees and colleagues studied the enzyme-ligand complex to get a clear answer for the role of the zinc ion. These studies found that, in free enzyme, the zinc coordination number is five; the metal center is coordinated with two imidazole Nδ1 nitrogens, the two carboxylate oxygens of glutamate-72, and a water molecule to form a distorted tetrahedral. However, once ligand binds at the active site of carboxypeptidase A, this coordination number can vary from five to six. When bound to dipeptide glycyl-L-tyrosine, the <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> of the dipeptide and the carbonyl oxygen replaced the water ligand. This would yield a coordination number of six for the zinc in the carboxypeptidase A- dipeptide glycyl-L-tyrosine complex. Electron density maps gave evidence that the <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> occupies a second position near glutamate-270. The closeness of these two residues would result in a steric hindrance preventing the water ligand from coordinating with zinc. This would result in a coordination number of five.

In fact, the n parameter of the modied Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was always higher than 1, suggesting reduced shielding among repeating units of the polymer.
