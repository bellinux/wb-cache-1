5|$|In 2005, {{the copper}} {{deposits}} in the Katanga Province (former Shaba province) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were the top producer of cobalt with almost 40% world share, reports the British Geological Survey. By 2015, DRC supplied 60% {{of the world}} production of 32,000 tons <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> of $20,000 to $26,000 per ton, including artisanal mining which supplied 10 to 25%.

5|$|A {{category}} of ticket packages {{was created to}} be sold by an auction process <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> estimated at up to $1,000. All proceeds were donated to Music for Relief, a non-profit organization founded by Linkin Park to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment. Additionally, one dollar per concert ticket sold was contributed to the charity. A tent of Music for Relief was staffed by local volunteers at each concert. The tent featured a photo booth which enabled fans to document their concert experience and express their support to take action on climate change, {{leading up to the}} United Nations Climate Summit that took place on September 23, 2014 in New York City. Various clean energy tools were also showcased.|$|E

5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels {{the right to buy}} back forfeited estates, <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough.|$|E
5|$|Tour {{operators}} {{continue to}} advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life, but {{this type of}} discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the cases á impluvium in Enampore or Mlomp with {{a few days of}} relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very conducive to the interests of fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> lower than those in Cap Skirring or Saly. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area.|$|E
5|$|At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, {{near the}} end of the Paris sojourn and after two {{successful}} concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers. Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the high costs of living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.|$|E

5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). As Jews {{became more and more}} excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own. Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris is traded {{mainly for}} its purported {{medicinal}} properties, for the pet trade, or, {{to a lesser}} extent, as food for local consumption. According to a 2003 report, the animals were sold for 30,000–50,000 Vietnamese đồng (US$1.50–2.50 or €1.10–1.80). Other reports have found them to cost US$2–10. In Cambodia, the species is used in Traditional Khmer Medicine. Surveys conducted at Cambodian markets showed that the species was the third most common mammal for sale, offered <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> ranging from US$0.85–6.25 (€0.65–4.70). In Vietnam, the pygmy slow loris is used for food, medicine, and often as a pet and {{is among the most}} frequently sold species. Formerly, hundreds of pygmy lorises were traded monthly in major markets, but recently numbers seem to have decreased, due to shortages in supply. In southern Vietnam, lorises are among the most popular wildlife dishes in wildlife meat restaurants.|$|E

5|$|The royals {{were eager}} to settle scores after Montfort’s defeat. At the Parliament at Winchester in September the same year, all those who had taken part in the {{rebellion}} were disinherited. Yet even though the uprising of the younger Simon Montfort in Lincolnshire was over by Christmas, scattered resistance remained. The main problem was the garrison encamped at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle, and a siege started {{in the summer of}} 1266 seemed futile. By the end of October, the royals drew up the so-called Dictum of Kenilworth, whereby rebels were allowed to buy back their land <b>at</b> <b>prices</b> dependent on their level of involvement in the rebellion. The defenders of the castle turned down the offer at first, {{but by the end of}} the year conditions had become intolerable, and in 1267 the Dictum was agreed upon.|$|E
