5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation <b>activists</b> <b>say</b> this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E

According to Executive Director of Advancing Human Rights David Keyes, in 2013, Anas Awwad, a 26-year-old Palestinian activist, was sentenced in absentia by a Palestinian court in Nablus, the West Bank, to one year in prison for “extending his tongue” against the Palestinian Authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Facebook. Keyes also states that in 2012, Palestinian blogger Jamal Abu Rihan was arrested by the Palestinian Authority for starting a Facebook campaign called “The People Want an End to Corruption,” he was indicted under the charges of“extending his tongue” against the Palestinian leadership.|$|E

25|$|As of 15 March 2013, the Bahraini {{uprising}} of 2011 and {{its aftermath}} resulted in 122 deaths. The number of injuries is hard to determine due to government clamp-down on hospitals and medical personnel. The last accurate estimate for injuries is back to 16 March 2011 and sits at about 2708. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that many detainees were subjected to torture {{and other forms of}} physical and psychological abuse while in custody, five of whom returned dead bodies. The BICI report finds the government responsible for 20 deaths (November 2011). Opposition <b>activists</b> <b>say</b> that the current number is 88 including 43 who allegedly {{died as a result of}} excessive use of tear gas.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, mass {{destruction}} of wildlife habitat {{has yet to}} cease {{all over the world}} and many species such as elephants, big cats, penguins, tropical birds, primates, rhinos, exotic reptiles, and many others are in danger of dying out. Many of today's zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species. Many zoos see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand. Some critics and the majority of animal rights <b>activists</b> <b>say</b> that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education.|$|E

According to the ALF's code, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life, may be claimed as an ALF action, including acts of vandalism causing economic damage to their victims. American activist Rod Coronado said in 2006: [...] "One thing that I know that separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being—that is, terrorists, violent criminals—is {{the fact that we}} have harmed no one." ...|$|E

Claiming to preserve their culture and traditions, some diaspora families prefer to send their daughters back to Kashmir to be forcefully wedded off. <b>Activists</b> <b>say</b> such unions are [...] "cruel, leading to murders and chaos".

According to Iranian officials, those who human rights <b>activists</b> <b>say</b> are peaceful political activists being denied due process rights are actually guilty of offenses against the national security of the country, and those protesters claiming Ahmadinejad stole the 2009 election are actually part of a foreign-backed plot to topple Iran's leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Animal {{protection}} <b>activists</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} Iditarod {{is not a}} commemoration of the 1925 serum delivery, and that race was originally called the Iditarod Trail Seppala Memorial Race in honor of Leonhard Seppala. [...] However, this criticism is inconsistent {{with the fact that}} Leonhard Seppala was one of the primary mushers who delivered serum in 1925 (see above). Animal protection activists also say that the Iditarod is dog abuse. For example, dogs have died and been injured during the race. The practice of tethering dogs on chains, which is commonly used by mushers in their kennels, at checkpoints and dog drops, is also criticized. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesperson Jennifer O'Connor says, [...] "We're totally opposed to the race for the cruelty issues associated with it". The ASPCA said, [...] "General concerns arise whenever intense competition results in dogs being pushed beyond their endurance or capabilities", according to Vice President Stephen Zawistowski.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the group's successes, {{there has}} been {{criticism}} of PETA from both the conservative and radical ends of the animal rights movement. Michael Specter writes that it provides for {{groups such as the}} Humane Society of the United States the same dynamic that Malcolm X provided for Martin Luther King, or Andrea Dworkin for Gloria Steinem—someone radical to alienate the mainstream and make moderate voices more appealing. The failure to condemn the Animal Liberation Front triggers complaints from the conservatives, while the more radical <b>activists</b> <b>say</b> the group has lost touch with its grassroots, is soft on the idea of animal rights, and that it should stop the media stunts, the pie-throwing, and the use of nudity. [...] "It's hard enough trying to get people to take animal rights seriously without PETA out there acting like a bunch of jerks," [...] one activist told writer Norm Phelps. However, Phelps continued: [...] "But it's hard to argue with success, and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world, in terms of both membership and spreading the animal rights message to the public at large." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1988, Cosmopolitan {{magazine}} {{published an}} article by Robert E. Gould, a psychiatrist, entitled [...] "Reassuring News About AIDS: A Doctor Tells Why You May Not Be At Risk." [...] The main contention of the article was that in unprotected vaginal sex {{between a man and}} a woman who both had [...] "healthy genitals" [...] the risk of HIV transmission was negligible, even if the male partner was infected. Women from ACT UP who had been having informal [...] "dyke dinners" [...] met with Dr. Gould in person, questioning him about several misleading facts (that penis to vagina transmission is impossible, for example) and questionable journalistic methods (no peer review, bibliographic information, failing to disclose that he was a psychiatrist and not a practitioner of internal medicine), and demanded a retraction and apology. When he refused, in the words of Maria Maggenti, they decided that they [...] "had to shut down Cosmo." [...] According to those who were involved in organizing the action, it was significant in that it was the first time the women in ACT UP organized separately from the main body of the group. Additionally, filming the action itself, the preparation and the aftermath were all consciously planned and resulted in a video short directed by Jean Carlomusto and Maria Maggenti, titled, [...] "Doctor, Liars, and Women: AIDS <b>Activists</b> <b>Say</b> No To Cosmo." [...] The action consisted of approximately 150 activists protesting in front of the Hearst building (parent company of Cosmopolitan) chanting [...] "Say no to Cosmo!" [...] and holding signs with slogans such as [...] "Yes, the Cosmo Girl CAN get AIDS!" [...] Although the action did not result in any arrests, it brought significant television media attention to the controversy surrounding the article. Phil Donahue, Nightline, and a local talk show called [...] "People Are Talking" [...] all hosted discussions of the article. On the latter, two women, Chris Norwood and Denise Ribble took the stage after the host, Richard Bey, cut Norwood off during an exchange about whether heterosexual women are at risk from AIDS. Footage from all of these media appearances was edited into [...] "Doctors, Liars, and Women." [...] Cosmopolitan eventually issued a partial retraction of the contents of the article.|$|E
