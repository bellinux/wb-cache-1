5|$|The new ball rule <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> spin bowling {{was less}} {{effective}} in the Tests, so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests, off spinner Johnson, until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring. Together they took only eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|As the {{defending}} champion, Kuznetsova took a wildcard into the Kremlin Cup, {{knowing that she}} had to win the title to qualify for Singapore. Kuznetsova handled the pressure well; defeating Alizé Cornet, Tímea Babos, Elina Svitolina and Daria Gavrilova in the final to win the title. This win automatically took the place in the last spot at WTA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2009 and <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Kuznetsova managed to successfully defend a title for the first time in her career.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} changes was the spread internet, which enabled knitters to share advice, patterns and experience, but <b>also</b> it <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> home knitters had direct access to supplies rather being reliant on local sources. These trends have continued.|$|R
6000|$|Jason {{saw that}} he was entrapped; but his second promise to Cheiron came into his mind, and he thought, ‘What if the Centaur were a prophet in <b>that</b> <b>also,</b> and <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> I should win the fleece!’ Then he cried aloud— ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Also,</b> it <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Dr. Hunkapiller's {{idea would}} require {{competing}} {{against his own}} customers, to all of whom Applied Biosystems sold its sequencing machines and their chemical reagents. However, he calculated that it would also mean doubling the market for that equipment.|$|R
5|$|Nash {{trained with}} South Melbourne during the 1946 {{pre-season}} but ultimately retired from VFL football {{to accept a}} position as captain-coach of the Ovens and Murray Football League side Wangaratta for a salary of £12 per week, four times the wage he would have received playing for South Melbourne. The high wage <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Nash was not required to find additional employment to cover his family's expenses, and in so doing, {{became one of the}} first fully professional Australian rules football players.|$|E
5|$|Of the First Test team, all bar Toshack scored {{multiple}} first-class {{centuries in}} their careers, and all averaged under 27.50 with the ball. As Bradman wanted all four spin techniques covered, {{as well as}} both left and right-arm seamers, this <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he could only have two fast bowlersLindwall and Milleras three positions were occupied by spinners and a fourth by Toshack, who was of medium pace.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} the Belgian Congo enabled the Belgian {{government}} in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. It <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the Belgian gold reserves, which had been moved to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were still available {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{temple of}} Janus was {{dedicated}} by Gaius Duilius on 17 August, {{day of the}} Portunalia. The key was the symbol of both gods and was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to signify <b>that</b> the boarding boat was a peaceful merchant boat.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the list}} of seasons {{indicating}} the league champions. Whenever the second placed team is <b>also</b> included, it <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the club <b>also</b> participated in the Yugoslav Championship qualifiers as on some seasons two clubs qualified.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} in the village itself and was {{therefore}} convenient, <b>also</b> the quarry <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> freight receipts were significant. The loading dock was removed when goods services were withdrawn; the siding on the down side was also removed.|$|R
5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this inequality <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the minority rights were {{not seen as}} a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
5|$|Two plagues afflicted coastal New England in 1614 and 1617, {{possibly}} {{transmitted from}} British and French fishermen to natives {{on the shore}} (although no concrete evidence exists to prove such a connection). The plague killed between 90% and 95% of the local Wampanoag inhabitants. The near disappearance of the tribe from the site left their cornfields and cleared areas vacant for the Pilgrims to occupy; it <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the Native Americans were in no condition to resist {{the arrival of the}} colonists.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5000|$|... "Carbon", {{essentially}} a sub-set of [...] "classic" [...] Mac OS API calls, was <b>also</b> absent. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the only native applications for OS X Server 1.0 were {{written for the}} [...] "Yellow Box" [...] API, which {{went on to become}} known as [...] "Cocoa". Furthermore, Apple's own FireWire was not supported.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I think so, but <b>also</b> <b>that</b> she <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{her story}} {{would be my}} story, copied you know, as I copied her dress. Of course it is all nonsense, just the {{influence}} of the place taking hold of me when overcome by other things, but at the time it seemed very real." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of gold <b>meant</b> <b>also</b> <b>that</b> there were bushrangers in the area. The grave of John Gilbert {{is near the}} town in the former police paddock. He {{was a member of}} the Gardiner-Hall gang and shot by police in 1865.|$|R
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} the 2013–14 season with five league goals, {{in addition to}} nine assists. He failed {{to make it into}} the Bundesliga Team of the Season, but was included in a list of the Best Defenders for the 2013–14 campaign. Rodríguez's nine assists <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he created more goals than any other full-back in Europe. His impressive displays during the season included 2.3 key passes per game, the same number as Andrea Pirlo, the two-time reigning Serie A Footballer of the Year, and 2.6 successful dribbles per game, more than Cristiano Ronaldo, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner.|$|E
5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
50|$|The {{consequence}} of the battle was that the small fleet Prussia had at its disposal ceased to exist. The loss of naval supremacy <b>meant</b> <b>also</b> <b>that</b> the Prussian positions at Usedom and Wollin became untenable and were occupied by Swedish troops.|$|R
5000|$|Marianne was a live wire, she was {{lively and}} funny to be with, {{but at the}} same time <b>also</b> determined. Which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> you always knew where you had her, and you were always aware of what it was she wanted. - John Dalsgarð, her layouter (memorial speech given at Norðurlandahúsið in Tórshavn, 22 Nov. 2014) ...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the process, {{rates for}} most public utilities, {{including}} {{drinking water and}} electricity, have gone up in real terms. This increase in charges has meant lower dependency on public funds {{to cover the cost}} of supplying these services. It <b>also</b> has <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> consumption has fallen as a result of the higher prices, delaying the need for further investments in order to increase installed capacities of different services. Some rates also have gone down, as in the case of waste collection for multiple users (for example, buildings or housing complexes), and of international phone calls.|$|R
5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E
5|$|Investigation of shipwrecks in {{vicinity}} of Pedra Branca. Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. The circumstances of the particular investigations <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Singapore's ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over the island.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a tiny, {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E
50|$|The {{dwellings}} of Mid and High Boreland carry a {{name that}} links them with a castle {{that must have been}} nearby. A 'Boor' meant a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants. Boreland <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> the land <b>that</b> was granted to the feudal superior specifically to be used to furnish food for his castle or dwelling.|$|R
5000|$|In the past, {{derivative}} <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> {{a compound}} <b>that</b> can be imagined to arise from another compound, if one atom {{or group of}} atoms is replaced with another atom or group of atoms, but modern chemical language now uses the term structural analog for this meaning, thus eliminating ambiguity. The term [...] "structural analogue" [...] is common in organic chemistry.|$|R
5000|$|... 2010 was not easier but 2011 JJK {{exploded}} the bank. The team finished 3rd in {{the league}} and celebrated the first medal in its history in Finnish Veikkausliiga. This <b>meant</b> <b>also</b> <b>that</b> in 2012 JJK plays {{for the first time in}} its history in UEFA European League.|$|R
5|$|The French ironclad Invincible was {{the second}} of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because they only had a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of the}} hull <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> they were broadside ironclads. Invincible had an uneventful career and was deployed in North American waters during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly and she was condemned in 1872 and scrapped in 1876.|$|E
5|$|The French ironclad Normandie was {{the third}} and last of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because they only had a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of}} the hull <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> they were broadside ironclads. Normandie was the first ironclad to cross the Atlantic in support of the French intervention in Mexico in 1862. Although the ship was active during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, she saw no action. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly; she was condemned in 1871 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Think Tank, {{released}} in May 2003, {{was filled with}} atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Think Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound {{was seen as a}} testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction. Think Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese {{animation}} {{was in its}} {{golden age}} until the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966. Fortunately {{the government did not}} cut Shanghai Animation Film Studio's funding. Animation was the only art form Chairman Mao allowed that artists could freely use to express ideas. Ironically, by 'freely' Chairman Mao <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> ideas <b>that</b> support the party. Only a few animations could be produced during this time, including Support Vietnamese to Fight Against America, Expose the Peace Negotiation Conspiracy of America, and After School. The animations were purely [...] "red washed". This had a serious impact, and slowed the progress of Chinese animation.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the opening}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the {{subsequent}} moves toward German reunification <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> interest in East German artists plummeted, as GDR citizens were now easily able to buy music by international artists; the political climate <b>meant</b> <b>also</b> <b>that</b> many major stars came to Berlin to perform, often for free, in late 1989 and 1990. Birr's new band Maschine und Männer, with Scharfschwerdt, had trouble attracting audiences.|$|R
50|$|Two Borland Farms are now {{located near}} Craigie village {{and this may}} relate {{directly}} to Craigie Castle. The name 'Boarland' could possibly refer {{to the presence of}} wild boar, however a more likely origin is <b>that</b> a 'Boor' <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants. The Borland or Bordland <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> the land <b>that</b> was specifically used to furnish food for a castle. A 'Boirland' is marked on the Timothy Pont map {{as far back as the}} late 16th / early 17th century.|$|R
