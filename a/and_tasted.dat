5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt <b>and</b> <b>tasted,</b> whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E

5000|$|Smell <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> are present, with infants showing {{different}} {{expressions of}} disgust or pleasure {{when presented with}} pleasant odors (honey, milk, etc.) or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> (e.g. sour taste). Newborns are born with odor <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> preferences acquired in the womb from the smell <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eats. Both breast- and bottle-fed babies around 3 days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula, indicating an innate preference. There is good evidence for older infants preferring the smell of their mother to that of others.|$|R

25|$|Zasavica is the {{location}} of the only farm of the Balkan donkey on the territory of former Yugoslavia. Farm was founded in the early 1990s and holds some 120 donkeys. They are kept for meat but mostly for their milk, which is used to make the pule cheese, {{one of the most expensive}} in the world with the price of 1,000 euros per kilogram (there are farms of the Balkan donkeys in Italy, Belgium and France with over 700 animals). Meat is used for the sausages and kulen while the milk is also used in the cosmetic industry (creams, soaps) but for the cream liqueur, too. Every April, a festival called World's Donkey Day is held. Teams from several countries (Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, etc.) compete in the preparation of the donkey stew, while other meat and milk products are being exchanged <b>and</b> <b>tasted.</b>|$|E

40|$|Epithelial {{tissue of}} {{vertebrate}} organisms {{serves as the}} interface {{between them and the}} immediate environment with which they interact. Transformation of this outer tissue layer generates specialized structures that allow organisms to make enhanced or entirely new interactions with its ecological niche. This study examines two structures derived from the oropharyngeal cavity epithelium: teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds. Using cichlids from Lake Malawi in eastern Africa as a model, this study seeks to show the co-evolutionary relationship that likely exists between teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds. Based on the observations that both teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds are derived from the epithelium, are colocalized sensory organs within the oropharyngeal cavity, have very similar structures in early development, and share certain patterns in gene expression, we hypothesize that the gene networks governing tooth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> bud development are similar. Through comparative morphology and molecular developmental biology, this study shows that both teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds share similarities of gene expression in both spatial and temporal patterns.

2500|$|Champagne {{and other}} {{sparkling}} wines are infrequently aged, and frequently have no vintage year (no vintage, NV), but vintage champagne may be aged. Aged champagne {{has traditionally been}} a peculiarly British affectation, and thus {{has been referred to}} as [...] "the English taste", though this term also refers to a level of champagne sweetness. In principle champagne has aging potential, due to the acidity, and aged champagne has increased in popularity in the United States since the 1996 vintage. A few French winemakers have advocated aging champagne, most notably René Collard (1921–2009). In 2009, a 184-year-old bottle of Perrier-Jouët was opened <b>and</b> <b>tasted,</b> still drinkable, with notes of [...] "truffles and caramel", according to the experts.|$|E

2500|$|A rapid-fire {{style of}} {{dialogue}} delivery and {{a penchant for}} nodding while speaking became Dev's style in films like House No. 44 (1955), Pocket Maar (1956), Munimji (1955), Funtoosh (1956), C.I.D. (1956) and Paying Guest (1957). [...] In the 1950s his films were of the mystery genre or light comedy love stories or were films with social relevance like Ek Ke Baad Ek (1959) and Funtoosh (1956). His style was lapped up by the audience and was widely imitated. He starred {{in a string of}} box office successes {{for the remainder of the}} 1950s opposite newcomer Waheeda Rehman in [...] C.I.D. (1956), Solva Saal (1958), Kala Bazar (1960) and Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962). Waheeda first became a star when C.I.D became a hit. The pair acted in Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1961 film) and Prem Pujari later. In 1955 he also co-starred with Dilip Kumar in Insaniyat. [...] With his acting in Kala Pani (1958), as the son who is willing to go to any lengths to clear his framed father's name, he won his first Filmfare award for Best Actor for the film. He attempted films of tragic genre occasionally like Pocket Maar (1956), [...] Kala Pani (1958), Bombai Ka Baboo (1960) and Sharabi (1964) <b>and</b> <b>tasted</b> success with them. Dev also played a few characters with a negative shade, like in Jaal (1952) where he played a smuggler, then as an absconding gang member in Dushman, and as a black marketer in Kala Bazar. Apart from his pairing with Suraiya and Kalpana Kartik, his pairing with Nutan and Waheeda Rehman was popular among the audiences in the late 50’s and 60’s. His films Rahi (1952) and Aandhiyan (1952), were screened along with Raj Kapoor's Awaara. From the early fifties till mid sixties, the trio of Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand ruled the roost.|$|E

In the case of acetic acid, all three attributes (odor, taste, flavor) varied with concentration in approximately the same way. Flavor fell slightly, but uniformly, below the sum of odor magnitude <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> magnitude. In the case of coffee, flavor <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> magnitude grew relatively rapidly and odor relatively slowly with concentration. Nevertheless, flavor again fell uniformly below the sum of odor magnitude <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> magnitude. A vector summation model previously applied with success to odor mixtures provided a very adequate description of {{the relation between}} flavor and its constituents. The applicability of the model in the present instance implies that neither taste nor smell contributes to flavor {{at the expense of the}} other...|$|R

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{represent}} the largest family of transmembrane receptors and are prime therapeutic targets. The odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> receptors account for {{over half of}} the GPCR repertoire, yet they are generally excluded from large-scale, drug candidate analyses. Accumulating molecular evidence indicates that the odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> receptors are widely expressed throughout the body and functional beyond the oronasal cavity - with roles including nutrient sensing, autophagy, muscle regeneration, regulation of gut motility, protective airway reflexes, bronchodilation, and respiratory disease. Given this expanding array of actions, the restricted perception of these GPCRs as mere mediators of smell <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> is outdated. Moreover, delineation of the precise actions of odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> GPCRs continues to be hampered by the relative paucity of selective and specific experimental tools, as well as the lack of defined receptor pharmacology. In this review, we summarize the evidence for expression and function of odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> receptors in tissues beyond the nose and mouth, and we highlight their broad potential in physiology and pathophysiology...|$|R
