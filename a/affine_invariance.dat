This paper reports on an <b>affine</b> transformation <b>invariance</b> approach we proposed to track rolling leukocyte in intravital microscopy image sequences. The method {{is based on the}} <b>affine</b> transformation <b>invariance</b> property, which enables the accommodation of linear affine transformations (translation, rotation, and/or scaling) of the target, and a particle filter that overcomes the effect of image clutter. In our data set of 50 sequences, we compared the new approach with an active contour tracking method and a Monte Carlo tracker. With the manual tracking result provided by an operator as the reference, the root mean square errors for the active contour tracking method, the Monte Carlo tracker and the <b>affine</b> transformation <b>invariance</b> approach were 0. 95 �m, 0. 79 �m and 0. 74 �m, respectively, and the percentage of frames tracked were 72 %, 75 % and 89 %, respectively.

We also separately studied the ability of the <b>affine</b> transformation <b>invariance</b> approach to track a dark target leukocyte and a bright target leukocyte by using the number of frames tracked as an evaluation measure.

Second, we show that there is a unique attribution method that satisfies Dummy, Additivity, Conditional Nonnegativity, <b>Affine</b> Scale <b>Invariance,</b> and Anonymity for all characteristic functions that are the sum of a multilinear function and an additive function. We term this the Aumann-Shapley-Shubik method. Conversely, we show that such a uniqueness result does not hold for characteristic functions outside this class.

In particular low-dimensional representation which discriminates classes can not only enhance the classification procedure, but also make it faster, while contrary to the high-dimensional embeddings can be efficiently used for visual based exploratory data analysis. In this paper we propose Maximum Entropy Linear Manifold (MELM), a multidimensional generalization of Multithreshold Entropy Linear Classifier model which is {{able to find a}} low-dimensional linear data projection maximizing discriminativeness of projected classes. As a result we obtain a linear embedding which can be used for classification, class aware dimensionality reduction and data visualization. MELM provides highly discriminative 2 D projections of the data which {{can be used as a}} method for constructing robust classifiers. We provide both empirical evaluation as well as some interesting theoretical properties of our objective function such us scale and <b>affine</b> transformation <b>invariance,</b> connections with PCA and bounding of the expected balanced accuracy error.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} registering two observations of the same object, where the observations differ due to a combined effect of an affine geometric transformation and nonuniform illumination changes. The problem of deriving new representations of the observations that are both invariant to geometric transformations and linear in the illumination model is analyzed. In this framework, we present a novel method for linear estimation of illumination changes in an affine invariant manner, thus, decoupling the original problem into two simpler ones. The computational complexity of the method is low as it requires no more than solving a linear set of equations. The prior step of illumination estimation is shown to improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art registration techniques {{by a factor of}} two.

Clustering a video sequence into activities requires one to simultaneously recognize activity boundaries (activity consistent subsequences) and cluster these activity subsequences. In order to do this, we build a generative model for activities (in video) using a cascade of dynamical systems and show that this model is able to capture and represent a diverse class of activities. We then derive algorithms to learn the model parameters from a video stream and also show how a single video sequence may be clustered into different clusters where each cluster represents an activity. We also propose a novel technique to build <b>affine,</b> view, rate <b>invariance</b> of the activity into the distance metric for clustering.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the symplectic structure of information geometry based on Souriau’s Lie group thermodynamics model, with a covariant definition of Gibbs equilibrium via invariances through co-adjoint action {{of a group}} on its moment space, defining physical observables like energy, heat, and moment as pure geometrical objects. Using geometric Planck temperature of Souriau model and symplectic cocycle notion, the Fisher metric is identified as a Souriau geometric heat capacity. The Souriau model is based on affine representation of Lie group and Lie algebra that we compare with Koszul works on G/K homogeneous space and bijective correspondence between the set of G-invariant flat connections on G/K and the set of affine representations of the Lie algebra of G. In the framework of Lie group thermodynamics, an Euler-Poincaré equation is elaborated with respect to thermodynamic variables, and a new variational principal for thermodynamics is built through an invariant Poincaré-Cartan-Souriau integral. The Souriau-Fisher metric is linked to KKS (Kostant–Kirillov–Souriau) 2 -form that associates a canonical homogeneous symplectic manifold to the co-adjoint orbits. We apply this model {{in the framework of}} information geometry for the action of an affine group for exponential families, and provide some illustrations of use cases for multivariate gaussian densities.
