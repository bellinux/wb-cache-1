Land consolidation is the multidisciplinary tool for sustainable rural development with its dynamic structure that gives possibilities {{getting the best}} solutions for land management decision. That is why {{the main purpose of}} the article is a theoretical study and development of scientific and practical recommendations concerning the formation of institutional environment of <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> in Ukraine. The subject of study is the formation of <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation.</b> Methodology. The study used the following methods: dialectical, logical and abstract, system analysis (theoretical and methodological generalizations, defining the essence of the content of institutional environment of <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation).</b> This paper identifies the role of the institutions in economic development and characterised the regulatory, procedural, distributive, informational, development and accumulation functions of <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> institution. As a novelty items offered and provided the detailed description of the main components of the institutional environment of <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> such as: traditional and mental, legal, causal, organizational and structural, and procedural. The essence of institutions of each of these components and their meaning and relationships are presented. Theoretically investigated that the formation of institutional mechanism of consolidation should be a symbiosis of both traditional and market institutions based on democratic principles under community participation. The article focuses on the feasibility of the formation of mechanism for monitoring the effectiveness of institutions. As the result of the study the author proposed to consider the institutional environment of <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> as a regulatory system harmonizing relations of the agricultural production, social and natural resources, designed to optimize the production, based on the actual requirements and restrictions of the existing institutes and institutions to guarantee a rational use of land resources. Practical implications. Analysis of current situation in Ukraine suggests that the urgent task is particularly not only to create, design and import of the land consolidation institutions but also to provide the diagnostic of their maturity and suitability for the current level of the land consolidation relations. This conclusion is supported with the lack of a specific state policy on development of land consolidation and distrust in government initiates. The author also provides a list of necessary actions required {{for the development of the}} <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> in Ukraine...|$|R

5000|$|In 1991, {{privatization}} of agriculture {{was a top}} priority {{of the government of}} Prime Minister of Bulgaria Dimitar Iliev Popov. That spring, the National Assembly of Bulgaria passed a new Arable Land Law, revising the conditions for ownership and use of agricultural land. The law allowed every Bulgarian citizen to own as much as thirty hectares of land, or twenty in areas of intensive cultivation. Use of this land was at the complete discretion of the owner. Conditions were stated for voluntary formation of cooperatives by private landowners and resale of their land. With some limitations, landowners whose property had been incorporated into state farms were to receive [...] "comparable" [...] plots elsewhere or other appropriate compensation. The state or municipality retained title to land not in private hands. Another provision described redistribution of land seized by the state from cooperatives and individuals during Zhivkov's several <b>agricultural</b> <b>consolidations.</b> A National Land Council under the Council of Ministers was to oversee land distribution and arbitrate disputes, aided by a system of municipal land commissions.|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} now-developed {{countries}} implies a common transformation path of economic development. That is, within an economy, as wage grows in non-farm sectors, labour migrates out of agriculture. With fewer workers, agricultural land resources may concentrate {{into the hands}} of fewer but larger farm operations (<b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation),</b> with more investment and higher production specification. However, the development process of China is less likely to trace the same path as it does in these countries, given its distinctive institutions. To examine the development process in the unique context of China, this dissertation focuses on two questions: (1) how do China’s rural workers self-select into off-farm employment (OFE) ? (2) How does <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> occur in China? In addressing the first question, I use Roy’s self-section model to analyze the following three occupational choices of China’s rural residents: farming only, local OFE, and migratory OFE. Based on household survey data from 101 communities in rural China in 2004 and 2007, the empirical results show that individual and household characteristics are important self-selecting factors for OFE participation. More importantly, I find that the increase of OFE in China is largely consistent with market-driven expectations. In addressing the question of whether and why the consolidation of farm operations develops in China’s agriculture, I assess the divergence between the size of farm operations from equal entitlements. The theoretical model predicts that a higher opportunity cost of farm labour, {{in the form of the}} urban wage, exerts a positive influence on consolidation of farm operations through rental arrangements. A Gini index is used to measure the inequality of farmland operations relative to equal farmland entitlements, with greater inequality being consist with higher consolidation of farm operations. Empirical results support the theoretical prediction, specifically, a 1000 -yuan increase in the annual urban wage, holding all other influences constant, increases the Gini index by 0. 012 (mean= 0. 26) over the 2004 - 2007 period...|$|R

Therefore, it is crucial in order for rational Planning, to obtain lots for non-agricultural use which enable those impeding objects to be shifted. One of the most feasible ways to obtain the lots is by making use of converted substitute lots in the process of the land consolidation project.

40|$|The {{widespread}} loss {{of wetlands}} due to agricultural intensification has been highlighted {{as a major}} threat to aquatic biodiversity. However, all is not lost as we reveal that the propagules of some aquatic species could survive burial under agricultural fields in the sediments of ‘ghost ponds’ - ponds in-filled during <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation.</b> Our experiments showed at least eight aquatic macrophyte species to germinate from seeds and oospores, following 50 – 150 years of dormancy in the sediments of ghost ponds. This represents a significant proportion of the expected macrophyte diversity for local farmland ponds, which typically support between 6 and 14 macrophyte species. The rapid (< 6 months) re-colonisation of resurrected ghost ponds by a diverse aquatic vegetation similarly suggests a strong seed-bank influence. Ghost ponds represent abundant, dormant time capsules for aquatic species in agricultural landscapes around the globe, affording opportunities for enhancing landscape-scale aquatic biodiversity and connectivity. While reports of biodiversity loss through agricultural intensification dominate conservation narratives, our study offers a rare positive message, demonstrating that aquatic organisms survive prolonged burial under intensively managed agricultural fields. We urge conservationists and policy makers to consider utilizing and restoring these valuable resources in biodiversity conservation schemes and in agri-environmental approaches and policies...|$|R

The study has focused on administrative land consolidations, which are implemented {{in accordance with the}} legislation regarding agricultural land management. In the research, the role of the individual land consolidator consolidation’s actor in land consolidation procedures was studied. For this purpose, an inquiry into the land consolidation participants, administrative units and municipalities was conducted. It has been observed that in Slovenia the support of public institutions in the field of land consolidation is extremely weak. The exceptions are the areas with significant experience in this field, where land owners and consolidation participants are generally extremely satisfied with the results. Nowadays, land consolidation may {{be a part of a}} development project. The praxis in Slovenia still follows the traditional approaches, partly due to the weak public institutional support in comparison to foreign experiences.

40|$|Adopted {{about one}} year after the 1989 Revolution, Land Law (Law 18 / 1991) {{represented}} the starting point of land reform in Romania. As a result of this law implementation, {{at the beginning of the}} year 2000 the private sector owned 84 % of total agricultural land: 82 % of arable land, 74 % of land under vineyards, 67 % of land under orchards and 87 % of land under meadows and pastures. Besides the benefic social and economic effects, the mutations produced represent a distortion source in the rural area, determining the following, among others: a) crisis of ownership relations - a main aspect of this being the confusion concerning the ownership rights. The prolongation of clearing up these rights represents a major obstacle to a good operation of land market, to <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> implicitly; b) managerial crisis, manifested by the lack of competitive behaviour, which gives an increased importance to the production function, to the detriment of commercial function; this results in the increased share of small-sized subsistence farms (households), lack of strategic orientations, etc; c) land market crisis - occurred in the context of the lack of legal and institutional framework concerning the land market operation (credits in advantageous conditions for buying land through the banking system or by establishing specialised banks, solving up the problems in connection to using land as collateral for obtaining credits, mortgage credit stimulation); d) crisis of agricultural economic efficiency - mainly generated by land property excessive fragmentation, large area (about 55 %) owned by old persons or by persons not having their domicile in the rural area, lack of main production factors combination, limited circulation of land capital, lack of an adequate legal and institutional framework, etc. An analysis of the concrete, social and economic situation of land fragmentation and of <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> opportunity was conducted in the commune Balaciu; this commune is located in the plain area, with a population of 3540 inhabitants and a total area of 8462 ha. In order to identify the rural social actors which can favour land consolidation by their structure, behaviour and functionality, the following typology of rural households has been used as methodology: agricultural households (consisting of persons working only in agriculture); pluriactive households (consisting of persons involved in both agricultural and non-agricultural activities); non-active households (consisting of non-active persons); non-agricultural households (only persons working in other non-agricultural activities). The survey revealed that the main entities which can become the social actors of rural/agricultural modernisation, of land consolidation implicitly are the pluriactive and non-agricultural households.

A distinctive quality of this metropolis is the mix of highly urbanized centres and open, green areas that come in different shapes and sizes. But how to design an appropriate planning system for this environment? Mixing “red” (urban) and “green” (rural) land uses, for instance, now becomes problematic as Dutch spatial planning has always focused primarily on the urban domain whereas planning of green areas has its origins in <b>agricultural</b> land <b>consolidation</b> policy. A genuinely integrated approach to the planning of built-up areas and green areas in the open spaces is a distant ideal in this setting. In addition, the regional administrative level, being so important for metropolitan spatial challenges, needs reinforcing. The authors make a plea for a reframing {{of the notion of}} spatial planning at the national and provincial geographical and administrative scale. It takes a new object for planning, design and analysis to do the trick. The traditional rural–urban opposition is traded for “metropolitan landscape”, a new image reflecting the integration of built-up and non-built-up distinctively urban and rural land uses. Planning for the metropolitan landscape requires a reassignment of duties and responsibilities among national, provincial and municipal governments and other stakeholders...|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the last}} century the amount of {{farmland}} in production has remained relatively steady, {{but the number of}} operating farms has continually dropped, signifying a consolidation of farm enterprises. Around the 1930s hard economic times hit the country with the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl era, forcing some farmers off the land. From 1950 to 2001 the amount of U.S. farm land used for major commodity crop production has remained about the same while over half of the farms are gone. [...] A farm’s reliance on farmworkers greatly depends on the quantity and the type of crop in production. Some crops require more labor than others, and in California, any labor-intensive crops are produced such as dairy products, fruits, tree nuts and vegetables. Although the domestic farm labor force has decreased in {{the last century}}, the proportion of hired workers has grown. Increased competition among <b>agricultural</b> producers and <b>consolidation</b> have created a need for a large, inexpensive, and temporary workforce that increasingly comes from abroad.|$|R
40|$|Rural {{economic}} {{development has been}} a topic of importance to community and government leaders for some time, but is of even greater importance today given recent changes in the rural and <b>agricultural</b> marketplace. Increased <b>consolidation</b> of American agriculture is resulting in fewer farms, which, in turn, places pressure on the rural economies since there are fewer farm families to generate spending and economic activity. In addition, the recent low commodity prices are placing pressure on the spending ability of producers and farm families, which puts further pressure on rural economies. Locally owned agricultural cooperatives, whose businesses have typically centered around farm supply and grain marketing, have historically been an integral component of the local economy. In many rural areas today, local agricultural cooperatives are among a very small group of businesses in the local economy and thus are a mainstay of the rural economy. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) estimate the direct and total employment and income impacts of locally owned farm supply and grain marketing cooperatives i...|$|R
