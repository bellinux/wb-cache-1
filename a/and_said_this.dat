She felt the show was evidence, alongside Sex and the City and Desperate Housewives, that women had more leading roles on television, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> [...] "allows women to be women and to show their different emotions and what we deal with in lifeperiod". Melanie's intellect, one of her defining characteristics, earned her the nickname [...] "Med School". VIBE Vixen's Jennifer Hickman referred to Melanie as [...] "bookwormy", and Virginia Heffernan characterized her as [...] "wholesome and a good student" [...] in the pilot. Heffernan called the character a [...] "kind of Cosby Show figure" [...] due to her initial reluctance to join the Sabre Sunbeams.|$|E

Comparing McCarthy to 'Dennis the Menace' of cartoon fame, the Vermonter {{delivered}} a scathing address in which he lambasted the Wisconsin man for dividing the nation.

He marveled {{at the way the}} Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of this country for communism.' He added, 'One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.'

500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea out that we are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But we also need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E
