5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker <b>accomplished</b> <b>the</b> feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) <b>accomplished</b> <b>the</b> feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E

He then played in the 1st National Hockey League All-Star Game on October 13, 1947, for the NHL All-Stars, a 4–3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E

He successfully satisfied this request, aided by his Bedouin allies.

5|$|In {{his first}} season at Massillon, Brown's team posted a 5–4–1 record, better than the {{previous}} year but far from Brown's exacting standards.

In 1934, Massillon won all of its games until a 21–6 defeat to Canton in {{the final game of}} the season.

The National League went even longer without an MVP award to a pitcher—after Bob Gibson won in 1968, no pitcher in that league was named MVP until Clayton Kershaw in 2014.|$|E

5|$|As Bagramyan pushed towards Vitebsk, {{his forces}} were {{aided by the}} same Belorussian guerrilla fighters who had escaped the German encirclement in April. They {{provided}} vital intelligence, including information on the location of bridges and troop movements, and launched attacks against German logistic lines. On 22 June 1944, Bagration began as Bagramyan proceeded in moving westwards as previously planned. However, a widening gap on the Front's northern flank grew as it advanced while the Second Baltic Front, tasked to help defend that area, took no action. Stalin agreed to send a tank corps to reinforce Bagramyan's forces but ordered him to capture Polotsk, which would sever Army Group North's communication lines and open up a route towards the central Baltic. By 3 July, his troops had <b>accomplished</b> <b>the</b> tasks {{set forth in the}} directive, destroyed the Third Panzer Army and captured Polotsk. For his achievements, on 7 July he was decorated with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.|$|E

IX Corps had been moved to Sendai as the occupation forces shifted {{as a result of}} the downsizing. As part of further downsizing, IX Corps was inactivated on 28 March 1950, and its command responsibilities were consolidated with other units.|$|E
5|$|Maddux {{made the}} most putouts in a season (39) three times in his career (1990, 1991, and 1993). The American League leader is Frank Lary, who made 32 putouts for the Detroit Tigers in 1961. Kaat is the leader in assists; he made 72 with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. The National League leader, Maddux, trails him by one (71 assists in 1996). Many {{pitchers}} have posted errorless seasons and 1.000 fielding percentages in their winning seasons; Mussina is the leader with four perfect seasons in the field. Guidry (19821984) and Mussina (19961998) both <b>accomplished</b> <b>the</b> feat in three consecutive seasons. The most double plays turned by a winning pitcher is nine, accomplished by Maddux in 2006. Four pitchers have also thrown no wild pitches in a winning season: Maddux (1997, 2006), Kaat (1975), Shantz (1961, 1962), and Rogers (2005). In contrast, the most wild pitches in a winning season is 18, by the knuckleballing Niekro. The fewest balks in a winning season is zero, achieved many times, but Maddux <b>accomplished</b> <b>the</b> feat the most time in his wins (12 balk-free seasons in 18 years). The most balks in a winning season is five, by Mike Norris in 1981 and Orel Hershiser in 1988. Langston picked off the most runners from the pitcher's mound in a winning season, with 10 in 1993; four pitchers are tied for the National League lead with 5 pickoffs. Rogers posted both the highest (100% in 2002) and lowest (0% in 2005) caught stealing percentage in a winning season. Shantz' 1961 season tied Rogers' 0% mark for lowest percentage caught, and three pitchers are tied for the National League lead (67% caught).|$|E
