5|$|To {{help get}} the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters {{listed as a}} landmark, RMJM Hillier and Rohm and Haas focused renovations on opening up floor space and modernizing systems. A part of the {{original}} plan that altered the building's facade was abandoned, but the facade received a thorough cleaning. Inside, most of the enclosed office space was removed and replaced with open workstations. The new layout was also designed to let more light into the interior of the building. The work spaces also received new furniture, which replaced some that dated back to the 1960s. The dining area was moved from the basement to street level in <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that</b> was previously occupied by a bank, but had lain vacant for several years. Security, telecommunications, and central plant systems were also upgraded and modernized. The interior renovations finished around May 2008, with improvements to the surrounding plaza completed several months later.|$|E

40|$|I {{find the}} {{relationship}} of pool structures and water fascinating. The architecture of pools is often hard edged and geometric while water is a fluid and formless, an organic substance that takes the shape of whatever contains it. I am drawn to that paradox. Rather than pulling them apart because of their conflicting existences, they create <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that’s</b> cohesive but inexplicable, <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that’s</b> both reciprocally intertwined and interdependent. My work is set up within {{the idea of creating}} a conflicting yet cohesive space. Visually, corporally and conceptually, it creates experiences that are disorienting. My work serves as a reminder of the motion and float-ability that exists in water. I’m interested in objects entering the surface of the water, and the way they find themselves rising back to the surface according to their buoyancy. My work explores buoyancy outside of a literal body of water, connecting it to different aspects such as light, air or language. Within the space, the materials used for my work create layers of subtle conflict that make up <b>an</b> illogical <b>space</b> <b>that’s</b> difficult to literalize...|$|R

25|$|Klein's {{synthesis}} of geometry as {{the study of}} the properties of <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that</b> is invariant under a given group of transformations, known as the Erlangen Program (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was set out in Klein's inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The program proposed a unified approach to geometry that has become the accepted modern view. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of transformations that preserve those properties. Thus the program's definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} lack of anecdotal devices, the {{painting}} is unusual in other ways. Bathsheba is presented in <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that</b> is difficult to read. The dark background is suggestive of night, while a massive column implies a large architectural structure. Behind her lies a passage of richly painted drapery composed of browns and ochers that impart a golden warmth. Around her rests a thickly painted background of white chemise; set against this her naked flesh stands out for its solid form and the sumptuous application of paint. The paint used to describe her figure is richly nuanced, its broad brushstrokes and strong highlights impart a vibrant tactile quality to the body, rendering her presence palpable.|$|E
25|$|GLaDOS' {{physical}} appearance went through several iterations when Valve had Jason Brashill help drive the visual creation of GLaDOS. Early designs used for her included a floating brain, a spider-like appearance, and an upside-down version of Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus {{with the four}} personality cores around her body. Eventually, they settled {{on the design of}} the robotic figure hanging upside down. This was done to convey both a sense of raw mechanical power and femininity. A large disk with the four personality cores hanging from it was added to her design, when she was still just a sphere standing above it. However, the team found it to be too small, giving her a body and putting it below the disk. Another early design was when GLaDOS was only a cube, which was used for the removed laser battle mentioned below. The large chamber that the player-character encounters {{was the result of the}} team wanting to build <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that</b> brought a great deal of attention to her.|$|E

500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that</b> it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone...

500|$|Another {{generalization}} concerns functions between differentiable or smooth manifolds. Intuitively speaking such a manifold M is <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>that</b> can be approximated near {{each point}} x by a vector space called its tangent space: the prototypical {{example is a}} smooth surface in R3. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map [...] between manifolds, at a point x in M, is then a linear map from the tangent space of M at x to the tangent space of N at f(x). The derivative function becomes a map between the tangent bundles of M and N. This definition is fundamental in differential geometry and has many uses – see pushforward (differential) and pullback (differential geometry).|$|E
