500|$|Furtado {{said that}} {{with the release of}} her albums before Loose, she had wanted to prove herself as a {{musician}} and earn respect from listeners through using many different instruments on an album, which most hip hop musicians did not do. After she believed she had accomplished that, she felt she had freedom to make the type of music she [...] "really love".

500|$|Dawson's initial {{inspiration}} {{came from}} a visit to The Orchard, an inn in Grantchester where she encountered a photograph of maids who had been there while Brooke was in residence there from 1909–1914.

Dawson choose to write about Brooke because she was intrigued by his personality and why women kept falling in love with him. To explore Brooke's personality, she <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> the question [...] "What if Rupert Brooke put a note under one of these floorboards—a note, in a way, just for me?" [...] She also was particularly interested in capturing the essence of Grantchester, the primary setting for the novel.|$|E

What if Dracula were still alive?" [...] She immediately scratched out seven pages of notes into her writer's notebook. Two days later, she started work on the novel. At {{the time she was}} teaching English as a second language, creative writing and composition classes at universities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

60|$|Thoughts came to her, as she <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> that question, {{which have}} startled and saddened us all.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps, {{there was}} some hidden meaning in this. There was unquestionably a sudden {{alteration}} in his look and manner; the cook <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> what it meant.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is he {{thinking}} of?' she <b>asked</b> <b>herself.</b> Her thoughts flashed back. 'And {{why did he}} ask me so peculiarly {{whether he}} should wire them at home?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>ask</b> <b>herself,</b> if you please. I {{have such}} trust in her {{judgment}} that I should leave her altogether {{to her own}} discretion." ...|$|R

60|$|Grace <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> {{in her own}} way, {{that same}} {{question}} many a time between Burrough and Bideford. When they arrived on the quay the question answered itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you going}} to do with him?" [...] said Mrs. Hammond, {{regarding}} her infant as if she often <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> the same question about her boy.|$|E
60|$|But {{she refused}} to go horseback riding in Central Park. She refused {{to go to the}} Plaza. And these refusals she made deliberately, without <b>asking</b> <b>herself</b> why.|$|R

6000|$|... "The ass {{is always}} {{knocking}} down my beacons outside the river," [...] he murmured. He attached no other meaning to Heemskirk's existence; but Freya was <b>asking</b> <b>herself</b> whether the lieutenant had seen them.|$|R
