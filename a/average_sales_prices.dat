50|$|Trade {{in value}} is an {{important}} facet of the car deal. Trade value estimates {{can be found at}} sites such as NADA,KBB, Edmunds, CarGurus and Consumer Reports. However, most of these values are estimated from a theoretical chart {{that may or may not}} be based on recent <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> of a particular make and model. If a particular make and model has less accurate data available from recent auction prices the dealer will be more cautious in the appraisal of the car. Inputting an identical used car on each of the above sites will render different values. Sometimes these values will differ slightly,while at other times their sites may differ significantly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the American piano {{industry}} {{does not appear to}} have slowed following the financial crisis of in the mid-1850s, although the <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> of pianos lowered, but the industry went into decline during the Civil War when both the prices of pianos and value of piano sales compared to the number of workmen dropped. According to the 1860 United States Census fifty-five manufacturers in New York state had employed 2,064 hands—1,728 in New York City—and produced 12,800 pianos worth $2,849,007 ($1,381 per worker, or $223 per piano) compared to sixty-seven manufacturers reporting 7,686 pianos worth $2,592,662 in 1855; ($1,447 per workman. $338 per piano) whereas the 1865 New York state census listed 1,406 workers for forty-one piano manufacturers reporting—only 855 in New York City—and twenty-seven manufacturers declared $1,874,931 in sales. The 1875 article described that Lindeman's workforce was reduced by half during the war.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a model framework and a corresponding empirical inference procedure for estimating long-run marginal cost in industries where production costs decline over time. In {{the context of}} the solar photovoltaic module industry, we rely on firm-level financial accounting data to estimate the long-run marginal cost of PV modules for the years 2008 - 2013. During those years, the industry experienced both sharp price declines and significant expansions of manufacturing capacity. By comparing the trajectory of <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> with the long-run marginal cost estimates, we {{are in a position to}} quantify the extent to which actual price declines were attributable to excess capacity as opposed to reductions in production costs. While we find a significant effect attributable to excess capacity for some quarters in our sample period, the dynamics of this industry also points to a rate of cost reductions that is even faster than the 80 % learning curve which has described the trajectory of <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> over the past three decades...|$|E

Controlling for square-footage, the decade in which the house was built, and whether a home was inside the urban growth boundary, we find that being within the boundary has {{a positive effect on}} sales prices in both years. The difference between the effects in the two years, however, is statistically insignificant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The TAC SCM {{tournament is}} moving into its fourth year. In {{an effort to}} track agent progress, we present a {{benchmark}} market efficiency comparison for the tournament, in addition to prior measures of agent competency through customer bidding. Using these benchmarks we find statistically significant increases in intratournament market efficiency, whereas agents are generally decreasing in manufacturer market power. We find that agent market share and bid efficiency have increased while the variance of <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> has been significantly reduced. Additionally, we test for a statistical relationship between agent profits and the bullwhip effect. ...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{the price}} {{evolution}} of {{houses on the}} basis of <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices,</b> as is current practice in Belgium, might be misleading due to changing characteristics of the houses sold in the periods observed. A hedonic index which takes into account changes in characteristics is more appropriate. We use the budget surveys of the Belgian Statistical Institute to illustrate how this also applies for Belgium. The estimated hedonic price index for house sales on the secondary market is practically always below the index based on average sales values for the period considered. This demonstrates the need to collect more extensive data on the characteristics of the dwellings sold in Belgium. ...|$|E

40|$|The ever-changing {{senses of}} {{consumption}} and fashion {{factor in the}} world have caused an ongoing increase on the demand towards hand woven textiles in recent years. Therefore, the prices of hand woven textiles, where the supply is limited, are on the rise. It is known that Buldan city, one of the centers of hand woven production in Anatolia, has a significant commercial potential in this respect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide an insight to the industry by comparing the profit margin of products woven in hand looms and automatic looms in textile industry in Buldan city and to raise awareness regarding the importance of production in hand looms. “Scarf”, which is the most produced textile item in Buldan, was preferred in the application study. In the study, the unit costs of the scarves woven with insect silk, floss silk, cotton and linen yarn, which are widely used in production, in hand looms and automatic looms were calculated and the profit margins to be calculated through the <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> were compared. At the end of the application study, it was seen that the profit margin of hand woven textiles was almost twice as high as the textiles woven in automatic looms...|$|E
