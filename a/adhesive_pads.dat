500|$|Tree frogs live {{high in the}} canopy, {{where they}} {{scramble}} around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The [...] "true" [...] tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae, but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of convergent evolution. These include the glass frogs (Centrolenidae), the bush frogs (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae), and the shrub frogs (Rhacophoridae). Most tree frogs are under [...] in length, with long legs and long toes with <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis {{on the surface and}} also surface tension and viscosity. Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed. Some members of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet. The reticulated leaf frog (Phyllomedusa ayeaye) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.|$|E

2500|$|The {{leaves are}} palmately compound, {{composed}} of five leaflets (rarely three leaflets, particularly on younger vines, and sometimes seven) joined from a central {{point on the}} leafstalk, and range from [...] (rarely to [...] ) across. The leaflets have a toothed margin.

2500|$|Parthenocissus quinquefolia {{can be used}} as a shading vine for {{buildings}} on masonry walls. [...] Because the vine, like its relative P. tricuspidata (Boston ivy), adheres to the surface by disks rather than penetrating roots, it does not harm the masonry but will keep a building cooler by shading the wall surface during the summer. As with ivy, ripping the plant from the wall will leave the adhesive disks behind. If the plant clings to fragile surfaces it can first be killed by severing the vine from the root. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> will then eventually deteriorate and release their grip.|$|E

50|$|Many {{arboreal}} species, such as tree porcupines, chameleons, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails {{to grasp}} branches. In the spider monkey and crested gecko, {{the tip of}} the tail has either a bare patch or <b>adhesive</b> <b>pad,</b> which provide increased friction.|$|R

40|$|The {{infection}} of nematodes by the endoparasitic fungus Verticillium balanoides was studied {{by means of}} optical and electron microscopical techniques. Conidia of this fungus adhere randomly in high numbers to the entire cuticle surface of the nematode Panagrellus redivivus. Adhesion is accomplished {{by means of a}} tri-layered <b>adhesive</b> <b>pad</b> located at the apical end of the conidium, the outermost layer of which shows a radiated substructure. After attachment an appressorium which grows through the <b>adhesive</b> <b>pad</b> and establishes a firm contact between the fungal cell wall and the nematode cuticle is formed. Penetration of the cuticle by means of a hyphal outgrowth on the appressorium is followed by the formation of an infection bulb from which trophic hyphae develop that invade the nematode. Approximately 60 h after infection conidiophores develop outside the nematode, producing numerous conidia...|$|R
50|$|During {{locomotion}} on {{the skin}} of the sole, the anterior region of E. soleae temporarily attaches to the skin via two pads through an adhesive secretion. These <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> contain two glandular secretions packaged in rods and spheroidal bodies. The locomotion step of E. soleae {{on the skin}} sole starts through elongation of the body with the haptor attached. Before attachment of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> to the sole skin, liquid spheroidal bodies quickly spreads {{across the surface of the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> as well as bundles of rod-like secretory bodies leave the pepper-pot apertures of rod-carrying ducts. The synergy of both secretions produces the cement that binds the parasite to the host.|$|E

5000|$|Crested {{blennies}} are oviparous {{and experience}} district pairing. Their eggs are demersal and adhesive and {{attach to the}} substrate with filamentous <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> or pedestals. The larvae are planktonic and are often found in shallow, coastal waters.|$|E
50|$|Unlike frog and lizard <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> {{which are}} often dry, insects tend to have an {{associated}} fluid for adhesion. The fluid that is secreted has a special property of being composed of an immiscible mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic material.|$|E
5000|$|The smooth <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> {{have shown}} {{convergent}} evolution between amphibians (geckos and frogs), arthropods and mammals (possum). [...] The mechanisms involved even {{appear to be}} similar. [...] This could indicate that this method of locomotion has found its optimal form in many species of animals. Hairy attachment systems of the gekkonid lizards and spiders do not produce fluids, these organisms rely on van der Waals interactions for the generation of strong attractive forces. Tree frog toe-pads are made of columnar epithelial cells that are separated from {{each other at the}} apices. Pores for mucous glands open into the channels that are between the cells which create a toe pad epithelium that has an array of flat topped cells with mucous filled grooves between them. The purpose of having cells separated at the tip is to allow the toe to conform to the structure it will adhere to. The hexagonal design around the outside of the cells (similar to the crickets) is likely to allow for the mucous to spread evenly over the cell. Smooth <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> are found in arboreal possums, which are marsupials that glide between trees. [...] The possum is also capable of using smooth <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> to climb vertically, making use of large toe pads. The pads consist of an epidermal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with the outer most layer's cells being flattened. The pad has alternating ridges and grooves with sweat glands emptying into the grooves providing fluid for wet adhesion. Bats have also evolved <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> separately. Some bats make use of an adhesive appendage, while others have suctioning adhesive organs.|$|E

5000|$|Sphaerodactylus is a genus of geckos {{from the}} Americas [...] that are {{distinguished}} from other Gekkota by their small size, by their round, rather than vertical, eye pupils, and by each digit terminating in a single, round <b>adhesive</b> <b>pad</b> or scale, from which their name (Sphaero = round, dactylus = finger) is derived. All species in this genus are rather small, but two species, S. ariasae and S. parthenopion, are tiny, and - with a snout-vent length of about 1.6 cm - the smallest reptiles in the world.|$|R

5000|$|Certain {{devices are}} {{promoted}} to allegedly remove toxins from the body. One version involves a foot-bath using a mild electric current, while another involves small <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> {{applied to the}} skin (usually the foot). In both cases, the production of an alleged brown [...] "toxin" [...] appears after a brief delay. In {{the case of the}} foot bath, the [...] "toxin" [...] is actually small amounts of rusted iron leaching from the electrodes. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>pads</b> change color due to oxidation of the pads' ingredients in response to the skin's moisture. In both cases, the same color-changes occur irrespective of whether the water or patch even make contact with the skin (they merely require water—thus proving the color-change does not result from any body-detoxification process).|$|E

40|$|Examination of dust {{collected}} from the homes of asthmatic patients showed there were significant numbers of house dust mites (HDM). The allergens generated from HDM {{are considered to be}} among the risk factors for asthma development. HDM can be identified in mattresses, carpets, quilts and pillows. HDM are about 0. 2 x 0. 3 mm in size, so they are only clearly visible under microscopic magnification. Therefore, it is important to develop a trapping kit to capture and stain them. We devised a trapping kit that is comprised of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>pad</b> and a staining agent. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>pad</b> is made of cotton cloth and is coated with glue, which can attract and trap HDM to prevent them from further spreading. The staining agent contains nanogold-coupled monoclone antibodies, which can react with HDM through binding with group 2 allergens on the body surface of HDM. After staining, both Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Tp) become visible to the naked eye. Our study showed that the HDM trapping pad can attract and trap HDM. The staining agent makes them visible so they can be counted. This kit can help us to identify the predominant HDM infestation area in the household environment. By identifying the infestation area, we can reduce HDM exposure and prevent the development of allergic disease...|$|R
