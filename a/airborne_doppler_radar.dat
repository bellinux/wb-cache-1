40|$|On June 29, 1981, two {{ground-based}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars,</b> an <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> optical <b>radar</b> (lidar), an instrumented tower, and a rawinsonde {{were employed}} to collect wind data in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in central Oklahoma. The main objectives of this experiment were related to a comparison of wind estimates and the visualization of the three-dimensional eddy structure in the convective atmospheric boundary layer. Discrepancies in the mean wind and wind profile detected by the different sensing systems were explained as being caused by a Schuler resonance of the aircraft's inertial navigation system, which caused an erroneous component of the aircraft's ground-relative velocity vector to be subtracted from the lidar-measured radial velocities. It is concluded that NASA's <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> optical <b>radar</b> system is capable of measuring wind fields in clear air {{on a smaller scale}} than was previously available with fixed remote sensors...|$|R

40|$|High {{resolution}} windspeed profile {{measurements are}} needed to provide reliable detection of hazardous low altitude windshear with an <b>airborne</b> pulse <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar.</b> The system phase noise in a <b>Doppler</b> weather <b>radar</b> may degrade the spectrum moment estimation quality and the clutter cancellation capability which are important in windshear detection.

A method is presented for the direct measurement of windspeed gradient using low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) radar. This spatial gradient is essential in obtaining the windshear hazard index. As an alternative, the modified Prony method is suggested as a spectrum mode estimator for both the clutter and weather signal. Estimation of Doppler spectrum modes may provide the desired windshear hazard information without the need of any preliminary processing requirement such as clutter filtering.

Among the sensors being tested are the ground-based Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) and <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> and LIDAR systems.

40|$|Finescale radar {{observations}} of intense thermals/starting plumes, {{during the early}} stages of precipitation formation, were collected by an <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> on two separate days. The radar data were recorded as the aircraft flew underneath the developing echoes. Mantle echoes (echoes that often appear as an inverted U shape) were observed on both days. Striking in one of the scans was the resemblance of the echo to a mushroom cloud resulting from a nuclear explosion. Numerical simulations using a two-dimensional cloud-resolving model were run to augment the interpretation of the observations. One of the important conclusions was the proposed modification to the default bulk microphysical scheme used in the model. The default scheme yields ‘‘a rush to precipitation’ ’ leading to the early establishment of large precipitation contents, which is not supported by the observations. Suggested modifications to the scheme are presented. 1...|$|E

40|$|Two {{independent}} airborne dual-wavelength techniques, {{based on}} nadir measurements of radar reflectivity factors and Doppler velocities, respectively, are investigated {{with respect to}} their capability of estimating microphysical properties of hydrometeors. The data used to investigate the methods are taken from the ER- 2 <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> (X-band) and Cloud <b>Radar</b> System (W-band) <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> during the Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers-Florida Area Cirrus Experiment campaign in 2002. Validity is assessed by {{the degree to which the}} methods produce consistent retrievals of the microphysics. For deriving snow parameters, the reflectivity-based technique has a clear advantage over the Doppler-velocity-based approach because of the large dynamic range in the dual-frequency ratio (DFR) with respect to the median diameter Do and the fact that the difference in mean Doppler velocity at the two frequencies, i. e., the differential Doppler velocity (DDV), in snow is small relative to the measurement errors and is often not uniquely related to Do. The DFR and DDV can also be used to independently derive Do in rain. At W-band, the DFR-based algorithms are highly sensitive to attenuation from rain, cloud water, and water vapor. Thus, the retrieval algorithms depend on various assumptions regarding these components, whereas the DDV-based approach is unaffected by attenuation. In view of the difficulties and ambiguities associated with the attenuation correction at W-band, the DDV approach in rain is more straightforward and potentially more accurate than the DFR method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the use of}} airborne or ground-based Doppler radars to observe precipitating systems over complex orography. As {{nearly all of the}} previous experi-ments involving Doppler radars were conducted over flat surfaces over the continents or the oceans, new techniques are needed firstly to separate ground clutter from meteorological signal and, in the case of airborne Doppler observations, to deduce navigational errors. Secondly, it is necessary to take the atmospheric circulation induced by orography into account in the three-dimensional wind field analysis. Variational techniques are presented to solve these problems. The proposed methods are tested with simulated ground-based and <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> observations for analytic flows over analytic terrains and for numerically simulated wind and reflectivity fields for the Brig event (22 September 1993) of heavy precipitation over the southern flank of the Alps (Cosma and Richard, 1998), and with actual airborne Doppler data relative to weak snow showers over the Rocky Mountains on 12 March 1995. 1...|$|E

Convective evolution within the inner core conforms to patterns shown by previous studies: convection initiates downshear-right, intensifies downshear-left and weakens upshear. Analysis of the vertical distribution of radar reflectivity and vertical air motion indicates the development of upper-level downdrafts in conjunction with strong convection downshear-left and a maximum in frequency upshear-left. Intense updrafts and downdrafts both conform to the shear asymmetry pattern. While strong updrafts occur within the eyewall, intense downdrafts show far more radial variability, particularly in the upshear-left quadrant, though they concentrate along the eyewall edges. Strong updrafts are collocated with low-level inflow and upper-level outflow superimposed on the background flow.

40|$|Recently, {{observations}} of electrified oceanic convection and associated cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning were obtained over the tropical western Pacific Ocean during TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment). During COARE, {{observations of}} convection were made {{using a variety}} of instrument platforms including ship and <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars,</b> an advanced lightning direction finder (ALDF) network, and a shipborne inverted electric field mill. This study focuses on data collected by the COARE ALDF network, fusion of those data with observations, and the methods used to calculate accurate CG return stroke locations. Analysis of CG lightning data and <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> data indicates that lightning-producing oceanic convection is characterized by deep, vertically developed convective cells with radar reflectivities exceeding 30 dBZ above the height of the 010 �C level. In several cases a peak in CG frequency occurred coincident with the descent of precipitation mass bounded by the 30 -dBZ reflectivity contour, linking the descent of the hydrometeor mass to the occurrence of CG lightning. The diurnal cycle of oceanic CG lightning, the convective available potential energy (CAPE), and rainfall indicates a peak in all these variables {{in the early morning hours}} (local time), approximately 2 h before the peak in cold-cloud area defined by brightness temperatures of less than 065 �C. Sounding data indicate a strong positive correlation between CAPE and mixed-layer wet-bulb potential temperature and a weak positive correlation between CAPE and the number of CG lightning flashes observed in a 24 -h period. The data also indicate that a highly nonlinear relationship exists between the wet-bulb potential temperature and the number of CG flashes observed in a 24 -h period. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} and finescale {{structure of a}} dryline that initiated a line of thunderstorms is presented. Both the along-line variability and mean vertical structure were examined using data collected by an <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> and a water vapor differential absorption lidar (DIAL). The initiation of convection appeared to result from the diurnally induced easterly flow in the maritime air east of the dryline that typically develops late in the day. This flow increased the low-level convergence and allowed rising parcels of air to reach the level of free convection. The along-line variability was largely attributed to numerous misocyclones distorting the thin line of radar reflectivity by advecting dry (moist) air across the dryline south (north) of the misocyclone. The misocyclones also influenced {{the location of the}} updrafts, with most of the peak values positioned north of the circulations.

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{integrated}} windshear program, the Federal Aviation Administration, jointly with NASA, is sponsoring a research effort to develop airborne sensor technology {{for the detection of}} low altitude windshear during aircraft take-off and landing. One sensor being considered is microwave Doppler radar operating at X-band or above. Using a Microburst/Clutter/Radar simulation program, a preliminary feasibility study was conducted to assess the performance of Doppler radars for this application. Preliminary results from this study are presented. Analysis show, that using bin-to-bin Automatic Gain Control (AGC), clutter filtering, limited detection range, and suitable antenna tilt management, windshear from a wet microburst can be accurately detected 10 to 65 seconds (. 75 to 5 km) in front of the aircraft. Although a performance improvement can be obtained at higher frequency, the baseline X-band system that was simulated detected the presence of a windshear hazard for the dry microburst.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the signal processing {{problems associated with the}} detection of hazardous windshears using <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> when weak weather returns are in the presence of strong clutter returns. In light of the frequent inadequacy of spectral-processing oriented clutter suppression methods, we model a clutter signal as multiple sinusoids plus Gaussian noise, and propose adaptive filtering approaches that better capture the temporal characteristics of the signal process. This idea leads to two research topics in signal processing: (1) signal modeling and parameter estimation, and (2) adaptive filtering in this particular signal environment. A high-resolution, low SNR threshold maximum likelihood (ML) frequency estimation and signal modeling algorithm is devised and proves capable of delineating both the spectral and temporal nature of the clutter return. Furthermore, the Least Mean Square (LMS) -based adaptive filter's performance for the proposed signal model is investigated, and promising simulation results have testified to its potential for clutter rejection leading to more accurate estimation of windspeed thus obtaining a better assessment of the windshear hazard...|$|E

The fundamental quantity obtained by this system to measure river currents is the mean offset of the Doppler spectrum.

A stratified-sphere model, allowing the fractional water content to vary along the radius of the particle, is used to compute the scattering properties of individual melting snowflakes. Using the effective dielectric constants computed by the conjugate gradient-fast Fourier transform (CGFFT) numerical method for X and W bands, and expressing the fractional water content of melting particle as an exponential function in particle radius, {{it is found that}} at X band the simulated radar bright-band profiles are in an excellent agreement with the measured profiles. It is also found that the simulated W-band profiles usually resemble the shapes of the measured bright-band profiles even though persistent offsets between them are present. These offsets, however, {{can be explained by the}} attenuation caused by cloud water and water vapor at W band. This is confirmed by the comparisons of the radar profiles made in the rain regions where the un-attenuated W-band reflectivity profiles can be estimated through the X- and W band Doppler velocity measurements.

40|$|Ground-based and <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> data {{collected}} during passage of frontal rainstorms over the European Alps and Cascade Mountains of Oregon {{are found to}} exhibit characteristic cross-barrier flow and precipitation patterns. A stably stratified layer of blocked (or partially blocked) low-momentum flow below mountain-crest level is separated from strong cross-barrier flow aloft by a concentrated layer of vertical wind shear. This shear layer slopes upward toward the mountain crest and persists for several hours as the storm passes over the mountain range. This pattern is remarkably similar from case to case and from one mountain range to the other. The orographically enhanced precipitation in these cases exhibits stratiform structure, marked by a radar bright band, which often drops to a lower height (indicating locally cooler conditions) immediately adjacent to the windward mountain slopes. A terrain-induced gravity wave pro-duces strong downslope flow and spillover of precipitation onto the lee side of the barrier. An elevated reflectivity maximum appears above the mountain crest and extends a short distance (generally 20 – 40 km) upstream, apparently {{as a result of}} gravity wave lifting.

During two flights, 18 significant turbulence encounters (sigma(sub Delta) is greater than or equal to 0. 20 g) occurred in the vicinity of deep convection; 14 moderate and 4 severe. In all cases, the encounters with turbulence occurred along the periphery of cumulus convection. These events were associated with relatively low values of radar reflectivity, i. e. RRF is less than 35 dBz, with most levels being below 20 dBz. The four cases of severe turbulence occurred in precipitation and were centered at the interface between a cumulus updraft turret and a downwind downdraft. Horizontal gradients of vertical velocity at this interface were found to be strongest on the downwind side of the cumulus turrets. Furthermore, the greatest loads to the aircraft occurred while flying along, not orthogonal to, the ambient environmental wind vector.

40|$|Algorithms for the {{retrieval}} of atmospheric winds in precipitating systems from downward-pointing, conically-scanning <b>airborne</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> are presented. The {{focus in the}} paper is on two radars: the Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler(IWRAP) and the High-altitude IWRAP (HIWRAP). The IWRAP is a dual-frequency (Cand Ku band), multi-beam (incidence angles of 30 50) system that flies on the NOAAWP- 3 D aircraft at altitudes of 2 - 4 km. The HIWRAP is a dual-frequency (Ku and Kaband), dual-beam (incidence angles of 30 and 40) system that flies on the NASA Global Hawk aircraft at altitudes of 18 - 20 km. Retrievals of the three Cartesian wind components over the entire radar sampling volume are described, which can be determined using either a traditional least squares or variational solution procedure. The random errors in the retrievals are evaluated using both an error propagation analysis and a numerical simulation of a hurricane. These analyses show that the vertical and along-track wind errors have strong across-track dependence with values of 0. 25 m s- 1 at nadir to 2. 0 m s- 1 and 1. 0 m s- 1 at the swath edges, respectively. The across-track wind errors also have across-track structure and are on average, 3. 0 3. 5 m s- 1 or 10 of the hurricane wind speed. For typical rotated figure four flight patterns through hurricanes, the zonal and meridional wind speed errors are 2 3 m s- 1.
