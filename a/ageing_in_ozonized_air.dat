40|$|There is {{very little}} {{agreement}} among the numerous papers which have been published {{on the content of}} oxides of nitrogen <b>in</b> <b>ozonized</b> <b>air.</b> The divergence <b>in</b> results might be attributed to either the method of analysis or the performance of the individual ozone generator. There are many methods for the determination of nitric acid and the oxides of nitrogen but the common method for analysis of ozone involves the re-action between potassium iodide and a measured volume of ozonized oxygen. The iodine liberated by the ozone is determined by the standard thiosulfate method. The method of analysis has been criticized on the basis that oxides of nitrogen which are present <b>in</b> <b>ozonized</b> <b>air</b> also liberate iodine. However, it has been established that nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide do not exist as such in the presence of ozone but are oxidized to nitric anhydride (1, 2). Furthermore, it has been established by many investigators (3, 4, 5, 6) that pure, dilute nitric acid is not an oxidizin...|$|R
40|$|The {{early stages}} of thermal {{oxidation}} of the basal plane of highly oriented graphite (HOPG) have been investigated <b>in</b> <b>ozonized</b> <b>air.</b> Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was employed to determine the surface topography on the nanometer scale. At temperatures within the range 300 - 500 °C and at O 3 concentrations below 1 ppm, the abstraction of carbon atoms from the basal plane, that is, formation of pointlike defects, occurs. These defects upon further oxidation are enlarged to monolayer deep pits with diameters in the range 1 - 100 nm. Pit formation does not proceed continuously during oxidation and is strongly inhibited when a critical pit density is reached. The pits are not generated {{very close to the}} pit edges with the consequence of a quite uniform not purely statistical coverage of the HOPG surface with the pits. Oxidation time, temperature, and O 3 concentration can be used to control the pit density and their distribution across the surface, the pit diameter, and the diameter distribution with unprecedented reproducibility.

40|$|Background: Ozone {{is a major}} {{secondary}} air pollutant often reaching high concentrations in urban areas under strong daylight, high temperature and stagnant high-pressure systems. Ozone in the troposphere is a pollutant that is harmful to the plant. Principal Findings: By exposing cells to a strong pulse of <b>ozonized</b> <b>air,</b> an acute cell death was observed in suspension cells of Arabidopsis thaliana used as a model. We demonstrated that O 3 treatment induced the activation of a plasma membrane anion channel that is an early prerequisite of O 3 -induced cell death in A. thaliana. Our data further suggest interplay of anion channel activation with well known plant responses to O 3, Ca 2 + influx and NADPH-oxidase generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mediating the oxidative cell death. This interplay might be fuelled by several mechanisms {{in addition to the}} direct ROS generation by O 3; namely, H 2 O 2 generation by salicylic and abscisic acids. Anion channel activation was also shown to promote the accumulation of transcripts encoding vacuolar processing enzymes, a family of proteases previously reported to contribute to the disruption of vacuole integrity observed during programmed cell death. Significance: Collectively, our data indicate that anion efflux is an early key component of morphological and biochemical events leading to O 3 -induced programmed cell death. Because ion channels and more specifically anion channels assume a crucial position in cells, an understanding about the underlying role(s) for ion channels in the signalling pathway leading t...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} an experiment to remove NO{sub x} from air-like gas flows by optimizing its oxidation to nitric acid. Their {{aim is to}} demonstrate an efficient de-NO{sub x} process that can replace the catalytic converter of today`s automobiles and recover greater engine performance. NO is oxidized to HNO{sub 3 } by injecting O{sub 3 } from an auxiliary air discharge unit, and the acid is scrubbed by a granular NaOH filter, the final product being NaNO{sub 3 }. In theory this scheme requires less engine power than the enthalpy loss through the catalytic converter, and permits engine operation with oxygen-rich fuel mixtures at high compression ratios for peak thermodynamic efficiency. Experiments utilize a glass tube flow reactor with a 20 liter/minute flow mixed from the separate injections of compressed <b>ozonized</b> <b>air</b> and an admixture of 200 ppm of NO in nitrogen from a small pressurized bottle, for net proportions of 89 % N{sub 2 }, 11 % O{sub 2 }, 120 ppm NO.

40|$|Abstract: Agriculture is {{the largest}} user of world water resources, {{accounting}} for 70 % of all consumption. Reducing water consumption and increasing water use efficiency in agriculture {{are two of the}} main challenges that need to be faced in the coming decades. Radicchio Rosso di Treviso Tardivo (RTT) is a vegetable that requires a water forcing process prior to final commercialization which presents a significant environmental impact due to the high water volumes used and then dispersed into the environment. The experiment was aimed at reducing the water use in the forcing process of RTT, by developing a pilot system with recycled water in a closed loop through ozone treatment. Concerning water quality, the redox potential value was higher <b>in</b> the <b>ozonized</b> system, whereas turbidity, pH and electrical conductivity of the ozonized system did not change significantly from the control. Yield and quality of plants obtained <b>in</b> the <b>ozonized</b> system did not significantly differ from the control plants except for the antioxidant activity that was higher in plants forced using the water treated with ozone.

40|$|Although the {{beneficial}} effects of balneotherapy {{have been recognized}} since a long time, a few information {{is available on the}} biological mechanisms underlying them and the subjective feelings of increased well-being and mood. The links between the serotonin (5 -HT) system and mood prompted us to investigate the 5 -HT platelet transporter (SERT), which is considered a reliable, peripheral marker of the same structure present in presynaptic neurons, in 20 healthy volunteers before (t 0) and 30 min after (t 1) thermal balneotherapy with ozonized water of Montecatini spa, as compared with a similar group who underwent a bath in non-mineral water. The SERT was evaluated by means of the specific binding of H- 3 -paroxetine (H- 3 -Par) to platelet membranes. Equilibrium-saturation binding data, the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (Kd), were obtained by means of the Scatchard analysis. The results showed that, while Bmax values did not change in both groups, the Kd values decreased significantly at t 1 only in those subjects who bathed <b>in</b> <b>ozonized</b> water. The results of this study, while showing a decrease of the dissociation constant (Kd) which is the inverse of affinity constant, of H- 3 -Par binding to SERT in all subjects after balneotherapy and not in those bathing in normal water, suggest that SERT modifications may be related to a specific effect of ozonized water and, perhaps, also to the increased sense of well-being.

Methods: Water samples were collected from air-water syringes, cup fillers and tap water before {{and at the end}} of the working day. They were cultured on non-nutrient agar (NNA) plates. Species identification was carried out with a PCR assay based on sequence analysis of the 18 S rRNA gene. The cellular response to ozone was tested on Acanthamoeba cyst with different doses at different contact time in vitro twice. Results: Prevalence rates for Acanthamoeba contamination were 100, 100 and 72 % for air-water syringes, cup fillers and tap water, respectively. The morphological analysis revealed the presence of A. castellanii, A. griffin, A. hatchitti and A. lenticulata.

40|$|Background: Date {{is one of}} the {{foodstuffs}} {{that are}} produced in tropical areas and used worldwide. Conventionally, methyl bromide and phosphine are used for date disinfection. The toxic side effects of these usual disinfectants have led food scientists to consider safer agents such as ozone for disinfection, because food safety is a top priority. The present study was performed to investigate the possibility of replacing common conventional disinfectants with ozone for date disinfection and microbial load reduction. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, date samples were ozonized for 3 and 5 hours with 5 and 10  g/h concentrations and packed. Ozonized samples were divided into two groups and kept in an incubator which was maintained at 25 °C and 40 °C for 9 months. During this period, every 3  month, microbial load (bacteria, mold, and yeast) were examined <b>in</b> <b>ozonized</b> and non‑ozonized samples. Results: This study showed that ozonization with 5  g/h for 3 hours, 5  g/h for 5 hours, 10  g/h for 3 hours, and 10  g/h for 5 hours leads to about 25 %, 25 %, 53 %, and 46 % reduction in date mold and yeast load and about 6 %, 9 %, 76 %, and 74. 7 % reduction in date bacterial load at baseline phase, respectively.

40|$|Ozone (O 3) -induced {{cell death}} in two suspension-cultured cell lines of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) derived from Bel-W 3 (hyper-sensitive to O 3) and Bel-B (highly {{tolerant}} to O 3) varieties were studied. By exposing the newly prepared cell {{lines to the}} pulse of <b>ozonized</b> <b>air,</b> we could reproduce the conditions demonstrating the difference in O 3 sensitivity as observed in their original plants, depending on the exposure time. Since O 3 -induced acute cell death was observed in the dark, the requirement for photochemical reactions could be eliminated. Addition of several ROS scavengers and chelators inhibited the cell death induced by O 3, indicating that singlet oxygen (1 O 2), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), hydroxyl radical and redox-active metals such as Fe 2 + play central roles in O 3 -induced acute damages to the cells. As expected, we observed the generation of 1 O 2 and H 2 O 2 in the O 3 -treated cells using chemiluminescent probes. On the other hand, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and some SOD mimics showed no inhibitory effect. Thiols added as antioxidants unexpectedly behaved as prooxidants drastically enhancing the O 3 -induced cell death. It is noteworthy that some ROS scavengers effectively rescued the cells from dying even treated after the pulse of O 3 exposure, confirming the post-ozone progress of ROS-dependent cell death mechanism. Since {{one of the key}} differences between Bel-B and Bel-W 3 was suggested to be the capacity for ROS detoxification by catalase, the endogenous catalase activities were compared in vivo in two cell lines. As expected, catalase activity in Bel-B cells was ca. 7 -fold greater than that in Bel-W 3 cells. Interestingly, Ca 2 + chelators added prior to (not after) the pulse of O 3 effectively inhibited the induction of cell death. In addition, increases in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration sensitive to Ca 2 + chelators, ion channel blockers, and ROS scavengers were observed in the transgenic Bel-W 3 cells expressing aequorin, suggesting the action of Ca 2 + as a secondary messenger initiating the oxidative cell death. The O 3 -induced calcium response in Bel-W 3 cells was much greater than Bel-B cells. Based on the results, possible pathways for O 3 -dependent generation of the lethal level of ROS and corresponding signaling mechanism for induction of cell death were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Carrier-selective {{contacts}} {{are one of}} the key {{enabling technologies}} to approach very high conversion efficiencies close to the theoretical limit of silicon solar cells. The tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) approach is an alternative to classical heterojunction solar cells enabling efficiencies up to 24. 4 %. The tunnel oxide is a core element of this contact as it has to reduce the minority carrier recombination but simultaneously must not hamper the majority carrier flow. This paper focuses on ozone-based oxidation techniques, which can potentially be cost effective and industrially feasible methods for the realization of ultra-thin tunnel oxide layers {{as an alternative to the}} oxidation in nitric acid (HNO 3) reference process. All investigated oxides were applied to the electron-selective contact (n-TOPCon) on planar and textured surfaces. It will be shown that both ozone based oxidation techniques (UV/O 3 photo-oxidation and wet-chemical oxidation <b>in</b> <b>ozonized</b> DI-H 2 O) enable high implied open circuit voltage (iVOC) values exceeding 720 mV on planar and 710 mV on textured surfaces, respectively. Further oxide properties as stoichiometry and layer thickness were analyzed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), spectral ellipsometry (SE) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In compliance with earlier results it was found that a minimum oxide layer thickness (approximately 1. 3 nm) and a high amount of oxygen-rich sub oxide species are required to obtain a good surface passivation. Using such oxides, a wider range of temperatures can be used during the TOPCon annealing. Applying the ozone-based oxide layers to n-TOPCon solar cells resulted in a high VOC of up to 719 mV and a peak efficiency of 24. 9 %.

40|$|<b>Ageing</b> <b>in</b> place" {{has gained}} {{dominance}} in policy worldwide {{for more than}} one and a half decades. This paper explores the significance of place <b>in</b> <b>ageing,</b> <b>in</b> particular within the context of globalisation and immigration. In order to promote the value and participation of older ethnic people in communities, the New Zealand Government has acknowledged cultural diversity <b>in</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place policies. However, the concept of <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place is based predominantly on middle-class and Euro-centric values. The policies based on such understandings may not be as applicable to the ethnic Chinese. Moreover, <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place policies sometimes simply appear to ignore the fact that cultural norms (such as parent-child co-residence in the filial piety practice) may have changed when the migrant is affected by acculturation processes in a Western cultural context. These issues indicate that more culturally attuned research is needed about <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place among older Chinese immigrants. Using a Chinese case study conducted in New Zealand, the present research is designed to explore older Chinese migrants’ experiences of <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place. This paper answers the following research questions: 1) why did the participants immigrate to New Zealand; 2) were they relatively permanently settled; 3) why they moved; and 4) what are their current living arrangements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFracture surface {{characteristics}} of Te 2 As 3 Se 5 (TAS) glass fibers <b>aged</b> <b>in</b> light and in dark {{have been investigated}} respectively for understanding physical aging effect on their fracture behavior. The properties including tensile strength (ı), surface flaw depth (Į), and mirror radii (r m) were measured by DY 30 Adamel Lomarghy and SEM respectively. Shape factor extracted by fitting of ı vs Į confirms that fractures of fibers <b>aged</b> <b>in</b> dark for 4 months originate from their surface flaw, {{but it does not}} work for fibers <b>aged</b> <b>in</b> light for 4 months. However, mirror constants (=ır m 1 / 2) of fracture surface for the TAS glass fibers <b>aged</b> <b>in</b> dark are in a good agreement with those <b>aged</b> <b>in</b> light. One possible reason is that the photoinduced effect changes the structure of glass surface during the physical aging...|$|R
