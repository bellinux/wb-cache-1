40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} {{identify}} risk factors associated with crashes is critical to determine appropriate countermeasures for improving roadway safety. Many studies have identified risk factors for urban systems and intersections, but few have addressed crashes on rural roadways, and none have analyzed crashes on Indian Reservations. This study analyzes crash severity for rural highway systems in Wyoming. These rural systems include interstates, state highways, rural county local roads, and the roadway system on the Wind River Indian Reservation (WRIR). In alignment with the Wyoming strategic highway safety goal of reducing critical crashes (fatal and serious injury), crash severity {{was treated as a}} binary response in which crashes were classified as severe or not severe. Multiple logistic regression models were developed for each of the highway systems. Five effects were prevalent on all systems including <b>animals,</b> <b>driver</b> impairment, motorcycles, mean speed, and safety equipment use. With the exception of animal crashes, all of these effects increased the probability that a crash would be severe. Based upon these results, DOTs can pursue effective policies and targeted design decisions to reduce the severity of crashes on rural highways...|$|R

2500|$|The most {{important}} design criterion for these curves is stopping sight distance. This is the distance a driver can {{see over the}} crest of the curve.

The desired stopping sight distance (S) is determined by the speed of traffic on a road. [...] By first finding the stopping sight distance (S) and then solving for the curve length (L) in each of the equations below, the correct curve length can be determined. [...] The proper equation depends on whether the vertical curve is shorter or longer than the available sight distance. Normally, both equations are solved, then the results are compared to the curve length.|$|R

The Utica Zoo features a variety of animals on forty acres of land. They have over 200 <b>animals.</b> <b>Drivers</b> will very often see deer on the Memorial Parkway. Throughout the year they host many social events and fundraisers: Eggstravaganza, Wine in the Wilderness, Brewfest, and Spooktacular. Valley View Golf Course was designed by Robert Trent Jones and is used by golfers of all skill levels with three fields: white field having 6409 yards, blue field having 6786 yards, and red field with 5916 yards. Val Bialas Ski and Sled Chalet was named after the third time local Olympian ice skater Valentine Bialas. It offers a rope tow, chair lift, night skiing, ice rink, and chalet with a snack bar. There are five trials each at a different difficulty level and a separate sliding hill. The Parkway Recreation Center, also known as the Edward A. Hanna Recreation Center, contains two modified basketball courts, a playground, weight training station, exercise equipment, walking track, tennis courts, computer room, conference area, and a Utica Sport Hall of Fame. This recreation center is also provided for the Utica Boys & Girls Club and the Parkway Senior Center. Basketball tournaments are held here and there called “Hoops & Dreams,” which is founded and directed by Patrick Johnson. John Mott Tennis Courts are also a part of the recreation center. The South Woods Switchback Trails are groomed in the winter for cross country skiing. Roscoe Conkling Park also has many memorials and statues, including the Eagle Monument.|$|R

40|$|Background: Brucellosis is an {{occupational}} hazard with those particularly at risk either living {{in close proximity}} with animals or handling them. It is a public health problem in developing countries with adverse health implications both for animals and human beings {{as well as economic}} implications for individuals and communities. The Objectives were to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis among abattoir workers of Lahore District and to determine the association of brucellosis with nature of job of the workers. Methods: Data was collected in April 2008. It was a cross-sectional study in which four main slaughterhouses in Lahore were included. The slaughterhouse workers were divided into seven strata based on their nature of job: meat sellers, slaughterers, <b>animal</b> keepers, <b>drivers,</b> cleaners, loaders and vets/paravets. A total of 360 such workers were selected using stratified random sampling technique. Sampling frames for different strata were prepared and from each frame, proportionate numbers, were selected through simple random method using random number tables. Data was obtained using a questionnaire. Additionally blood samples were collected and analyzed for anti-Brucella Immunoglobulin G (IgG) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Results: The seroprevalence of anti-Brucella IgG was found to be 21. 7 %. A statistically significant difference was observed between the immune status of the respondents and their nature of job (p= 0. 005), age groups (p= 0. 013), and duration of job (p= 0. 003). Conclusion: The disease is an important public health problem in Pakistan. The disease can be prevented in the slaughterhouse workers through the use of personal protective devices.

40|$|Despite the {{critical}} importance of fungi as symbionts with plants, resources for <b>animals,</b> and <b>drivers</b> of ecosystem function, the spatiotemporal distributions of fungi remain poorly understood. The belowground {{life cycle of}} fungi {{makes it difficult to}} assess spatial patterns and dynamic processes even with recent molecular techniques. Here we offer an explicit spatiotemporal Bayesian inference of the drivers behind spatial distributions from investigation of a Swiss inventory of fungal fruit bodies. The unique inventory includes three temperate forest sites in which a total of 73 952 fungal fruit bodies were recorded systematically in a spatially explicit design between 1992 and 2006. Our motivation is to understand how broad-scale climate factors may influence spatiotemporal dynamics of fungal fruiting within forests, and if any such effects vary between two functional groups, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi. For both groups we asked: 1) how consistent are the locations of fruiting patches, the sizes of patches, the quantities of fruit bodies, and of prevalence (occupancy) ? 2) Do the annual spatial characteristics of fungal fruiting change systematically over time? 3) Are spatial characteristics of fungal fruiting driven by climatic variation? We found high inter-annual continuity in fruiting for both functional groups. The saprotrophic species were characterised by small patches with variable fruit body counts. In contrast, ECM species were present in larger, but more distinctly delimited patches. The spatial characteristics of the fungal community were only indirectly influenced by climate. However, climate variability influenced overall yields and prevalence, which again links to spatial structure of fruit bodies. Both yield and prevalence were correlated with the amplitudes of occurrence and of fruit body counts, but only prevalence influenced the spatial range. Summarizing, climatic variability affects forest-stand fungal distributions via its influence on yield (amount) and prevalence (occupancy), whereas fungal life-history strategies dictate fine-scale spatial characteristic...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDisplacement {{characteristics}} in <b>animals</b> are crucial <b>drivers</b> of successful movement decisions in resources acquisition, migration, and dispersal. As landscape structure is modified by human activity, mobility patterns {{are likely to}} evolve in response to habitat fragmentation. In species with complex life cycles that involve obligatory migrations between different habitats, one can predict that movement propensity would be promoted by fragmentation {{as long as it}} allows to reaching a habitat patch. Here, we compare the movement characteristics of naive toadlets sampled in populations distributed over a fragmentation gradient to test the hypothesis of a positive correlation between fragmentation and mobility levels. We studied toadlet movement in experimental arenas providing small patches of suitable conditions. We recorded the use of these patches (patch behavior) or the absence of their use (overtaking behavior). The more fragmented the original landscape, the more prone the toadlets were to combine these two behaviors, thus showing a higher motivation to explore. Moreover, the more fragmented the original landscape, the less the toadlets exhibited patch behavior. As the toadlets were reared in a common environment, the behavioral differences detected, relating to the level of fragmentation, resulted from inheritance. Our results thus illustrate that fragmentation is likely to create cross-generational transmittable variations in movement characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Aven is a {{regulator}} of the DNA damage {{response and}} G 2 /M cell cycle progression. Overexpression of Aven {{is associated with}} poor prognosis in patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, and altered intracellular Aven distribution is associated with infiltrating ductal carcinoma and papillary carcinoma breast cancer subtypes. Although Aven orthologs {{have been identified in}} most vertebrate species, no Aven gene has been reported in invertebrates. Here, we describe a Drosophila melanogaster open reading frame (ORF) that shares sequence and functional similarities with vertebrate Aven genes. The protein encoded by this ORF, which we named dAven, contains several domains that are highly conserved among Aven proteins of fish, amphibian, bird and mammalian origins. In flies, knockdown of dAven by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in lethality when its expression was reduced either ubiquitously or in fat cells using Gal 4 <b>drivers.</b> <b>Animals</b> undergoing moderate dAven knockdown in the fat body had smaller fat cells displaying condensed chromosomes and increased levels of the mitotic marker phosphorylated histone H 3 (PHH 3), suggesting that dAven was required for normal cell cycle progression in this tissue. Remarkably, expression of dAven in Xenopus egg extracts resulted in G 2 /M arrest that was comparable to that caused by human Aven. Taken together, these results suggest that, like its vertebrate counterparts, dAven plays a role in cell cycle regulation. Drosophila could be an excellent model for studying the function of Aven and identifying cellular factors that influence its activity, revealing information that may be relevant to human disease...|$|R
40|$|Animal-vehicle {{collisions}} are {{a common}} phenomenon worldwide, causing injury or death to millions of animals and hundreds of human passengers each year. Collision numbers can be significant to species conservation, wildlife management, traffic safety, {{as well as from}} an economic and political point of view, and should thus be evaluated from these different perspectives. In this thesis, I assess, evaluate, analyse and predict animal-vehicle collisions with respect to their extent, their effect on populations, and their broad and fine scale distribution. A questionnaire with Swedish drivers indicated that nationwide road traffic in 1992 may caused an annual loss in harvest of common game species of 7 % to 97 % and of 1 % to 12 % of estimated populations. Road mortality did not appear as an existential threat to most species, although in badgers (Meles meles), traffic probably is the largest single cause of death. A slow population growth rate coupled with a high proportion of adult badger road-kills is responsible for their sensitivity to road mortality. Provided that road mortality is additive, we predicted that losses due to nationwide traffic might already exceed birth rates and limit badger population growth. In roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces alces), road mortality is of minor importance to the population. Broad-scale trends and patterns in collision numbers correlate with harvest and traffic volumes, thus providing a simple means to monitor the toll of road traffic. To predict local collision risks with these species, information on animal abundance and landscape composition, on road traffic parameters, and on the spatial coincidence of roads and landscape elements is needed. However, vehicle speed appeared {{as one of the most}} important factors determining collision risks with moose, underlining the influence of human factors on collision risks. Successful counteraction therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach that addresses both the <b>animal</b> and the <b>driver</b> in their shared environment...|$|R
40|$|The rumen {{microbiome}} {{is integral}} to efficient production in cattle and shows strong host specificity, yet {{little is known about}} what host factors shape rumen microbial composition. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is produced in large amounts in the saliva, can coat both commensal and pathogenic microbes within the gut, and presents a plausible mechanism of host specificity. However, the role salivary SIgA plays in commensal bacteria selection in ruminants remains elusive. The main objectives of this study were to develop an immuno-affinity benchtop method to isolate SIgA-tagged microbiota and to determine if salivary SIgA preferentially binds selected bacteria. We hypothesized that SIgA-tagged bacteria would differ from total bacteria, thus supporting a potential host-derived mechanism in commensal bacterial selection. Whole rumen (n = 9) and oral secretion samples (n = 10) were incubated with magnetic beads conjugated with anti-secretory IgA antibodies to enrich SIgA-tagged microbiota. Microbial DNA from the oral secretion, whole rumen, SIgA-tagged oral secretion, and SIgA-tagged rumen was isolated for amplicon sequencing of V 1 –V 3 region of 16 S rDNA genes. Whole rumen and oral secretion had distinctive (P < 0. 05) bacterial compositions indicated by the non-parametric multidimensional scaling plot using Euclidean distance metrics. The SIgA-tagged microbiota from rumen and oral secretion had similar abundance of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fibrobacter, candidate phyla TM 7, and Tenericutes and are clustered tightly. Composition of SIgA-tagged oral secretion microbiota was more similar to whole rumen microbiota than whole oral secretion due to enrichment of rumen bacteria (Lachnospiraceae) and depletion of oral taxa (Streptococcus, Rothia, Neisseriaceae, and Lactobacillales). In conclusion, SIgA-tagged oral secretion microbiota had an increased resemblance to whole rumen microbiota, suggesting salivary SIgA-coating may be one host-derived mechanism impacting commensal colonization. Further studies, to explore the variations in antibody affinity between different <b>animals</b> as a <b>driver</b> of microbial composition are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Traffic {{collisions}} are {{a worldwide}} issue {{that can cause}} injury and death, which leads to {{billions of dollars in}} damages every year. Significant research efforts have been undertaken to develop and utilize statistical modeling techniques for analyzing the characteristics of crash count data. While these modeling techniques have been providing meaningful outputs, improvements on these modeling methods still need to better understand the crash risk and the contributing factors. Five important issues in crash data modeling are identified in this research. The first two issues are over or under dispersion with crash data and excess zeros within crash records. Considering that they have been well studied in the previous research, this study focuses on the remaining three major issues. The first one is relevant to the partial observations of multiple processes, i. e. crash data may be collected by different agencies that create multiple data sources and may be inconsistent. A modeling mechanism that takes advantage of all datasets for better estimation results is highly desirable. The second one is an interaction issue. Some collisions are single vehicle crashes, such as off-road crashes and rollover incidents, and some collisions involve interaction behavior, such as the Animal-Vehicle Collision (AVC) and the Vehicle-Vehicle Collision. The characteristics of crashes with interaction behavior are different from those with only one vehicle involved. It is challenging to develop a crash modeling scheme that can capture the interaction behavior. The last one is the nonlinear relationship issue. Most previous collision models are Generalized Linear Model-based (GLM-based) approaches. Such GLM-based approaches are constrained by their linear model specifications because, in most situations, the relationship between the crash rate and its contributing factors are not linear or may not even be monotonic. Thus, finding a way to model the collision data with nonlinear and non-monotonic relationships is of utmost importance. To address the issues of inconsistent observations, two techniques are developed. A fuzzy logic-based data mapping algorithm is proposed as the first technique to match data from two datasets so that duplicate crash records can be removed when combining these datasets. The membership functions of the fuzzy logic algorithm are established based on survey inputs collected from experts of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). As verified by expert judgment collected through another survey, the accuracy of this algorithm was approximately 90 %. Applying this algorithm to the two WSDOT datasets relevant to AVC, reported AVC data and the Carcass Removal (CR) data, the combined dataset has 15 % - 22 % more records compared to the original CR dataset. The proposed algorithm is proven effective for merging the Reported AVC data and the CR data, with a combined dataset being more complete for wildlife safety studies and countermeasure evaluations. The second technique is a diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson regression (DIBP) method. It is an inflated version of bivariate Poisson regression model adopted to directly fit two datasets together. The proposed model technique was also applied to the reported AVC and CR data sets collected in Washington State between 2002 and 2006. The diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson model not only can model paired data with correlation, but also handle under- or over- dispersed data sets. Compared with three other types of models; double Poisson, bivariate Poisson, and zero-inflated double Poisson; the diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson model demonstrates its capability of fitting two datasets with remarkable overlapping portions resulting from the same stochastic process. Therefore, the diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson model provides researchers another new approach to investigating paired data sources from a different perspective. To address the issues with the interaction issue, a new occurrence mechanism-based probability model, an interaction-based model, which explicitly formulates the interactions between the objects, is introduced. The proposed method was applied to the AVC data and this method can explicitly formulate the interactions between <b>animals</b> and <b>drivers</b> to better capture the relationships among drivers' and animals' attributes, roadway and environmental factors, and AVCs. Findings of this study show that the proposed occurrence mechanism-based probability model better capture the impact of drivers' and animals' attributes on the AVC. This method can be further developed to model other types of collisions with interaction behavior. To address the nonlinear relationship issue, a Generalized Nonlinear Model (GNM) -based approach is put forward. The GNM-based approach is developed to utilize a nonlinear regression function to better elaborate non-monotonic relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Previous studies focused mainly on causal factor identification and crash risk modeling using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), such as Poisson regression, and logistic regression among others. However, their basic assumption of a generalized linear relationship between the dependent variable (for example, crash rate) and independent variables (for example, contributing factors to crashes) established via a link function can often be violated in reality. Consequently, the GLM-based modeling results could provide biased findings and conclusions when the contributing factors have parabolic impact on the crashes. In this research, a GNM-based approach is applied with the rear end accident data and the AVC data collected from ten highway routes starting in 2002 and ending in 2006. For the rear-end collision application, the results show that truck percentage and grade have a parabolic impact: both items increase crash risks initially, but decrease risks after certain thresholds. Similarly, Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and grade also have a parabolic impact on the AVC rate. Such non-monotonic relationships cannot be captured by regular GLM's, which further demonstrates the flexibility of GNM-based approaches in modeling the nonlinear relationship among data and providing more reasonable explanations. The superior GNM-based model interpretations better explain the parabolic impacts of some specific contributing factors and help in selecting and evaluating rear-end crash safety improvement plans. In Summary, these solutions proposed to address the three major issues in crash modeling are important for crash studies. The fuzzy-logic based data mapping algorithm can combine partial observations from different processes to form up a more complete dataset for a thorough analysis. The diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson models can directly take two data observation processes into account. The occurrence mechanism based probability models and GNM based models are effective methods for handling the interaction issue and non-linear relationships between dependent and independent variables...|$|R
60|$|More miserable {{still was}} the {{appearance}} of the camels. Several native boats were unloading them at a distance of two or three hundred yards from shore. The water was not more than three or four feet deep; but when the poor beasts were turned into it most of them lay down, with only their heads above water, and positively refused to make an effort to walk to land. Some never were able to make the effort, and their bodies drifted here and there in the smooth water. Some of the camels had got within fifty yards of shore, and then had lain down, looking, with their short bodies and long necks, like gigantic water-fowl. Those who had been driven ashore were in little better plight. Their bones seemed on the very point of starting through their skin, and they lay as if dead upon the sand, uttering feebly the almost human moaning and complainings peculiar to the camel. Others had recovered a little. These were endeavouring to browse the scanty leaves on the bushes around. Some of these camels have been twenty days on the voyage, and during this time have been crowded together like sheep in a pen, with next to nothing either to eat or drink during the whole time. The wonder is that any of them survived it. Government suffers no loss by the death of these unfortunates, as a contractor agreed to deliver them here in a fair condition, and only those who survive the voyage, and recover something of their former strength, are accepted and paid for. At least, this is one version of the story. The other is, that they are consigned to the Land Transport Corps. That body, however, receive no intimation of their coming, and boatload after boatload of camels arrive, and wander away from the beach to die for want of the water within their reach. At a mile from the landing-place the scene is painful in the extreme. Camels and mules wander about in hundreds without masters, without anything. Here they strive for a few days’ existence by plucking scanty shoots; here they sicken and die. The scenes were frightful everywhere, but were worst of all at the watering-troughs. These were miserably-contrived things. Only ten or a dozen animals could approach at once; they were so unevenly placed, that when one end was full to overflowing there was not an inch of water at the other; and beside this, at a time when water was worth its weight in gold, they leaked badly. They were only supplied with water {{for an hour or so}} in the morning, and for a similar time in the evening; and in consequence the scene was painful in the extreme. There was a guard to preserve order, but order could not have been kept by ten times as many men. There were hundreds of transport <b>animals,</b> with one <b>driver</b> to each five or six of them. What could one driver do with six half-mad animals? They struggled, they bit, they kicked, they fought like wild-beasts for a drink of the precious water for which they were dying. Besides these led animals were numerous stragglers, which, having broken their head-ropes, had gone out into the plain to seek a living on their own account. For these there was no water; they had no requisition pinned to their ears, and as they failed thus scandalously to comply with the regulations laid down by the authorities, the authorities determined that they should have no water. They were beaten off. Most of them, after a repulse or two, went away with drooping heads to die; but some fought for their dear lives, cleared a way to the trough with heels and teeth, and drank despite the blows which were showered upon them. I inquired of the Land Transport Corps why these scattered mules are not collected and fed. I am told that nearly the whole of these mule- and camel-drivers have deserted and gone to Massowah. And so it is. The mules and camels are dying of thirst and neglect; the advanced brigade cannot be supplied with food; the harbour is becoming full of transports, because there are no means of taking the men inland, although there are plenty of animals; and all this because the land transport men desert. The officers of that corps work like slaves; they are up early and late, they saddle mules with their own hands, and yet everything goes wrong. Why is all this? One reason undoubtedly is, that the animals have been sent on before the men. A few officers and a comparatively small body of native followers are sent out, and to them arrive thousands of bullocks, thousands of mules, thousands of camels. The Arab followers, appalled by the amount of work accumulating upon them, desert to a man, the officers are left helpless. Had a fair number of officers and followers been sent on to receive the animals as they came, all might have gone well. It was simply a miscalculation. And so it is, I regret to say, in some other departments. You apply for a tent, and are told there are no bell-tents whatever arrived. You ask for a pack-saddle, and are told by the quartermaster-general that there is not a single pack-saddle in hand, and that hundreds of mules are standing idle for want of them. You ask for rations, and are informed that only native rations have yet arrived, and that no rations for Europeans have been sent, with the exception of the sixty days’ provisions the 33d regiment have brought with them. Why is this? There are scores of transports lying in Bombay harbour doing nothing. Why, in the name of common sense, are they not sent on? The nation is paying a very fair sum for them, and there they lie, while the departments are pottering with their petty jealousies and their petty squabbles.|$|R
40|$|Wildlife-vehicle {{accidents}} {{result in}} substantial personal, {{environmental and economic}} losses, including human injuries, fatalities, loss of wildlife, and vehicle damage. In British Columbia, about 16, 000 such collisions occur annually, including unreported cases. This typically results {{in two to three}} human deaths (Sielecki 2001) and claims to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) of over CDN$ 25 million, excluding “swerved-tomiss” accidents. As Farrell (2002) notes, the problems associated with wildlife-vehicle collisions are global, pervasive and increasing, yet most of the literature suggests that many mitigation techniques have limited utility because they are ineffective at reducing collisions or have large impacts on natural wildlife movements. Project Objectives The Wildlife Protection System (WPS) is designed to use infrared cameras to detect wildlife on or near highways. When wildlife is detected, fl ashing lights are triggered, warning drivers to reduce speed and anticipate wildlife on the roadway. The objectives of this project are to: 1. Determine the ability of the WPS to detect wildlife and warn motorists. 2. Determine the speed response of drivers to wildlife-activated warning lights. 3. Document wildlife behavior near highways using 24 -hour infrared video footage in order to develop more effective wildlife collision mitigation strategies. Funding Source and Total Budget Funding for this project was provided by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, Intrans Tech (part of the Rainbow Group of Companies), Parks Canada, the BC Conservation Foundation, the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program, FLIR Systems, Inc., OCTEC Ltd., and QWIP Technologies. In 2002, over CDN$ 600, 000 was spent on development and preliminary testing of the system. Methodology The fi rst trial was initiated in the summer of 2002 in Kootenay National Park, British Columbia, Canada. In the trial, a camera was mounted on a 6 -m pole at each end of a 2 -km stretch of highway. Adjacent to each pole was a trailer containing a computer (with tracking software), two radar guns, and a conventional digital video camera. Continuous (24 -hour) infrared and conventional video footage was recorded. In addition, an “event log” was generated in an Excel spreadsheet that recorded traffi c speeds before and within the test zone, and animal detections within the zone. A number of technical diffi culties prevented the system from becoming fully operational in 2002. However, we were able to view 24 -hour infrared video footage of deer behavior in the highway right-of-way (ROW) over 16 days from 29 August to 7 October 2002. We recorded the number of deer present on the ROW during fi ve-minute samples at the beginning of every half-hour, along with their location and some behaviors (in ditch, on roadside approaching highway, on roadside retreating from highway, standing on road, crossing road), whether they were running, whether a car was present, and if crossing, whether the attempt was successful and whether there was a near-miss with a vehicle. Summary of Findings and Their Applications Successes from this preliminary trial include confi rmation of the camera’s ability to track wildlife within a 1 -km range, and collection of infrared video data, providing a unique opportunity to study wildlife behavior on and near road systems. We recorded 1131 deer-minutes of behavior (number of deer events multiplied {{by the time they were}} present in the sampling period). Based on hourly totals of deer-minutes, we stratifi ed the 24 -hour period into night (midnight to 7 AM), midday (7 AM to 7 PM) and evening (7 PM to midnight). Both the number of deer and the duration of their stay in the ROW were greatest during the night, intermediate during the evening, and lowest during midday, so the number of deer-minutes per hour was over 2 x higher at night than evening, and over 15 x higher at night than midday. However, deer were more likely to exhibit behaviors of concern to motorists during midday. For example, within sample periods, the following measures were higher per deer during midday than evening or night, respectively: approaches to highway (0. 70, 0. 60, 0. 43), running approaches to highway (0. 42, 0. 09, 0. 03), stepping onto the highway surface (0. 14, 0. 10, 0. 10), attempted or successful highway crossings (0. 12. 0. 08, 0. 08), and crossing in front of oncoming cars (0. 05, 0. 00, 0. 02). The relatively higher rate of high-risk behaviors during midday is compounded by the fact that vehicle numbers were much higher during ICOET 2003 Proceedings 391 Making Connections midday (263 /hr) than evening (182 /hr) or night (70 /hr). Driving in daylight probably increases deer visibility dramatically, but being within the line-ups of cars more typical of midday presumably decreases the driver’s fi eld of view and may increase the collision hazard and severity associated with a driver swerving or making a sudden stop. Implications for Future Research/Policy If further test trials are successful, this new technology should be used to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions. The WPS offers several advantages over conventional mitigation strategies including: • Wildlife cannot become habituated as they might to scents, refl ectors, and other deterrents because the system focuses on the actions of motorists, rather than <b>animal</b> behavior. • <b>Drivers</b> are less likely to become complacent to the warning system because it is only triggered temporarily when wildlife is present. • This system does not interfere with the natural movement of wildlife, nor require the construction of overpasses or underpasses to allow for highway crossings. • In contrast to permanent structures, such as overpasses and underpasses, this system is highly portable and can be moved seasonally to high risk areas, or relocated in response to changing wildlife populations and movements, adjacent land-use and traffi c patterns. • This system can operate 24 -hours/day, in contrast to some mitigation tools that operate only at night. Wildlife behavior data collected from this trial in August to October, 2002 suggests that despite the number and duration of deer events in the ROW being higher at night or evening than midday, deer exhibit behaviors more likely to result in accidents during midday. High midday traffi c volumes may partly negate the visibility benefi ts that would otherwise exist from driving in daylight. The portable infrared video recording system could also be used as a research tool for wildlife accident mitigation such as documenting wildlife crossing rates prior to construction of new highways to determine best locations for overpasses and tunnels (if they are deemed necessary) and assessing the effectiveness of other existing mitigation tools, such as refl ectors, repellents, and whistles by documenting wildlife behavioral response. The system could be employed in a broad range of other off-highway wildlife behavior research as the trailers are fully portable, unobtrusive, and provide 24 -hour/day recordings. The 2003 tests will focus on continued assessment and refi nement of the technical aspects of the WPS, evaluating the effectiveness of the warning lights in altering driver speed, and documentation of wildlife behavior in the test zone...|$|R
