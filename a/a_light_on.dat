5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> its crystals.|$|E

Bowen then installed a camera assembly on the Dextre robot and removed insulation from Dextre's electronics platform. Drew installed <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> a cargo cart and repaired some dislodged thermal insulation from a valve on the truss. Meanwhile, the ISS and shuttle crew entered the Leonardo PMM to commence the internal outfitting of the module.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{human factors}} and user {{interface}} engineering problems were {{revealed in the}} investigation of the reactor control system's user interface. Despite the valve being stuck open, <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the control panel ostensibly indicated that the valve was closed. In fact the light did not indicate the position of the valve, only the status of the solenoid being powered or not, thus giving false evidence of a closed valve. As a result, the operators did not correctly diagnose the problem for several hours.|$|E
25|$|From 1 March 1864 until 31 August 1865, Captain Thomas {{measured}} sea temperatures {{from the}} Chain Pier. The data supported {{the acceptance of}} the Gulf Stream as a mechanism to explain the warmer seas around Scotland, especially in the west. In 1869, as an experiment into using electric light for lighthouses, Thomas Stevenson had an underwater cable installed from the eastern breakwater of Granton harbour. An operator on the harbour wall, with a switch and a Bunsen cell (an early form of battery), controlled <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the end of the Chain Pier from half a mile (800 m) away.|$|E
25|$|In the {{photoelectric}} effect, it {{was observed}} that shining <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> certain metals would lead to an electric current in a circuit. Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However, using the case of potassium as an example, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light available with the technology of the time caused no current at all. According to the classical theory of light and matter, the strength or amplitude of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.|$|E

25|$|On 20 October 1978, Cuyahoga was {{the oldest}} {{commissioned}} vessel in Coast Guard service and was conducting a night-time training cruise during clear weather. She was heading north at 12knots in the Chesapeake Bay off Smith Point Light {{near the mouth of}} the Potomac River. At 8:45pm, Officer Candidate Officer of the Deck Earl Fairchild reported sighting <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the northern horizon. The Commanding Officer, Chief Warrant Officer Donald K. Robinson confirmed this observation and after evaluating the radar contact misidentified the contact as a similarly northbound small vessel, likely a fishing boat turning into the Potomac River at 15,700yards. In fact, it was the 521foot Argentinian bulk freighter, M/V Santa Cruz II, loaded with 19,000tons of coal, bound for San Nicolás de los Arroyos, Argentina traveling south at over 14knots.|$|E
25|$|The {{project has}} used crowd-sourcing to create maps which show where sexual assault has taken place. In 2012, Women Under Siege {{put out a}} call to people from Syria and those working with Syrian {{refugees}} {{to provide information about}} rape and sexual assault. The entries were created by collecting information from journalists, human rights activists and individual citizens. Some the reports came via email or by Twitter with the hashtag #RapeinSyria. Women Under Siege mapped these incidents, providing over 117 pieces of data for each entry. The data was documented in real time, using a software developed by Ushahidi. The data was analyzed and put together in a comprehensive report that details a huge amount of human suffering. Not only did the information shine <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the problem, it also uncovered unexpected findings. For example, the data revealed that Syrian government forces were also largely responsible for much of the sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the Cape route, caravel ships of Portuguese Franciscans and Dominicans set out to evangelize the no longer sealed lands of the East, and traversed the coasts in search of suitable centres for their operations. A legend tells how, when a caravel with some Franciscan missionaries was cruising up the Coromandel Coast, towards nightfall their attention was attracted by <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> shore and they decided to land there. They did, without knowing for some time that they had landed at the ruins of Betumah. But when they attempted to approach the light, it preceded them inland, across the ruins of the Nestorian town, over an empty stretch of ground, past (new) Mylapur and into a forest, where the light vanished. Here the Franciscans established a mission and built a church (still extant) in honour of Our Lady of Light in 1516, whence the locality, no longer a forest, but a wealthy residential quarter, is still known as The Luz—after Nossa Senhora da Luz (Portuguese for Our Lady of Light). The Dominicans followed in their wake, and in 1520 Fre. Ambrosio, O.P., was consecrated bishop for the Dominican missions at Cranganore and Mylapur.|$|E
