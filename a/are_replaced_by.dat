5|$|For the 1733 version, Bach used a {{somewhat}} more extended orchestra: the recorders <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> traversos (Fl) and they get separate parts in all four choral movements. In movements three and four the oboes <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> oboes d'amore (Oa). In the 10th movement (Suscepit Israel) the oboes replace the trumpet for the obbligato instrumental part.|$|E
5|$|There are 5 premaxillary {{teeth in}} both species, {{the fourth of}} {{which is about a}} third larger {{relative}} to the others. The maxilla has 12 distinct sockets in K. langenbergensis. Excluding the pseudocaniniforms, the maxillary tooth size remains roughly constant but gradually decreases after the pseudocaniniforms in both species; all tooth sockets after the twelfth <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a continuous trough. In total, K. guimarotae had at least 15 maxillary teeth, and K. langenbergensis 17 or 18. Meanwhile, the dentary exhibits 21 teeth in K. langenbergensis and at least 20 in K. guimarotae. Like the maxilla, distinct sockets for dentary teeth <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a groove from the eleventh tooth backwards in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is {{almost exactly the same}} as the original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances in front of the multicolored background <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E

5|$|Aston Martin Racing {{adapted the}} DB9 for sports car racing, {{producing}} the DBR9 for FIA GT1 and the DBRS9 for FIA GT3. These two cars are lightened DB9s; the interior features are removed and the aluminium body panels <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> carbon fibre panels. Additionally, the engine has been tweaked {{in both the}} cars to produce more horsepower.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Wright's 2006 Macbeth {{takes place}} {{in the midst of a}} modern Australian gang and drug culture.

They whisper their prophecies in Macbeth's ear as they dance in a deserted nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 {{is heated}} in air, it becomes Pb12O19 at 293°C, Pb12O17 at 351°C, Pb3O4 at 374°C, and finally PbO at 605°C. A further {{sesquioxide}} Pb2O3 {{can be obtained}} at high pressure, along with several non-stoichiometric phases. Many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> vacancies: PbO {{can be considered as}} having such a structure, with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent.|$|E
50|$|The band also later saw {{the exit}} of guitarists Soorya and James, who <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Malinda Senanayake and Arjun Dhas. Malinda later left {{the band and}} <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Thishan Wijesinghe, while Arjun <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Akila Peiris. Drummer Heshan Jayawardena left the band in 2006, and <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Oshada Wijemanne who played with the band until 2008, {{when he left the}} country and <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Tharaka Seneviratne, {{formerly}} of Whirlwind and Stigmata.|$|R

5|$|Only the aye-aye, the extinct giant aye-aye, and {{the largest}} of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a {{functional}} strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the aye-aye, the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.|$|E
5|$|String theory extends {{ordinary}} {{particle physics}} by replacing zero-dimensional point particles by one-dimensional objects called strings. In the late 1980s, {{it was natural}} for theorists to attempt to formulate other extensions in which particles <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> two-dimensional supermembranes or by higher-dimensional objects called branes. Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by Paul Dirac, and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} the Lorentz group on the space of field {{configurations}} (a field configuration is the spacetime history of a particular solution, e.g. the electromagnetic field in all of space over all time is one field configuration) resembles the action on the Hilbert spaces of quantum mechanics, except that the commutator brackets <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> field theoretical Poisson brackets.|$|E
50|$|Lifestyle <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> VOX in January 1993. Soon thereafter, Screensport {{merged with}} Eurosport and its {{transponder}} <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> RTL2. RTL 4 moved to Astra 1D in 1995 and <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Super RTL. Teleclub <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Kabel 1 {{during the same}} year. TV3 and TV1000 left Astra in 1996 and their transponders were taken over by BSkyB who used them for Fox Kids/Sky Two and Granada Plus/Granada Men & Motors. Filmnet also left in 1996, to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Bloomberg Germany in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} bassist Paul Bugden left {{in early}} 2007, and <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Samuel Wilson. The original drummer, Elliot Vaughan had a falling {{out with the}} band and left in 2007. Shortly after, he <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Laurent [...] "Lozz" [...] Gillgrass, who left the band in early 2008, and <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Mark Rabone. In 2009, Bassist and backing vocalist Samuel Wilson left the band to attend college, and <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Zach Phelps.

5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> two controllable support units.|$|E
5|$|Gluck made {{a number}} of changes to the {{orchestration}} of Orfeo when adapting it from the original Italian version to the French version of 1774. Cornetts and chalumeaux <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> more common and modern oboes and clarinets, while the part played by trombones considerably decreases, possibly {{due to a lack of}} technical ability on the part of the French trombonists. Cornetts were instruments that were typically used for church music, and chalumeaux were predominant only in chamber music: both cornetts and chalumeaux were unpopular in France in 1774. In many ways the change from chalumeau to oboe corresponds to that from castrato to high tenor. Neither castrato nor chalumeau were to survive.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the main game, four self-contained stories were released as downloadable content (DLC) under the title , featuring new characters within the Muramasa universe. For the new characters, swords <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> other weapons such as clubs and shurikens, but they otherwise play {{in the same way}} as Momohime and Kisuke. New music was created for the title under Sakimoto's supervision: the four episodes were scored by Kudo, Chiba, Kaneda and Iwata respectively. The Vanillaware-developed DLC launched in both Japan and the West between November 2013 and November 2014: the final DLC's Japanese release was delayed by over two months behind the Western release. A special edition of Muramasa Rebirth exclusive to Japan contained all four DLC episodes alongside the original content.|$|E
5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Charles Darwin {{formulated}} the scientific {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed {{from generation to generation}} (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.|$|E

5|$|NY309 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY29A in downtown Gloversville. The route heads northward as Bleecker Street, passing large commercial buildings as it heads north through the city. At Spring Street—two blocks north of NY29A—the surroundings become more residential as the commercial structures <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> homes. The route continues on, crossing Cayadutta Creek between 8th Avenue and McLaren Street before leaving Bleecker Street at 11th Avenue to follow an unnamed western extension of 11th Avenue. At this point, {{the amount of}} development along NY309 drops substantially as it parallels Cayadutta Creek and heads northwestward {{out of the city}} limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the city of Gloversville to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E
5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over another set of railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward {{from this point on}} NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the spring}} molt is complete, {{the body of}} the male is a {{brilliant}} lemon yellow, a color produced by carotenoid pigments from plant materials in its diet, with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight. The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside with a yellow bib. After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> duller plumage, becoming buff below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches. In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.|$|E
