5|$|<b>Anisotropy</b> {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This <b>anisotropy</b> makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This <b>anisotropy</b> is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This <b>anisotropy</b> determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, <b>anisotropy</b> in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
5|$|Directional <b>anisotropy</b> {{refers to}} a {{difference}} in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either <b>anisotropy</b> in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional <b>anisotropy</b> is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E

40|$|The arrival {{directions}} of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are highly isotropic. This is {{expected from the}} presence of turbulent magnetic fields in our Galactic environment that repeatedly scatter charged CRs during propagation. However, various CR observatories have identified weak <b>anisotropies</b> of various angular sizes and with relative intensities of up {{to a level of}} 1 part in 1, 000. Whereas large-scale <b>anisotropies</b> are generally predicted by standard diffusion models, the appearance of small-scale <b>anisotropies</b> down to an angular size of 10 degrees is surprising. In this review, we summarise the current experimental situation for both the large-scale and small-scale <b>anisotropies.</b> We address some of the issues in comparing different experimental results and remaining questions in interpreting the observed large-scale <b>anisotropies.</b> We then review the standard diffusive picture and its difficulty in producing the small-scale <b>anisotropies.</b> Having set the stage, we review the various ideas and models put forward for explaining the small-scale <b>anisotropies.</b> Comment: 60 pages, 16 figures; invited review for Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics (PPNP...|$|R
25|$|The <b>anisotropy,</b> or {{directional}} dependency, of {{the cosmic}} microwave background is divided into two types: primary <b>anisotropy,</b> due to effects that occur at the last scattering surface and before; and secondary <b>anisotropy,</b> due to effects such as interactions of the background radiation with hot gas or gravitational potentials, which occur between the last scattering surface and the observer.|$|E

Rashid Sunyaev later calculated the observable imprint that these inhomogeneities would have on the cosmic microwave background. Increasingly stringent limits on the <b>anisotropy</b> of the cosmic microwave background were set by ground based experiments during the 1980s. RELIKT-1, a Soviet cosmic microwave background <b>anisotropy</b> experiment on board the Prognoz 9 satellite (launched 1 July 1983) gave upper limits on the large-scale <b>anisotropy.</b> The NASA COBE mission clearly confirmed the primary <b>anisotropy</b> with the Differential Microwave Radiometer instrument, publishing their findings in 1992.

The Cosmic Microwave Background {{fluctuations}} {{provide a}} powerful probe {{of the dark}} ages of the universe through the imprint of the secondary <b>anisotropies</b> associated with the reionisation {{of the universe and}} the growth of structure.

The physics of secondary fluctuations is described, with emphasis on the ionisation history and the evolution of structure.

25|$|Due to the {{typically}} large, bi-stable spin <b>anisotropy,</b> single-molecule magnets promise {{the realization}} of perhaps the smallest practical unit for magnetic memory, and thus are possible building blocks for a quantum computer.

40|$|AbstractCommonly, in the {{evaluation}} of the optical appearance of glass panes in building envelopes, <b>anisotropies</b> are a reason for a dispute between the architect or client and the façade manufacturer. Sometimes each party has a different perception, how strong the <b>anisotropies</b> are and what is permissible. This paper discusses in the first part the formation of the <b>anisotropies</b> and their natural sources. It is shown that the appearance of this phenomenon is dependent on the environmental conditions of the building site as well as the glass quality. If the application of thermally tempered glass cannot be avoided, the quality assurance of the production process has to be carefully planned. Furthermore a method for the quantitative measurement of <b>anisotropies</b> is proposed and prescribed in detail. This method can assist in the quality assurance process. Measurements are showing that probably the best tempered glass offers slight <b>anisotropies</b> and that under unfavorable conditions these <b>anisotropies</b> can become evident...|$|R
40|$|We study {{primordial}} <b>anisotropies</b> {{generated in}} the model of gauged hybrid inflation in which the complex waterfall field is charged under a U(1) gauge field. Primordial <b>anisotropies</b> are generated either actively during inflation or from inhomogeneities modulating the surface of end of inflation during waterfall transition. We present a consistent δ N mechanism to calculate the anisotropic power spectrum and bispectrum. We show that the primordial <b>anisotropies</b> generated at the surface of end of inflation do {{not depend on the}} number of e-folds and therefore do not produce dangerously large <b>anisotropies</b> associated with the IR modes. Furthermore, one can find the parameter space that the <b>anisotropies</b> generated from the surface of end of inflation cancel the <b>anisotropies</b> generated during inflation, therefore relaxing the constrains on model parameters imposed from IR <b>anisotropies.</b> We also show that the gauge field fluctuations induce a red-tilted power spectrum so the averaged power spectrum from the gauge field can change the total power spectrum from blue to red. Therefore, hybrid inflation, once gauged under a U(1) field, can be consistent with the cosmological observations. Comment: 21 pages, no figure, minor changes, published versio...|$|R
40|$|The data {{measured}} by the Cosmic Background Explorer's (COBE) differential microwave radiometer (DMR) {{has been shown to}} be consistent with the existence of 10 ppm <b>anisotropies</b> in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This consistency has been widely accepted as a definitive detection of the <b>anisotropies.</b> However, the reanalysis presented in this paper shows that the COBE DMR data is also consistent with the absence of <b>anisotropies.</b> Consequently, the probability densities of the sky maps with and without <b>anisotropies</b> are comparable. Provided it is confirmed that the COBE data is also consistent with the non existence of the 10 ppm <b>anisotropies,</b> it is argued that the COBE data alone tells nothing more about the existence of the <b>anisotropies</b> than was known before the COBE satellite was launched. As WMAP has the same differential data acquisition and reconstruction algorithm as COBE, it is quite possible that a similar reanalysis of the WMAP data will lead to the same conclusion. The single beam antenna and low noise receivers of the soon-to-be-launched Planck satellite should permit direct measurement of the 10 ppm <b>anisotropies</b> and provide definitive evidence as to their existence or non existence...|$|R

In contrast to previous work, we find no evidence for any limit to how large the <b>anisotropies</b> can become, although for increasing <b>anisotropies</b> {{the shape of the}} instantons becomes significantly different from Hawking's original no-boundary instanton. In all cases an inflationary phase is reached, with the <b>anisotropies</b> decaying away. Larger <b>anisotropies</b> are associated with a much larger imaginary part of the action, implying that the highly anisotropic branches of the wavefunction are heavily suppressed. Interestingly, the presence of <b>anisotropies</b> causes the wavefunction to become classical much more slowly than for isotropic inflationary universes.

40|$|New {{calculations}} of the Galactic contamination over microwave background radiation <b>anisotropies</b> are carried out. On one hand, when a frequency-dependent contrast of molecular clouds {{with respect to}} the Galactic background of the diffuse interstellar medium is taken into account, the anisotropic amplitude produced by Galactic dust is increased with respect to previous calculations and this is of the same order as that of the data from the observations. On the other hand, if we take into account rotational dust emission, for instance, a frequency independence of <b>anisotropies</b> in the microwave range may be obtained. This leads to the possibility that under some particular, but not impossible, conditions all the microwave background radiation <b>anisotropies</b> may be due to Galactic foregrounds rather than cosmological in origin. Moreover, a suspected coincidence between the typical angular sizes of the microwave background radiation <b>anisotropies</b> and those of nearby molecular clouds makes more plausible the hypothesis of a purely Galactic origin for these <b>anisotropies.</b> It is also argued that the correlation among structures at different frequencies, the comparison of the power spectrum at different frequencies and the galactic latitude dependence of the <b>anisotropies</b> are not yet proofs in favour of either a cosmological or Galactic origin.
