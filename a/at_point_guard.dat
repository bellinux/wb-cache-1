5|$|On February 3, 2014, Morris {{signed a}} 10-day {{contract}} with the Memphis Grizzlies. Mike Conley, Jr. had been injured and Jerryd Bayless had been recently traded, leaving the team short <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard.</b> On February 13, 2014, the Grizzlies did not offer him a second 10-day contract after his first 10-day contract expired.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2015, Lin {{signed a}} two-year, $4.3 million {{contract}} with the Charlotte Hornets, who used their bi-annual exception in the deal. He had been open to re-joining New York, {{but they were not}} interested, having drafted guard Jerian Grant to pair with veteran José Calderón <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard.</b> Lin was projected to back up Hornets point guard Kemba Walker, and coach Steve Clifford envisioned that the two pick-and-roll players would sometimes play together.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 15 {{games of the}} 2013–14 NBA season, Nelson started <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> for the Orlando Magic, but on November 29, he missed the game due to injury. Victor Oladipo moved from {{shooting}} guard to point guard, while Moore became the starting shooting guard against the San Antonio Spurs. Moore missed some action due to injury with the game against Sacramento on December 21. He returned to the lineup three games later on December 29. On February 18 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Moore had 17 points and 2 blocks, which were season highs. Moore tied his season high of 17 points on 6-for-6 shooting, including 5-for-5 on three point shots on April 9 against the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, Burke {{signed a}} maximum rookie contract—120 {{percent of the}} preset salary scale of $2,032,300—with the Jazz, {{resulting}} in a contract worth in $4,987,320 guaranteed salary for his first two seasons, while the Jazz have team option rights for {{the third and fourth}} years. This cleared the way for Burke to participate in the July 7–12 Orlando Summer League. <b>At</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams. In the NBA Summer League, Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field, including 1–19 on three-point shots, while trying to adjust to the pace of the NBA game. He was even benched for a game. Following Burke's Summer League performance, the Jazz signed John Lucas III.|$|E
5|$|With the {{graduation}} of Luis Guzmán, Fernández switched {{back to his}} natural position <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> in his junior campaign. Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection. He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard in college basketball. A shooting slump that lasted {{the majority of the}} season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5%, his three point percentage drop to 33.3%, and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game. He still led the team in assists, with 3.9 per game. Fernández did miss four games {{in the middle of the}} season due to a bone bruise in his knee, but the shooting slump was more devastating and caused him to consult a sports psychologist. One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond, in which he went 3-for-17 from the field and committed three turnovers. After the game Fran Dunphy convinced Fernández that he had to take less shots and get his teammates involved.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 NBA draft, {{believing that}} the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors {{starting}} lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and {{would be out of}} the league by age 29. In the backcourt, Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard.</b> The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2015, Jones {{announced}} he was ending his college career to enter the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall {{pick in the draft}} by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who then traded his draft rights to his hometown team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, in exchange for a 2019 second round draft pick and the draft rights to the 31st and 36th picks in the draft, Cedi Osman and Rakeem Christmas, respectively. On July 7, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Timberwolves. Jones started in the preseason opener when Ricky Rubio was sidelined, but did not fare well against Russell Westbrook, going scoreless and nearly giving up a triple double. Jones began the season fourth on the Timberwolves depth chart <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> (behind Rubio, Zach LaVine and Andre Miller) and was inactive for the October 28 season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. Jones was active {{for the first time on}} November 7 when Kevin Martin had to be away from the team for the game against the Chicago Bulls. Two games later on November 10, he was active again when three starters were sidelined, including Rubio who was scratched from the lineup right before tipoff. He made his debut that night against the Charlotte Hornets, posting his first assist, steal, rebound and point. On December 5, using the flexible assignment rule, the Timberwolves assigned Jones to the Idaho Stampede, the D-League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. On December 22, he was recalled by the Timberwolves after he averaged 24.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.5 steals in 35.2 minutes per game in six starts in the D-League. He made his first NBA field goals on December 23 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 6 points in 20 minutes. Jones didn't play in 17 consecutive games (since January 4) and then had a season-high 5 assists on February 8 against the New Orleans Pelicans. By late February, head coach Sam Mitchell noted that Jones would be getting sufficient playing time to be evaluated. He achieved a career-high on February 22 with 9 points on 4-of-7 shooting against the Boston Celtics. On February 28, he posted 6 assists against the Dallas Mavericks. Jones posted 6 assists and 10 points against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 7, Jones tallied 4 steals against the Sacramento Kings. On April 13, he closed out the season with a 12-assist effort against the New Orleans Pelicans.|$|E
25|$|The next year, Divac {{participated in}} the team that took the gold at the FIBA Junior World Championship (since split into {{separate}} under-19 and under-21 events) in Bormio, Italy. That event launched the young generation of Yugoslavian basket ballers, also featuring stars like Rađa and Kukoč, regarded as likely the best in history. Before the breakup of Yugoslavia, they would also take the titles at EuroBasket 1989 and the 1990 FIBA World Championship in Argentina, where they were led by Dražen Petrović, {{as well as the}} EuroBasket 1991 title, with Aleksandar Đorđević <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vandersloot {{was widely}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the top prospects in the 2011 WNBA Draft. Her relatively small size had been a subject of concern, as was her defense—despite averaging 4.5 steals per game in the 2011 NCAA tournament and ending her Gonzaga career with 366. However, she was seen as likely {{to be one of the}} top seven picks, and was ultimately picked third overall by the Chicago Sky. One indicator of her likely draft position was that Indiana Fever coach Lin Dunn, whose team needed depth <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> going into the 2011 season, signed Shannon Bobbitt in February, convinced that Vandersloot would be picked before the Fever's turn at #9.|$|E

25|$|At UCLA, Kaczmarski started <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> {{early in}} the 1999-2000 season due to an injury to regular starter Erica Gomez. Eventually, she was shifted to the {{shooting}} guard position. Kaczmarski faced some early season struggles, including a pair of losses in December to Rutgers and UCONN during her return to the New York metropolitan area. She improved later in the season, ending {{with an average of}} 11.7 points per game and having set a school record by hitting seven three pointers during a game at Washington State University. Kaczmarski was also named Pac-10 Player of the Week during the final week of the regular season and was a selection to the conference all-freshman team.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Hill {{joined the}} San Antonio Spurs {{and made his}} NBA debut on November 4 against the Dallas Mavericks in the third game of the season. He had sat out the {{previous}} two games due to a sprained left-thumb. In 15 minutes of play, Hill finished with 11 points, 1 steal, and 1 assist. Hill initially served as the main reserve <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> however after NBA leading scorer Tony Parker suffered an injury {{early in the season}} he was promoted to starter. After the return of Manu Ginóbili and Tony Parker, Hill received fewer minutes. He finished his rookie season averaging 5.7 points per game, 2.1 rebounds per game, and 1.8 assists per game. Hill made his playoff debut in game 2 of the Spurs first-round series against the Mavs, but he only played 5 minutes.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, 2006, Foye was {{selected}} seventh {{overall in the}} 2006 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, and later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He entered his rookie year {{on a team that}} already had six guards on its roster. Off-season free-agent acquisition Mike James was slated to start <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> Foye's most likely position in the NBA, with Ricky Davis at small forward and Rashad McCants at shooting guard. This left Foye to battle for minutes on a bench full of guards. In November, Foye's first month as a professional basketball player, Timberwolves coach Dwane Casey only gave Foye an average of 14.6 minutes per game. Foye, however, was productive whenever he was given minutes. He scored in double digits {{in each of the four}} games he was given 20 or more minutes of playing time.|$|E

25|$|Standing at 6 feet 5 {{inches tall}} (1.96 m) and {{weighing}} 220 pounds (100kg), Harden plays mostly at the shooting guard position. With season averages of over 26 {{points per game}} since the 2012–13 season, Harden {{is considered one of}} the most versatile and dangerous scorers in the NBA. He possesses a wide array of offensive moves; two of the most prominent among them being his Euro step and his step-back jumper. He has also gained notoriety for his ability to exploit league rules in order to more efficiently draw fouls and get to the free throw line, from which he is a career 84.9% shooter. He has led the NBA in free throw attempts and makes every year since the 2014–15 season. Though primarily a scorer, he is also known for his playmaking ability, orchestrating the Rockets' offense with his elevated assist numbers. During the early portion of the 2016–17 season, Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni played Harden <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> which resulted in him averaging over 10 assists per game for the first time in his career.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the 2011 NBA lockout, the Knicks engaged in a sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks for center Tyson Chandler on December 10, 2011, with Chandler signing a four-year contract worth approximately $58 million. In return, the Knicks sent Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, generating a trade exception for Dallas. Ronny Turiaf and $3 million in cash considerations were sent to the Wizards to complete the three-way trade. The Knicks also obtained the draft rights to Ahmad Nivins and Georgios Printezis from Dallas. In order to fit Chandler under the salary cap, Chauncey Billups was earlier waived under the amnesty clause of the new collective bargaining agreement. To replace Billups <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> the Knicks signed Mike Bibby to a one-year, veteran minimum contract. The Knicks also signed veteran point guard Baron Davis on December 19 to a one-year contract. At the time, Davis had suffered a herniated disk and was not expected to compete for about 6–8 weeks, leaving Toney Douglas as the team's starting point guard. The Knicks struggled early in the season because Douglas and Bibby struggled to facilitate the offense and subsequently, it became stagnated. Subsequently, rookie Iman Shumpert was thrust into the role as the starting point guard after Douglas was relegated to the bench due to his struggles. In addition, head coach D'Antoni also decided to use Carmelo Anthony as a point forward to help generate a more up-tempo offense; however, there were concerns Anthony was holding the ball for too long, thus contributing to the stagnation of the Knicks' offense.|$|E

500|$|Burke {{committed}} {{to represent the}} Jazz in 2014 NBA Summer League. [...] On July 18, he was named to practice with the USA Basketball National Select Team from July 28–31. On October 24, 2014, the Jazz exercised their third-year team option on his rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season. On November 14, Burke made a buzzer beater to give Utah a 102100 victory over the New York Knicks. On January 2, he tied Antoine Walker's NBA record for worst single-game three point shooting performance, 0-for-11. Burke scored a season-high 28 points on January 3 against the Minnesota Timberwolves who had traded the 9th overall selection of the 2013 NBA draft to the Utah Jazz {{that they used to}} select Burke. On January 22, the Jazz announced that Burke would not start despite being healthy, making way for Dante Exum's first start <b>at</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard.</b> This gave Burke the role of scorer and leader of the reserves. With the shakeup, the 1428 Jazz won their next two games against the Milwaukee Bucks and Brooklyn Nets. It {{was the first time in}} Burke's basketball career that he had not been a starter.|$|E

On December 8, Michigan lost 8258 to (19/-) SMU as LeVert slumped on 113 field goal {{shooting}} and 36 free throw shooting. On December 15 against Northern Kentucky, LeVert posted 13 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, becoming the fourth player in Michigan program history to record a triple-double, and the 49th Wolverine to eclipse 1,000 career points. Based on his triple double against Northern Kentucky and a 19-point effort against Youngstown State, LeVert earned Co-Big Ten Player of the Week honors (along with Malcolm Hill) on December 21. On December 30, Michigan defeated Illinois 78–68 in its Big Ten Conference opener as LeVert posted a 22-point, 10-assist double-double.

Later that week, Holden saw Lin playing in a much more competitive game, driving to the basket at every opportunity with the [...] "instincts of a killer", and Lin became a top priority for him. Harvard coaches feared that Stanford, close to Lin's home, would offer Lin a scholarship, but it did not, and Lin chose to attend Harvard. [...] "I wasn't sitting there saying all these Division I coaches were knuckleheads," [...] Diepenbrock said. [...] "There were legitimate questions about Jeremy." [...] Joe Lacob, incoming Warriors owner and Stanford booster, said Stanford's failure to recruit Lin [...] "was really stupid. The kid was right across the street. [...] you can't recognize that, you've got a problem."
