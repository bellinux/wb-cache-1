40|$|Several {{scientific}} communities concentrate {{their efforts}} using photogrammetric techniques {{in the field}} of modelling urban areas. On the other side – with the access to high resolution satellites – also remote sensing in urban areas is present since a few years. At the same time, the shift from <b>analytical</b> to digital <b>photogrammetry</b> is now effective. Therefore, remote sensing and photogrammetry become closer as never before and this tendency is also remarkable in the corresponding software. Remote sensing is an invaluable tool in fields where spatial and spectral information is required. For topics like land use evaluation or change detection at regional scales, image processing techniques used for optical satellite imagery have proved their potential. Familiarised with the problem of modelling urban areas using photogrammetric techniques, our team extended its research topics by integrating knowledge resulting from satellite imagery processing. For this purpose, investigations with photogrammetric software and remote sensing software are realised during practical works with students of the department of surveying at ENSAIS Strasbourg. After creating a digital terrain model resulting from the restitution of stereoscopic photographs, several orthophotos are created and mosaicked together. The step of geocoding and mosaicking images has been attempted in parallel using on the one side exclusively photogrammetric tools {{and on the other side}} solely remote sensing tools. Results were assessed in a quantitative way, based on local and global precision and in a qualitative way, visualising the mosaicked area through a three dimensional representation. RESUME...|$|R

One {{of the advantages}} of direct digital data capture in the air is the possibility of capturing multispectral data as well as panchromatic. Between modern filmbased aerial mapping cameras with their extremely high resolution and, {{at the other end of}} the spectrum, the high-resolution satellite sensors, themarket for new airborne devices is large and incontestable. Two competing technologies are available as the basis for airborne digital sensors - linear and matrix array CCDs. The price/performance ratio of the matrix array CCDs are insufficient to offer swath widths and resolutions comparable to film cameras. The most promising alternative are linear arrays, arranged in a triplet on the focal plane, one forward-, one nadir- and one backward-looking. When combined with GPS and INS systems, this configuration provides geometric performance that enables the same photogrammetric operations to be performed on the workstation as with scanned film imagery. Additionally, multispectral CCD lines can be placed on the focal plane, providing data unique for remote sensing due to theadditional advantages of geometrically correct sensor modeling, stereo imagery and accurate geo-coding. A development project between LH Systems and the German Aerospace Centre has resulted in a functioning three-line sensor.

40|$|Point based co-linearity is an {{essential}} conception in Photogrammetry. But point in photogrammetry means only physical or visible points, such as dots, cross points and corner point etc. Especially in the stage of either analogue or <b>analytical,</b> even digital <b>photogrammetry,</b> the main primitive feature, which can be measured by human operator, is physical point. It {{can be referred to}} as Point Photogrammetry contrary to Line photogrammetry, which is proposed and used only in the past about 20 years. For a straight line a coplanar equation is used, where the line on the image lies on the plane, passing through corresponding spatial straight line and the photographing centre in line photogrammetry. All straight lines and curves are normally referred to linear feature rather than point feature in line photogrammetry. The co-planarity can be normally explain as Sa(SPSQ) = 0, which means the image point a must lie on the plane composed by perspective centre S and two end point P and Q of the 3 D line. However, in mathematics all lines or curves are consists of points, which is expressed as generalized point in this paper. Collinear equation could be used to linear features similar as the visible point, and all kinds of features existing in photogrammetry can be concentrated on "point" [...] called as Generalized Point Photogrammetry. According to this philosophy the adjustment form would be consistent, simpler and more convenient comparing with line photogrammetry. In the Generalized point photogrammetry the only difference between physical points and feature line point is that two collinear equations of both x and y are used for the physical point and only one collinear equation of x or y depending on the local direction of the line segment is used for feature line point.

40|$|An {{indirect}} {{methodology for}} determining the distribution of mass balance at high spatial resolution using remote sensing and ice-flow modelling is presented. The method, based on the mass-continuity equation, requires two datasets collected over the desired monitoring interval: (i) the spatial pattern of glacier surface-elevation change, and (ii) the mass-flux divergence field. At Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Valais, Switzerland, the mass-balance distribution between September 1992 and September 1993 is calculated at 20 m resolution from {{the difference between the}} pattern of surface-elevation change derived from <b>analytical</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> and the mass-flux divergence field determined from three-dimensional, numerical flow modelling constrained by surface-velocity measurements. The resultant pattern of mass balance is almost totally negative, showing a strong dependence on elevation, but with large localized departures. The computed distribution of mass balance compares well (R 2 = 0. 91) with mass-balance measurements made at stakes installed along the glacier centre line over the same period. Despite the highly optimized nature of the flow-modelling effort employed in this study, the good agreement indicates the potential this method has as a strategy for deriving high spatial and temporal-resolution estimates of mass balance.

40|$|Main {{objective}} of this work is to suggest some easy procedures to solve typical non-linear problems of <b>analytical</b> <b>photogrammetry,</b> which are also frequent in digital photogrammetry.

Once validated the technique of orientation of two images, a procedure for the orientation of three images is proposed. In particular, the introduction of a third image allows avoiding human decision to find the final solution. In order to find an easy solution for three-image orientation, each model coming from two images of a triplet is analysed, computing the relative orientation bby using an exhaustive research of preliminary values of its parameters. This non-conventional approach supplies the orientation of two images, taking into account a priori information among four base solutions. Once each model is relatively registered, the absolute orientation is computed by using a linear parameterization.

With these combined new approaches we expect a higher level of completion of the object, an improvement of the modeling quality and a shortening of the processing time to generate the 3 D model. We streamline our new method of point cloud editing and improve our new technique of view-dependent texture mapping.
