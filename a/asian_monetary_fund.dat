The Asia Times Online wrote in an editorial published several days after the meeting, [...] "The idea {{that the existence of}} a currency swap arrangement or the wider concept of an <b>Asian</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>fund</b> ... could have prevented the Asian crisis or the worst of it, is both wrong and politically noxious." [...] After IMF Managing Director Horst Köhler visited five Asian nations, including Thailand, in June 2000, the Asia Times Online denounced his endorsement of [...] "the ill-conceived and likely never to be implemented Asean plus three ... currency-swap plan". In a 2001 interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review, Köhler stated that the CMI would promote regional economic co-operation and development and that he would not oppose the formation of an Asian Monetary Union.|$|E
50|$|At {{the height}} of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Japanese {{authorities}} proposed an <b>Asian</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund,</b> which would serve as a regional version of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, this idea was shelved after encountering strong resistance from the United States. After the crisis, finance ministers of members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the People's Republic of China, Japan, and South Korea met on 6 May 2000 at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Chiang Mai, Thailand, to discuss the establishment of a network of bilateral currency swap agreements. The proposal was dubbed the Chiang Mai Initiative and intended to avoid a future recurrence of the Asian Financial Crisis. It also implied the possibility of establishing a pool of foreign exchange reserves accessible by participating central banks to fight currency speculation. The proposal would also supplement the financial resources of international institutions such as the IMF. Joint Ministerial Statement (JMS) was issued after the ASEAN+3 Finance Minister’s Meetings have mentioned the development of the CMI.|$|E

By 2011 Japan managed to establish a cooperative agreement with China and Korea called the [...] "PRC-Japan-Republic of Korea Free trade agreement", also known as the CJK FTA, which did not include the U.S. Japan's intention with this was so that they could use the People's Republic of China card in order to gain U.S support in order to have backing within the TPP, and shift the negotiations toward Japan's agendas with support of the United States.On 9 December 2016, resolution of participation was made in House of Councillors, and notified completion of domestic procedures for ratification to the depositary of the treaty (New Zealand) as the first ratified country on 20 January 2017.

50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> (AMF) was {{initially}} {{proposed by the}} Japanese government during the 1997 Asian financial crisis at the G7-IMF meetings in Hong Kong during September 20-25, 1997. It was aimed towards securing a regional network funded by Asian countries to overcome current and future economic crisis. During the Asian financial crisis, Asian leaders experienced the incompetence of both regional and international {{institutions such as the}} Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Countries such as Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Thailand had to turn to bailouts from the IMF. However, the strict conditions of the IMF bailouts evoked discontent among Asian countries. This discontent was largely because Asian nations had little leverage on IMF crisis resolution measures despite the IMF being an international organisation. Another source of discontent was due to the financial volatility concerning the US dollar. More specifically it owed to the fixed exchange-rate system that Asian governments adopted throughout the 1990s, in which currency was pegged to the US dollar at rates incompatible with domestic economies. The initial proposal of the AMF stirred conflict between Japanese authorities and the United States.|$|E

40|$|This paper re-assesses the {{prospects}} for greater monetary integration in Asia {{in the wake of}} the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The Asian crisis highlighted the absence of well-developed supranational institutions in Asia to provide early warning signals of impending currency or balance of payments problems, access to unconditional funds to cope with financial problems, and a common defensive mechanism to deal with speculative movements in exchange rates. Since 1997 there have been a number of initiatives to enhance monetary cooperation in the region including a Japanese proposal for an <b>Asian</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund,</b> the Chiang Mai Initiative at the Asean+ 3 meeting in May 2000, the Kobe Research Project, and the currency swap agreements and surveillance machinery initiated at the Asian Development Bank Meeting in Honolulu in May 2001. We find that whilst a common monetary and exchange rate policy in EA is unlikely in the foreseeable future, until the net economic benefits of giving up unilateral exchange rate regimes are more apparent, a good case can be made for placing responsibility for the functions of macroeconomic surveillance and regional resource pooling within a permanent institution which could evolve over time into a fully-fledged <b>Asian</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> with its own Asia-specific rules on conditionality.

40|$|The {{idea of an}} <b>Asian</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> (AMF), {{which was}} first raised in 1997, culminated in an {{agreement}} among the finance ministers of ASEAN plus PRC, Japan, and Korea (ASEAN+ 3) {{to establish a system}} of swap arrangements among their countries in {{what is known as the}} Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) on May 6, 2000. Policymakers of the ASEAN+ 3 have made considerable progress over the past three years in increasing the availability of liquidity as they have succeeded in contracting a number of bilateral swaps and establishing informal mechanisms of policy dialogues and reviews among the ASEAN+ 3. However, the CMI is in an embryonic stage of development, and as such requires a great deal of expansion and consolidation to serve as an efficient regional liquidity support system. This paper analyzes possibilities of, and prospects for, constructing a regional financial arrangement in East Asia by augmenting liquidity support and broadening the scope of cooperation through the CMI. Through an evolutionary process of enlargement and consolidation of the CMI, this study envisions creation of a possible <b>Asian</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> that is complete with financial support facilities, a monitoring and surveillance mechanism, and a regional collective exchange rate system with a view to adopting a common currency as a long-term objective. A detailed proposal for an operational structure of the CMI is presented. Issues related to surveillance and regional exchange rate policy cooperation are also analyzed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the political dynamics surrounding the Japanese government’s initial {{proposal for the}} creation of an <b>Asian</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> (AMF) in 1997 and the arrangements that have emerged in its place. Specifically, the paper delves into why Japan attempted to embark on regional institution building independent of the United States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1997 but has since supported the close linkage to the IMF of a network of bilateral currency swap arrangements in the region. The findings reveal the formidable difficulties Japan faces in circumventing the activities of US-dominated multilateral institutions to play a greater leadership role in financial crisis management in Asia. ...|$|E

This could also take pressure off the constrained resources of the IMF.

In contrast, reserve holdings by emerging markets appear to exceed the optimal reserve coverage ratio by wide margins, of-fering a quantitative indicator of the limited availability of market-based insurance for emerging markets...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{integration}} is less pronounced in East Asia than among states in Europe and North America or compared to economic integration within the region. Cross-border trade flows, direct investment {{and investment in}} capital goods have long been greater and faster growing than other investment flows, while regional institutional and legal structures are scarce and frequently insubstantive. This dichotomy persists despite suggestions since the early 1990 s that Asian financial integration would accelerate, especially following the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 and including national enthusiasm for the World Trade Organization. This article suggests explanations in legal, governance and institutional frameworks for the paradox of modest financial integration, despite increasing regional cooperation, accompanying robust economic growth and trade integration. However, the recent global financial crisis provides opportunities and incentives for the region to endorse greater financial integration, sacrificing state sovereignty so that transnational financial arrangements may function effectively.
