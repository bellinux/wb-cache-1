5|$|Ochs's {{drinking}} {{became more}} and more of a problem, and his behavior became increasingly erratic.

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the end of the hostage crisis, President Claire Haas (Marcia Cross) <b>and</b> <b>CIA</b> {{director}} Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force between the FBI <b>and</b> <b>CIA.</b> President Haas mentions that there were eight collaborators within the shadowy cabal group who are secretly involved with the AIC. As a result of Lydia's actions, the collaborators gained access to sensitive U.S intelligence. This information was vital to their goal of controlling certain areas within the government. As a response, the task force is assigned to uncover the conspiracy and expose the involvement of the collaborators in orchestrating the hostage crisis. Alex is hired to be a member of the task force along with Ryan Booth, Nimah Amin, Shelby Wyatt, and Dayana Mampasi. The leader of the group is Clay Haas (Hunter Parrish), a renowned political advisory strategist. Prior to the formation of the task force, Alex is re-instated as an FBI agent.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of how bin Laden {{was located}} by U.S. {{intelligence}} differ. The White House <b>and</b> <b>CIA</b> director John Brennan {{stated that the}} process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance. According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News, however, the U.S. was tipped off about bin Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention {{in exchange for a}} bounty.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor <b>and</b> <b>CIA</b> chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E

5|$|Alex Parrish, {{a former}} FBI recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a {{terrorist}} attack on Grand Central Terminal and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The current time-line focuses on Parrish's constrained relationship with her friends while {{she is on the}} run in an attempt to prove her innocence. In the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI; in flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the current time-line, a hostage crisis at a G-20 summit in New York City is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President Claire Haas <b>and</b> <b>CIA</b> director Matthew Keyes form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by Clay Haas) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the hostage crisis.|$|E

Starting at 01:00 on 11March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions in order to launch their attack. About 02:00, a U.S. adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord <b>and</b> <b>CIA</b> officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with U.S. technicians at Lima Site 85 was completely cut off. Afterwards, Secord briefed U.S. A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of U.S. personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.|$|E

During a break, Obanno, infuriated, ambushes Le Chiffre in his suite. After Obanno leaves Le Chiffre's room, Bond engages him and {{strangles}} him to death. Vesper is traumatised by the encounter, but Bond comforts her. When the tournament resumes, Bond loses his initial stake, and Vesper refuses to fund further playing. Frustrated, Bond is about to kill Le Chiffre when he meets Felix Leiter, a fellow player <b>and</b> <b>CIA</b> agent who is on the same mission as Bond. Leiter, on the verge of losing, agrees to stake Bond on the condition that the CIA takes custody of Le Chiffre after his defeat.|$|E

5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who {{said that if he}} were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother <b>and</b> <b>CIA</b> director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These connections made the Eisenhower administration more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government.|$|E
