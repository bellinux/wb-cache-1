5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville is a {{historic}} district and neighborhood in central Louisville, Kentucky, USA. It is the third largest such district in the United States, and the largest preservation district featuring almost entirely Victorian architecture. It is also unique in {{that a majority of}} its structures are made of brick, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> contains the highest concentration of residential homes with stained glass windows in the U.S. Many of the buildings are in the Victorian-era styles of Romanesque, Queen Anne, Italianate, among others; and a large number of blocks have had few or no buildings razed.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to study how {{shopping}} centers in Stavanger region coexist with the city, with special focus {{on the relationship between}} <b>the</b> shopping centers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> sustainability aspect is examined to this research in order to provide more comprehensive study. The problem statement relies on understanding how the integrated shopping centers relate to some aspects such as location, density, accessibility, sustainable transport, and to some extent, economy. In order to comply with these objectives, the development of shopping centers in Stavanger region with their classification is generally discussed, and then some specific shopping centers were selected based on their distinct aspects mentioned above. The discoveries show that <b>the</b> location <b>and</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>neighborhood’s</b> condition influence <b>the</b> relation between <b>the</b> shopping centers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> <b>The</b> shopping centers in a high density and a robust neighborhood indicate more integration <b>and</b> sustainable than <b>the</b> other shopping centers in the opposite situation. However, city regulations may helps {{to reduce the risk of}} disintegration between shopping centers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> This thesis concludes that shopping centers in Stavanger region have been attempting to integrate with <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> trying to achieve sustainable transportation...|$|R

25|$|The Cedars was {{originally}} {{developed in the}} 1870s with moderately-priced homes, but by the late 19th century the neighborhood {{had become one of}} the premier destinations in Dallas, with stately Victorian homes belonging to wealthy businessmen, lawyers, and politicians dotting the streets. The Cedars was also the home of Dallas' Jewish community, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> included the Shaareth Israel synagogue. (Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus fame was born in the Cedars.) By the early 20th century, however, light industry and growing population pressures had begun to take the bloom off the neighborhood's rose, and most of the city's wealthiest began to move further north to neighborhoods northeast of downtown. Even as industry, such as the Sears-Roebuck warehouse that now is home of the South Side on Lamarlofts, moved in, fine homes continued to be built, especially for well-to-do members of the Jewish community. But by the 1920s, the massive Victorians of the late 19th century were gone, the synagogue was demolished, and most people moved on. In the 1960s, virtually all of the remaining homes were destroyed by the city for highway projects. Today, only a scant handful of homes (perhaps as few as six) from the neighborhood's original residents survive, none in restored condition.|$|E
