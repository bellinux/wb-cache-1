5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E
5|$|Imported operettas and {{domestic}} productions by both whites like Cohan and blacks like Cook, Europe and Johnson {{all had a}} formative influence on Broadway. Composers like Gershwin, Porter and Kern made comedic musical theater into a national pastime, with <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> that was distinctly American and not dependent on European models. Most of these individuals were Jewish, with Cole Porter the only major exception; they were the descendants of 19th century immigrants fleeing persecution in the Russian Empire, settled most influentially in various neighborhoods in New York City. Many of the early musicals were influenced by black music, showing elements of early jazz, such as In Dahomey; the Jewish composers of these works may have seen connections between the traditional African American blue notes and their own folk Jewish music.|$|E
25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record {{of what has happened}} to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.|$|E

25|$|In this example, {{the general}} {{deliverables}} within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently {{as time goes}} by, mainly because of dependencies between deliverables. For instance, the actual go for the delivery of the software and the other related deliverables are dependent {{on the outcome of}} the deliverable “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier. The customer organization can get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> {{for the use of the}} software in the target domain, to guarantee that the software is a “fit” within the organization.|$|E
25|$|The Little 500 is {{much more}} than just the race. There are also several series events {{associated}} with the race. These events are held for a few reasons. The first and foremost is for fun. The second reason is so that teams can scout out the competition and get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> for that year's race field. And the final reason is so that all the members of a team, not just those competing in the actual race itself, can still participate and compete. There are four other series events outside of the race: Qualifications, ITTs, Miss-N-Out, and Team Pursuit.|$|E
25|$|To obtain <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> for the {{problems}} being encountered in the field, he made three trips to New Guinea, for 17 days in November 1942, 15 days in June 1943, and 16 days in February 1944. He contracted malaria during the first visit. O'Brien and the Engineer-in-Chief, Major General Clive Steele, left Melbourne on 5 August 1944 {{on a tour of}} ordnance plants in the United States, Canada and Britain. In London, O'Brien was invested with his membership of the Distinguished Service Order by George VI in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. On the way back to Australia, he visited the war zones in Northern Italy and Burma.|$|E

25|$|In its {{depiction}} of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, {{which he did}} by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching on a holstered gun. This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to savor the performances and character reactions, create <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful landscapes. Leone also incorporated music to heighten up the tension and pressure {{before and during the}} film's many gunfights.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{influence to}} jazz was the blues, {{an expression of}} the hardships experienced daily by slaves, in direct contrast to the work song, a celebration of work. Its musical inspiration came from where its players did, Africa. The rhythmic form of blues was a basis for many developments that would appear in jazz. Though its instrumentation was mostly limited to melodic instruments and a singer, feeling and rhythm were tremendously important. The two primary feels were a pulse on alternating beats that we see in countless other forms of American music, and the shuffle, which is essentially the pattin' juba rhythm, <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> based on a division of three rather than two.|$|E
25|$|Prospective BBGs {{are first}} {{nominated}} by their school headteacher, {{to be considered}} for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, {{to the side of the}} Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships for <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> of the grass court.|$|E

25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as no boundaries were given {{up in the next}} eight overs, and Yuvraj felt like he had to attack. He got away with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> at a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was gone for a stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but he ran out of partners, as no one could help him keep the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E

So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song.
