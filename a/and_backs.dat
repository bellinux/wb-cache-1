5|$|Like other bows, {{they lost}} {{importance}} {{with the introduction}} and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made with fiberglass bellies <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> with a natural or man-made core.|$|E

Scar taunts him over {{his role in}} Mufasa's death <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> him {{to the edge of}} the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, {{attempting}} to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas, who overheard him betray them to Simba. With his enemies gone, Simba takes over the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, <b>and</b> <b>backs.</b> The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E

5|$|Five former Rams players also {{jumped to}} the Browns in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move {{gave rise to a}} legal battle with the Rams, who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with the Browns. Reeves, the Rams' owner, filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with the Browns, claiming the tackle unlawfully broke his contract to play for the Rams. Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. At the end of August 1946, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore was not bound to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Tucker is {{introduced}} as J.T. Hellstrom’s (Thad Luckinbill) employer, while pursuing a business deal with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and beginning {{an affair with}} Jill Abbott (Jess Walton). Tucker secretly gains control of Katherine’s company, Chancellor Industries, after she buys stock in a dummy corporation and at a shareholders' meeting, Tucker reveals that he is Kay's long-lost son, and he was behind a woman named Jojo Glover pretending to be her daughter. After years of planning, Tucker had finally gotten his revenge on Katherine for giving him away and he begins slowly dismantling Chancellor Industries by selling its subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Katherine's other son, Brock Reynolds (Beau Kazer) advises Tucker {{to get to know}} their mother, but Katherine refuses to accept him, and Tucker is hurt. He hires Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and plans to sell off Chancellor Industries piece by piece, including Jabot Cosmetics. Adam’s father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) wins Jabot in a bidding war; Tucker refuses to hire Jill at Chancellor Industries. Katherine threatens to reveal Tucker's bribing of Alexander Thomas until she begins feeling guilty <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> off; an impressed Tucker puts a hold on the selling of her company. While Katherine and Tucker bond, he asks about his father, Arthur Hendricks (David Hedison), while Jill finds the information on Tucker and runs it in Restless Style magazine. Tucker and Katherine come to an agreement where she gets 51% of Chancellor Industries, but Tucker mistakenly believes Jill and Katherine were working together, and he promises to dismantle the company before their agreement comes into effect. Thanks to Jill, Tucker is investigated by the SEC while he bonds with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who is struggling with letting go of the child she thought was her daughter. Tucker supports her, much to the dismay of her boyfriend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), while he announces his plans to purchase Jabot for himself. Tucker blackmails Katherine into giving him back control of Jabot in exchange for him keeping quiet about Adam giving Victor access to the bids and he offers Ashley the CEO position.|$|E
