5|$|Reported {{details about}} the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes from {{the heat of the}} impact, {{presented}} a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth’s denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers <b>ablate</b> from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during atmospheric entry.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to <b>ablate</b> the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E

30|$|When PLD is {{performed}} in a low-pressure ambient atmosphere or under vacuum, <b>ablated</b> species simply move swiftly in a forward-directed distribution. On the other hand, in a high-pressure ambient atmosphere, <b>ablated</b> species jostle with ambient molecules, and the flight velocity gradually decreases due to collisions between the <b>ablated</b> species and ambient molecules, and finally, the <b>ablated</b> species cease to move. Therefore, {{a significant number of}} <b>ablated</b> species and ambient molecules are accumulated, resulting in the formation of high-density <b>ablated</b> species and high-density ambient molecules in the impedance region.

50|$|Although {{hatcheries}} in {{the developing}} countries still depend on wild seed, maturation can be induced by eyestalk ablation technique where eyestalks of females are unilaterally <b>ablated</b> to stimulate endocrine activity. The <b>ablated</b> females spawn after 4 days, with a peak observed at days 5-6. However it is expensive to raise spawners in captivity and <b>ablated</b> shrimps result in less hardy fry with low survival rate. Even though the fecundity of the <b>ablated</b> females may not differ significantly, the hatch rates of <b>ablated</b> females {{was found to be}} markedly less (37.8% to 58.1%) than that of unablated females (69.2%).

These procedures do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the breastbone) or cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine).

25|$|Laser {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (LDESI) {{mass spectrometry}} is an ambient ionization technique applicable to {{plant and animal}} tissue imaging, live-cell imaging, and most recently to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to <b>ablate</b> the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method is also good for imaging in applications. The analyses can be desorbed through a pulsed laser irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Nuckolls {{and several other}} weapons {{designers}} had developed {{the outlines of the}} ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly <b>ablate</b> when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum {{did not have to be}} heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1MJ beam. To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5kt releases 2 million MJ in total.|$|E

The live cornea has a thin layer removed therefrom, leaving an exposed internal surface thereon. Then, either the surface or thin layer is exposed to the laser beam along a predetermined pattern to <b>ablate</b> desired portions. The thin layer is then replaced onto the surface. Ablating a central area of the surface or thin layer makes the cornea less curved, while ablating an annular area spaced {{from the center of}} the surface or layer makes the cornea more curved.

2500|$|Appropriately {{applied with}} electro {{surgical}} forceps, desiccation and coagulation {{result in the}} occlusion of blood vessels and halting of bleeding. While the process is technically a process of electrocoagulation, the term [...] "electrocautery" [...] is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. The process of vaporization {{can be used to}} <b>ablate</b> tissue targets, or, by linear extension, used to transect or cut tissue. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high voltage current to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated. The continued application of current to this highly impedant tissue results in resistive heating and the achievement of very high temperatures - enough to cause breakdown of the organic molecules to sugars and even carbon, thus the dark textures from carbonization of tissue.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{unilateral}} {{eyestalk ablation}} on wild and pond-reared Penaeus monodon during ovarian maturation {{were determined by}} examining the growth (e. g., carapace length, body length, body weight) and reproductive (e. g., gonad weight, gonadosomatic index (GSI), average and maximum oocyte diameter) parameters to compare their reproductive potential.

The protein content of the unilateral eyestalk <b>ablated</b> (39. 81 ± 1. 83 %) crabs was higher than that of control crabs (36. 15 ± 1. 22 %).

The lipid content of {{the present study}} was higher in eyestalk <b>ablated</b> crabs (1. 81 ± 0. 03 %) rather than intact control crabs (1. 54 ± 0. 07 %). The ash content of eyestalk <b>ablated</b> crabs (7. 83 ± 1. 29 %) was relatively higher when compared to intact control crabs (7. 62 ± 0. 40 %). The moisture content in eyestalk <b>ablated</b> crabs (79. 15 ± 4. 58 %) was higher when compared to intact control crabs (78. 24 ± 3. 58 %).

2500|$|The {{space between}} the uranium fusion tamper (also termed pusher; both terms can be used interchangeably) which is the metal {{cladding}} encasing the secondary and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It {{is one of the}} most closely guarded secrets of a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary’s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the channel filler – an optical element used as a refractive medium, also called random-phase plate. This [...] "plate" [...] was a polystyrene plastic foam filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-Z plasma from the X-rays and tamped (not to be confused with the fusion tamper) the sputtering effect that choked the radiation from compressing the secondary. Sputtering is the manifestation of the underdense plasma corona of the ablating hohlraum and the tamper surfaces. It is a problem, also shared by magnetically confined fusion reactors (see Tokamak), that has to do with the ablated particles, the blown-off uranium (or Pb–Bi alloy, depending on the [...] "cocktail", or high-Z element mixture, of the hohlraum design to tailor its opacity), which fly inside the radiation channel and absorb radiation or reflect it, contributing negatively to the radiation mirroring (also termed [...] "ducting" [...] in the TN jargon). The re-emitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary’s tamper and <b>ablate</b> it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction. (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity. After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this radiative equilibrium must be reached together with the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the sparkplug (see below), hence their name equilibrium supers.|$|E
