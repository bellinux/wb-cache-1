40|$|This article {{comes up}} with a new concept of {{applying}} the difference between traction forces on front and rear wheelsets to guiding control, as well as the design of a new type of structurally simple asymmetrical radial bogies, which lead to the proposition <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> forces difference-steering asymmetric radial bogies. The traction forces difference-steering asymmetric radial bogies are referred to as TFDA-bogies, in which the difference of longitudinal creep forces between front and rear wheels produces radial steering of both wheelsets. The concept <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> difference is incorporated into guiding control and bogie structure is also simplified in the form of asymmetrical radial bogies. Angle sensors are mounted to facilitate the change of electric currents of the front and rear traction motors to control the guiding mechanism so that wheelsets can adopt the radial position. With SIMPACK, the multibody dynamics analysis software, three whole vehicle models of TFDA-bogies, radial bogies, and conventional bogies are set up and comparative analyses are made on the lead wheel <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, lead wheel lateral force, lead wheel friction power, and total vehicle friction power under idle running condition and traction condition, respectively.

40|$|Background Fibroblastic foci profusion on {{histopathology}} {{and severity}} <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis on highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) {{have been shown}} to be predictors of mortality in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between fibroblastic foci (FF) profusion and HRCT patterns in patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP). Methods The HRCT scans of 162 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of UIP or fibrotic NSIP (n[*]=[*] 162) were scored on extent of groundglass opacification, reticulation, honeycombing, emphysema and severity <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis. For each patient, a fibroblastic foci profusion score based on histopathologic appearances was assigned. Relationships between extent of fibroblastic foci and individual HRCT patterns were investigated using univariate correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression. Results Increasing extent of reticulation (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and increasing severity <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) were independently associated with increasing FF score within the entire cohort. Within individual multidisciplinary team diagnosis subgroups, the only significant independent association with FF score was severity <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) /UIP (n[*]=[*] 66, r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 19, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) (n[*]=[*] 49, r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 45, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Furthermore, FF score had the strongest association with severity <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis in patients with IPF (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 34, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and CHP (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 35, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). There was no correlation between FF score and severity <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis in patients with fibrotic NSIP. Global disease extent had the strongest association with severity <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis in patients with fibrotic NSIP (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 58, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Conclusion In patients with fibrotic lung disease, profusion of fibroblastic foci is strikingly related to the severity <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> bronchiectasis, particularly in IPF and CHP. This may explain the growing evidence that traction bronchiectasis is a predictor of mortality in several fibrotic lung diseases...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The article {{describes}} the most common methods for determining the locomotive traction force. Solving the tasks <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> calculations involves determination of the forces influencing the train at every point of the way. When choosing a rational trajectory of the train motion {{and the development of}} operational regulations of train driving it is necessary to determine the actual value <b>of</b> the locomotive <b>traction</b> force. Considering various factors, power value <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> electric motor <b>of</b> locomotive may have significant differences. Advancement of the operational definition system <b>of</b> the locomotive <b>traction</b> force during the calculations by electrical parameters <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> electric motor with regard to uneven load of wheel-motor block is the purpose of the article. Methodology. The method <b>of</b> determining the <b>traction</b> force <b>of</b> locomotives and diesel locomotives with electric transmission, which is based on primary data acquisition <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> electric engines <b>of</b> direct current behavior, was proposed.

40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> voltages and currents are {{the basis}} for assessing energy electromagnetic processes in systems <b>of</b> electric <b>traction,</b> in particular, DC.

Nonperiodic stochastic nature of the change of voltage and current calls for study of their spectral composition using probabilistic methods based on spectral correlation theory of random processes. The theoretical assumptions and the relations of connection of the energy spectrum of a random process with his correlating function are set out. The results of the numerical calculations of the spectra <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> voltages and currents actually operating electrical subsystems transport are given; they are: feeder voltage at the traction substation; currents in modes <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> and recuperation <b>of</b> electric locomotives in accordance with DE 1 and VL 8; the voltage on the current collector of the city tram.
