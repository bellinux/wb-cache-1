Male participants who graduated from an NVC-based batterer intervention program in California had zero percent recidivism within 5 years, according to the relevant District Attorneys' offices.

5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, <b>as</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Guam Department of Health; most were {{lacerations}} and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to {{the intensity of the}} storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 {{million tonnes}} of nickel are {{produced}} annually worldwide.

5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit.

5|$|Initially, Don {{failed to}} intensify {{significantly}} {{due to a}} misalignment between the lower and mid-level circulations. The wind shear in the region further exposed the circulation from the convection late on July28, although the winds increased slightly. Early on July29, Don attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) <b>as</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hurricane Hunters, and the storm maintained that intensity while moving across the Gulf of Mexico. As Don approached the Texas coast early on July30, the thunderstorms rapidly diminished due to the combination of wind shear, drier air, and cooler water temperatures just offshore. The winds decreased as the convection dissipated, and Don made landfall on Padre Island National Seashore as a tropical depression at 0230UTC on July30. About {{three and a half}} hours later, Don degenerated into a remnant low, and the circulation dissipated six hours after that.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{pressure}} {{also brought}} about a rapprochement between Hungary and Poland. Vladislaus met his four brothers, including John Albert and Sigismund, in Lőcse (now Levoča in Slovakia) in April 1494. They planned a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. However, John Albert wanted to strengthen Polish suzerainty over Moldavia and to dethrone Stephen in favour of Sigismund, which gave rise to new tensions between Poland and Hungary. Shortly after the conference, John Albert decided to launch a campaign against the Ottomans to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă. Fearing that the subjugation of Moldavia was John Albert's actual purpose, Stephen made several attempts to prevent his campaign. With Ivan III's support, he persuaded Alexander of Lithuania not to associate himself with John Albert. <b>As</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bychowiec Chronicle, the Lithuanian magnates also condemned the war, and simply refused to cross the Southern Bug.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{identify}} the reorganization of the defenses was a rare intelligence breakdown for the Allies. Post-action reports still documented the original estimate and assumed that the 352nd had been deployed to the coastal defenses by chance, a few days previously, {{as part of an}} anti-invasion exercise. The source of this inaccurate information came from German prisoners of war from the 352nd Infantry Division captured on D-Day <b>as</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 16th Infantry S-3 D-Day Action Report. In fact, Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4. This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army, but at that late stage in the operations, no plans were changed.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Isa was {{the first}} of eleven super-typhoons to occur during the 1997 Pacific typhoon season. The second {{tropical}} cyclone of the season, Isa developed from a disturbance in the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands on April 12. It moved erratically at first, though after attaining tropical storm status it curved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north. Isa very gradually intensified, and on April 20 the typhoon reached peak 1-min winds of 270km/h (165mph), <b>as</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Joint Typhoon Warning Center; Japan Meteorological Agency reported maximum 10-min winds of 155km/h (100mph).

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, the Arab {{attack was}} methodical: in 672–673 Arab fleets secured bases along {{the coasts of}} Asia Minor, and then {{proceeded}} to install a loose blockade around Constantinople. They used the peninsula of Cyzicus near {{the city as a}} base to spend the winter, and returned every spring to launch attacks against the city's fortifications. Finally, the Byzantines, under Emperor Constantine IV, managed to destroy the Arab navy using a new invention, the liquid incendiary substance known as Greek fire. The Arab land army in Asia Minor was also defeated by the Byzantines, forcing the Arabs to lift the siege. The Byzantine victory was of major importance for the survival of the Byzantine state, as the Arab threat receded for a time. A peace treaty was signed soon after, and following the outbreak of another Muslim civil war, the Byzantines even experienced a period of ascendancy over the Caliphate.|$|E
