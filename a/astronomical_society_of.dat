5|$|Kepler-5 has, as {{considered}} by the Kepler team, the potential {{for use in the}} study of planets in extreme conditions; its high temperature, large size, and short orbital period contribute to the aforementioned conditions. The findings of the Kepler team, which also included planets Kepler-4b, Kepler-6b, Kepler-7b, and Kepler-8b, were announced at the 215th meeting of the American <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> January 4, 2010.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Gascoigne {{developed}} a device, {{known as an}} optical corrector plate, which allowed wide field photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring. Such corrector plates were subsequently used on many telescopes and became known as Gascoigne correctors. During this period he was also active in supporting {{the establishment of a}} national research organisation for astronomers, the <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Australia. It held its first meeting in 1966, and Gascoigne was made its first vice-president.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union {{launched}} {{a process for}} giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Taphao Kaew for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Thai <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Thailand. Taphaokaeo {{was one of two}} sisters associated with a Thai folk tale.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{building}} a planetarium in Toronto date back to 1944, but serious planning only started in 1962, thanks to a bequest made by {{a former member of}} the Royal <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Canada (RASC). In May 1964 the Chairman and the President of the University of Toronto gave their support for the idea to the RASC, and suggested a site near the existing Royal Ontario Museum, adding that significant financial support would have to come from outside the University to make it possible.|$|E

5|$|Amateur Achievement Award winners {{receive a}} {{commemorative}} plaque, which is {{presented at the}} Annual Meeting Awards Banquet. The monetary value of the award is US$500. Candidates can be nominated by {{any member of the}} astronomical community (with the exception of the nominees themselves and their families) and the nominations should be accompanied by other letters of support. All the nominations have to be delivered to the <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific by December 15 of the nominating year and remain valid for three years. The winners are selected by the Awards Committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The committee have the right not to award any of the nominees if they do not consider their achievements exceptional enough, which has already happened several times.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Southern Africa in 2003 {{reported}} that observations {{of four of}} the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them—R and S Microscopii—are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, {{and the other two}} U and RY Microscopii are more difficult still. Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low metallicity. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the galactic halo of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens' Committee, a committee tasked with providing for the needs of the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892, Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.|$|E

25|$|The {{first issue}} of MNRAS was {{published}} on 9 February 1827 as Monthly Notices of the <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> London {{and it has been}} in continuous publication ever since. It took its current name from the second volume, after the <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> London became the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS). Until 1960 it carried the monthly notices of the RAS, at which time these were transferred to the newly established Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1960–1996) and then to its successor journal Astronomy & Geophysics (since 1997). Until 1965, MNRAS was published in-house by the society; from 1965-2012 it was published by Blackwell Publishing (later part of Wiley-Blackwell) on behalf of the RAS.
