5|$|Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India. Shastri and {{his senior}} cabinet members Morarji Desai and Gulzari Lal Nanda were strong {{supporters}} of Hindi being the sole official language. This increased the <b>apprehension</b> that Nehru's assurances of 1959 and 1963 {{would not be}} kept despite Shastri's assurances to the contrary. Concerns over the preference of Hindi in central government jobs, civil service examinations and the fear that English would be replaced with Hindi as medium of instruction brought students into the anti-Hindi imposition agitation camp in large numbers. On 7 March 1964, the chief minister of Madras State, M. Bhaktavatsalam at a session of the Madras Legislative Assembly recommended the introduction of Three-language formula (English, Hindi and Tamil) in the state. <b>Apprehension</b> over the Three-language formula increased student support for the anti-Hindi cause.|$|E
5|$|High Explosive Research was the British {{project to}} {{independently}} develop atomic bombs after the Second World War. This decision {{was taken by}} a cabinet sub-committee on 8 January 1947, in response to <b>apprehension</b> of an American return to isolationism, fears that Britain might lose its great power status, and the actions by the United States to unilaterally withdraw from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 Quebec Agreement. The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the militias}} that were then {{competing}} for power interpreted the UN troops' presence {{as a threat}} to their hegemony. Consequently, several gun battles took place in Mogadishu between local gunmen and peacekeepers. Among these was the Battle of Mogadishu of 1993, a US <b>apprehension</b> of two high-ranking lieutenants of faction leader Aidid. The UN soldiers eventually withdrew altogether from the country on 3 March 1995, having incurred more significant casualties.|$|E
5000|$|... 96.6 {{per cent}} of <b>apprehensions</b> by the Border Patrol in 2010 {{occurred}} at the southwest border. [...] The number of Border Patrol <b>apprehensions</b> declined 61% from 1,189,000 in 2005 to 723,840 in 2008 to 463,000 in 2010. The decrease in <b>apprehensions</b> {{may be due to}} a number of factors including changes in U.S. economic conditions and border enforcement efforts. Border <b>apprehensions</b> in 2010 were at their lowest level since 1972. In March 2017 there were 17,000 <b>apprehensions,</b> which was the fifth month in a row of decline.

40|$|We examine illegal {{immigration}} in the United States from Mexico {{over the period}} 1976 - 1995. One challenge {{is that we do}} not observe the number of individuals that attempt to enter the United States illegally; we only observe the number of individuals apprehended attempting to cross the U. S. -Mexico border illegally. Based on a simple migration model, we postulate the existence of an <b>apprehensions</b> function, which expresses <b>apprehensions</b> at the border as a function of illegal attempts to cross the border and U. S. border-enforcement effort. We estimate a reduced-form <b>apprehensions</b> function using monthly data on <b>apprehensions</b> at the U. S. -Mexico border, person hours the U. S. Border Patrol spends policing the border, and wages in the United States and Mexico. We find that a 10 % decrease in the Mexican real wage leads to a 7. 5 % to 8. 8 % increase in <b>apprehensions</b> at the border. Under plausible conditions this is a lower bound for the effect of the Mexican wage on attempted {{illegal immigration}}. It is the purchasing power of U. S. wages in Mexico, not the purchasing power of U. S. wages in the United States, that matters for border <b>apprehensions,</b> suggesting that migrants expect to maintain ties with Mexico. Border <b>apprehensions</b> are higher in the month following a large devaluation of the peso and higher when the change in the Mexican real wage is negative. Each additional hour the U. S. Border Patrol spends policing the border yields an additional 0. 25 to 0. 33 <b>apprehensions.</b> ...|$|R

The person who printed the pamphlet, Nikolai Olsen, was arrested on the same day, and the <b>apprehension</b> of Jon Hol followed on 10 February. He remained in custody until 26 February, and was indicted on 11 March, for lèse majesté. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Lars Holst were indicted on the same charge. Upon the arrests, the newspaper Verdens Gang noted that no conservative writers had been sanctioned, despite openly calling for a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} {{a nuclear}} weapons project, known as Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on nuclear weapons. In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an <b>apprehension</b> of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons. The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E

Though Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew attempt to provide for Sarek and have arranged for a chamber music concert for him, the ambassador expresses <b>apprehension</b> and annoyance.

5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and <b>apprehension,</b> the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E

Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her <b>apprehension</b> as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{there were}} 1,078,168 <b>apprehensions</b> {{made in the}} first year of Operation Wetback, with 170,000 being rounded up from May to July 1954. In addition, many illegal {{immigrants}} fled to Mexico fearing arrest; over half a million from Texas alone. The total number of <b>apprehensions</b> would fall to just 242,608 in 1955, and would continuously decline by year until 1962, when there was a slight rise in apprehended workers. Despite the decline in <b>apprehensions,</b> the total number of Border Patrol agents more than doubled to 1,692 by 1962, and an additional plane was also added to the force.|$|R
5|$|In the 1870 election, {{the first}} state in which blacks were allowed to vote, Stevenson warned that {{violence}} against them would not be tolerated. Although he relied on local authorities to suppress any incidents, he offered rewards for the <b>apprehension</b> of perpetrators of election-related violence. Stevenson also recommended that the carrying of concealed weapons be outlawed. The General Assembly passed the requested legislation on March 22, 1871. The law imposed small fines for the first offense, but the amount rapidly increased for subsequent infractions in order to deter repeat offenders.|$|E

The Coast Guard can {{be transferred to the}} Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. During World War I, Hispanics served in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and U.S. Life-Saving Service; and during World War II, Hispanics served aboard ships guarding the shores of the United States and the Atlantic Ocean against enemy submarines. However some men, such as Jose R. Zaragoza, served on missions on lonely atolls. Hispanics have served in every major conflict, and continue to do so. Coast guard service is not limited to armed conflicts with other nations; the Coast Guard also plays a vital role in the <b>apprehension</b> of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.|$|E
5|$|D'Oliveira was {{omitted from}} the England team for part of 1968 amid a slump in his batting form, but he marked his return in late August with a score of 158 runs in England's final Test match of the year, against Australia at The Oval. Days later, the MCC {{selectors}} omitted D'Oliveira from the team to tour South Africa; they insisted that this was based entirely on cricketing merit, but many in Britain voiced <b>apprehension</b> {{and there was a}} public outcry. After Tom Cartwright's withdrawal because of injury on 16 September, the MCC chose D'Oliveira as a replacement, prompting accusations from Vorster and other South African politicians that the selection was politically motivated. Attempts to find a compromise followed, but these led nowhere. The MCC announced the tour's cancellation on 24 September.|$|E
5|$|Henriksen {{was one of}} {{the several}} actors, {{including}} Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, cast in Aliens who had collaborated with James Cameron on The Terminator. Roz Kaveney, in her analysis of Ash in From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, draws parallels to Bishop as a representation of the Three Laws of Robotics. Although Ash's programming allows (and encourages) harming humans, Bishop puts human life above all else in accordance with the First Law of Robotics. Bishop was studied by LeiLani Nishime of the University of Texas Press in 2005 as a theoretical dramatization of how humans would deal with the presence of an Other, concerning Ripley's initial <b>apprehension</b> about being near a synthetic after her life-threatening encounter with Ash. According to an article by Anton Karl Kozlovic of the University of Nebraska Omaha, Bishop's altruistic actions (which include rescuing Newt and Ripley) contradict a trend towards technophobia in pre-1990 films.|$|E

5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} <b>apprehension.</b> The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of <b>apprehension</b> as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
