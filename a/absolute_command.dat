25|$|Pirates {{were mostly}} former {{merchant}} seamen, {{or at least}} men who had sailed on vessels legitimately before turning to piracy. As a result, a pirate ship still had the usual terminology found on merchant ships, but the role each ranking sailor would play on the pirate ship was not the norm. A pirate ship still had a Captain of the vessel. As the economist Peter Leeson argues, pirate captains were democratically elected by the entire crew. This was not a lifelong title and had less power than the merchant captain, as Leeson provides evidence of pirate captains being removed from the position, in one case thirteen captains were removed during one voyage, for not performing at the level that was expected of them or for overstepping their bounds of authority. The Pirate captain had <b>absolute</b> <b>command</b> when pursuing a vessel or in military engagements, otherwise he was {{another member of the}} crew.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{the annual}} change of consuls (the two Roman chief executives) began to {{adversely}} impact the consistent management of its armed forces, and to weaken their effectiveness, {{especially in the}} era following the Punic Wars. Eventually {{it led to the}} prolongation of military commands in the field; hence, Roman army generals became increasingly independent, and they led soldiers personally loyal to them. These military leaders began to acquire the ability to rule better than the ineffective civil institutions. In short, the civil power's political capabilities were not commensurate with the actual needs of the Roman state. As Rome's strength and reach increased, the political situation developed in which an <b>absolute</b> <b>command</b> structure imposed by military leaders at the top might, in the long run, in many cases be more successful and cause less chaos and hardship to the citizenry than the corrupt and incompetent rule by the oligarchy of quarreling old families who de facto controlled the government. Such was his purpose when the conservative Optimate, the noble and Roman general Sulla (138â€“78), seized state power by military force; yet he sought without permanent success to restore the Senate nobility to its former power.|$|E
500|$|When Rider Haggard first {{conceived}} of She he {{began with the}} theme of [...] "an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love". Although ostensibly a romance, the novel {{is part of the}} wider discourse regarding women and womanhood in late-Victorian Britain. Many scholars have noted how She was published as a book in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, and Adrienne Munich argues that Haggard's story [...] "could fittingly be considered an ominous literary monument to Victoria after fifty years of her reign". Indeed, in her devotion to Kallikrates (two thousand years after his death), Ayesha echoes the long-lasting fidelity of Victoria to her husband, Albert. However, unlike the [...] "benign" [...] Victoria, the question of female authority is realised to the extreme in the figure of She-who-must-be-obeyed, whose autonomous will seemingly embodies Victorian anti-feminist fears of New Women desiring 'absolute personal independence coupled with supreme power over men'. Haggard constantly emphasises this anxiety over female authority in She, so that even the rationally minded and misogynistic Holly, who has put his [...] "heart away from such vanity as woman's loveliness", ultimately falls upon his knees and worships Ayesha [...] "as never woman was worshipped". Similarly, although the masculine and chivalric Leo is determined to reject Ayesha for killing the devoted native girl Ustane, he too quickly falls under her will. In fact, Ayesha's <b>absolute</b> <b>command</b> over the male sex {{is one of the most}} startling and unnerving aspects of the story.|$|E

2500|$|With Irish Home Rule {{about to}} become law in 1914, the Cabinet were contemplating some form of {{military}} action against the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) who {{wanted no part of}} it, and who were seen by many officers as loyal British subjects. In response to the King's request for his views (the King had also written to the Prime Minister), French wrote (25 September 1913) that the army would obey [...] "the <b>absolute</b> <b>commands</b> of the King", but he warned that some might think [...] "that they were best serving their King and country either by refusing to march against the Ulstermen or by openly joining their ranks" [...] although he stressed that he wanted to act firmly against dissidents within the army. In December 1913, in his memorandum [...] "Position of the Army with Regard to the Situation in Ulster", French recommended that Captain Spender, who was openly assisting the UVF, be cashiered [...] "pour decourager les autres".|$|R

25|$|Propaganda notwithstanding, Amenemhet {{never held}} the <b>absolute</b> power <b>commanded</b> in theory by the Old Kingdom pharaohs. During the First Intermediate Period, the {{governors}} of the nomes of Egypt, nomarchs, gained considerable power. Their posts had become hereditary, and some nomarchs entered into marriage alliances with the nomarchs of neighboring nomes. To strengthen his position, Amenemhet required registration of land, modified nome borders, and appointed nomarchs directly when offices became vacant, but acquiesced to the nomarch system, probably in order to placate the nomarchs who supported his rule. This gave the Middle Kingdom a more feudal organization than Egypt had before or would have afterward.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the command}} of {{superior}} officers be very <b>absolute,</b> yet no <b>command</b> against {{the laws of nature}} is binding; so that a soldier, retaining his commission, ought to refuse to execute any barbarity, as if a soldier should be commanded to shoot a man passing by inoffensively, upon the street, no such command would exempt him from the punishment of murder.|$|R
60|$|For, on the whole, {{it is the}} lot of Chiefs everywhere, this same.

The proper name of all Kings is Minister, Servant. In no conceivable Government can a lay-figure get forward! This Worker, surely he above all others has to 'spread out his Gideon's Fleece,' and collect the monitions of Immensity; the poor Localities, as we said, and Parishes of Palace-yard or elsewhere, having no due monition in them. A Prime Minister, even here in England, who shall dare believe the heavenly omens, and address himself like a man and hero to the great dumb-struggling heart of England; and speak out for it, and act out for it, the God's-Justice it is writhing to get uttered and perishing for want of,--yes, he too will see awaken round him, in passionate burning all-defiant loyalty, the heart of England, and such a 'support' as no Division-List or Parliamentary Majority was ever yet known to yield a man! Here as there, now as then, he who can and dare trust the heavenly Immensities, all earthly Localities are subject to him. We will pray for such a Man and First-Lord;--yes, and far better, we will strive and incessantly make ready, each of us, to be worthy to serve and second such a First-Lord! We shall then {{be as good as}} sure of his arriving; sure of many things, let him arrive or not.|$|R

The earliest allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances {{is to be found}} in the Apostolical Constitutions (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an <b>absolute</b> fast is <b>commanded.</b> Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.|$|R

50|$|The king ruled for life, {{unlike any}} of his appointees. The kings of Joseon were all of the Jeonju Yi clan and notionally descended from Taejo, {{although}} some were adopted. For a list of Joseon kings, see List of Korean monarchs.

5|$|The Macedonian kings, who wielded <b>absolute</b> {{power and}} <b>commanded</b> state {{resources}} such as gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy.

The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by {{the institution of the}} army, while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies.|$|R

The natural disasters were thought to be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences. When there was severe drought or a series of disasters, the king often formally sought criticism from both the officials and citizenry, and whatever they said or wrote were protected from prosecution in such cases (although there were few exceptions).|$|R
