25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military <b>action</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

He was rated as the sixth most respected senator in a 1987 survey by fellow senators.

He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people. In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war. By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.|$|E

2500|$|In the Persian Gulf area, Iraq {{remained}} a problem. In June 1993 two U.S. Navy ships fired Tomahawk missiles against the headquarters building of Iraq's intelligence service in Baghdad {{in response to}} evidence of a plot to assassinate former President Bush {{during a visit to}} Kuwait. Aspin described the attack as a [...] "wake up call" [...] for Saddam Hussein. Two months later Aspin received a report on the U.S. military performance during the 1991 Gulf War, the result of a study undertaken by the House Armed Services Committee when he chaired it. The report concluded that the U.S. Central Command had greatly exaggerated damage done to Iraqi military equipment, such as tanks and naval vessels, by air strikes. Aspin also had to consider the question of health problems of U.S. service personnel who participated in the <b>action</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq.</b> He announced that a preliminary review disclosed no connection between chemical weapon agents and the reported health problems. Nevertheless, he formed a panel of outside experts to examine the issue further.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his second}} book, The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq (pub. 2002), Pollack details {{the history of}} United States <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> since the Persian Gulf War of 1991. He says that the United States should invade Iraq, and {{describes}} ways of going about it. Pollack argued that Saddam Hussein was simply too volatile and aggressive in his policies to be trusted not to begin another conflict in a volatile region. In The Threatening Storm, Pollack argued [...] "the only prudent and realistic course of action left to the United States is to mount a full-scale invasion of Iraq to smash the Iraqi armed forces, depose Saddam’s regime, and rid the country {{of weapons of mass}} destruction.” Pollack predicted, “It is unimaginable that the United States would have to contribute {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars.” Likewise, he wrote, “we should not exaggerate the danger of casualties among American troops. U.S. forces in Bosnia have not suffered a single casualty from hostile action because they have become so attentive and skillful at force protection.” ...|$|R

[...] He also praised Blair's [...] "heroic efforts" [...] in pushing for the so-called second resolution regarding the Iraq disarmament crisis, but lamented [...] "The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partner—not NATO, not the European Union and, now, not the Security Council". Cook's resignation speech in the House of Commons received an unprecedented standing ovation by fellow MPs, was described by the BBC's Andrew Marr as [...] "without doubt one of the most effective, brilliant resignation speeches in modern British politics." [...] Most unusually for the British parliament, Cook's speech was met with growing applause from all sides of the House and from the public gallery. According to The Economists obituary, that was the first speech ever to receive a standing ovation in the history of the House.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the ways}} in which U. S. policy toward Iraq was dictated by its broader Cold War strategy between 1958 and 1975. While most historians have focused on ‘hot’ Cold War conflicts such as Cuba, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, few have recognized Iraq’s significance as a Cold War battleground. This thesis shows where Iraq fits into the broader historiography of the Cold War in the Middle East. It argues that U. S. decisions and actions were designed to deny the Soviet Union influence over Iraq and a strategic base in the oil-rich Gulf region. This was evident in the Eisenhower administration’s response to Iraq’s revolution in 1958, when it engaged in covert action to prevent communists from gaining control of the state; in the Kennedy administration’s efforts to bolster the first Ba’th regime during its war with the Kurds in 1963 because it perceived it as anti-communist; in the Johnson administration’s support for the anti-communist, Arab nationalist regimes during the mid- 1960 s; and in the Nixon administration’s decision to support the Kurdish rebels in 1972 - 75 after the second Ba’thist regime drew Iraq partially into the Soviet orbit. This suggests a clear pattern. Using newly available primary sources and interviews, this thesis reveals new details on America’s decision-making toward and <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> during {{a key part of the}} Cold War. Significantly, it raises questions about widely held notions, such as the CIA’s alleged involvement in the 1963 Ba’thist coup and the theory that the U. S. sold out the Kurds in 1975. Finally, it argues scholars have relied excessively and uncritically on a leaked congressional report, the Pike Report, which has had a distorting affect on the historiography of U. S. -Iraqi relations. This thesis seeks to redress these historiographical deficiencies and bring new details to light...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} ten years {{beginning}} with the protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle 1999 there has been an intense wave of international activism not unlike the political activism of the late 1960 s. Unlike the 1960 s, however, grassroots organizations, social movements, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other civial society networks are forming large cross-border networks. They have launched international campaigns against neoliberal globalization, militarism, and war. Neoliberalism is an ideology that asserts that "free" markets, not states, should be the means by which most of society's resources are allocated. Those networks campaigning against neoliberalism and tis global effects, for example, privatization of public services, now have created their own political space, the World Social Forum (WSF). The WSF now attract up to 150, 000 participants to its meetings and, along with, regional and local social forums, has spread to all continents. The WSF, among other things, initiated the global day of <b>action</b> <b>against</b> the <b>Iraq</b> War in February 2003 which attracted 12, 000, 000 people in 800 cities worldwide. My powerpoint presentation will address three questions: 1) Why has the shift to global political activism occurred?, 2) What is the World Social Form?, 3) Why has it grown to massive proportions? I will use as case studies two Canadian NGOs, the Council of Canadians and Alternatives, a Quebec based NGO, and an India based NGO, the National Campaign On Dalit Human Rights (formerly "untouchables") which has become part of an extensive global network taking the cause of the Dalits beyond India...|$|R
