According to Amnesty International, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja suffered fractures of the jaw and head and bruising of the arms during his first month in detention, allegedly as a result of torture.

5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>in</b> a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|In season 10, Cristina {{decides to}} accept a job to run {{a state of the}} art clinic in Switzerland. Owen {{supports}} her decision as he realizes no good could come from him asking her to stay, but requests her not to leave him until she has to leave him for good, following which, they both spend two weeks leading to her permanent departure together. While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>in</b> the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} of a {{coronary}} stent is typically attributed to Jacques Puel and Ulrich Sigwart when they implanted a stent into <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>in</b> Toulouse, France in 1986. It {{was used as a}} scaffold to prevent the vessel from closing and to avoid restenosis in coronary surgery—a condition where scar tissue grows within the stent and interferes with vascular flow. Shortly thereafter in 1987, Julio Palmaz (known for patenting a balloon-expandable stent) and Richard Schatz implanted their similar stent into <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>in</b> Germany. The use of these bare-metal stents helped reduce the incidence of restenosis from 30–40% in coronary surgery to 20–30%.|$|E

40|$|There is rich {{theoretical}} {{literature that}} cites {{the importance of}} the therapist’s use of self as a way of knowing, especially <b>in</b> cases where <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> has been severely traumatized in early life. There is limited empirical research that explores the in-session experience of therapists working with traumatized <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> order to support these claims. This study employed a qualitative design to explore a therapist’s internal experience when <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> dissociates <b>in</b> session. The aim {{of this study was to}} further develop the theoretical construct of dissociative attunement to explain the way that therapist and <b>patient</b> engage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nonverbal process of synchronicity that has the potential to communicate dissociated images, affect or somatosensory experiences by way of the therapist’s internal experience. Findings revealed that therapists have strong emotional and behavioral responses to <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> dissociation <b>in</b> session, which include anxiety, feelings of aloneness, retreat into one’s own subjectivity and alternating patterns of hyperarousal and mutual dissociation. Findings also revealed that the process of dissociative attunement is at play when <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> dissociates <b>in</b> session. The process of dissociative attunement was comprised of seven component parts: Disjunction and Connection, Perception of Nonverbal Cues, Induced Feeling, Therapist as Placeholder, Asymmetry of Roles and Responsibility in the Dyad, Containment, and Therapist Imaginings. Findings imply that <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> dissociation <b>in</b> session should be considered an interpersonal phenomenon that holds the potential to communicate important aspects of the patient’s affective experience and needs through examination of the therapist’s internal experiences...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples {{of the use of}} an unreliable narrator in film is the German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, from 1920.
