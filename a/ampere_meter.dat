50|$|An ammeter (from <b>Ampere</b> <b>Meter)</b> is a {{measuring}} instrument {{used to measure}} the current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in amperes (A), hence the name. Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated as milliammeters or microammeters. Early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the Earth's magnetic field for operation. By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in electric power systems.|$|E

The coefficients have been cast into a normalized form and presented in two sets of twelve charts which allow loop locations of constant effectiveness to be visualized. The charts provide contours in normalized space along which different loops will provide the same derivative coefficient per ampere turn or per <b>ampere</b> <b>meter</b> for a general point relative to the coil.

40|$|Abstract. A test {{methodology}} for rheological behaviors of MR greases based on double rotational coaxial cylinder shear mode {{is presented in}} this paper. Both flow velocity profiles and shear stress profiles of MR greases in shear channels are analytically explored. The theory relationship between shear stress acted on MR greases and transmission torques is established, an approximate algorithm is put forwarded to acquire nominal shear stresses by transmission torques. On the basis of differential equation and its rational boundary conditions from stress equilibrium of MR greases micro-unit, an approximate corresponding algorithm is worked out for nominal shear strain rates by rotor angular velocities. The relationship between average value of magnetic flux density in annular channels and excitation electrical currents are experimentally obtained.

50|$|IEEE 1902.1 RuBee uses {{magnetic}} waves also often called inductive communication. James Clerk Maxwell presented his now famous set of equations (Maxwell's Equations) to the Royal Society in 1864. These equations describe {{what happens when}} an electron travels along a conductive wire. Two fields are created, the Electric Field, labeled E, and the Magnetic Field, labeled H. These electric and magnetic fields travel through the aether, (i.e. outer space or the far field), {{at the speed of}} light with an assumed impedance of 377 Ω. E, the electric field, may be given in newtons per coulomb or volts per meter, and H, the magnetic field, may be given in gauss or <b>amperes</b> per <b>meter.</b> The two fields are tied together with the aether to form simple electric circuit capable of transferring power. However, when these two fields are measured in what is called the near field (much less than the wavelength of the signal) very strange things happen. (Also see Capps “Near Field or Far Field"). E and H are no longer connected in a simple predictable manner. The value of c (speed of light) and the resistance of the aether are altered and it is possible to produce large H values with low E values. It is as if the aether impedance has been reduced to only a few ohms.|$|R
