40|$|In the UK {{there is}} {{considerable}} interest in using GPS-Disciplined Oscillators (GPSDOs) <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> traceable to UTC(NPL). However, UK accreditation bodies are somewhat reluctant to accept GPSDOs <b>as</b> traceable <b>standards,</b> without a detailed study of the practical issues involved in establishing traceability. NPL has undertaken an extensive study, examining the performance of 15 GPSDOs loaned by 11 UK suppliers and manufacturers, to address this traceability issue. In this paper a detailed account is presented of the results obtained from the NPL study. A preliminary set of recommendations {{on the use of}} GPSDOs <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> traceable to UTC(NPL) have been produced. The progress made on implementing a mechanism enabling GPSDOs to be recognized <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> traceable to UTC(NPL) is outlined. ...|$|R

5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came <b>as</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths).

At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E
