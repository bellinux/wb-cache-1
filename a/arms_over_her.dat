25|$|Twist lifts are {{a form of}} pair lifts, {{where the}} lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady is caught by her waist {{in the air and}} lands on the {{backward}} outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, delayed rotation, etc.|$|E
60|$|ANNA--[Taking {{one of his}} <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.] Come on in the cabin. You {{can have}} my bed if there ain't no other place.|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled {{hair from her}} forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young Spaniard; she crossed her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Catherine, {{why are you}} crying, love?' I asked, {{approaching}} {{and putting}} my <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. 'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse.' ...|$|R

60|$|He {{smiled at}} her and put his <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. Together they walked up the golden arcade to tell the others. That night Charlotte and Ellen cried with {{happiness}} as they talked it over in the twilight.|$|R
60|$|When {{she could}} lie still {{she turned away}} from him, still mute. And he lay with his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> motionless. Noises went on, in the street, {{overhead}} in the work-room. But theirs was complete silence.|$|E
6000|$|... [An interval. She spasmodically flings her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> son and [...] daughter, {{lets them}} fall, and becomes unconscious. They fetch a [...] looking-glass, {{and find that}} her {{breathing}} has ceased. The clock [...] of the Chateau strikes noon. The scene is veiled.] ...|$|E
60|$|Helena {{could not}} keep still; her body was full of strange sensations, of {{involuntary}} recoil from shock. She was tired, but restless. All the time Siegmund lay with his hot <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> himself so incomprehensible in his base of blue, open-eyed slumber, she grew more breathless and unbearable to herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "You bet I do!" [...] he returned, {{and then}} put his <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} and kissed her gently. [...] "Well, let us hope it all comes out for the best," [...] he added, and walked off to go to work.|$|R
50|$|In both Hinduism and Buddhism {{the goddess}} is always {{placed on the}} left side of the male deity, where she 'sits on his left thigh, while her lord places his left <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> left {{shoulder}} and dallies with her left breast'.|$|R
5000|$|Cuddle, (also called Wrap Position or Sweetheart’s Wrap): The gent {{wraps his}} right arm around the lady’s waist; she wraps her left arm around her front to hold his right hand. She wraps <b>her</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> left <b>arm</b> and across her front to hold his left hand. Hands are at waist level.|$|R
6000|$|She {{laid her}} cigar aside like Amelius, and crossed her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> bosom, {{and looked at}} him, with the first {{softening}} gleam of tenderness {{that he had seen}} in her face. [...] "My friend," [...] she said, [...] "yours will be a sad life--I pity you. The world will wound that sensitive heart of yours; the world will trample on that generous nature. One of these days, perhaps, you will be a wretch like me. No more of that. Get up; I have something to show you." ...|$|E
6000|$|But her martyrdom {{was over}} at last. The {{minister}} {{appeared in the}} pulpit and Peg subsided into silence. She folded her bare, floury <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast and fastened her black eyes on the young preacher. Her behaviour for the next half-hour was decorum itself, save that when the minister prayed that we might all be charitable in judgment Peg ejaculated [...] "Amen" [...] several times, loudly and forcibly, somewhat to the discomfiture of the Young man, to whom Peg was a stranger. He opened his eyes, glanced at our pew in a startled way, then collected himself and went on.|$|E
60|$|Never shall I {{forget the}} look of horror which came in Mme. la Marquise's eyes {{when she saw me}} {{entering}} our miserable attic {{in the company of a}} stranger. The last of the little bit of tallow candle flickered in its socket. Madame threw her emaciated <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> child, just like some poor hunted animal defending its young. I could almost hear the cry of terror which died down in her throat ere it reached her lips. But then, monsieur, to see the light of hope gradually illuminating her pale, wan face as the stranger took her hand and spoke to her--oh! so gently and so kindly--was a sight which filled my poor, half-broken heart with joy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm awful tired. It's awful cold. My feet hurt awfully. Carl dear, oh, pleassssse {{take me home}} now. I want my mamma. Maybe she won't whip me now. It's so dark and--ohhhhhh----" [...] She muttered, incoherently: [...] "There! By the road! He's {{waiting for}} us!" [...] She sank down, <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, groaning, [...] "Don't hurt me!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{tightened}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> bosom, and she laughed to herself--a hard, harsh, angry laugh.|$|R
50|$|The Jumpin' Joe is a swing dance move {{adaptation}}, {{invented in}} 2007 in Ventura, California. It {{can be used}} as an adaptation on the Princess Dip or the Pretzel. It was meant for leads who may be shorter than their partner. Instead of struggling to swing their following partner's <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> own head, he may jump as she does so, thus executing the Jumpin' Joe.|$|R
6000|$|The superb {{success of}} this last {{offering}} excited Teddy to such a degree, that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration, and before it had time even to roast, he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre. Of course {{she did not like}} it, and expressed her anguish and resentment in a way that terrified her infant destroyer. Being covered with kid, she did not blaze, but did what was worse, she squirmed. First one leg curled up, then the other, in a very awful and lifelike manner; next she flung her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head as if in great agony; her head itself turned on her shoulders, her glass eyes fell out, and with one final writhe of her whole body, she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins of the town. This unexpected demonstration startled every one and frightened Teddy half out of his little wits. He looked, then screamed and fled toward the house, roaring [...] "Marmar" [...] {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|E
5000|$|In some twists, {{the lady}} {{performs}} a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is [...] "at least 45° {{from the body}} axis and her legs are straight or almost straight." [...] Other variations which may increase the score include steps or other skating moves going into the twist, delayed rotation, or the lady holding her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{even smaller}} panels each depict a female figure with a halo on a plain golden background, with {{cypresses}} {{on either side}} of them, symbolising the Garden of Eden. According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of [...] "η αλιθηα" [...] (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and [...] "η ταινοσις" [...] (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility). Sincerity holds a cross in one hand and points to her mouth, while Humility crosses her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> chest.|$|E
5000|$|Medvedeva {{commonly}} performs {{some of her}} jumps with an <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, {{a technique}} called the [...] "Tano" [...] variation, a position first popularized by Brian Boitano {{as part of his}} triple lutz jump. She performs several jump combinations ending with a triple toe loop, such as the 3F-3T, 3S-3T, 3Lz-3T, 3Lo-3T, and 2A-3T. She is also known for practicing various triple-triple-triple jump combinations.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} round in his chair, and saw Clariss {{sitting at the}} feet of Julia, with one white <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> friend's knee. Jim {{immediately}} stuck forward his muzzle and gazed at her. Clariss had loosened her masses of thick, auburn hair, so that it hung half free. Her face was creamy pale, her upper lip lifted with odd pathos! She had rose-rubies in her ears.|$|R
6000|$|She stopped breathlessly, {{stared at}} his face with her former {{intensity}} as if she would pluck the thought that followed from his brain. But he only moved closer to <b>her,</b> passed his <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders with a movement so natural and protecting {{that it had a}} certain dignity in it, and, looking down upon her bent head with eyes brimming with sympathy, whispered, [...] "Poor, poor child!" ...|$|R
50|$|Twist lifts are {{a form of}} pair lifts, {{where the}} lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady is caught by her waist {{in the air and}} lands on the {{backward}} outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, delayed rotation, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Dec {{found it}} very {{frustrating}} when the callers could not get the answer right (while sometimes also submitting guesses that didn't rhyme), and would sometimes throw the toy and the stand it was placed on in (mock) anger, or ranting into the camera, which became a staple occurrence and sparked his catchphrase for the game, [...] "It's Gotta Rhyme!". The hosts' continued frustration led to them filming a pre-recorded round of the game, with an answer of [...] "Pat Cat" [...] (the clue being host Cat Deeley rubbing her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> back). The fictional contestant {{made a number of}} unrelated guesses, including constantly repeating [...] "Feely Deeley" [...] even when informed it was incorrect numerous times.|$|E
5000|$|A twist lift, {{an element}} {{found only in}} pair skating, is a move that begins with the man {{assisting}} the lady in an Axel or toe-assisted jump where she rotates and is caught mid-air by the man, who then places her down back on the ice. In some twists, the lady performs a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is [...] "at least 45° from the body axis and her legs are straight or almost straight." [...] A few pairs perform a nearly 180° degree split before rotating. A pair may also achieve a higher score with a difficult entrance, delayed rotation, or if the lady holds her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head while rotating.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Coat of Arms of Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester {{who is a}} heraldic heiress. Depicting <b>her</b> father's <b>arms</b> imposed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> husband's (Richard, Duke of Gloucester).|$|R
60|$|She freed herself quietly {{from his}} <b>arm,</b> and spoke <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Barbara gave <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> and <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} threw a swift {{smile at}} Mrs. Noel, {{who did not}} answer it, but stood looking quietly after them, her eyes immensely dark and large.|$|R
5000|$|Maekawa {{is another}} of Makoto's classmates who is very tall for a girl (she claims to be 179.9 cm tall) and always refers to Makoto as 'transfer student' as she can never get his name right. She later says that its kind of {{embarrassing}} for her {{to change the way}} she addresses Makoto(It is hinted that she has feelings for Makoto). She is very calm and sometimes expressionless perhaps due to having a weak body and sometimes amuses herself by teasing Ryūko. She gets dizzy if she raises her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head for more than ten seconds, and often wears various costumes. Her parents own a bar in the shopping district and she has several part-time jobs. She insists on wearing cosplay to work even when her supervisor insists her not to.|$|E
5000|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colin Tilley, and premiered on March 24, 2011. In the video, Brown {{plays the role of}} a mechanic. It begins with Hilson lying down with Brown on top of her as he caresses her and they clasp hands. The video then cuts to images of Hilson straddling Brown. As the song's first verse starts, however, they are in separate scenes: Hilson, sporting a black fur coat, is {{standing in the middle of}} a dark and smoky street, while Brown, in overalls and a tank top, is underneath a car in an auto garage. Midway through the clip, the two intertwine at an industrial warehouse in matching black outfits and sunglasses. A tag-team dance then ensues. After they both pirouette and dip and dive, Brown towers over Hilson and swings his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> as she ducks. She then raises up and swings her arms over Brown, who leans back to avoid Hilson's movements in slowed-down [...] "bullet time" [...] action.|$|E
5000|$|Adams {{appeared}} on stage at two months old {{in the play}} The Lost Baby at Brigham Young Theatre. [...] She appeared again {{at the age of}} nine months in her mother's <b>arms.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>her</b> father's objections, Adams began acting as a small child, adopting her mother's maiden name as her stage name. They toured throughout the western U.S. with a theatrical troupe that played in rural areas, mining towns and some cities. At the age of five, Adams starred in a San Francisco theater as [...] "Little Schneider" [...] in Fritz, Our German Cousin and as [...] "Adrienne Renaud" [...] in A Celebrated Case. She debuted in New York at age ten in Esmeralda and then returned to California. Adams later wrote a short essay, [...] "The One I Knew Least", where she described her difficulty in discovering her own personality while playing so many theatrical roles as a child. She briefly returned to Salt Lake City, where she lived with her grandmother and studied at the Salt Lake Collegiate Institute.|$|E
60|$|Coming to a clear, rapid stream, {{the warriors}} {{dismounted}} and rested while their horses drank thirstily {{of the cool}} water. An Indian touched Isaac on the arm and silently pointed toward the huge maple tree under which Thundercloud and Myeerah were sitting. Isaac turned his horse and rode the short distance intervening. When he got near he saw that Myeerah stood with one <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> pony's neck. She raised eyes that were weary and sad, which yet held a lofty and noble resolve.|$|R
60|$|She drew Jeanette out, leaving Thyra rocking Damaris in <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and crooning <b>over</b> <b>her</b> like {{a mother}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say at once, Clive!" [...] the Campaigner cried, {{rising in}} her might, and {{extending}} a great strong <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> helpless child, [...] "that Colonel Newcome owns {{that he has}} gone to live as a pauper in a hospital! He who has squandered his own money. He who has squandered my money. He who has squandered the money of that darling helpless child--compose yourself, Rosey my love!--has completed the disgrace of the family, by his present mean and unworthy--yes, I say, mean and unworthy and degraded conduct. Oh, my child, my blessed child! to think that your husband's father should {{have come to a}} workhouse!" [...] Whilst this maternal agony bursts <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> Rosa, on the sofa, bleats and whimpers amongst the faded chintz cushions.|$|R
