5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon {{found that it was}} an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E

25|$|In addition, women's pain {{tends to}} be treated less seriously and {{initially}} ignored by clinicians when compared to their treatment of men's pain complaints. Historically, women have not {{been included in the}} design or practice of clinical trials, which has slowed the understanding of women's reactions to medications and created a research gap. This has led to post-approval adverse events among women, resulting in several drugs being pulled from the market. However, the clinical research industry is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> and has made progress in correcting it.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in March 1964, Radio Caroline was {{the first}} in what became an {{eventual}} fleet of 10 offshore pirate radio stations that began to ring the British coastline, mostly along the South East coast. By 1966 millions were tuning into these commercial operations, and the BBC was rapidly losing its radio listening audience. This was largely {{due to the fact that}} even though they were fully <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> the BBC still only played a few hours of Pop music from record a week, as opposed to the pirates who broadcast chart music and new releases all day.|$|E
25|$|While {{owned by}} Jenista the {{aircraft}} {{was destroyed in}} an accident on 11 June 1994 at the Jean Airport in Jean, Nevada. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the pilot did not properly connect the aileron control linkage when the aircraft was assembled for flight and then did not detect the fault during the preflight inspection. The pilot become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> on take-off on aerotow. The pilot released from the tow plane at about , the right wing collided with {{the ground and the}} glider crashed resulting in minor injury to the pilot. The aircraft was not repaired and was removed from the Federal Aviation Administration registry on 29 April 1995.|$|E

One might think that this character speaks for the author.|$|R
25|$|Flying faster {{means that}} the {{aircraft}} passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, {{reducing the number of}} rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines basically double the speed and altitude of conventional designs, so limiting the number of shells that the chance of hitting the bomber essentially dropped to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were keenly <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> and expecting to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns.|$|E
25|$|There were exceptions, of course. The {{first person}} known to {{publicly}} {{address this issue}} was Bob Bemer, who had noticed it in 1958 {{as a result of}} work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, IBM, the government of the United States and the ISO <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL PICTURE clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates. Despite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, Erik Naggum was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 1916, {{when the}} central span was being raised into position, it {{fell into the}} river, killing 13 workers. The chief {{engineer}} was made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> six weeks before the collapse by the engineer that {{was responsible for the}} construction of the centre section, Frants Lichtenberg. Frants Lichtenberg was also working as an inspector for the federal government of Canada at the time. Immediately, fears of German sabotage were reported but it was soon clear that another tragic construction accident had befallen the structure (a problem with the hoisting devices). Re-construction began almost immediately after the accident and special permission granted for the bridge builders to acquire the steel that was in high demand because of the War effort. The fallen central span still lies {{at the bottom of the}} river. After the bridge's completion in 1917, special passes were required for those wanting to cross the structure. Armed soldiers, and later Dominion Police, guarded the structure and checked passes until the end of the War.|$|E

25|$|In May 1777, de Coudray and {{his entourage}} of 18 {{officers}} and 10 sergeants reached America. At this time Americans were becoming <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of accepting foreign adventurers into their ranks. Some foreign officers proved valuable to the American cause, while others were not useful. For example, Matthias Alexis Roche de Fermoy and Frederick William, Baron de Woedtke proved to be failures as combat generals. Because du Coudray had been promised the rank of major general, Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, and John Sullivan vowed to resign if the Frenchman was promoted over their heads. Anxious not to offend France, Congress invented the title Inspector General of Ordnance and Military Manufactories for de Coudray but made sure {{that he had no}} authority over the combat generals. The freshly-minted Inspector General promptly began quarreling with other French officers such as the capable engineer Louis Lebègue Duportail and involved himself in intrigues. One Frenchman noted that de Coudray's arrogance offended the Congress and damaged relations between the American colonies and France. De Coudray even managed to anger Gilbert Motier, marquis de La Fayette. Finally, on 16 September 1777 de Coudray stupidly rode his horse onto a Schuylkill River ferryboat and the skittish animal leaped overboard, drowning its rider.|$|E

500|$|Morrowinds soundtrack was {{composed}} by Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose previous soundtracks for Total Annihilation and Icewind Dale had earned some acclaim from the gaming press.

Outside Bethesda press releases, some have criticized Morrowinds soundtrack. In their reviews of the game, both GameSpot and GameSpy criticized {{the length of the}} game's soundtrack and praised its general production quality. In the words of GameSpot's Greg Kasavin: [...] "The very first time you boot up Morrowind, you'll be treated to a memorable, stirring theme filled with soaring strings and booming percussion. You'll proceed to hear it literally every five minutes or so during play." [...] Soule was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> and chose to create a soft and minimalist score so as not to wear out players' ears.|$|E
