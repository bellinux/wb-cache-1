5|$|In early November 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy {{selected}} Critchfield to be {{head of the}} Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. McElroy {{hoped that}} Critchfield {{would be able to}} fix the nation's trouble missile program, but Critchfield was reluctant to serve at the director's $19,000 salary. McElroy then offered to let Critchfield serve without pay, with the government paying only his expenses of $15 per day, while allowing Critchfield to continue to draw his Convair salary of around $40,000. Critchfield accepted this offer, but ran into a storm of political and media criticism over the conflict of interest involved in heading <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> did $4 million worth of business with Convair each year. Critchfield then withdrew his name from consideration.|$|E
5|$|The Ministries of Japan (行政機関) {{consist of}} eleven {{ministries}} and the Cabinet Office. Each ministry {{is headed by}} a Minister of State, which are mainly senior legislators, and are appointed from {{among the members of}} the Cabinet by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office, formally headed by the Prime Minister, is <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> handles the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. The ministries are the most influential part of the daily-exercised executive power, and since few ministers serve {{for more than a year}} or so necessary to grab hold of the organisation, most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats.|$|E

25|$|The pace of {{building}} was slower than expected, {{partly because of}} a lack of funds and partly because of a dispute between Griffin and Federal government bureaucrats. Many of Griffin's design ideas were attacked by both the architectural profession and the press. In 1917 a Royal Commission determined that they had undermined Griffin's authority by supplying him with false data which he had used to carry out his work. Ultimately, Griffin resigned from the Canberra design project in December 1920 when he discovered that several of these bureaucrats had been appointed to <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> would oversee Canberra's construction. The Commonwealth Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Hughes had removed Griffin as director of construction at Canberra after disagreements over his supervisory role, and in 1921 created the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, with John Sulman as chair. Griffin was offered membership, but declined and withdrew from further activity in Canberra.|$|E

25|$|Fascists {{promoted}} {{social welfare}} to ameliorate economic conditions affecting their nation or {{race as a}} whole, {{but they did not}} support social welfare for egalitarian reasons towards those not considered racially embodied with pure German blood. Under an extensive welfare system, over 17 million Germans obtain assistance under the control of National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> had “projected a powerful image of caring and support”. The NSV had grown to the second largest Nazi group organization by 1939, dwarfed only by the German Labor Front. The NSV and its Winter Aid and Strength Through Joy provided evidence to the German citizenry that the National Socialists were keeping their promise to create “an organic national community” where “class conflict and social antagonisms would be overcome” and the “egoism of the individual” would instead surrender to the “overriding interests of the whole”. These programs were designed to “obliterate distinctions of class and status” and enhance the lives of the ordinary people. Fascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak and they instead promoted social Darwinist views.|$|E
25|$|As World War II ended, the United States had {{to decide}} what to do with regard to its Intelligence structure. Not wanting to relive another Pearl Harbor, and with the growing threat of the Cold War, the United States decided to {{establish}} an Intelligence agency that operated continually rather than only during times of war and conflict. The National Security Act of 1947 (signed by President Harry S. Truman on July 26, 1947) implemented a permanent, non-military, Intelligence agency called the Central Intelligence Agency, <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> evolved out of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The CIA was not to be part of the military command structure, nor was it to have a domestic role or police power and was to be under the control of the newly established position of Director of Central Intelligence. In addition to creating the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Act of 1947 established the United States National Security Council (NSC). The National Security Council was composed of the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (now titled, Director of Central Intelligence), and other key members to advise the President on national security and foreign policy matters.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} receive {{payments}} for hospice patients under Medicare or Medicaid, a hospice must be certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and in 2007 93.1% were.

For one example, <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> is entirely supported through donations or relies on volunteer staff might not choose to seek certification.

500|$|Three {{modes of}} {{critical}} {{response to the}} Final Destination franchise have predominated. First, it has been framed as a postmodern horror franchise, one which, {{in the style of}} the Scream franchise, self-consciously refers to the history of horror cinema and rewards viewers for their knowledge. Second, the films have been examined for their visual effects. This is particularly true of The Final Destination (2009) and Final Destination 5 (2011). Third, the franchise has been criticized for being cynical and reductive. For example, the film studies scholar Reynold Humphries dismisses the franchise as [...] "obscurantist nonsense whose only 'idea' is that death is <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> has a 'plan' for each of us".|$|E
500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} who deal with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not just watching people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds are very important to their characterizations and who they are. I really am interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people from all these different backgrounds find their place in the FBI, <b>an</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E
