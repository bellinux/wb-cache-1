5|$|As {{part of its}} planned <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> Allbritton Communications, Sinclair {{originally}} planned to sell its existing stations in three markets – Charleston, South Carolina, Birmingham, Alabama and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania – where Allbritton already owned stations, but continue to operate them under local marketing agreements. WABM and WTTO in Birmingham and WHP-TV in Harrisburg were {{to be sold to}} Deerfield Media, and WMMP in Charleston was to be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings – a broadcasting company owned by conservative pundit Armstrong Williams. Howard Stirk Holdings was also used as a sidecar for two conflicting stations in Sinclair's earlier <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> Barrington Broadcasting.|$|E

40|$|We {{compare the}} wealth effects of {{acquiring}} assets from a divesting firm (i. e., <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> divested assets) with the <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> an entire organization (i. e., <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> non-divested targets) abroad. We hypothesize {{that the ability}} to select the most valuable assets and leave the unwanted ones behind affords bidders greater flexibility in <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> assets as opposed to <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> non-divested targets. We apply event study methodology on a sample of 2137 cross-border M&As from 1986 to 2009 to test our hypothesis. Consistent with our proposition, we find that bidders fare better in <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> divested assets. Our various market-based measures of performance are overwhelmingly in favor of these kinds of acquirers. Consistent with the wealth effects, we also find that the cost of capital charged to buyers of divisions/subsidiaries/assets of an organization is lower compared to buyers of whole/parent corporations abroad. Overall, our findings suggest that bidders who {{are in a position to}} bid for specific divisions or subsidiaries or assets of a foreign corporation rather than acquire the whole corporation can extract larger benefit...|$|R

40|$|We {{test the}} {{implications}} of the Misvaluation hypothesis (Shleifer and Vishny, 2003) for a large sample of acquirers of private and public target firms. Consistent with the Misvaluation hypothesis we find that acquirers are overvalued. The overvaluation is higher for stock <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> private targets. We find that the announcement period returns are lower for firms that are overvalued at the time <b>of</b> <b>acquisition.</b> Announcement period returns are lower for larger <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> public targets and higher for larger <b>acquisitions</b> <b>of</b> private targets. We also examine the factors that determine stock as the method of payment. Consistent with the Misvaluation hypothesis we find that firms that have higher valuation measures at the time <b>of</b> <b>acquisition</b> tend to use stock. Acquirers of public targets tend to use stock more frequently...|$|R
