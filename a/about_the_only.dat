However, he resumed training and was declared fit for the Netherlands opening match against Czech Republic, where he started on the bench. His introduction brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> goal of the match – a penalty scored the 89th minute. Ronald de Boer was adjudged to have had his shirt pulled whilst jumping to meet Overmars' cross. In the quarter-finals, he scored twice in the team's 6–1 win against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands went on to lose their semi-final to Italy on penalties. Overmars played in eight of the national team's ten 2002 World Cup qualifiers, {{but it was an}} unsuccessful campaign as they failed to qualify for the finals.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Alliance {{under its}} new leader Stockwell Day {{presented}} a further challenge to McDonough's NDP. Fearful of {{the prospect of}} an Alliance government, many NDP supporters moved to the Liberals. As well, two NDP MPs, Rick Laliberte and Angela Vautour, crossed the floor to other party caucuses, reducing the NDP caucus to 19 seats. In the 2000 federal election, the NDP was held to just 13 seats, and its 8.5 percent of the popular vote, was near its historic low from the 1993 campaign. <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> solace the NDP and McDonough could take from the 2000 campaign was that they were at least able to maintain official party status in the House of Commons (if only barely), unlike McLaughlin in the 1993 campaign.|$|E
25|$|In 1780, the Spanish {{established}} two combination {{missions and}} pueblos at the Yuma Crossing: Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicuñer and Mission Puerto de Purísima Concepción. Both these pueblos and missions {{were on the}} California side of the Colorado River but were administered by the Arizona authorities. On July 17–18, 1781 the Yuma (Quechan) Indians, in a dispute with the Spanish, destroyed both missions and pueblos—killing 103 soldiers, colonists, and Friars and capturing about 80 prisoners, mostly women and children. In four well-supported punitive expeditions in 1782 and 1783 against the Quechans, the Spanish managed to gather their dead and ransom nearly all the prisoners, but failed to re-open the Anza Trail. The Yuma Crossing was closed for Spanish traffic and it would stay closed until about 1846. California was nearly isolated again from land based travel. <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way into California from Mexico would now be a 40- to 60-day voyage by sea. The average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824 meant that additional colonists coming to Alta California were few and far between.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a Social Security {{number for}} a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal {{requirement}} that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want or have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes are to join a religion that {{does not believe in}} insurance, such as the Amish, Christian Science or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.|$|E

25|$|The {{track laying}} was divided up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|E

500|$|Poitou donkey and mule breeders were {{extremely}} protective of their breeding practices, {{some of which}} were [...] "highly unusual and misguided." [...] Jacks were kept in closed-in stalls throughout the year once they had begun covering mares, in often unhygienic conditions. Once the mares had been covered, a folk belief held that if they were underfed, they would produce colts, which were more valuable, rather than fillies. This often led to mares being starved during their pregnancies. Colostrum, vital for foal development, was considered unhealthy and withheld from newborns. A lack of breeding records resulted in fertility problems, and there was a significant amount of foal mortality, due to jacks being used to cover horse mares before jennies of their own kind, resulting in late-born foals that were vulnerable to cold fall and winter temperatures. Despite these husbandry issues, one author, writing in 1883, stated that [...] "mule-breeding is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> branch of agricultural industry in which France has no rival abroad, owing its prosperity entirely to the zeal of those engaged in it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Communist Party of Albania (known as the Party of Labour of Albania after 1948) {{was founded}} in November 1941 {{in the context of}} the foreign {{occupation}} of the country, with the majority of its members including its leader, Enver Hoxha, having no connection to the Comintern. Historian Jon Halliday has commented that [...] "it was set up without any known direct contact with Moscow. It was not at all a 'Moscow creation'... the bulk of the founding leadership were middle-class intellectuals on whom the strongest influences were Western intellectual traditions." [...] Albania furthermore was the only country in Eastern Europe which had liberated itself without the presence of the Red Army on its soil. A combination of these factors led Stalin to initially have been [...] "both curious and suspicious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> leader of a Communist regime in the Soviet bloc who escaped from any historical ties or contact with the Soviet Union." [...] This, Halliday continues, [...] "was true not just of Hoxha as an individual, but of almost the entire leading group in Albania." [...] Despite this, however, Hoxha was [...] "the quintessential Stalinist. Many of the descriptions Nikita Khrushchev used to denounce Josef Stalin... could easily be applied to Enver Hoxha." ...|$|E

Slant Magazine writer Eric Henderson opined, [...] "But just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> element of the whole album that really sticks is the Laura Bush-worthy domestic complacency of 'Cater 2 U,' in which the trio espouses their joy in total submission." [...] Dimitri Ehrlich from Vibe magazine found that [...] "the sexy trio is far more believable on the seductive R ballad 'Cater 2 U,' in which they set the feminist movement back more than a century over the course of four minutes". Andy Battaglia writing for The A.V.

In a review of Love Songs, Amanda Koellner from the website Consequence of Sound described [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] as a [...] "sleek" [...] album opener.

[...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him {{the kind of man}} characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
