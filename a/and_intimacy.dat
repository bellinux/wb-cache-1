5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, <b>and</b> <b>intimacy.</b> The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} {{and quality of}} emotional <b>intimacy</b> <b>and</b> sexual <b>intimacy</b> are fundamental to both men?s and women?s relationship functioning. However, previous studies suggest that gender differences exist in men?s and women?s experiences sexual <b>and</b> emotional <b>intimacy.</b> Although these differences cannot be presumed to apply to all men and women, acknowledging and understanding their existence can prove useful to appreciating the role and impact of emotional <b>and</b> sexual <b>intimacy</b> in couples. The present study used differential item functioning (DIF), an IRT-based statistical framework, to explore gender differences in dissatisfaction with sexual <b>intimacy</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>intimacy</b> (1) across the continuum of relationship distress, and (2) within each domain, respectively. Data were provided by husbands and wives (N = 2, 038) from {{a representative sample of}} community couples who completed the Marital Satisfaction Inventory ? Revised (MSI-R). IRT-based DIF analyses revealed significant gender differences, suggesting that men and women differ in their experience and reports of dissatisfaction with sexual <b>intimacy</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>intimacy</b> across the continuum of relationship distress, as well within the respective domains of sexual <b>and</b> emotional <b>intimacy.</b> Although nuanced, understanding these differences provides further insight into men?s and women?s experience of relationship distress across the entire spectrum of relationship distress, and can be used in improving the assessment, prevention, and treatment of sources of couple distress...|$|R

5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry <b>and</b> <b>intimacy</b> such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E

5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance <b>and</b> <b>intimacy,</b> between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

5|$|Velázquez's {{portrait}} is {{a staging}} {{of a private}} moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep <b>and</b> <b>intimacy</b> found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery {{or any of the}} goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres, Manet, and Baudry, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although the pose has been painted by many later artists. Manet, in his stark female portrayal Olympia, paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess. Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the role of}} the mother-daughter relationship on the daughter‟s development of the capacity for intimacy with a romantic partner. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine whether separateness in mother-daughter interactions was related to romantic <b>intimacy</b> (sexual <b>and</b> non-sexual <b>intimacy)</b> in romantic relationships. The following instruments were used: 1) Socio-demographic questionnaire; 2) Competence in Mother-Daughter Relationship Questionnaire (ICQ-M) and 3) Personal Assessment of Intimacy Questionnaire (PAIR). 179 adolescent female university students participated in this study most of who were between the ages of 20 and 24. The results indicated that a positive relationship existed between separateness <b>and</b> sexual <b>intimacy</b> (r=. 688, p<. 01) as well as separateness <b>and</b> non-sexual <b>intimacy</b> (r=. 598, p<. 01). A positive relationship between connectedness <b>and</b> non-sexual <b>intimacy</b> (r=. 468, p<. 01) was also observed, however no correlation was observed between connectedness <b>and</b> sexual <b>intimacy.</b> These findings indicate that separateness in mother-daughter interactions has a definite effect on the different dimensions of romantic intimacy. Therefore, late adolescent women who possess the ability to assert themselves and express differences between themselves and their mothers are not as apprehensive as their peers when it comes to romantic intimacy with a partner...|$|R

25|$|This {{relationship}} between distance <b>and</b> <b>intimacy,</b> between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence to The Wind Will Carry Us. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence, through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking {{of time and space}} in the modern world of telecommunications.|$|E

The first cast read-through occurred at Bloomsbury Central Baptist Church in London on 7 August 2012. Principal photography began on interior sets at Vision Studios on 13 August 2012. Location shooting began the first week of September. Most location photography occurred in the town of Clevedon. Some scenes were also shot in the towns of Bridport and West Bay, and in the surrounding district of west Dorset. Three locations were used in the area around Yate, South Gloucestershire, and two in Bristol. Other filming locations included Shepton Mallet, Portishead, and Weston-super-Mare, and the villages of Eype and Flax Bourton. The oft-seen cliff where Danny Latimer's body is found, and which features heavily in the visuals of Broadchurch, is Harbour Cliff and Harbour Cliff Beach in West Bay.

25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love <b>and</b> <b>intimacy.</b> Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E
