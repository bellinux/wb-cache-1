40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} the system access problem for CDMA networks where the access channels are nonorthogonal to the traffic channels. In such systems, <b>the</b> <b>accessing</b> user can degrade {{the performance of}} existing users by introducing extra interference. We study how transmit power should be varied with each successive access attempt so that the linear combination of average power expended and the average delay experienced by <b>the</b> <b>accessing</b> user is minimized. The harm caused by <b>the</b> <b>accessing</b> user to <b>the</b> existing communication links is also considered. We find that for all cost functions we consider, {{the absence of an}} access deadline implies that each access attempt should be made at some constant power. With an imposed access deadline we find that the optimum sequence of transmit powers can be determined recursively. ...|$|R

5|$|Fragments of {{the west}} range – the cellarer's range – are extant.

The largest surviving fragment of the range comprises a cellarium or storehouse where supplies were kept. It is a vaulted undercroft of nine bays constructed from stone ashlar with its floor level below that of the cloister.

5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of <b>accessing</b> <b>the</b> unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E
