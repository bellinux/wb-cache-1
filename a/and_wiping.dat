5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E
5|$|In early June, {{plans were}} made for the Australian 2nd Division to attack around Morlancourt in {{preparation}} for a more significant attack at Hamel. On 10 June, the battalion advanced on the right of the 7th Brigade's line, capturing the German front line trenches around Morlancourt <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out a whole battalion, taking 325 prisoners for the loss of 400 men. On 4 July the battalion undertook a supporting role in the successful Australian attack at Hamel, following up the initial success with a further, albeit small, advance on 8 July. After the German offensive petered out, the 27th Battalion undertook peaceful penetration operations against the German line as the Allies began to prepare to launch their own offensive.|$|E
5|$|The male wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male will enter the female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The Courtship process consists of the male bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> them over his body. The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E

25|$|In December 2014, Buhari {{pledged to}} enhance {{security}} in Nigeria, {{if he wins}} the general elections on 14 February 2015, which were later rescheduled for 28 March 2015. Since this announcement, Buhari's approval ratings reportedly have skyrocketed amongst the Nigerian people (largely due to the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan's apparent inability to fight Boko Haram's brutal insurgency). Buhari has now made internal security <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out the militant group {{one of the key}} pillars of his campaigning.|$|E

25|$|In {{the weeks}} before the 2016 election, Frank uses ICO as a pretext to {{enacting}} martial law in urban areas and consolidating polling places in key states. Done mainly through back channels with Democratic governors, this is officially done {{in the name of}} safety, but in practice disenfranchises rural Republican voters. To keep the strategy of fear going, Doug blackmails hacker Aidan Macallan into launching a massive cyberattack on the NSA, slowing down Internet traffic <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out hundreds of thousands of files. The Underwood Administration pins the attack on ICO.|$|E
25|$|New York City {{publishes a}} guide for {{property}} owners and tenants, entitled Preventing Rats on Your Property: A Guide for Property Owners and Tenants, that discusses how the Health Department inspects for rats, and how to control rats, including looking for evidence, cleaning up, starving them, shutting them out, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> them out. The guide covers the use of traps, rat poison, and wire mesh {{at the base of}} trees, as well as the new rules for garbage pickup, with landlords bringing out garbage in the morning immediately prior to pickup rather than the night before. Rodent baiting is suggested as an effective approach to wiping out rats.|$|E
25|$|The Iranians struck {{south-east}} of Sulaymaniyah {{where they}} easily defeated {{most of the}} Iraqi defenders because Saddam Hussein left them to defend even the most exposed positions. After the Iranians had defeated the Iraqi forces at the front lines, they advanced quickly. However, the Iraqis launched a counter-attack during the Iranian advance. The Iraqi soldiers involved in the counter-attack were ambushed by the Iranians and most Iraqi troops were slaughtered. Victory {{seemed to be in}} the hands of Iranians as they reached Sulaymaniyah but they failed to capture it. The Iranians also came dangerously close to Iraq's Darbandikhan reservoir. The Iraqis responded by launching 720 chemical artillery rockets and 200 chemical artillery shells which resulted in the Iranian 55th parachute division taking heavy losses <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out of the 84th infantry division, forcing the Iranians to call off the offensive.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to de-tect camera cuts <b>and</b> <b>wipes.</b> The approach projects a video into two images representing the spatio-tempoml continuity of a video life. Visually, these images are composed by regions of diferent patterns, each region represents the temporal location of a shot. The shape of a region boundary inherently classifies cut <b>and</b> <b>wipe,</b> <b>and</b> most importantly, marks the start and end of a wipe sequence. We hence formulate algorithms to lo-cate the color and texture discontinuities occurring at the boundaries of image regions. Keywords spatio-temporal image segmentation, camera cut <b>and</b> <b>wipe</b> detection. ...|$|R

25|$|In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of {{gripping}} {{the blade of}} their knife between thumb and forefinger <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing their hand from handle {{to the tip of}} the knife. This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream. Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities, such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from their targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in Scream 2, in regards to defeating two trained detectives single-handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving blunt trauma, stabbing wounds and gunshots. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior.|$|E
25|$|Three 11-year-old boys rode {{their bikes}} {{into the west}} parking lot to {{purchase}} soft drinks. Hearing {{a member of the}} public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled looking toward his two friends, Omarr Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and had started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty next noticed an elderly couple, Miguel Victoria Ulloa (74) and Aida Velazquez Victoria (69), walking toward the entrance. As Miguel reached to open the door for his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aida with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported that he had seen Miguel cradling his wife in his arms <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> blood from her face. Miguel shouted curses at Huberty, who approached and killed him with a shot to the head.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E

[...] In Wings of Liberty Zeratul's investigation into the Hybrids reveals that Amon's coming has been foretold; initially, he is described as [...] "one who shall break the cycle of the gods." [...] On Zhakul, Amon's role in the Ulan prophecy is further elaborated on, and it is here that he is first referred to as the [...] "fallen one." [...] After arriving on Aiur to retrieve the surviving memories from the remains of the Overmind, Zeratul encounters the spirit of Tassadar; from both beings Zeratul gains a glimpse into one possible future in which the Overmind foresaw Amon successfully employ his hybrids and the Zerg to annihilate the Protoss before turning on <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out the Zerg. In this future, Amon taunted the Protoss by revealing Kerrigan to be the only one in a position to oppose him.|$|E

2500|$|American {{military}} forces gradually solidified this defensive {{position on the}} southeast side of the Korean peninsula, dubbed the [...] "Pusan Perimeter". Walker received reinforcements, including the Provisional Marine Brigade, which he used along with the Army's 27th Infantry Regiment as [...] "fire brigades," [...] reliable troops who specialized in counterattacking <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out enemy penetrations. As more reinforcements arrived, the combat advantage shifted toward the United Nations forces. North Korean forces had suffered terribly and their supply lines were under constant aerial bombardment. Almost all of their Russian-made T-34 tanks, which spearheaded the invasion, had been destroyed. Walker ordered local counterattacks while planning for a large-scale breakout in conjunction with MacArthur's Inchon landing in September.|$|E

2500|$|Tuttle {{immediately}} {{decided to}} take {{a leading role in the}} movement to start a new city on the Miami River, but knew that a decent transportation (in that time, a railroad) was necessary to attract development. Tuttle tried to induce Henry Flagler to extend his railroad to Fort Dallas (Miami), and offered to divide her large real estate holdings if he would do this. She wrote numerous letters to Flagler in this connection and finally made the trip to St. Augustine and in person repeated her offer. [...] Her efforts were of no avail at that time; however, providence favored Tuttle. The great freeze on 1894-1895 devastated the old orange belt of central and northern Florida, destroying valuable groves <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out fortunes overnight.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the game, the map of Stilwater is fully visible. However, shops and activities will simply be displayed as a question mark until the player discovers them. By completing missions <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> out enemy strongholds the player gains control of the various neighborhoods the city is split into. There are over 130 interiors within the city, and hidden events can be triggered by some, including over ninety shops which can be purchased when the player controls each shops' associated territory. The player gets a 10% discount at owned stores and buying an entire chain of departments will mean that the protagonist's face appears on in-game billboard advertisements. The game shares technology with that of , another Volition-developed game and so certain elements of the environment are fully destructible. A number of Easter eggs are placed within the sandbox, including the pop-out Easter Bunny which won [...] "Top Easter Egg of 2008".|$|E
