5|$|Brett {{follows the}} crew's cat, Jones, into an engine {{room and the}} now fully-grown alien (Bolaji Badejo) attacks him and disappears with his body into an <b>air</b> <b>shaft.</b> After heated discussion, the crew decide the {{creature}} {{must be in the}} air ducts. Dallas enters the ducts, intending to force the alien into the airlock, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the others to abandon ship and escape in its small shuttle. Now in command, Ripley explains that the shuttle will not support four people and pushes to continue with Dallas' plan of flushing out the alien.|$|E
5|$|To {{get out of}} the <b>air</b> <b>shaft,</b> SpongeBob molds Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs into a {{battering}} ram to {{bust out}} the shaft, and he finally makes it out, only to find that all the customers have left after waiting for so long without getting any food. However, SpongeBob summons them all back as he sings a song in honor of the Krusty Krab to the tune of O Tannenbaum. Meanwhile, Plankton finally finds the perfect opportunity to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. He fails, having been caught by Mr. Krabs. The eleventy-seventh anniversary celebration then goes ahead.|$|E
5000|$|In the Folk Music Encyclopedia, Kristin Baggelaar and Donald Milton wrote [...] "The Gaslight {{was weird}} then {{because there were}} <b>air</b> <b>shafts</b> up to the apartments and {{the windows of the}} Gaslight would open into the <b>air</b> <b>shafts,</b> so when people would applaud, the neighbors would get {{disturbed}} and call the police. So then the audience couldn't applaud; they had to snap their fingers instead." ...|$|R

In another attack on the communications building next to the Tigris River, another GBU-27 Paveway III was dropped through an <b>air</b> <b>shaft</b> {{in the center of the}} roof atop the building and blew out all four walls.|$|E
25|$|The {{general and}} six {{officers}} made a daring escape on November 27 by tunneling from an <b>air</b> <b>shaft</b> beneath their cells into the prison yard and scaling the walls. Only two of Morgan's men were recaptured, {{and he and}} the rest soon returned to the South. Morgan was killed {{less than a year}} later in Greeneville, Tennessee by a Union cavalryman after refusing to halt while attempting to escape.|$|E
25|$|Reid {{finally took}} his own chance to escape {{on the night of}} 14/15 October 1942, along with Major Ronald Littledale, Lieutenant Commander William L. Stephens RNVR, and Flight Lieutenant Howard Wardle RAF. They cut through the bars on a window in the prisoner's kitchen, and climbed out onto the flat roof of the German kitchen. They then crossed the brightly lit outer yard, and avoided being seen by a guard. They entered a storage cellar under the Kommandantur (Commandant's HQ), crawled out through a narrow <b>air</b> <b>shaft</b> leading to the dry moat, and exited through the park. They split into pairs, with Reid and Wardle {{disguised}} as Flemish workmen travelling by train to Tuttlingen, near the Swiss border, via Zwickau and Munich. They crossed the border near Ramsen on the evening of 18 October. Stephens and Littledale also travelled to Tuttlingen by train, via Chemnitz, Nuremberg and Stuttgart, then followed Reid and Wardle across the border {{in the early hours of}} 20 October.|$|E

25|$|In The Empire Strikes Back, Vader becomes {{obsessed with}} finding Luke and leads the Imperial {{attack on the}} Rebel base on Hoth, but the Rebels escape. While conversing with the Emperor, Vader convinces him that Luke would be {{valuable}} to the Empire if he could be turned {{to the dark side}} of the Force. Vader hires a group of bounty hunters to follow Luke and his friends, and negotiates with Bespin administrator Lando Calrissian to set a trap for them so that Luke will follow them. After Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO arrive, Vader tortures Han, freezes him in carbonite and gives him to bounty hunter Boba Fett. When Luke arrives, Vader defeats Luke in a lightsaber duel, severing his opponent's hand. Vader then tells Luke that he is his father and asks Luke to help him overthrow the Emperor so they can rule the galaxy together. Horrified, Luke escapes through an <b>air</b> <b>shaft.</b> Vader telepathically tells Luke that it is his destiny to join the dark side.|$|E
500|$|The Memorial {{consists}} of two distinct architectural elements, linked by a terrace of Purbeck stone. A black rectangular creeper-covered enclosure surrounds the <b>air</b> <b>shaft,</b> forming a single block. The northern face of the enclosure is kept free of creepers, and is inscribed with the police badge of office and the text [...] "The National Police Memorial: Honouring Those Who Serve". This face also includes a vitrine in which the Roll of Honour is displayed.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes {{episodes in}} the novel {{retained}} in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's [...] "escape" [...] from his cell via the <b>air</b> <b>shaft,</b> for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities would recur in subsequent Bond films.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the great}} issues in {{apartment}} design {{at the turn of}} the century was the disposition of the courts - often reduced to mere <b>air</b> <b>shafts.</b> But because of its size, Graham Court could have a courtyard shared with no other building.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} five <b>air</b> <b>shafts,</b> two of which have nearby service {{galleries}} leading off horizontally to the cliffs which were used to dump spoil while carving out the tunnels, the <b>air</b> <b>shafts</b> were capped in 1958. The southern half of the tunnel is considerably damp with the tunnel being flooded to about 6 inches on the southern 300 yards. The southern portal of the Sandsend tunnel is bricked up and it can only be accessed via the northern portal of the Kettleness tunnel by walking through the Kettleness tunnel and the area between the tunnels which is overgrown with grass and trees. The northern portal of the Sandsend tunnel partially collapsed in 2008 after years of pressure from the cliff above.|$|R
50|$|It {{was opened}} in 1796. Its {{construction}} was delayed by soil movement {{and it was}} probably the resulting movement that led to the tunnel having a slight 'S' bend. There is room for two 7 ft (2.13 m) beam boats to pass. There are three <b>air</b> <b>shafts</b> along its length.|$|R
500|$|The scenes {{set at the}} {{software}} company Eurisko were filmed in Burnaby's Metrotower complex, a building used by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. The location was barely big enough for the actors to perform in after the crew had finished setting up the necessary equipment. The scene with Dana Scully shooting the fan in the <b>air</b> <b>shaft</b> was a last minute change to the script, replacing an elevator shaft sequence that was deemed too expensive. The episode's title is taken from {{the title of the}} book The Ghost in the Machine by Arthur Koestler. The Central Operating System and its actions in the episode are an homage to ’s HAL 9000, who—due to conflicted programming—also became confused and killed people. The X-Files team would once again face a malevolent AI in the William Gibson-penned fifth season episode [...] "Kill Switch".|$|E
500|$|Han and {{the others}} go to Cloud City on the planet Bespin to obtain help from Han's friend Lando Calrissian (Mort), [...] "the only black guy in the galaxy", only to {{be turned over to}} Darth Vader. Han willingly reveals the {{location}} of Luke and the Rebel base but is tortured by being forced to listen to Paula Cole's [...] "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?", as punishment for clogging a toilet on the 16th floor of Cloud City, which forced Vader to use the [...] "little pig people's" [...] bathroom. Han is used to test a carbon freezing chamber Vader intends to use on Luke {{to take him to the}} Emperor. Leia professes her love to Han, but Han tells her to [...] "fuck off" [...] and is then frozen in carbonite for posterity. Lando later double-crosses the Empire, freeing Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO, motivating the guards with a pizza party. Despite R2-D2 having sex with the combination lock, and subsequently being discovered by her husband, to get the door open, they are too late to stop Boba Fett from flying off with Han. Luke arrives at Cloud City and, after being briefly interrupted by Ryan Seacrest on American Idol, engages Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader cuts off Luke's right hand. With Luke cornered and defenseless, Vader goads Luke to join the dark side, revealing that he is his father. Luke casts himself into an <b>air</b> <b>shaft</b> and, after discovering that a worker has shoved his severed hand down his pants, ends up hanging on an antenna beneath the city, calling out to Ben, Leia, and Tom Selleck. Leia senses Luke's call from within the Millennium Falcon and has him rescued. On board a Nebulon-B frigate, Luke is fitted with an artificial hand, but told to practice masturbating with a hot dog first. Lando, dressed in Han's clothes, sets off with Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon to rescue Han. Luke angrily protests the story's ambiguous ending, but then he receives a letter from Doc Brown, a reference to the ending of Back to the Future Part II.|$|E
2500|$|After {{arriving}} at Cloud City, {{and engaging in}} a brief confrontation with Boba Fett, Luke encounters Vader, and the two engage in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central <b>air</b> <b>shaft.</b> [...] As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for Vader, who severs Luke's right hand, causing him to lose his weapon. After Luke refuses to join Vader against the Emperor, Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father. [...] Humiliated, and horrified by the truth, Luke intentionally falls off the bridge and is pulled into an <b>air</b> <b>shaft.</b> [...] He is ejected beneath the floating city, but is able to grab onto an antenna. He makes a desperate telepathic plea to Leia, who senses it and persuades Lando to return {{for him in the}} Falcon. After Luke is brought on board, they are chased by TIE fighters but R2-D2 reactivates the Falcons hyperdrive, allowing them to escape.|$|E
5000|$|The Great Central Main Line {{from the}} north of England to [...] {{was built in the}} 1890s. It passed through {{the eastern edge of the}} parish in the 2997 yd Catesby Tunnel, which was started in 1895 and {{completed}} in 1897. One of the tunnel's five <b>air</b> <b>shafts</b> is in Hellidon parish.|$|R
50|$|The {{subterranean}} caverns were adequately ventilated by <b>air</b> <b>shafts.</b> Fireplaces in the cellars {{were connected}} to house chimneys. Smoke could be seen by enemies, emanating from seemingly empty houses, making the town resemble a ghost town. Znojmo inhabitants could survive {{for a long time}} in refuge due to the presence of wells and a drainage system in the catacombs.|$|R
2500|$|Between 2009–2014 {{thirteen}} ventilation shafts {{were scheduled}} to be revamped. [...] In the first phase, during tranche1 the <b>air</b> <b>shafts</b> for replacement were Drayton Park, Gillingham Street, Moreton Terrace, Pulross Road, Somerleyton Road and Tynemouth Road. [...] In tranche2 for the second phase were scheduled those at Cobourg Street, Dover Street, Gibson Square, Great Titchfield Street, Isledon Road, Kings Cross, Palace Street and Rita Road.|$|R

Another group of six men was led by Pacifico [...] "Joe" [...] Stella of Pittston. Amedeo Pancotti {{was part of the}} second group, and for his {{remarkable}} climb out of the Eagle <b>Air</b> <b>Shaft</b> (the only exit available) to the surface, he was awarded the Carnegie Medal for Heroism from the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.|$|E
2500|$|Nyle {{returns home}} and {{presents}} {{himself to his}} wife without his wig or contacts and tries torturously to explain his inner pain to her before crushing her head. Meanwhile, Elena makes her torturous escape from the Aboria Institute, encountering a zombie-like [...] "mutant" [...] which attempts to eat her in an <b>air</b> <b>shaft</b> {{as well as an}} entire room full of Sentionauts, who are suspended immobile in a large, factory-like chamber. Nyle, having dissolved his final contact to the material world, collects a ceremonial dagger he calls [...] "The Devil's Tear-Drop", and heads out in pursuit of Elena. While chasing her through the woods surrounding the Institute, he encounters a pair of [...] "heshers", who he kills with his dagger after insisting one of them had sex with Elena.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, the Pi Kappa Alphas held {{a reunion}} at Stimson house, {{which they had}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "Red Castle." [...] They found the iron-gated wine cellar just as it was when errant pledges (and UCLA prisoners) were locked inside and sprayed with a hose. [...] Memories flowed as the fraternity brothers gathered at the house, one recalling his proposal to his wife on the stairs of the house, and another recalling pelting a pledge with eggs from the same staircase, only to discover that the pledge was allergic to eggs—paramedics had to be called when his eyes swelled closed. [...] One of the returning fraternity members recalled that, as a pledge, he crawled through an <b>air</b> <b>shaft</b> to escape from the catacombs and, covered with soot, appeared at the door of a neighbor [...] asking if he might use the phone—the neighbor being Mrs. Doheny who later bought Stimson House to rid herself of the Pi Kappa Alphas.|$|E
