5000|$|<b>A</b> rolling <b>recession,</b> or <b>a</b> rolling {{adjustment}} <b>recession</b> {{occurs when the}} recession only affects certain {{sectors of the economy}} at a time.

On <b>a</b> whole, rolling <b>recessions</b> occurs regardless of nationwide or statewide economic recession and the effects may not be in the national economic measures e.g. GDP (Gross Domestic Product).

40|$|M. Comm. (Financial Economics) The term {{structure}} of interest rates, particularly the term spread determined from {{the difference between}} ten-year government bond yields and three-month Treasury bill yields, has received increased attention as a valuable forecasting tool {{for the purposes of}} monetary policy and recession forecasting. This is {{on the back of the}} observed positive relationship between term spread and economic activity. Moreover, the term spread has been observed to invert prior to the occurrence of economic recessions both in developed and developing countries. This study investigated the forecasting ability of the South African (S. A.) term spread in predicting S. <b>A.</b> <b>recessions,</b> taking into account the recent global economic recession. The reason behind the investigation is due to the forecasting consistencies illustrated by the term spread in providing statistically incorrect signals of recession in 2003, which did not transit into reality. It implied a weak relationship between the S. A. term spread and economic activity. Moreover, based on observations from the literature that term spreads and economic activities across countries are correlated, the term spreads of China, United States (U. S.) and Germany were investigated and compared to the S. A. term spread, to determine which better forecasts S. <b>A.</b> <b>recessions.</b> The study employed the Dynamic Probit Model, since it is considered to provide a better predictive edge over the Traditional Static Probit model. The findings revealed that the S. A. term spread accurately predicted all the S. <b>A</b> <b>recessions</b> since 1980; Chinese term spread accurately predicted the 1996 and 2008 S. A recessions; U. S. term spread predicted some recessions; while German term spread predictions were countercyclical...|$|R
5|$|The 1687 {{earthquake}} {{marked a}} turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in trade, a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires. To add to these problems, on October 28, 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco. This disaster led to an intense devotion for an image of Christ called The Lord of the Miracles, which has been taken out in procession every October since 1746.|$|E

5|$|After initial {{rises in}} opinion polls {{following}} Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined {{with the onset}} of <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in 2008, leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. A year later, Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931, making the Conservatives the largest party in a hung parliament. Brown remained in office as Labour negotiated to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. On 10 May 2010, Brown announced he would stand down as leader of the Labour Party, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. Labour's attempts to retain power failed and on 11 May, he officially resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, and as Leader of the Labour Party by Ed Miliband.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from <b>a</b> <b>recession,</b> from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> {{following}} the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined.

And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in <b>a</b> <b>recession,</b> due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been possible. In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901.
