40|$|Background Availability is an {{important}} predictor of early and excessive alcohol consumption by adolescents. Many countries have implemented <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> to prevent underage purchases of alcohol. However, shop-floor compliance with these <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> appears to be problematic. This study addresses the issue of non-compliance with <b>age</b> <b>limits.</b> Which measures do vendors take to avoid underage alcohol sales, {{and what do they}} report as important reasons to comply or not with <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> for alcohol sales? Methods Open-ended telephone interviews were conducted with store managers selling alcohol (N = 106). Prior to the interviews, all outlets were visited by an underage mystery shopper in order to measure compliance with the legal <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> on alcohol sales. The interview results are compared against actual compliance rates. Results Several measures have been taken to prevent underage sales, but the compliance level is low. Furthermore, open coding resulted in 19 themes, representing both valid and invalid arguments, that vendors mentioned as relevant to their decisions of whether to comply with the law. Compliance with <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> is dependent on the knowledge of the rules and the ability and motivation to follow the rules. The ability aspect in particular seems to be problematic, but in many cases, the motivation to actively comply with the <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> is lacking. Conclusions To enhance compliance, it is important to raise the awareness of the importance of <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> and to connect possible violations of the regulations to negative consequence...|$|R

5|$|The ages of {{globular}} clusters place a bound on the <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> {{of the entire}} universe. This lower limit {{has been a significant}} constraint in cosmology.

However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} to lease two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1994 {{was made with}} International Lease Finance Corporation in May. Maintenance was outsourced to a British company, after Braathens, which also operated 737 Classic aircraft, had denied Color Air the use of its simulators and technical workshops. For the start-up, Color Air hired 18 pilots, 40 flight attendants and 40 ground employees, {{in addition to the}} administration. The company was criticized for only hiring women flight attendants. Braathens operated with an internal pension age of 58 years for its pilots, while SAS had a 60-year <b>age</b> <b>limit.</b> Due to EEA rules, the judicial <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> was 65 years, so Color Air was able to hire retired SAS and Braathens pilots. These could be paid only NOK500,000 in annual wage, since they received a full pension from their old employers on top of it. The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association stated that this was morally reprehensible, but Color Air was supported by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, medical experts, and SAS, who all claimed that there were no medical reasons to not let people in their 60s operate aircraft.|$|E

Hugh was born in approximately 1125, for in 1153 with his election as bishop he was still under the canonical <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> for bishops of 28.

5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the <b>age</b> <b>limit),</b> and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work experience for the additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal <b>age</b> <b>limit,</b> on 30 November 1960.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{take any}} further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would {{normally}} have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as adjutant of No.2 Squadron. After getting a taste of flying as a passenger, the twenty-five-year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896. The official <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three. Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his wings, his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to No.32 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps to gain operational experience in France. Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Ypres, but he escaped injury; {{by the time he}} completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.|$|E
40|$|The {{potentially}} {{negative effects}} of drinking alcohol, smoking tobacco, using illicit drugs, gambling, and exposure to violent or otherwise detrimental movies or games are widely acknowledged. Risks may involve harm to people’s mental or physical health and/or their social well-being. These risks may be especially valid for specific groups in society. Societies generally aim to protect children and adolescents from risky products. Availability {{can be seen as}} an important predictor of adolescent consumption of risky products. In order to reduce underage sales, in many countries so-called <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> have been introduced. <b>Age</b> <b>limits</b> serve to prevent young people’s access and exposure to risky products and to delay the age at which young people may start consumption. In addition to this so-called threshold effect, there has been speculation regarding the possible occurrence of an opposite effect. The forbidden fruit theory suggests that <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> may make restricted commodities more attractive. The studies presented in this dissertation focus on the issue of compliance with <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> and the effects of various interventions that were designed to increase compliance with <b>age</b> <b>limits.</b> Furthermore, the possibility of a forbidden fruit effect was examined. Based on the empirical chapters of this dissertation, raising awareness and providing feedback are distinguished as the essential instruments in increasing knowledge, ability and motivation and subsequently improving compliance. <b>Age</b> <b>limits</b> are an important first step towards protecting adolescents against risky products. Without actual attention to the issue of compliance, however, their contribution will remain limited...|$|R

5|$|On November 23, {{the league}} and the players agreed to resume {{negotiating}} on November 25. On November 26, after 15 hours of talks, a tentative deal was reached. The NBPA re-formed as a union on December 1, receiving support from over 300 players, exceeding the requirement for at least 260 signatures. Signature cards {{were sent to the}} roughly 440players on rosters {{at the end of the}} previous season, as well as to the 60rookies drafted in 2011 and to players who signed at least two 10-day contracts. The re-formation enabled further negotiations with the league on secondary issues such as the <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> for the NBA draft and rules on players being sent to and recalled from the NBA D-League. The players and owners concluded their voting on the deal on December 8, when the deal was ratified, and the lockout ended after 161 days. The owners approved the deal by a 25–5 vote, while 86% of the more than 200 players who voted approved the deal. Miami Heat's Micky Arison and Dallas Mavericks' Mark Cuban are the two owners who have publicly disclosed that they voted against the new CBA.|$|E
5|$|The {{settings}} for {{the stories are}} primarily high fantasy worlds, with the producers opting not to use a dark or science fiction-based setting. An exception is Xillia 2, which mostly {{took place in a}} modern setting, and explored darker themes than usual. This direction was confirmed as a one-off experiment for the series. The main characters {{play a key role in}} the Tales games, as it is partially through them that the main theme of each entry is depicted. For Abyss, it was decided to take a risk and create an unorthodox protagonist that would be initially unlikable. For Vesperia, the team opted to raise the <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> of the target audience, showing this in the game by making the main protagonist a more mature type. A female main protagonist was included for the first time in Xillia in the form of Milla Maxwell alongside male protagonist Jude Mathis, although at the time it was stated that there were no solid plans to create a game with a single female protagonist. A sole main female character, called Velvet, was eventually included in Berseria. The way the characters interact with each other during the narrative forms one of the core aspects of designing each game. Another main priority is for players to see a part of themselves in the characters.|$|E
