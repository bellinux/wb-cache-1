50|$|Framing {{price or}} value: For example, one study {{reported}} on a magazine subscription where potential subscribers were offered two options: an online subscription for $59, or a combined online and print for $129 a year. Most people chose the online only option. However, when a third option was introduced: print only for $129 (i.e. the decoy), the online and print option seemed like better value and {{a significant number of}} people switched to that option. In other words, the decoy price assists in framing value. Marketers use a variety of methods to frame value: e.g. quote monthly payment options rather than a single <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
40|$|Partitioned pricing is {{a tactic}} {{in which a}} seller {{presents}} multiple prices for a single product or service instead of one, <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>price.</b> This research investigates effects of partitioned prices containing a variable number of price components, under varying levels of seller trustworthiness, and {{with or without the}} presentation of the total price. The results indicate that partitioning into a large number of price components, relative to a small number of price components, negatively affects perceived fairness and purchase intentions for less trustworthy, but not more trustworthy, sellers when the total price is not presented. However, partitioning into a large number of price components positively affects fairness and purchase intentions, regardless of seller trustworthiness, when the total price is presented. The research also examines effects of partitioning on price estimation and recall. ...|$|E

Based on key informant interviews with tour operators and hotel managers, as well as surveys of employees and interviews with customers at four- and five-star hotels, this study establishes that, if not wisely administered, the adoption of an <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>pricing</b> system may lead to a decline in employee satisfaction, customer perception of overall service quality, and finally, in customer satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|The flat price {{structure}} of prix fixe menus (i. e., fixed food prices and fixed service gratuities) affords restaurant operators {{the opportunity to}} present the same menu price in different ways. This report examined customers’ responses to financially equivalent prix fixe menu prices with a built-in gratuity (i. e., <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>prices),</b> a separately listed percentage gratuity and a separately listed dollar gratuity in terms of deal perception. Through an online experiment, we found that prix fixe menu prices with a percentage gratuity below (above) the conventional 15 % were perceived more (less) favorably than their all-inclusive counterparts. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between prix fixe menu prices with a percentage gratuity and those with a dollar gratuity at all surcharge levels. The implications of these findings for presenting prix fixe menu prices are discussed...|$|R

The service was fairly short-lived as competing offerings from providers like AOL, Prodigy, and CompuServe provided more services targeted at American users for a lower price. Many of US West's Minitel offerings were charged à la carte or hourly while competitors offered monthly <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>pricing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that preferences are affected by whether a price is presented as one allinclusive expense or partitioned {{into a series of}} charges. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a simple psychological mechanism whereby price format determines how many product attributes are actively processed at the time of valuation. Three studies support the hypothesis that price partitioning acts as an incentive to process multiple product dimensions. This process sometimes leads to the paradoxical overweighting of minor (but easy to evaluate) attributes that would be overlooked under an <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>price</b> format. The effect of price partitioning on demand can be detrimental or beneficial, consistent with existing conflicting findings in the literature and with variance in practice. Beyond its predictive and prescriptive implications, this theory contributes to the general notion that pricing might affect as much as capture perceived value...|$|E
40|$|Research on {{behavioral}} pricing {{has found}} that presenting {{the price of a}} product or service in separate parts rather than a consolidated whole can reduce consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the total cost. That principle suggests that restaurants which charge separate fees for their food and service whether by voluntary tipping or an automatic service charge may be perceived as less expensive than those that include service charges {{in the form of an}} <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>price.</b> An internet-based simulation testing that idea found that participants rated restaurants with tipping or automatic gratuity policies as less expensive than restaurants that built the costs of service into menu prices. Furthermore, participants ordered more expensive meals when automatic gratuities were added to the bill than when the costs of service were built into menu prices. While the study was a simulation only (and no money was at stake), the industry 2 ̆ 7 s longstanding practice of setting menu prices with service charges extra is supported by these findings...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, disease {{management}} programs (DMPs) {{are used to}} treat chronic diseases. Their aim is to improve care and to control the rising expenditures related to chronic diseases. A bundled payment was introduced to facilitate the implementation of DMPs. This payment is an <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>price</b> per patient per year for a pre-specified care package. However, it is unclear to which extent the costs of developing and implementing DMPs are included in this price. Consequently, the organizations providing DMPs bear financial risk because {{the development and implementation}} (D&I) costs may be substantial. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the variability in and drivers of D&I costs among 22 DMPs and highlight characteristics that impact these. METHODS: The data was analyzed using a mixed methods approach. Descriptive statistical analysis explored the variability in D&I costs as measured by a self-developed costing instrument and investigated the drivers. In addition, qualitative research, including document analysis and interviews, was conducted to explain the possible underlying reasons of cost variability. RESULTS: The development costs varied from € 5, 891 to € 274, 783 and the implementation costs varied from € 7, 278 to € 387, 879 across DMPs. Personnel costs were the main component of development. Development costs were strongly correlated with the implementation costs (ρ = 0. 55), development duration (ρ = 0. 74), and number of FTEs dedicated DMP development. Organizations with large size and high level of care prior to the implementation of a DMP had relatively low development costs. These findings were in line with the cross-case qualitative comparison where programs with a longer history, more experienced project leadership, previously established ICT systems, and less complex patient populations had lower D&I costs. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation in D&I costs of DMPs, which is driven primarily by the duration of the development phase and the staff needed to develop and implement a DMP. These drivers are influenced by the attributes of the DMP, characteristics of the target population, project leadership, and ICT involved. There are indications of economies of scale and economies of scope, which may reduce D&I costs...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} in marketing and public economics suggests that consumers underestimate {{the effects of}} taxes and surcharges on total purchase prices when taxes and surcharges are made less salient. The leading explanation is that consumers anchor on base prices and underadjust for surcharges. We perform experiments that: extend the tax salience and price partitioning literatures to the labor supply context; test the anchoring hypothesis by examining the effects {{of positive and negative}} wage surcharges on willingness to work; and test whether responses to price partitioning result from imperfect calculation of <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>prices</b> or from deeper preferences. We reject the anchoring hypothesis and find that subjects are less willing to work both when their wages are partitioned with positive and with negative surcharge components. We also find evidence that partitioned pricing effects result from cognitive limitations and possibly from responses to complexity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The common {{trend to}} form larger organisations has {{nowadays}} also reached {{the health system}} and the diagnostic laboratories. This development is dominated by economic motivations, notably by the wish to reduce costs. This tendency bears risks, specifically {{for the quality of}} medical services. Too much centralisation, which is frequently accompanied by <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>prices</b> and downgrading, puts quality at risk. Quality management does not necessarily increase costs but can also help to reduce costs. For example changes in the organisation, cooperation and management of laboratories may help to reduce costs but yet maintain or even improve quality. The achievement of this goal needs great efforts for defining visions and strategies and developing concepts. Expertise from economic and organisational sciences rather than mere medical knowledge are necessary to reach these objectives. Know-how on methods and problem solution must be gained or obtained from external sources. All involved individuals must be willing to change and to overcome antagonistic attitudes. Legal measures including the Health Care Modernisation Act (Gesundheitssystem-Modernisierungsgesetz =GMG) are aimed to reach integrated medical care, for example in out-patient and in-patient settings. It is important that the involved parties cooperate to overcome the disadvantages and to combine the advantages of the present situation. Thereby the health system will develop innovative solutions, which are efficient and cost-saving but also guarantee the maintenance or even improvement of current quality standard...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{agencies}} have had performance contracting authority since 1985, when Congress first authorized agencies {{to enter into}} shared energy savings agreements with Public Law 99 - 272, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. By the end of FY 2001, agencies had used energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) to attract private-sector investment of over $ 1 billion to improve the energy efficiency of federal buildings. Executive Order 13123 directs agencies to maximize their use of alternative financing contracting mechanisms such as ESPCs when life-cycle cost effective to reduce energy use and cost in their facilities and operations. Continuing support for ESPCs at the Administration and Congressional levels {{is evident in the}} pending comprehensive national energy legislation, which repeals the sunset provision on ESPC authority and extends ESPC authority to water savings projects. Despite the Congressional and Presidential directives to use ESPCs, some {{agencies have}} been reluctant to do so. Decision makers in these agencies see no reason to enter into long-term obligations to pay interest on borrowed money out of their own operating budgets if instead Congress will grant them appropriations to pay for the improvements up front. Questions frequently arise about whether pricing in ESPCs, which are negotiated for best value, is as favorable as prices obtained through competitive sourcing, and whether ESPC as a means of implementing energy conservation projects is as life-cycle cost effective as the standard practice of funding these projects through appropriations. The lack of any quantitative analysis to address these issues was the impetus for this study. ESPCs are by definition cost-effective because of their ''pay-from-savings'' requirement and guarantee, but do their interest costs and negotiated pricing extract an unreasonably high price? Appropriations seem to be the least-cost option, because the U. S. Treasury can borrow money at lower interest rates than the private sector, but appropriations for energy projects are scarce. What are the costs associated with requesting funding and waiting for appropriations? And how is the value of an energy project affected if savings that are not guaranteed do not last? The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and demonstrate methods to help federal energy managers take some of the guesswork out of obtaining best value from spending on building retrofit energy improvements. We developed a method for comparing <b>all-inclusive</b> <b>prices</b> of energy conservation measures (ECMs) implemented using appropriated funds and through ESPCs that illustrates how agencies can use their own appropriations-funded project experience to ensure fair ESPC pricing. The second method documented in this report is for comparing life-cycle costs. This method illustrates how agencies can use their experience, and their judgment concerning their prospects for appropriations, to decide between financing and waiting...|$|R
