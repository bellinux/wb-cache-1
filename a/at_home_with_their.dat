Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{film crew}} {{recorded}} the students on campus, <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> friends and families, at medical appointments, and at transgender-related events. Some footage was {{recorded by the}} students themselves. In February 2005, the administration at Smith College prohibited the crew from continuing to film one of the documentary's subjects, Lucas Cheadle, on campus (except in his apartment). Cheadle asked the dean of students to reconsider, but his appeal was denied. Smith College has received considerable media attention about questions regarding transgender students.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{increase}} the nutrition knowledge and to create perdurable changes in children's behaviour with nutrition education-educational material. A quasi-experimental design was utilized with 78 volunteer female participants aged 8 - 12 who were attending a volleyball school. Education materials were given to education group to study <b>at</b> <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> families during 1. 5 months in order to support the education. The increase in nutrition knowledge was significant comparing to control group (p< 0. 005). As a result, the nutrition education and the educational material induced positive changes in nutrition knowledge and behaviours...|$|R

50|$|The major {{festival of}} this area is Chhath puja in which people offer their prayer to Lord Sun. Almost all the people {{wherever}} they are, their major desire is to celebrate Chhath puja <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> family members and villagers. Holi, Diwali and Dusshera are other three festivals celebrated with so much of gaiety. Other festivals such as Nagpanchmi, Saraswathi Puja, Makar Sankranti, Eid, Janmashtami and others are also celebrated.|$|R
25|$|Siblings {{taken into}} care {{together}} were often separated and contact between siblings was discouraged. Boys and girls were usually separated in institutions so {{brothers and sisters}} rarely had close contact. Family ties were cut when one sibling ended up in care while others remained <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> parents or were sent elsewhere. The result is that many people never knew they had siblings or only found out much later in life. Children's names were often changed and poor and incomplete records kept of children in care. This {{makes it difficult for}} older care leavers to find out why and how they ended up in care, and to trace parents, siblings or other living relatives.|$|E
25|$|New Year; {{the grandest}} of all festivals, and a seven-day holiday period for {{government}} officials. Civil officials, military officers, and foreign emissaries gathered {{first in the}} early hours of the morning to attend a levee, an occasion where omens, disasters, and blessings of the previous year would be reviewed, along with tribute of regional prefectures and foreign countries presented. It was also an opportunity for provincial governors to present their recommended candidates for the imperial examination. Although festival ceremonies in Chang'an were lavish, rural people in the countryside celebrated privately <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> families in age old traditions, such as drinking a special wine, Killing Ghosts and Reviving Souls wine, that was believed to cure illnesses in the following year.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, she married Evan Maxwell, a now former newspaper reporter who spent over fifteen years {{working for the}} LA Times, covering international crime. Early in their marriage, Maxwell became very bored. Her husband worked from 4:00 PM to midnight, and as there was no bus service near their house and Evan needed the car for work, Maxwell found herself alone <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> toddler son. Maxwell did not like television and claims to have read all of the science fiction books in the local public library, in addition to everything science fiction in a local second-hand book store. After having exhausted all of her local Science Fiction options, she seated herself {{in front of her}} ancient manual typewriter and began to write a book she would enjoy, even though she had no training in creative writing.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{aired on}} Thanksgiving Day 1983, {{a year after}} Lee's final {{appearance}} as Mr. Hooper at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. [...] The producers chose to air it {{the first week of}} the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> children in order to discuss it. [...] The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. [...] Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. [...] Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, [...] "When we finished that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears", even Spinney underneath his costume. [...] Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although Spinney later said, [...] "There was nothing wrong with that take. [...] It was perfect". [...] Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance.|$|E
500|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} victory since early September 2014 after winning 1–0 away against Cheltenham Town, De Girolamo scoring from a Coulson {{pass in the}} 43rd minute. De Girolamo was recalled early from his loan spell by Sheffield United as they wanted him for their two upcoming cup fixtures, after he had scored three times in four York matches. Bournemouth's Guadeloupe international defender Stéphane Zubar joined on loan until 4 January 2015, with Parslow being loaned back to Grimsby until the same date. York drew 1–1 <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> divisional rivals AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round}} of the FA Cup; Hyde gave York the lead in the eighth minute after scoring from Coulson's low cross, before Andy Frampton equalised for the away team on 22 minutes. Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working as hard as they possibly can but I'm just looking for a little bit more now".|$|E

25|$|Some women self-select out {{of higher}} status positions, {{choosing}} instead {{to have more}} time to spend <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and <b>with</b> <b>their</b> families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home. Working class women, in particular, also sometimes self-select out of more time-intensive or higher -status positions {{in order to maintain the}} traditional gender hierarchy and household accord.|$|R

Charlotte came across Emily's poems which had been shared only with Anne, her partner {{in the world of}} Gondal. Charlotte proposed that they be published. Anne revealed her own poems but Charlotte's reaction was characteristically patronising: [...] "I thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own". Eventually the sisters reached an agreement. They told neither Branwell, nor their father, nor their friends about what they were doing. Anne and Emily each contributed 21 poems and Charlotte contributed 19 and with Aunt Branwell's money, they paid to have the collection published.|$|E

[...] The young Gregory and his brother, Caesarius, first studied <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> uncle Amphylokhios. Gregory went on to study advanced rhetoric and philosophy in Nazianzus, Caesarea, Alexandria and Athens. On the way to Athens his ship encountered a violent storm, and the terrified Gregory prayed to Christ that if He would deliver him, he would dedicate his life to His service. [...] While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with his fellow student Basil of Caesarea and also made the acquaintance of Flavius Claudius Julianus, who would later become the emperor known as Julian the Apostate. [...] In Athens, Gregory studied under the famous rhetoricians Himerius and Proaeresius. Upon finishing his education, he taught rhetoric in Athens for a short time.|$|E

60|$|As a teacher, Garfield {{seems to}} have been eminently successful. His genial {{character}} and good-natured way of explaining things made him a favourite at once with the rough western lads he had to teach, who would perhaps have thought a more formal teacher stiff and stuckup. Garfield was one of themselves; he knew their ways and their manners; he could make allowances for their awkwardness and bluntness of speech; he could adopt towards them the exact tone which put them <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> once <b>with</b> <b>their</b> easy-going instructor. Certainly, he inspired all his pupils with an immense love and devotion for him; and it is less easy to inspire those feelings in a sturdy Ohio farmer than in most other varieties of the essentially affectionate human species.|$|R

Of course Elspeth took to repaying his attentions by loving him, and he soon suspected it, and then gloomily admitted it to himself, but never to Shovel. Being but an Englishman, Shovel saw no reason why relatives should conceal their affection for each other, but he played on this Scottish weakness of Tommy's with cruel enjoyment.|$|R
2500|$|The {{description}} of the Panche is different in Epítome than the Muisca; the Panche are described as a much more war-like people, their rugged terrain worse for the cavalry and the style of warfare different. While the Muisca [...] "fought" [...] using screams and shouting, the Panche are described as fighting silently with slingshots, poisoned arrows and large heavy poles made of palm trees (macanas) swinging them with both hands to hit their enemies. The practice, later described from the Muisca as well, of tieing mummies on their backs is reported from the Panche. The habit is described as showing {{what will happen to}} their opponents; fighting like they fought and to instigate fear in the enemy. Of the Panche is described that when they won their battles, they celebrated their victory with festivities, took the children of their enemies to sacrifice them, captured the women and killed the men by poking out the eyes of the combat leaders. The combat of the Panche is described as fiercer as of the Muisca and the combatants walked naked. They had tubes made of animal skins where they held the lances and bow and arrows to shoot. The Panche warriors are described as eating the flesh of their enemies at the battlefield or later <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> wives and children. The process of treaties is described as performed not by the men, but by the women, as [...] "they cannot be refused".|$|E
