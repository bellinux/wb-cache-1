25|$|Silicon (Si) is {{the second}} most common element in the Earth's crust (oxygen is the most common). The {{compound}} silica, also known as silicon dioxide (SiO2), is formed from silicon and oxygen atoms. Since oxygen and silicon make up about 75% of the Earth's crust, the compound silica is quite common. It is found in many rocks, such as granite, sandstone, gneiss and slate, and in some metallic ores. Silica can be a main component of sand. It can also be in soil, mortar, plaster, and shingles. The cutting, breaking, crushing, drilling, grinding, or <b>abrasive</b> <b>blasting</b> of these materials may produce fine to ultra fine airborne silica dust.|$|E
25|$|Non-slagging gasifiers produce dry ash {{similar to}} that {{produced}} by conventional coal combustion, which can be an environmental liability if the ash (typically containing heavy metals) is leachable or caustic, and if the ash must be stored in ash ponds. Slagging gasifiers, which are utilized at many of the major coal gasification applications worldwide, have considerable advantage in that ash components are fused into a glassy slag, capturing trace heavy metals in the non-leachable glassy matrix, rendering the material non-toxic. This non-hazardous slag has multiple beneficial uses such as aggregate in concrete, aggregate in asphalt for road construction, grit in <b>abrasive</b> <b>blasting,</b> roofing granules, etc.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{the glass}} panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates {{to assist with the}} {{selection}} of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them—representing a wide diversity of voices spread through time—were used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water jet cutter to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass fabricator (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized bus shelter glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art <b>abrasive</b> <b>blasting</b> to etch the photo-realistic images into the glass. Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, to laminate the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exterior}} of the Cleveland Trust Company Building became increasingly dirty in its first 55 years, but calls by the news media to clean the structure were largely ignored by the bank. [...] The building underwent its first exterior cleaning (a type of <b>abrasive</b> <b>blasting)</b> in July 1964.

The bus bays imposed a 36ft pier spacing on the main block, {{and led to the}} standardization of a 1ft 6in module for the design. Concrete was strongly expressed within the building, the external finishes to structural elements being unclad reinforced concrete. The walls were ribbed, and the locally graded round aggregate was exposed by <b>abrasive</b> <b>blasting.</b> The floors were made of precast concrete coffered units over which a reinforced concrete floor was cast. For the cladding Madin offered the council a choice of Portland Stone or Travertine Marble to align with the adjacent civic buildings. A third, cheaper option was pre-cast concrete with Hoptonwood limestone and Derbyshire spar aggregate with white cement: this was offered by Alan Maudsley, the City Architect, and accepted by the council as an economy measure.|$|E

At a time when all other art forms were changing, glass, it seemed to him, was not. He wondered why so few artists were exploring a material, which was capable of so much. After becoming aware of the, still very young, Studio Glass Movement in the USA (Studio glass), he studied glass blowing in New York (1974) and California (1975-1977), Carther returned to Canada to explore the material on his own.** He wanted to work sculpturally in glass on a very large scale and within architectural environments. Not wanting to accept the structural and aesthetic limitations of stained glass, he began experimenting with techniques such as acid etching and <b>abrasive</b> <b>blast</b> carving. In 1981, Carther came to the realization that he did not need lead at all, that if he worked with thicker ¾ inch plate glass, he could carve deeply into glass with <b>abrasive</b> <b>blast</b> and not compromise the structural capabilities of the glass, allowing him to work at almost any scale. He also began to fire glass enamel onto the plate for colour. This method of working became his primary technique. ** ...|$|R
5000|$|Mobile dry <b>abrasive</b> <b>blast</b> {{systems are}} {{typically}} {{powered by a}} diesel air compressor.

40|$|Past {{decontamination}} and {{solvent recovery}} {{activities at the}} Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) {{have resulted in the}} accumulation of 1. 5 million gallons of radioactively contaminated sodium-bearing liquid waste. Future decontamination activities at the ICPP could result in the production of 5 million gallons or more of sodium-bearing waste using the current decontamination techniques of chemical/water flushes and steam jet cleaning. With the curtailment of reprocessing at the ICPP, the focus of decontamination is shifting from maintenance for continued operation of the facilities to decommissioning. As decommissioning plans are developed, new decontamination methods must be used which result in higher decontamination factors and generate lower amounts of sodium-bearing secondary waste. The primary initiative of the WINCO Decontamination Development Program is the development of methods to eliminate/minimize the use of sodium-bearing decontamination chemicals.

40|$|Abstract. Carbon fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (CFRP), {{which are}} now used in some aerospace applications, is difficult to cut and drill holes in. Moreover, no reports have focused on selecting a suitable drilling method for each aerospace part. This paper discusses many methods of hole generation for CFRP composites, including methods using traditional drill tools and non-traditional methods such as abrasive water jet (AWJ), laser beam and <b>abrasive</b> <b>blast.</b> We look at traditional cemented carbide material tools, polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tools, diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated tools and ceramic tools. Then, comparing the experimental results of these methods from the viewpoints of characteristics, efficiency, cost, and hole quality, we investigate each problem to select the suitable drilling method. As a result, we propose a novel method to strategically obtain the best solutions to generate holes in aerospace parts...|$|R

50|$|Two-hose dry-ice {{blasting}} {{was developed}} before the single-hose system. This approach {{is very similar}} to a suction-feed <b>abrasive</b> <b>blast</b> system. Compressed air is delivered in one hose, and ice pellets are sucked out of a second hose by the venturi effect. Compared to a single-hose system, the two-hose system delivers ice particles less forcefully (approximately 5% for a given air supply). For a given amount of compressed air, two-hose systems can have less vertical distance between the machine and applicator. For most systems available today this limit is well in excess of 25 feet. Two-hose systems are generally cheaper to produce due to a simpler delivery system. These systems are rarely seen today as they are less efficient in most applications. Their principal advantage is in allowing finer particles of ice to be delivered to the applicator as the late combination of warm air with cold ice results in less sublimation in the hose. These systems allow for more delicate surfaces to be cleaned such as in semiconductor.|$|R

40|$|Paint removal is {{a common}} {{maintenance}} requirement for aircraft as well as naval and land vehicles, since external paint gets damaged and loses much of its corrosion protection effectiveness with time. Paint removal is also conducted when metallic aircraft structures are inspected periodically for fatigue cracks and corrosion. The conventional methods of removing paint employed throughout the Canadian Forces mainly include chemical stripping and <b>abrasive</b> media <b>blasting.</b> Chemical stripping {{involves the use of}} hazardous chemicals, which are high in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP). <b>Abrasive</b> media <b>blasting</b> typically results in a substantial quantity of solid waste consisting of paint and blast residues. Such waste is subject to control under increasingly stringent environmental and safety regulations and its disposal is costly.
