40|$|Background: Bone Marrow Transplantation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} therapeutic methods in much malignant and nonmalignant disease. Patients with Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) following radiotherapy and chemotherapy will suffer from immuno-suppression. Therefore they are susceptible to get saprophytic fungi infection that sometimes are killer. Materials and Methods: The purpose of this cross-sectional survey is isolation of saprophytic fungi from patients with BMT and wards space and instruments. Therefore sampling from ventilator system (HEPA filter and common filter), air canal, <b>air,</b> <b>hospital</b> instruments and clinical samples (nasal discharge, sputum, urine) were done and cultured in sabouro dextrose agar with choloramphenicol (SC). In assessing total frequency from 4838 plates of wards space and instruments, 985 fungi colonies includes 21 genus were isolated. Results and Conclusion: Most fungi colonies present were Penicillium, Aspergillus and Cladosporium and low present were Trichoderma,Stereptomyses, Chrysosporium, Rhizopus...|$|E

During the last few years, {{there has been an}} increase in the number of cases of invasive aspergillosis (8), a disease with a very high mortality. Infecting strains may be acquired both inside and outside the hospital. Voriconazole has proven to be superior to amphotericin B and is now the drug of choice for the primary treatment of invasive aspergillosis (9, 13). Despite the lack of definitive data correlating in vitro sus-ceptibility results with clinical response, in vitro antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus should be considered a sine qua non when selecting therapy. We are not aware of large studies comparing the antifunga...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in data suggesting that besides <b>air,</b> <b>hospital</b> water is a potential source of transmission of filamentous fungi, and in particular Aspergillus fumigatus. Molecular characterization of environmental and clinical A. fumigatus isolates, collected prospectively during an 18 -month period, was performed to establish if waterborne fungi {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis. Isolates recovered from water (n = 54) and air (n = 21) at various locations inside and outside the hospital and from 15 patients (n = 21) with proven, probable, or possible invasive aspergillosis were genotyped by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Based on genomic fingerprints, the environmental A. fumigatus isolates could be grouped into two major clusters primarily containing isolates recovered from either air or water. The genotypic relatedness between clinical and environmental isolates suggests that patients with invasive aspergillosis can be infected by strains originating from water or from air. In addition, 12 clusters with genetically indistinguishable or highly related strains were differentiated, each containing two to three isolates. In two clusters, clinical isolates recovered from patients matched those recovered from water sources, while in another cluster the clinical isolate was indistinguishable from one cultured from air. This observation might open new perspectives in the development of infection control measures to prevent invasive aspergillosis in high-risk patients. The genetic variability found between airborne and waterborne A. fumigatus strains might prove to be a powerful tool in understanding the transmission of invasive aspergillosis and in outbreak control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Frequently {{encountered}} multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii {{are common}} and prevalent {{in a hospital}} environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence and pattern of antibiotic resistance, extended spectrum and metallo beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates from restricted settings of indoor <b>air</b> <b>hospital</b> environment. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Wolaita Sodo University Teaching and referral Hospital, Ethiopia from December 1 / 2015 to April 30 / 2015. The Air samples were collected from delivery room, intensive care unit and operation theatre of the hospital by active, Anderson six slate sampler technique during the first week of the months, twice a week during Monday’s and Friday’s. Standard microbiological procedures were followed to isolate P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Susceptibility testing was performed on isolates using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique. Extended spectrum beta lactamase production was detected by double disc synergy test and Imipenem-resistant isolates were screened for producing Metallo-beta lactamase. Results A total number of 216 indoor air samples were collected from the delivery room, intensive care unit, and operation room. Correspondingly, 43 A. baumannii isolates were identified (13 from delivery room, 21 from intensive care unit and 9 from operation room). Likewise 24 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained (4 from delivery room, 13 from intensive care unit and 7 from operation room). Extended spectrum beta lactamase and metalo-beta lactamase production were observed in 24 (55. 8 %) and 13 (30. 2 %) isolates of A. baumannii respectively, whereas P. aeruginosa showed 15 (62. 5 %) extended spectrum beta lactamase and 9 (37. 5 %) metallo-beta lactamase production. Conclusions Extended spectrum beta lactamase and metallo-beta lactamase producing bacteria in hospital air is a new dimension for specific setting of the study area where antimicrobial resistance is increasing and surgical site infection is prevalent. So, identification of these microorganisms has a great role in reducing the burden of antibiotic resistance and could also provide a significant input for framing hospital infection control policies...|$|E
