5|$|English Heritage {{took over}} {{management}} of the castle in 1983, and stripped back 20th-century additions to present it <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> appeared in 1914, including demolishing the old signal station tower. The site remains open to visitors and received 5,751 visitors in 2010. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building and as a scheduled monument. The air station's former hangars are still used as a recreation centre by Hampshire County Council.|$|E
5|$|After the conflict, Portland Castle was {{transferred}} to the Ministry of Works in 1949 and opened to the public in 1955. The Ministry decided to present the interior <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> looked in the 16th century and removed most of the 19th- and 20th-century additions and changes. The Captain's House and the adjacent gardens were used by the neighbouring HMS Osprey helicopter base until 1999, but with the facility's closure, this part of the fort was also opened to visitors, the house being turned into a visitor facility.|$|E

5|$|The high-definition upgrade {{was not as}} {{difficult}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed {{to be set as}} there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E

25|$|Shuttleworth's career {{never took}} off <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done {{and loss of}} form, plus {{persistent}} injuries, forced him to leave Lancashire in 1975 and join Leicestershire, where he played forty-one matches between 1977 and 1980. In twelve seasons with Lancashire, Shuttleworth played in 177 matches and took 484 wickets {{at a cost of}} 22.92 each. He played in 105 limited-overs matches for the county and took 147 wickets at 18 apiece.|$|E
25|$|The US {{team was}} Culbertson {{and his wife}} Josephine, Theodore Lightner and Waldemar von Zedwitz. All {{the members of the}} American team would be {{recognised}} as outstanding players in the years that followed. Both their partnerships were experienced and organised; the result of the match was not long in doubt. Culbertson won by 4,845 points over a week's play of 200 deals (total points scoring): not quite so bad for Buller <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been.|$|E

25|$|The {{final day}} was short, SDS was now an {{organization}} {{consisting of the}} factions RYM and a much less powerful RYM II.

However, as “excised <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been,” PL did meet on that last day in the Coliseum. “Proclaiming itself the true SDS,” PL met {{on the other side of}} the convention center, away from the new SDS, who spent their last day planning a Chicago event that would take place that October, only a few months later. This event is what would later be named the Days of Rage.|$|E
25|$|They {{looked at}} the case as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail. Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop her dresser and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E

Today, the church accepts women as priests and Halonen has stated that she has no personal reason not {{to return to the}} church but refrains from doing so in order not to give a signal that might be misinterpreted. In the 1990s, Halonen acted as the chairman of Suomen setlementtiliitto, a Christian social work organization. After her presidential term, Halonen rejoined the Evangelical-Lutheran Church. According to her statements, she had previously refrained from it <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been considered an attempt to garner political support. Since then, Halonen has even preached publicly in a divine service of her home parish of Kallio. This is a privilege that the parish priest may grant only in exceptional cases to persons known for their Christian conviction.|$|E

25|$|However, Ah Jie and Kai Qi's {{happiness}} is short lived {{when her father}} {{is part of a}} gang that kidnaps Ah Jie's brother for ransom. Kai Qi knowing her father is one of the cohorts protects him from the police by withholding information about the kidnappers identities when she thinks this will cause her to lose her new-found happiness with Ah Jie. Soon Ah Jie's brother is found badly injured in a comatose state, the authorities show Ah Jie's family that Kai Qi's father is one of the kidnappers. Ah Jie becomes furious with Kai Qi and blames her for not telling the authorities earlier <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> saved his brother from serious injuries. Due to her father's actions Kai Qi is too ashamed to face others and starts to revert to her isolated self, but once Ah Jie's anger cools down he tries hard to overlook what her father has done to save their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the morning}} {{session of the}} {{previous}} day, England initially gave themselves some grounds for optimism. The wicket of Symonds fell early and only Warne provided any resistance as the tail was cleaned up, with Australia all out for 419 (a lead of 260). The originally bowler-friendly pitch appeared to have flattened out considerably, and the total did not appear as imposing <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> otherwise been. Unfortunately for England the four Australia bowlers gave no quarter, and England went from 0/41 to 3/49 as the pacemen ripped through the top order. The pressure did not relent, and ultimately England succumbed midway through the final session to be all out for a mere 161 runs. The victory margin was an innings and 99 runs, giving Ponting his first innings victory in an Ashes test match, in what was clearly England's poorest performance of the series thus far. Brett Lee took his best wicket haul of the series with 4/87. Shane Warne was named Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 5/39 and 2/46, and his resilient 40* with the bat. Warne's dismissal of Harmison was also his 999th International wicket (combining Test and ODI wickets), leaving him one shy of becoming only the second player in history to reach the 1000th International wicket milestone (after Muttiah Muralitharan).|$|E
500|$|The Director's Edition {{was better}} {{received}} by critics {{than the original}} theatrical release. The DVD Journal's Mark Bourne said that the Director's Edition showcased [...] "a brisker, more attractive version of the movie" [...] that was [...] "as good <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been in 1979. Even better maybe." [...] Complaints included the edition's 2.17:1 aspect ratio, {{as opposed to the}} original 2.40:1 Panavision. Jeremy Conrad of IGN felt that despite the changes, the pacing might still be too slow for some viewers.|$|E

50|$|It's wonderfully scripted, well-acted and {{thoroughly}} enjoyable to watch. It features some terrific costumes, great cars, realistic backdrops and stunning photography.

500|$|To save weight, Canopus carried less armour {{than the}} Majestics— in the belt {{compared}} to —although {{the change from}} Harvey armour in the Majestics to Krupp armour in Canopus meant that the loss in protection was not as great <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on {{either end of the}} belt were [...] thick. The main battery turrets were 10in thick, atop [...] barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12in thick sides as well.

500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl.
