40|$|The <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet</b> (Morus serrator) {{population}} has increased considerably {{over the past}} century, both in New Zealand and Australia.

Reasons for {{the increase in the}} <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet</b> population are poorly understood; here we consider the possible effects of recent fluctuations in climatic and oceanographic conditions, and changes in major local commercial fisheries. A significant trend towards more frequent, and stronger, El Niño Southern Oscillation events, warmer summer sea surface temperatures in Bass Strait, increased annual catches and catch per unit effort in the Victorian pilchard (Sardinops sagax) fishery and potential increased discarding of fisheries bycatch may account for {{at least some of the}} observed increase in the <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet</b> population.

40|$|Data on {{the extent}} to which the sexes may differ in their phenotypes are {{critical}} for a full understanding of the biology and management of any species. We previously quantified behavioral differences and vocal similarities between genetically-sexed Australasian Gannets (Morus serrator). Here, we quantify size monomorphism and plumage dichromatism in this socially monogamous, colonial seabird. In comparison with other sulids, the <b>Australasian</b> <b>Gannet</b> is characterized by low sexual dimorphism indices in various size metrics, and most physical dimensions are statistically similar between adult female and male gannets. In contrast, we found indications of sexually dichromatic plumage traits in the melanin-based, rusty head plumage and in the black-and-white tail feathers. To our knowledge, these findings constitute the first evidence of melanin-generated sexual plumage dichromatism in a size monomorphic seabird species. Using opsin-sequencing, we also confirm that the <b>Australasian</b> <b>Gannet</b> is a visually violet-sensitive species, for which the detection of both gross differences in feather reflectance, and long-wavelength based plumage dichromatism, should be perceptually feasible. However, because of the extensive overlap between females and males in the size and chromatic traits detected here, and in the behavioral and vocal displays reported in previous studies, we advocate for the use of genetic techniques for sex identification in this gannet species.

40|$|The <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet,</b> Morus serrator, {{a member}} of the Family Sulidae, {{primarily}} inhabits New Zealand and Australian coastal waters. It is considered to be closely related to the Atlantic gannet, Morus bassana, in the North Atlantic, and Cape gannet, Morus capensis, in South African waters, with which it shares similar ecological niches. Although often described as relatively well studied, much of our current knowledge of Australasian gannets has been derived from anecdotal observations, and irregular visits to breeding colonies. Few studies have derived information from continuous observations of known individuals over consecutive breeding seasons. Conversely, studies of Atlantic gannets, in particular, have been conducted on a far more rigorous basis. Thus, parallels drawn between the three species, and particularly Atlantic and Australasian gannets, {{may or may not be}} accurate. This study is the first to document three complete and consecutive breeding seasons (1999 - 00, 2000 - 01, and 2001 - 02), using marked nests at the Plateau colony, Cape Kidnappers, New Zealand. Birds were individually marked and I investigated their breeding ecology, and in particular the annual variability in success and other breeding variables. Contrasting with previous studies, I found that the onset of egg laying differed little between years, and although laying was less synchronous in one season, it was highly synchronous in the other two seasons. This is similar to the Atlantic gannet in which the onset of laying is similar year to year, and laying is also highly synchronised. At least for the <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet,</b> the timing of egg laying does not appear to be linked to sea surface temperature near the colony. However, both species appear to time egg laying to allow chick rearing to coincide with a predictably timed peak in prey availability. Further in depth study is required to confirm this for the <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet</b> breeding in New Zealand. The use of back-dating to estimate the onset of egg laying from hatching dates and chick ages was also tested and found to provide a useful estimate. Although previous studies of Australasian gannets have suggested highly variable breeding success, with almost complete breeding failures in some years, this study is the first to document this, and explore possible reasons. Previous studies have suggested human disturbance at breeding colonies as being the cause, with little evidence provided. However, I found in 1999 - 00, there was considerable egg and chick losses as a result of environmental conditions causing adult and chick starvation and desertion of eggs and young chicks, and productivity was only 9 %. A similar pattern, although less severe, occurred in the following season, but conditions improved during the chick rearing stage resulting in 55 % productivity. In 2001 - 02, environmental conditions were stable, resulting in high hatching success, however, an unseasonal storm resulted in considerable chick mortality, and productivity was again low at only 13 %. Thus, productivity during the three seasons studied varied markedly, being very low in two of the three seasons as a consequence of environmental conditions, with no evidence of human disturbance. This is the first study which has linked the environment to variable breeding success in this species, and its findings contrast considerably with the invariably high breeding success of the Atlantic gannet. Retrospective analysis of previous <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet</b> studies suggests this natural link between the environment and breeding success has been apparent, but not recognised, since the 1940 s. Links between specific environmental factors and breeding failures are yet to be determined. I established that calculated egg volume is a good predictor of fresh egg mass, allowing analysis of eggs through the use of linear measurements, when fresh egg mass is not known. For all seasons combined mean egg volume was 89. 2 mm 3, whilst a mean incubation period of 45 days is similar to other <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet</b> studies. Changes in specific gravity during egg development did not allow accurate determination of egg laying dates, with 12. 7 % of fresh egg mass being lost during development. Eggs laid both within and between seasons by individual females were highly correlated in all measures (length, width, shape, and volume). These egg measures generally showed a negative correlation with laying date, at least in the last two breeding seasons. Egg volume was positively correlated with chick mass at hatching, although chick growth rates did not seem correlated with egg volume. However, in 2000 - 01, chicks that survived to fledging were significantly heavier on day-one, despite hatching from similar volume eggs. For chicks that fledged successfully, those that hatched later in the season increased in mass more slowly than chicks that hatched early. However, the reverse trend was found for wing length, possibly as a consequence of wing development being more important than mass increase. Linked to the breeding failures in 1999 - 00, were low nest attendance rates by adults and the lowest recorded body mass for adult Australasian gannets in this or previous studies. Similarly, first egg volumes in this first season were significantly lower, and fewer lost eggs were replaced. Chick growth rates also varied between breeding seasons. Early development of chicks (0 - 11 days) was slower in 1999 - 00 than in the other two seasons (slower even than chicks that did not fledge in the other seasons). Growth rates of older chicks (20 + days) that survived to fledge, however, were actually greatest in that season. This suggests that older or more experienced adults, who were better able to provision chicks through poor foraging conditions, were then able to raise faster developing chicks once conditions improved. The evidence presented in this thesis demonstrates that the 1999 - 00 breeding season was a difficult one for breeding Australasian gannets at Cape Kidnappers. Furthermore, information derived from this three season study, along with analysis of historical studies, suggests that the <b>Australasian</b> <b>gannet</b> differs markedly to the Atlantic gannet in many respects. Most notable is the occurrence of pronounced breeding failures in some years, apparently influenced by environmental conditions. This seems to be a consequence of a more variable environment, involving variability in weather, oceanographic conditions, and prey availability and abundance...|$|E
