5|$|In {{the town}} of Broome, the maximum wind gust {{recorded}} was 153km/h (95mph), recorded at the Broome aerodrome, as well as recording 163.8mm (6.45in) of rain for the 24hours up to 9 a.m. WST (0100 UTC) on 20 April. Vegetation in this area were badly damaged, particularly the <b>African</b> <b>Mahogany</b> trees which were either snapped off or uprooted. Parts of Cable Beach were severely eroded. An area {{which used to be}} covered with sand was completely covered by rocks. The eastern side of Roebuck Bay had evidence of severe erosion of the coastal terrain. At Broome's only banana plantation, almost all crops were completely lost, with 10 out of 18,000 plants left surviving. Fortunately, most buildings in {{the town of}} Broome remained unharmed, although power supplies were cut to many parts of Broome for several days.|$|E

25|$|Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most {{commonly}} manufactured from <b>African</b> <b>mahogany,</b> spruce or birch veneers that are bonded {{together in a}} hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured {{to a number of}} specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies and meets specifications.|$|E
25|$|The park holds {{a remnant}} of the Nigerian lowland forests that once formed a {{continuous}} 50–100km wide belt from the Niger River west to the Dahomey Gap in Benin. To the south and southeast the forest was separated from the coast by mangrove and swamp forests, while to the north it merged into the Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregion. Human pressure is not new. In the Okomu park there is an extensive layer of charcoal and pottery below the forest, indicating that it was cleared and then regenerated over the last 700 years. By {{the start of the}} 20th century the forest survived only in disconnected blocks, which were under intense pressure from human activity. The British colonial administration set up a series of forest reserves to manage what remained, including controlled extraction of valuable trees such as <b>African</b> <b>mahogany.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Turraeanthus africana is {{a species}} of plant in the Meliaceae (Mahogany) family. It is found in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. The genus name {{is derived from the}} {{botanist}} Turra (1607-1688) of Padua, Italy and arithos, a Greek word meaning flower. [...] Common names are: Avodiré, apeya, engan, agbe, lusamba, wansenwa, African Satinwood, and <b>African</b> White <b>Mahogany.</b> It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the flora}} of Africa is rather poor in plant species when {{compared}} to the floras of Tropical America or South-east Asia, this vast continent is the home {{of a wide range of}} plants useful to Man. Many of these have become famous in cultivation around the world. Coffee now provides an important source of income for certain countries, and the Yams yield one of the world’s staple foods. The Oil Palm and Cola trees are widely cultivated in Africa itself and elsewhere. <b>African</b> <b>Mahoganies</b> and Ironwoods are much sought after timber trees of excellent quality. Numerous grasses and pulses are well-known for their food value, and some of the native Cucurbitaceae are appreciated additions to our vegetable diet. African plants have also made their contribution to horticulture, ranging from world-famous trees such as the African or Gabon Tulip tree and many of the South African species of Proteaceae to the multitude of East and South African succulents. The present paper provides a survey of the most important of these useful plants and will emphasize the need of further research for forestry and agricultural as well as horticultural purposes, especially as far as some still little-known but potentially important plants species are concerned. </p...|$|R
500|$|With {{little but}} Combs' {{inexperience}} to run against, Chandler portrayed Combs as a pawn of former governors Clements and Wetherby, whom he derisively nicknamed [...] "Clementine" [...] and [...] "Wetherbine". He accused both administrations of wasteful spending, specifically attacking {{the construction of}} the Kentucky Turnpike and Freedom Hall as unnecessary expenditures. Some of Chandler's attacks were more personal in nature; he charged that when Clements was governor, he spent $20,000 ($ in [...] dollars) on a new rug for his office, and that Wetherby had used <b>African</b> <b>mahogany</b> to panel his office, instead of [...] "good, honest Kentucky wood". Though receipts later showed that carpeting for the entire first floor of the capitol had cost only $2,700 and that Wetherby's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a Kentucky contractor, Chandler's charges remained effective at keeping the Combs campaign on the defensive.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{strategy}} in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one. He claimed Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $20,000 rug in his office. (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire {{first floor of the}} capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said [...] "didn't hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it".) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of <b>African</b> <b>mahogany</b> paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone [...] "clear to Africa" [...] to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Both Clements and Wetherby {{endorsed}} Bert T. Combs {{to succeed}} Wetherby as governor. Wetherby had named Combs to the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1951 {{to fill a}} vacancy created {{by the death of}} Judge Roy Helm. Happy Chandler, Clements' old foe, ran against Combs in the primary and painted him as a pawn of [...] "Clementine" [...] and [...] "Wetherbine", his derogatory nicknames for Clements and Wetherby. In fact, Chandler ran the entire campaign not just against Combs, but against Clements and Wetherby as well. He charged both Clements and Wetherby with extravagant spending in their administrations. Among his allegations were that Clements had purchased a $20,000 rug for his office and that Wetherby had paneled his office with <b>African</b> <b>mahogany.</b> Chandler promised that, if elected, he would use [...] "good, honest Kentucky wood" [...] in his office and that all Kentuckians would be invited to the capitol to walk on the $20,000 rug. Ultimately, invoices showed that no $20,000 rug had been purchased by Clements and Wetherby's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a local contractor. Chandler's charges may have been inaccurate, but he defeated Combs in the primary and {{went on to win the}} general election.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} trim remained virtually unchanged from 1973, with standard seating choices, including Strato bucket seats with center console or notchback bench seat with an armrest and cloth or Morrokide upholstery. The bucket seats were available with optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support. However, the real <b>African</b> Crossfire <b>Mahogany</b> trim {{was replaced by}} a simulated material for the instrument panel due to splintering problems on 1973 models; the [...] "real" [...] wood was continued on the console and door panels for another two years. Also, a new cut-pile carpeting replaced the nylon loop rugs of previous years.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} timber species in Neotropics, mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) is still harvested from natural forests. The difficulty of ensuring its regeneration in logged-over forests was a {{primary reason for}} listing this species in CITES appendix II in 2003, requiring producer countries to develop sustainable production systems. The most advanced efforts are those of communities that harvest multiple products, including more than 8000 m cubic/year of mahogany timber, from all over nearly 730 000 hectares of production forests on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. Over the past twenty years, their foresters have developed inventories and managment plans and overseen enrichment planting efforts, while researchers have established experiments and studies to evaluate management alternatives. Seven years of research on mahogani regeneration has revealed that mahogany trees with diameters superior to 75 cm are the {{most important}} seed producers, but selective harvesting of all trees over the minimum diameter limit of 55 cm is depleting them. Silvicultural experiments on different sizes of clearings have shown that 5 000 square m clearings produced by machinery or burning, treatments which impede resprouting by trees of other species, were most favorable, to establishment and growth of mahogany seedlings. Seedlings did not survive when planted under the forest canopy. Researchers, foresters, government agencies, and communities have been collaborating to integrate these new findings into revised management guidelines and to modify forestry policies accordingly. These findings are likely to be applicable to the management of this species elsewhere in its native range, and possibly also to the closely related <b>African</b> <b>mahoganies...</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1975 Le Mans {{received}} mostly trim changes {{including new}} crosshatch grilles on base and Sport models, and a distinctive vertical bar grille with more chrome on the Grand Le Mans (renamed from Luxury Le Mans) series cars and only revised nameplates and taillight lenses in the rear. Interiors were revised on top Grand Le Mans cars {{to include the}} distinctive wrap-around dashboard from the Grand Prix and Grand Am models with simulated <b>African</b> Crossfire <b>Mahogany</b> trim, a notchback bench seat with armrest in sedans and wagons or a no-cost choice of the notchback bench or Strato bucket seats in coupes. Base Le Mans and Sport Coupe models carried over trim only slightly revised from 1974 including a revised Custom Cushioned steering wheel.|$|R
2500|$|As of 2010, the 'Big Al' bass {{came in a}} 5-string {{version with}} the choice of H and SSS pickup configurations. The Albert Lee {{signature}} model comes with two custom-wound DiMarzio hum-bucking pickups and an <b>African</b> <b>mahogany</b> body. [...] On August 10, 2015, Ernie Ball announced that both the Big Al and Reflex basses {{are scheduled to be}} discontinued on October 31, 2015 in order to streamline the company's product offerings.|$|E
2500|$|As of 1999, 87% of {{the total}} volume of wood {{harvested}} was one of five species of <b>African</b> <b>mahogany.</b> These selective logging practices yield only 8.7 cubic meters (the volume {{less than that of}} one tree) per hectare. [...] This creates a scenario where many roads are created to move very few selected trees from the forest. This creates access to previously secluded areas which expedites the rate of forest accessibility thereby allowing populations to move in to collect fuelwood, hunt bushmeat, and start clearing the land for agriculture.|$|E
2500|$|Picket boat no. 41768, {{the future}} Darlwyne, was built [...] for the Royal Navy in 1941 in the Sussex Yacht Works yard at Shoreham-by-Sea.

The 1974 Grand Ams rear-end styling was redesigned for the new 5 mph crash standards and had vertical rear taillights with relocated license plate and fuel filler above the bumper. Engine and transmission offerings {{were the same as}} 1973, but four-speed manual transmissions were no longer offered in California, where only the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic was available. Inside, the genuine <b>African</b> crossfire <b>mahogany</b> trim on the instrument panel was replaced by a simulated material due to delamination problems on the 1973 models but the real wood was continued on the center console, optional console clock, and radio bezel.|$|R
50|$|The theatre was {{designed}} to blend with the rough terrain of the Ozark Mountains. He had originally planned a marble style theatre reminiscent of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, but soon {{had a change of}} mind. The Larson Company of Tucson, Arizona, fabricated a section of rock on Missouri's Highway 76 and the theatre was soon engulfed with waterfalls, koi-filled ponds, ferns and trees native to the Ozarks. The inside of the theatre incorporates the outside. Trees and plants are seen throughout the theatre's three lobbies. Oak floors are accompanied by <b>African</b> ribbon-striped <b>mahogany</b> walls that are filled with pictures of the Andy Williams Television Show. Williams' passion for art can be seen throughout as well. From the start of his career, Williams had accumulated several paintings and sculptures and decided to fill his theatre with his collection. Frankenthaler, Diebenkorn, Oldenburg, Pollock, Klee and Moore are a small list of artists whose work is on display at the Moon River Theatre.|$|R

2500|$|Some of the {{furnishings}} from Mauretania were {{installed in a}} bar/restaurant complex in Bristol called the Mauretania Bar (now Java Bristol), situated in Park Street. The bar was panelled with great quantities of richly carved and gilt old growth <b>African</b> <b>mahogany,</b> which came from her first class lounge. The neon sign made for the 1937 opening on the south wall still advertises Mauretania and her bow lettering was used above the entrance.

2500|$|As the {{building}} was designed to echo the Washington Monument, the sides of {{the building}} slope slightly inward, and each floor of the Foshay Tower is slightly smaller than the one below it. It is also unusual in that the tower is set back from the street, with a two-story structure surrounding it on the Marquette Avenue and 9th Street sides. The other two sides of the building, facing 8th Street and 2nd Avenue, are now surrounded by the TCF Tower, which rises to seventeen stories on the 2nd Avenue side and entirely obscures the views from the windows of the first seven stories of the Foshay Tower on the 2nd Avenue and 8th Street sides. Internally the building uses steel and reinforced concrete.

60|$|This fine {{concession}} is {{a rectangular}} parallelogram, whose dimensions are 2,000 yards long {{from north to}} south, by a breadth of half. The village stands outside the south-western angle, and the Fía rivulet runs through the south-eastern corner. The surface is rolling ground, with a rise and a depression trending from south-west to north-east. The whole extent, except where 'bush' lingers, is an old plantation of bananas, manioc, and ground-nuts. There is an ample supply of good hard timber, but red pitch-pine or creosoted teak from England would last much longer. Amongst the trees are especially noted the copal, the gamboge, rich in sticky juice, the brovi, {{said to be the}} hardest wood, and the dum, or <b>African</b> <b>mahogany</b> (Oldfieldia africana), well known in Ceylon as excellent material for boat-building. There was an abundance of the Calabar-bean (Physostigma venenosum), once used for an ordeal-poison, and now applied by surgery in ophthalmic and other complaints. The 'tie-tie,' as Anglo-Africans call the rope-like creepers, was also plentiful; it may prove valuable for cordage, and possibly for paper-making. I was pleased to see the ease with which the heaped-up jungle-growth is burnt at this season and the facility of road-making. Half a dozen Kru-boys with their matchets can open, at the rate of some miles a day, a path fit to carry a 'sulky;' and the ground wants only metalling with the stone which lines every stream. At the same time I hold that here, as in Mexico, we should begin with railways and tramways. Nor will there be any difficulty in keeping down the jungle. The soft and silky Bahama-grass has been brought from Sá Leone to Axim, where it covers the open spaces, and it grows well at Akankon. There is no trouble except to plant a few roots, which extend themselves afar; and the carpet when thick allows, like the orange-tree, no undergrowth.|$|E
