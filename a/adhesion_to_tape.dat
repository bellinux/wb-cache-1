A quantitative adhesion assay using image analysis identified fundamental differences in the mechanism of adhesion of A. pullulans blastospores <b>to</b> these substrata, <b>Adhesion</b> <b>to</b> pPVC was greater than that to uPVC by a maximum of 280 % after a 4 -h incubation with 10 (8) blastospores ml(- 1).

Hydrophobic interactions were found <b>to</b> dominate <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> uPVC because (i) a strong positive correlation was observed between substratum hydrophobicity (measured by using a dynamic contact angle analyzer) and <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> a range of unplasticized polymers including uPVC, and (ii) neither the pH nor the electrolyte concentration of the suspension buffer, both of which influence electrostatic interactions, affected <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> uPVC.

ECM binding is mediated by cell-adhesion molecules, the membrane expression of {{which might be}} influenced by soluble mediators, such as cytokines. The aims of our study were to ascertain whether epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), interleukin 1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha), or interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) can modify MIA PaCa 2 (pancreatic cancer cell line) and CAPAN- 1 (metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line) <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> fibronectin, laminin, or type I collagen, and whether these cytokines can shift the membrane expression of the hyaluronic acid receptor (CD 44). EGF significantly enhanced MIA PaCa 2, but not CAPAN- 1, <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> fibronectin, laminin, and type I collagen. TGF-beta 1 reduced MIA PaCa 2 <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> type I collagen, but enhanced CAPAN- 1 <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> fibronectin and laminin. IL- 1 alpha was found to enhance MIA PaCa 2 <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> fibronectin, while reducing <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> type I collagen, whereas IL- 1 beta reduced the <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> laminin. IL- 1 alpha enhanced CAPAN- 1 <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> laminin in a dose-dependent manner; IL- 1 beta slightly increased the adhesion of these cells to laminin at low dosage, and to type I collagen at high dosage. Both IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta reduced CD 44 membrane expression of MIA PaCa 2, while TGF-beta 1 increased the percentage of CD 44 -positive CAPAN- 1 cells. We suggest that the effects on cell adhesion induced by different cytokines depend {{on the status of}} the target pancreatic cancer cell. EGF and, in part, IL- 1 alpha can favor nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> ECM, possibly favoring tumor spread. Metastatic cells seem to lose the responsiveness to EGF, while becoming hyperresponsive to IL- 1 alpha. TGF-beta 1 might exert an antidiffusive effect on primary, and a prodiffusive effect on metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. Only IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, and TGF-beta 1 seem to influence CD 44 membrane expression.

The ability of the tumour cells {{to adhere to the}} EC monolayer was significantly reduced by application of flow at a shear rate of 250 s(- 1). A 2. 2 -fold increase in tumour cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> ECs under flow was observed upon addition of thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) -activated platelets but not resting platelets. A similar increase (2. 5 -fold) in tumour cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> ECs under flow was observed when the tumour cells were incubated with resting platelets on thrombin-treated ECs. However, thrombin treatment of the ECs alone had no effect on tumour cell adhesion in the absence of platelets. The enhancement of tumour cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> ECs by TRAP-activated platelets was virtually abolished by blockade of the platelet glycoproteins P-selectin and GPIIb-IIIa by monoclonal antibodies. Blockade of P-selectin also inhibited the direct adhesion of TRAP-activated platelets to ECs, but did not affect the interaction of the tumour cells with platelets immobilized on subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM). Blockade of GPIIb-IIIa inhibited both platelet-EC and platelet-tumor cell interactions. Our results indicate that tumour cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> the endothelium under flow is enhanced by platelets under conditions that allow platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> ECs.

40|$|Serratia marcescens is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen and a {{major cause}} of ocular infections. In previous studies of S. marcescens MG 1, we showed that biofilm maturation and sloughing were regulated by N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) -based quorum sensing (QS). Because of the importance of adhesion in initiating biofilm formation and infection, the primary goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether QS is important in <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> both abiotic and biotic surfaces, as assessed by determining the degree of attachment to hydrophilic tissue culture plates and human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Our results demonstrate that while <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> the abiotic surface was AHL regulated, <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> the HCE cell biotic surface was not. Type I fimbriae were identified as the critical adhesin for non-QS-mediated attachment to the biotic HCE cell surface but played no role in <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> the abiotic surface. While we were not able to identify a single QS-regulated adhesin essential for attachment to the abiotic surface, four AHL-regulated genes involved in <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> the abiotic surface were identified. Interestingly, two of these genes, bsmA and bsmB, were also shown to be involved in <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> the biotic surface in a non-QS-controlled fashion. Therefore, the expression of these two genes appears to be cocontrolled by regulators other than the QS system for mediation of attachment to HCE cells. We also found that QS in S. marcescens regulates other potential cell surface adhesins, including exopolysaccharide and the outer membrane protein OmpX. We concluded that S. marcescens MG 1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to biotic and abiotic surfaces and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> an abiotic surface but not in <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> a biotic surface...|$|R

CADM 1 downregulation, but not antibody-dependent CADM 1 inhibition, reduced MC <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> ECM, suggesting indirect regulation of ECM <b>adhesion.</b> <b>To</b> investigate potential mechanisms, phosphotyrosine signalling and polymerisation of actin filaments, essential for integrin-mediated adhesion, were examined. Modulation of CADM 1 expression positively correlated with surface KIT levels and polymerisation of cortical F-actin in HMC- 1 cells. It also influenced phosphotyrosine signalling and KIT tyrosine autophosphorylation. CADM 1 accounted for 46 % of surface KIT levels and 31 % of F-actin in HMC- 1 cells. CADM 1 downregulation resulted in elongation of cortical actin filaments in both HMC- 1 cells and human lung MCs and increased cell rigidity of HMC- 1 cells.
