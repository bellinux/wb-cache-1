25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> into this year.|$|E

She said {{the world was}} eager {{to see a new}} American foreign policy and that, [...] "There is a great {{exhalation}} of breath going on around the world. We've got a lot of damage to repair." [...] She did indicate that not every past policy would be repudiated, and specifically said it was essential that the six-party talks over the North Korean nuclear weapons program continue. Clinton re-emphasized her views during her first speech to State Department employees when she said, [...] "There are three legs to the stool of American foreign policy: defense, diplomacy, and development. And we are responsible for two of the three legs. And we will make clear, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> that diplomacy and development are essential tools in achieving the long-term objectives of the United States. And I will do all that I can, working with you, to make it abundantly clear that robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America's future." [...] Clinton also soon visited the United States Agency for International Development, where she met employees and said they would be getting extra funds and attention during the new administration.|$|E

It was no use running, and I threw myself down, in hopes they would think I had been knocked over. You passed within thirty yards of me. Our guns opened so heavily on them, after you had got through, that I thought it prudent to keep quiet a little longer before I made a move; and the result was that the Austrian cavalry, as it came along in the pursuit of our men, picked me up.|$|R

The speech of Faust {{concerning}} him is mis-translated by Shelley, who understood the humour of the piece, {{as well as the}} poetry, but not the particular humours of it. Nothing can be more expressive of a conceited, narrow-minded reviewer. 'Oh he!--he is absolutely everywhere,--What others dance, he must decide upon. If he can't chatter about every step, 'tis as good as not made at all.

60|$|I {{described}} {{fully the}} market at Attegrat in a former letter; and as this was precisely the same scene upon a rather larger scale, I have little to add to what I then said. Very large quantities of flour were brought in, and the commissariat secured a considerable supply. Numbers of mules, donkeys, and cattle were also there. The small-goods market too was crowded, and herbs and grain of all sorts—onions, chillies, cloth, {{and most of the}} other articles I mentioned as having seen at Attegrat—were here, with the exception only of pumpkins, of which I did not see a single specimen. I, however, bought three pounds of coffee, which I look upon as a great prize, as it will be a change from the excessively bitter herb termed by courtesy tea. The commissariat have purchased a considerable quantity of coffee, and I am told we shall find it much more plentiful <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> This will be a very great boon for the men.|$|E

5000|$|In Blackest Night #2, {{multiple}} {{black power}} rings attempt to reanimate {{the body of}} Don Hall, only to be prevented from disturbing his grave by an invisible barrier. As they collide with the barrier, the rings' typical command ("rise") is interrupted; the rings instead respond: [...] "Don Hall of Earth at peace." [...] This is the first depiction of the black power rings failing to recruit a member for the Black Lantern Corps. In an interview with IGN, Johns provides an explanation behind Dove's immunity to the black power rings: [...] "You'll learn more about this <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> But really it speaks {{to the nature of}} Don Hall.

[...] Steven Parrish, vice-president at Philip Morris, stating that [...] "We understand that this was not only a terrible mistake, but that it was wrong. To say it's inappropriate is an understatement." [...] In an internal memo, CEO John R. Nelson agreed with critics that the report [...] "exhibited a callous and cynical disregard of basic human values." [...] On July 26, 2001, Phillip Morris issued an apology in the Wall Street Journal:For one of our tobacco companies to commission this study (AD Little Report concluding that smokers save the state money - by dying early) was not just a terrible mistake, it was wrong. All of us at Philip Morris, no matter where we work, are extremely sorry for this. No one benefits from the very real, serious and significant diseases caused by smoking.

5000|$|Self-gravity is {{influential}} in understanding sea {{level and the}} ice caps for oceanographers and geologists, which is particularly important <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> trying to anticipate the effects of climate change. The deformation on the Earth from {{the forces of the}} oceans can be calculated if the Earth is treated as fluid and the effects of self-gravity are taken into account and this allowed for the influence of ocean tide loading {{to be taken into account}} when observing the Earth's deformation response to harmonic surface loading. The results of calculating post-glacial sea levels near the ice caps are significantly different when using a flat Earth model that does not take self-gravity into account, as opposed to a spherical Earth where self-gravity is taken into account because of the sensitivity of the data in these regions, which shows how results can drastically change when self-gravity is ignored. There has also been research done to better understand Laplace's Tidal Equations to try to understand how deformation of the Earth and self-gravity within the ocean affect the M2 tidal constituent (the tides dictated by the Moon). There have been suggestions that if the Greenland ice complex melts, the sea level will actually fall around Greenland and rise in areas further away because the effects of self-gravity [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} Annales Cavenses are not originally {{conceived as}} an independent work, because their com-pilation depends, in a symbiotic way, on preexisting chronological tables; nevertheless, they are an important source {{for the history of}} Southern Italy. With their unique and sometimes ingenious system of marginal an-notations, they provide, initially, only a list of emperors or events, such as eclipses, election of abbots, deaths of local lords. However, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> over the years and we approach the time of their compiler, or compilers, the simple catalogue comprehends longer and more structured information, showing also the ideo-logical leaning and the culture of the author. Some particular information, however, could be so compromis-ing that the next compiler was forced to correct or erase what had been written earlier. Annales Cavenses, in short, represent an eloquent example of the most characteristic products of medieval historiography...|$|E
30|$|The results {{shown in}} Figure 6 {{indicate}} that for GOPs 1 and 4, the CADF scheme without heuristics incurs higher distortion than the baseline Foschini-Miljanic algorithm. This is because, without the heuristics, the CADF scheme measures channel conditions only once per second. In particular, the channel parameters {{are taken from}} the first 2 ms slot during which the GOP is transmitted. Since one GOP takes about 1000 time slots for the chosen video, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> in time, our optimization continues to use the old channel gains. Thus, {{if there is a}} substantial change in channel gains from the original values, the optimization performs sub-optimally. This is indicated by the measurements of the channel capacity variance, also shown in the same figure plotted with reference to the right-hand y-axis. For GOPs 1 and 4, we see a high variance in channel capacity. The Foschini-Miljanic algorithm, however, uses current channel conditions while determining the target SIR in the outer loop, and therefore performs better in some cases.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} eight years, we have worked on the general {{problems}} associated with grain boundaries in metals with DOE support. This final report summarizes the work that has been performed. At {{the start of this}} work, we took a much more atomistic approach to grain boundaries. However, as we performed this research it became clear that such approaches had the drawbacks listed above, and that we were not proceeding toward the more general understanding of grain boundaries that we have hoped to achieve. We then moved toward more macroscopic based experiments that we could use to understand the structure and motion of grain boundaries. From these we were able to begin deducing {{some of the most important}} results of this work and to provide information that can be used by others to understand the role of grain boundaries in materials. We thus present this report in a topical way and provide the experimental and theoretical underpinning that is needed at each point <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward...</b>|$|E
