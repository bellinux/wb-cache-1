25|$|The {{topic of}} animal {{consciousness}} is beset {{with a number}} of difficulties. It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot tell us about their experiences. Also, it is difficult to reason objectively <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.|$|E

When questioned directly, Hutchinson accused the other ministers of preaching works and not grace, but did this only in private. These theological differences had begun to take their toll in the political aspects of the colony, and the Massachusetts governor, Henry Vane, who was a strong free grace advocate, announced his resignation to a special session of the deputies. While citing urgent matters back in England as being his reason for stepping down, when prodded, he broke down, blurting out his concern that God's judgment would [...] "come upon us for these differences and dissensions". The members of the Boston church successfully induced Vane to withdraw his resignation, while the General Court began to debate {{who was responsible for}} the colony's troubles. The General Court, like the remainder of the colony, was deeply divided, and called for a general fast to take place on 19 January in hopes that such repentance would restore peace.|$|E

2500|$|Heidegger claimed {{philosophy}} and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, {{which was a}} superficial way of understanding them. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of Franz Brentano's treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word [...] "being", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, Being and Time, with a citation from Plato's Sophist indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered obvious, rather than as worthy of question. Heidegger's intuition <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the [...] "history of Being", that is, {{the history of the}} forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive destruction of the history of philosophy.|$|E

Maurice thought that the basis of Laplace's beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast to his conviction that the invariability {{of the laws of}} nature did not permit of supernatural events. After Laplace's death, Poisson told Maurice, [...] "You know that I do not share your [...] opinions, but my conscience forces me to recount something that will surely please you." [...] When Poisson had complimented Laplace about his [...] "brilliant discoveries", the dying man had fixed him with a pensive look and replied, [...] "Ah! we chase after phantoms [...]" [...] These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the ultimate [...] "vanity" [...] of earthly pursuits.

[...] In such a structure, some churches would be given full membership of the Anglican Communion, while others had a lower-level form of membership, with no more than observer status on some issues. Williams also used his keynote address to issue a profound apology for the way that he had spoken about [...] "exemplary and sacrificial" [...] gay Anglican priests in the past. [...] "There are ways of speaking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> that seem to ignore these human realities or to undervalue them," [...] he said.
