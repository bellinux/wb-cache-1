5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage {{is the body}} of special privileges belonging {{to members of the}} British peerage. It is distinct from parliamentary privilege, which <b>applies</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> those peers serving in the House of Lords {{and the members of the}} House of Commons, while Parliament is in session and forty days before and after a Parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form <b>applies</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and <b>applies</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E

5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping <b>applies</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping {{is not as}} significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping. Photon diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.|$|E
