With the advent of computers and increasing needs of digital data, PWD is facing the challenge of providing current accurate and spatially referenced information. This project explains the concepts of using Geographic Information System (GIS) {{as a way to}} store spatial data extracted from <b>As-built</b> <b>Drawing</b> or CAD drawing. Spatial data management is easier and more natural to users as it can be manipulated, retrieved, and related to all other data stored in the database. The method involves is by integrating and establishing of <b>As-Built</b> <b>Drawing</b> with Geographic Information System in die inventory of PWD road network and road assets. Fundamentally, GIS and CAD systems are different but PWD is taking advantage with the similarity of the elements in both systems, combining die technology and the resources that it has.

40|$|This {{document}} {{establishes a}} systematic program to establish, organize, and document the design basis and design requirement {{information for the}} K Basins where existing design information is inadequate. The Design Reconstitution Program involves identifying and retrieving design information from identified source documents; evaluating, verifying, and validating the design information; resolving discrepancies; regenerating missing critical design information; and preparing and issuing a summary document of the design information. Upon completion, the design requirements shall be evaluated with the facility as-found configuration to verify the adequacy of appropriate design requirements with the as-found configuration and to document and resolve any discovered discrepancies. Once the design requirement (design analysis, calculation, design basis) comparison is made and discrepancies resolved (dispositioned, implemented, and incorporated as required), the as-found condition of a drawing then becomes an <b>as-built</b> <b>drawing</b> that is released into the engineering release system. This <b>as-built</b> <b>drawing</b> is then the accurate accounting of the field configuration {{that is consistent with}} the design requirements (recovered through the design reconstitution program) and is used with high confidence to make valid engineering, operational, and maintenance decisions...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} a single span simply supported steel truss railway bridge is analyzed when subjected to train loads. The {{study was conducted}} by using three different methodologies namely modal analysis using three dimensional finite element models of a bridge based on <b>As-built</b> <b>drawn</b> from scratch; a time history analysis and field measurement on an existing bridge. The finite element models of the bridge were modeled using two methodologies; using beam and shell elements. A time history analysis involves developing an equation of motion for the forced and free vibration of the bridge when subjected to both a single- and successive train loads. The dynamic responses studied include the displacement, acceleration and natural frequency of the bridge which were compared for different train speeds, span length, and {{the mass of the}} bridge. Field measurement was conducted using accelerometers and displacement transducers which were mounted on a self-designed mounting section.

40|$|Abstract: A frequency-response function–based parameter-estimation {{method was}} used for finite-element (FE) model {{calibration}} of a full-scale bridge using measured dynamic test data. Dynamic tests were performed on the bridge to obtain measured frequency-response functions. Data quality was ensured by comparing measured data with the FE model and removing erroneous data. A coherence data selector was developed to remove the noise-contaminated portions of themeasured frequency-response functions. An unrefined FEmodel was created using design information for the geometry and structural parameters. This model was improved to a refinedmodel by using concrete cylinder property data, <b>as-built</b> <b>drawing</b> geometry, {{and the addition of}} components that participate in the dynamic response of the bridge. Simulations were performed using the model to ensure both observability and identifiability of structural parameters. The model of the bridge was then calibrated successfully usingmeasured frequency-response functions. An increase in the negative bending region concrete-deck rigidity was found during the calibration and verified by increased reinforcement in that area. Examining the second norm of the residual between the different models and the measured data resulted in an improvement from the unrefined to the calibrated FE model. The proposed method proved to be robust in the presence of modeling andmeasurement errors and computationally efficient for use with full-scale structures. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) BE. 1943...|$|E

It {{requires}} {{the implementation of}} land-use restrictions to prevent exposure to potentially dioxin-contaminated soils beneath IR Site 30 from an “old trash dump ” situated along a waterline replacement area within 11 th Street {{to the north of}} IR Site 30 noted on a 1989 <b>as-built</b> <b>drawing</b> in both the short term and long term, and allows IR Site 30 to be used in its current and future use as a daycare center. The RD/RAWP specifies the roles and responsibilities for implementing, monitoring, and enforcing the engineering controls (ECs) and institutional controls (ICs) specified in the ROD. At sites, such as IR Site 30, where contaminants are left in place at levels that do not allow for unrestricted use, Land Use Controls (LUCs) are used to ensure that the contaminants do not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. LUCs are defined as any restriction or administrative action, including ECs and ICs, arising from the need to reduce risk to human health and the environment. The selected remedy in the ROD utilizes both ECs and ICs. The IR Site 30 ECs specify maintaining the building foundation slab to prevent contact with potential dioxin contamination beneath the slab.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} research is to study the precision of pile foundation position compared to its original predetermined location. The deviations of pile foundations (precast piles), which {{is defined as the}} lateral displacement of the pile head, were collected from <b>as-built</b> <b>drawing</b> documents that were prepared after the piling activity at each project has completed. The precision of the pile foundation position is evaluated using available Standards such as British Standard, Canadian Standard, and Indian Standard. Those three standards employing maximum pile head movement of 75 mm, except for Canadian standard that allows lateral dislocation up to 150 mm, when the measurement were taken after the entire piling activity of a project has been done. The results of 19 projects that employing pile foundations with dimension ranging from 250 mm to 600 mm, show that about 40 % pile with diameter of 600 mm and about 60 % pile with diameter 500 mm deviated lateraly less than 75 mm. While for pile with diameter ranging from 250 mm to 450 mm, between 65 % to 70 % were driven in the tolerance of 75 mm from its original design location. In other words, it can be concluded that the deviation of pile location influenced by pile dimension. The bigger the dimension of piles the smaller the percentage of piles driven in the 75 mm tolerance from its designed locatio...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that construction industry is information intensive and complex industry. However, present trend and proliferations towards multi-participant mega projects have heightened {{the need for}} an effective and efficient evaluation and monitoring by stakeholders. A persistent problem in construction has been in documenting changes, which occur in the field, and preparing the as-built schedule. Combining computer vision technology with 3 D CAD to produce <b>as-built</b> <b>drawing</b> offers a potential solution. However a recent investigation indicated that {{there is a lack of}} systematic and automated evaluation and monitoring in construction projects. The aim of this research is to identify techniques which are used in the construction industry for monitoring and evaluating the actual physical progress and to establish how the current computer technology can be used for monitoring the construction physical progress on site. 3 D CAD is increasingly being used as a design tool for construction projects and digital images can be used to provide accurate information needed to document as-built construction schedule. The DCM provides a bridge for storing structural design information in an integrated construction relational database management system that can be shared by a range of computer applications. The DCM model is a part of developing the Tele-Construction base site management system, which retrieves the status of construction work in progress and develop the actual progress bar chart. A pilot study of Car Parking for Larkin Mosque is conducted to check the validity of DCM. The application of DCM model in monitoring the progress enables project management teams to better track and controls the productivity and provides better mechanism for management of projec...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNuclear {{fuel cycle}} {{facility}} under construction at Kalpakkam houses more than 200 process vessels and equipments of different capacity and configurations and about 62 Kms of piping of varying sizes from 8 DN to 250 DN in about 5000 m 3 of concrete cell volume. Austenitic stainless steel 304 L {{has been widely}} used as work horse material for this plant due to its resistance to corrosion in acidic environment. The fabrication works of this facility involves more than 70000 weld joints for interconnecting various vessels, equipment and associated piping system. Pneumatic pressure testing and soap bubble leak testing are the two methods effectively {{used to assess the}} final integrity of the system after fabrication and erection. Physical verification of entire piping system as per the approved <b>as-built</b> <b>drawing</b> is a pre pneumatic test requirement. During physical verification, entire piping system will be physically scanned by visual inspection methods for orientation, gradient and also to identify any surface imperfections. Even though all surfaces of the piping system are examined before giving clearance for welding, the surfaces will be re-examined prior to integrity testing to ensure that piping system orientation is as per approved design and its surfaces are free from damages. Orientation and slope {{plays an important role in}} nuclear fuel cycle facility. Because nuclear fuel cycle facility is designed in such a way that gravitational force is effectively used to transfer process fluid to avoid the usage of moving mechanical parts. This is one of the zero maintenance design feature of nuclear fuel cycle facility. Based on experience many procedures are developed to ensure the intended design requirements. Before proceeding to the integrity testing, one has to verify the completion of all quality control stage inspection activities during fabrication by way of documents verification pertaining to the weld joints and loop involved in the testing. All inspection documents right from raw material identification, fabrication and inspection of components are to be verified prior to integrity testing. Verification of large number of inspection related documents posses a very big challenge. To meet this herculean task in time, an asset management system is designed and developed in house. Asset management system plays a key role in storage and retrieval of all inspection credentials and NDE images involved in the system, and with least amount of time these can be retrieved and verified. The asset management system also plays a constructive role during the pre commissioning activities of the plant. This paper emphasis the optimization methodologies adopted during integrity testing...|$|E
