40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} between the South African Grade 11 Life Sciences curriculum documents, <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge and behavioural preferences of students was investigated. The Life Sciences curriculum and textbooks used in Grade 11 Life Sciences were analysed to determine the curriculum ideology of the subject and concepts related to <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS that are prescribed for teaching with the aim of educating students about <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS and promoting safe behaviour. Life Sciences and non-Life Sciences students were compared to determine whether academic <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge taught in Life Sciences was related to functional <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge and behavioural preferences. Findings indicate that Life Sciences does not promote safe behaviour related to <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS. Furthermore Life Sciences is knowledge-oriented <b>and</b> integrates <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge as extra content. In addition Life Sciences does not have a clear curriculum ideology for <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS education even though it has characteristics of various curriculum ideologies with greater emphasis on the scholar academic ideology. The Life Sciences curriculum makes provisions for the construction <b>and</b> application of <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge, but it does not provide guidance with regards to application of knowledge. Moreover textbooks are not consistent with regard to presentation of content and do not present sufficient content for meaningful application in everyday life. Results also showed that academic <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge improves some students’ knowledge of functional <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge. It was also found that <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge does not significantly correlate with some students’ behaviour presumably because students have difficulty in relating Life Sciences knowledge to real life. Consequently some students do not fully know some <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS concepts, and they rely on alternative means to respond to questions for which {{they do not have the}} necessary content knowledge. It was also found that some students do not take ownership of social problems related to <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS. The researcher believes that there is a need to review <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS education in Life Sciences by basing it on a precise curriculum ideology that will ensure that suitable scientific content, which may lead to behaviour transformation, is integrated.

40|$|Coinfections {{of sexually}} {{transmitted}} infections are frequent {{due to the}} same transmission routes which may facilitate the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections. Sexually transmitted coinfections are associated with atypical and generally more severe clinical features, more complications, resistency to treatment, unfavourable outcome, and worse prognosis.

These infections are more frequent in HIV infected patients than in the normal population. The shared transmission routes, impairment of the immune response, elevated cytokine levels and the associated inflammatory milieu produce local tissue damage, breaches in mucosal epithelium, which increases the risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Regular screening for sexually transmitted infections, use of more sensitive diagnostic methods, improved reporting and avoidance of unsafe sexual behaviour among certain subpopulations as well as education are essential in the prevention of sexually transmitted coinfections...|$|R

In 2011, Folding@home began simulations {{of the dynamics}} of the enzyme RNase H, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. South Africa has {{the fastest}} growing <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS {{epidemic}} {{in the world and}} it has become {{the leading cause of death}} in the country. Its greatest impact is felt on the economically active population. Educators form part of this population. Mitigating the impact of the disease on the education sector is critical, for education is seen as the 'social vaccine' against the <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS epidemic, in the absence of a medical cure. <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS have serious ramifications for the education sector. The AIDS tragedy will continue to manifest itself in an increase in the number of AIDS orphans, as educators succumb to the disease, and learners are taken out of school to take care of ailing parents. In order to manage the impact of the disease in schools, the implementation and management of the <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS policy are essential. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact educator knowledge on <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS had on the management of the <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS policy. It further attempted to assess whether educator knowledge on the <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS policy impacted on the management thereof. Finally, it examined how the training needs with respect to the aforementioned, as well as the training needs of educators to provide care and support to people infected <b>and</b> affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS, impacted on the management of the <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS policy. The research was conducted within the Ekurhuleni East District (D 5). The quantitative method was deemed most appropriate for the study. A questionnaire was used to illicit educator responses.

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy.

Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life.
