50|$|An {{isoclinic}} line connects points of equal magnetic dip, and an <b>aclinic</b> <b>line</b> is the {{isoclinic line}} of magnetic dip zero.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic dip {{results from}} the {{tendency}} of a magnet to align itself with lines of magnetic field. As the Earth's magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface, {{the north end of}} a compass needle will point downward in the northern hemisphere (positive dip) or upward in the southern hemisphere (negative dip). The range of dip is from -90 degrees (at the South Magnetic Pole) to +90 degrees (at the North Magnetic Pole). Contour lines along which the dip measured at the Earth's surface is equal are referred to as isoclinic lines. The locus of the points having zero dip is called the magnetic equator or <b>aclinic</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
