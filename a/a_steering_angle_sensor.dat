50|$|VSA {{combines}} the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Traction Control System (TCS) with side-slip control to help stabilize the vehicle whenever it turns {{more or less}} than desired. ABS is an existing system that prevents the vehicle's wheels from locking up under braking, especially in slippery road conditions. For the ABS to work, the system relies on the computed input from <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> to monitor the driver's steering direction, the yaw sensor to detect the momentum of which the wheels are steering (yaw rate), and a lateral acceleration (g-force) sensor to signal the changes in speed. At the same time, the TCS will prevent wheel slip during acceleration while the side-slip control stabilizes cornering when the rear or front wheels slip sideways (during oversteer and understeer).|$|E
40|$|An {{instrumented}} four-wheeled robot {{was constructed}} to investigate steering-induced tip-up and rollover of four-wheeled vehicles, {{and the possibility}} of stabilizing and driving while balanced on two wheels. Using an analogy to a cart-pole controller, an energy shaping controller was developed to drive the vehicle's roll energy to a fixed value and stabilize the vehicle in a tipped-up position. The controller was implemented on experimental hardware, which included an ARM 7 -based FEZ Domino microcontroller and a MicroStrain 3 DM-GX 2 inertial measurement unit. Data logged during experimental trials were analyzed in MATLAB to assess the stability and effectiveness of the controller. Experimental results indicate the controller is capable of driving the vehicle to the tipped-up balancing position.

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> <b>sensor,</b> and <b>a</b> gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.|$|R
40|$|Wheel shimmy and wobble {{are well}} known dynamic {{phenomena}} at automobiles, aeroplanes and motorcycles. This eigenmode excites in particular oscillations of the wheel about the steering axis, {{and it is no}} surprise, that unstable bicycle wobble is perceived unpleasant or may be dangerous, if not controlled by the rider in time. Basic research on wobble at motorcycles within the last decades has revealed a better understand-ing of reasons for the sudden onset of wobble, and the complex relations between parameters affecting wobble have been identified. These fundamental findings have been transferred to bicy-cles. As mass balances and inertial properties, rider influence and lateral compliances of tyre and frame do differ at bicycle and motorcycle, approved models to represent wobble at motorcycles have to prove themselves, when applied at bicycles. For that purpose numeric results are compared with measurements at test runs, and parametric influences on the stability of the wobble mode at bicycles have been evolved.

The performance of the three types of integration algorithm is evaluated based on two data sets. The results indicate that both the GNSS/WSS/YRS integration and the GNSS/WSS/YRS/SAS integration could estimate the horizontal position with meter-level accuracy during 30 -second GNSS outages.

40|$|In {{the highly}} {{competitive}} automotive industry, OEM and tier-I suppliers face {{the problem of}} determining costs and creating accurate and rapid schedules for current and future product developments. Successful companies in this industry {{are those that are}} able to forecast and meet important deadlines, satisfy performance requirements and reduce costs to keep development within budget. But frequently one or two factors are achieved {{at the expense of the}} others. Sometimes, for example, suppliers are able to cut costs, but only at the expense of quality. Or they can increase quality at expense of costs. Both scenarios are of concern, especially when competitors are attempting to capture market share. Engineers and program managers require powerful techniques to have better estimates of completion time versus expenditures. Unfortunately, though, there are not yet such tools available that are capable of incorporating both dimensions of product quality and cost. Moreover, it would be desirable to incorporate product performance with those two dimensions in order to obtain a broad perspective of the entire design. The main goal of this thesis is the investigation, evaluation and application of the research reported in the Ph.

This is achieved by superimposing crossed, steered beams, which is referred to as &ldquo;lateral modulation&rdquo; (LM). This type of beamforming achieves almost the same accuracy in lateral displacement measurements as in axial displacement measurements, ie, displacement vector measurements. The <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> (ASTA) can also be used instead of LM, which uses only beams with <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle.</b> In this report, the accuracy of the displacement vectors and lateral displacement measurements for LM and ASTA were evaluated using simulations and agar phantom experiments. The parameters used were direction of <b>a</b> displacement vector, <b>steering</b> <b>angles,</b> and rotation angle for the coordinate system. Changes in the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and rotation angle of the coordinate system permit control of frequencies in the respective directions of the coordinate axes. As shown, when performing a simple ASTA for displacement vector measurement, a spectra frequency division should be performed using a previously developed multidimensional autocorrelation or Doppler method instead of block-matching methods. In this version of ASTA, the combination of nonsteering and rotation of the coordinate system is also effective, because the lateral bandwidth does not decrease. In such a case, transmission of a laterally wide wave will also be effective, particularly for three-dimensional measurement/imaging using a two-dimensional array transducer. ASTA can also be used for accurate lateral displacement measurements.
