50|$|Achievement Orientation {{refers to}} how an {{individual}} interprets and reacts to tasks, resulting in different patterns of cognition, affect and behavior. Developed within a social-cognitive framework, <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> theory proposes that students’ motivation and achievement-related behaviors {{can be understood}} by considering the reasons or purposes they adopt while engaged in academic work. The focus is on how students think about themselves, their tasks, and their performance. In general, an individual {{can be said to}} be “mastery” or “performance” oriented, based on whether one’s goal is to develop one’s ability or to demonstrate one’s ability, respectively. Achievement orientations {{have been shown to be}} associated with individuals’ academic achievement, adjustment, and well-being.|$|E
50|$|Her work {{is unique}} in that it investigates {{motivation}} in real-life situations while using motivational principles discovered in laboratory situations. Notable studies employ psychological concepts and findings in hopes of improving the American educational system. Also, her research is often centered on intrinsic motivation, sometimes studied {{over long periods of}} time to track change. Another goal of Harackiewicz is to research, improve, and revise the <b>Achievement</b> <b>Goal</b> Theory. Overall, the key aspect of her study is theoretical synthesis, meaning that her combined findings between the laboratory and survey research are mainly executed to question pre-existing motivational psychology theories. Harackiewicz has been recognized for her achievements with the 2013 Cialdini Award from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology.|$|E
30|$|More recently, {{attention}} has been directed to the consequences of pursuing <b>achievement</b> <b>goals.</b> For instance, <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> positively predict long-term academic performance (Harackiewicz, Barron, Tauer, Carter, & Elliot, 2000). Moreover, <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> can activate intrinsic motivation (Cury, Elliot, Sarrazin, Da Fonseca, & Rufo, 2002). Based on this finding, Lee, Sheldon, and Turban (2003) argue that <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> promote academic enjoyment. In contrast, researchers also find that negative emotions can be exacerbated by <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> due to high expectations. For example, students aspiring for high <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> may experience more anxiety during tests (Flanagan, Putwain, & Caltabiano, 2015).|$|R

Existing theories and empirical {{findings suggest that}} <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> are potentially related to life satisfaction. However, the relationship between <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> and life satisfaction remains relatively unexplored in the psychology literature. In this study, we examined how, why, and when <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> affect life satisfaction using original survey data from China. The results suggest that <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> were positively related to life satisfaction (R 2  = . 20, 90 % CI [. 11, [...]. 26]), that the perception of successful agency fully mediated the relationship between <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> and life satisfaction (R 2  = . 22, 90 % CI [. 12, [...]. 27]), and that emotion reappraisal moderated the relationship between <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> and life satisfaction (R 2  = . 34, 90 % CI [. 23, [...]. 39]). Our study indicates that <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> have {{a positive influence on}} life satisfaction and help to elucidate the mechanism and boundary condition of this influence.|$|R
30|$|Through {{a survey}} study of 225 {{participants}} in China, {{we find that}} <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> are positively related to life satisfaction.

Specifically, {{this study examines}} elementary teachers 2 ̆ 7 <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations, self-efficacy for teaching, and perceptions of help-seeking {{in the context of}} high-stakes testing and school accountability under No Child Left Behind and an Elementary and Secondary Education Act waiver. Butler 2 ̆ 7 s (2007) teacher <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientation framework provided the theoretical basis of the present study; high-stakes tests and school accountability status were thought to impact teachers’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations. Additionally, teachers 2 ̆ 7 <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations were thought to impact teaching self-efficacy and perceptions of help-seeking. The sample included 381 elementary school teachers. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and hierarchical multiple regression were used to examine the relationships between and among high-stakes testing and issues teachers perceive to be related to these tests, stress related to high-stakes tests, school accountability status, teachers’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations, teaching self-efficacy, and perceptions of teacher help-seeking. Results suggest that, for this sample, dimensions of teachers’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations differ from the dimensions characterized by Butler and colleagues (Butler, 2007; Butler 2 ̆ 6 Shibaz, 2008; Nitsche et al., 2010; Cho 2 ̆ 6 Shim, 2013; Shim et al., 2013). Specifically, teachers in this sample exhibited mastery and work-avoidance goals, as characterized by Butler (2007), but not performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. Teachers here distinguished between personal performance orientation, or motivation driven by external factors (e. g., recognition from administrators) and using others as the referent to which they compared their own performance (e. g., colleagues). Additionally, class performance orientation emerged as a distinct dimension of teachers’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations for this sample. Those who espoused this orientation sought for their classes to compare favorably with other classes and were motivated by external factors, such as their class scoring high on state-wide tests. Teacher <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations were related to high-stakes testing, but school issues related to high-stakes testing and stress associated with these tests were more salient predictors of teachers’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations than whether teachers taught in testing grades or not. Finally, teachers’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations were significant predictors of self-efficacy for teaching and teachers’ perceptions of their own help-seeking...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> and mental health, {{and the effect}} of the related factors Abstract Recently, adolescent’s mental health and depression problem have been widely concerned all over the world. Studies concerning it have been done from different perspectives. High school is the key period of adolescent’s physical and mental development, when they may have a high risk of mental conflicts, certain behavioral and emotional problems. Through questionnaire with high school students as subjects, this study examines <b>achievement</b> <b>goal,</b> self-concept, social comparison and the {{relationship between}} these factors and mental health. This study consists of three parts: 1) a preliminary exploration of the relationship between vocational school students’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal,</b> self-concept and their mental health; 2) a revision of the simplified Chinese version for Dykman’ s goal Orientation Inventory; 3) a further discussion on the relationship between high school students’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goal,</b> self-concept, social comparison and depression. Major findings of this study are: 1. 	Dykman’s Goal Orientation Inventory is revised. This revised version, with high validity and reliability, conforms to Dykman’s theoretical assumptions and can be a convenient and effective measurement for <b>achievement</b> <b>goal.</b> 2. 	Self-concept and <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> of vocational school students can make a significant prediction of their mental health. Learning goal influences mental health through self-concept. 3. 	<b>Achievement</b> <b>goal,</b> self-concept and social comparison of high school students are closely related to their depression. 4. 	Self-concept and social comparison of high school students are the mediator variable between <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> and depression. The theoretical and practical implications of this study: 1. With the simplified Chinese version of Dykman’s Goal Orientation Inventory revised and used first in this study, its applicability is inspected and the conclusion drawn by Dykman on the prediction of <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> on depression is examined as well; on the basis of previous studies, a comprehensive and systematic study is done on how the factors work together to influence mental health(particularly depression). 2. This study enrichs the studies with high school students as subjects. It provides methods and basis for the theoretical studies and interference about high school students’ mental health education and depression problem. 近年来青少年心理健康及抑郁问题受到国内外普遍的关注，研究者从不同的角度对其进行了研究。高中阶段是青少年生理、心理发育的关键时期，也是心理冲突和行为、情绪问题发生的高发期。本研究以高中生为样本，采用问卷法，考察了成就目标、自我概念、社会比较与心理健康的关系。研究分为三个部分：研究一初步探讨职高生成就目标、自我概念与心理健康的关系；研究二主要对Dykman的目标定向问卷进行中文版简版的修订；研究三对高中生成就目标、自我概念、社会比较与抑郁的关系进行进一步的研究验证。 本研究的主要结果如下： 1. 	修订Dykman的目标定向问卷（Goal Orientation Inventory）。修订后的中文版简版目标定向问卷符合Dykman的理论假设，具有较好的信、效度，是测量成就目标的方便、有效的测量工具。 2. 	职高生的心理健康状况能由自我概念及成就目标进行有效预测。成就目标对心理健康的影响受到自我概念的中介作用。 3. 	高中生成就目标、自我概念、社会比较都与抑郁关系密切，是影响抑郁的重要因素。 4. 	高中生自我概念、社会比较因素是成就目标与抑郁之间的中介变量。 本研究的理论意义和实践意义： 1 ．通过对Dykman（ 1998 ）目标定向问卷的修订和在国内的首次应用，考察问卷的适用性和Dykman的成就目标对抑郁的预测作用的研究结论；并在前人研究的基础上，就影响心理健康（特别是抑郁）的相关因素的共同作用做较综合、系统地研究。 2 ．补充和丰富了以高中生为对象的相关研究，为高中心理健康教育、高中生抑郁问题的理论研究和干预提供了方法和依据...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{the past}} 2 decades, {{research}} findings established <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> theory {{as a powerful}} framework for conceptualizing difference {{in the quality of}} student’s engagement, persistence on task, and academic resilience. So the present study examined the relationship between <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations and academic resilience. Method: Participants were 606 students (307 girls and 297 boys) selected from Shiraz high schools. They completed the Achievement Goals Questionnaire and Youth development Module Scale (RYDM). To analyze the data, the relationships between variables were examined, using Pearson product– moment correlations. Also simulanteous multiple regression was performed to investigate the prediction of academic resilience by <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations. To examine the reliability and the validity of measures Cronbach alpha coefficient and factor analysis method were applied, respectively. Results: Simultaneous multiple regression of <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations on academic resilience showed that “mastery-approach” was a significant positive predictor of the “home care/high” and “peer care” subscales. Also, “performance-approach” was a significant, positive predictor of “home care/ high”, and “school/community meaningful” was predicted by “performanceavoidance” positively. Conclusion: According to the findings, it seems that <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientation has a critical role in students’ academic achievement.

The <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> of adolescent basketball players was examined, looking at differences based on the gender and ethnicity of the participants. The study included 250 adolescent basketball players ranging in age from 9 to 14 years old, and currently participating in basketball leagues and tournaments within Central Indiana and Western New York. All of the participants completed the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ), which consisted of four demographic questions examining the gender, age, ethnicity, and how long the adolescent had been participating in the sport of basketball on a team. The means of the two subscales, task and ego, were calculated for all of the completed questionnaires. The Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data according to the four research questions. All four research questions were not significant; there were no significant differences in the adolescent basketball players' <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientation based on age, gender, and ethnicity.

Although there is a great deal of research on teachers ’ classroom assessment practices, few empirical research attempts have been made to link these practices to students’ perceptions of classroom assessment environment and motivation defined in terms of <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations. This study examined teachers ’ assessment practices within the framework of classroom assessment literature and <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> theory. More specifically, the purposes of this study were to identify the underlying dimensions of students ’ perceptions of classroom assessment environment and <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations and to investigate the possible effects of certain student-level and class-level characteristics on perceived classroom assessment environment and <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientations. The participants were 1, 636 ninth grade students and their corresponding 83 science teachers enrolled in public schools within Muscat educational region in Oman 2 during the spring semester 2007. Two questionnaires were developed and used, one fo...|$|E
40|$|This study {{builds on}} {{previous}} research combining <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientation from <b>Achievement</b> <b>Goal</b> Theory and motivational regulation from Self-Determination Theory. The {{aim was to}} assess the combination of the “what” and “why” of youth sport activity, and how it relates to the need for competence and self-esteem. <b>Achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientation, specifically task and ego, was employed to represent the “what”, whilst intrinsic and external regulation reflected the “why”. Based on a sample of 496 youth sports participants, structural equation modeling with a bootstrapping procedure was used to examine whether the indirect relationship between <b>achievement</b> <b>goal</b> orientation and self-esteem was conditional to motivational regulation. The results show partial support for the conditional process models. Specifically, task orientation was indirectly linked with self-esteem through competence need, and the relationship was stronger with higher levels of intrinsic regulation for sport. Furthermore, ego orientation was negatively associated with self-esteem through a positive relationship with competence frustration. However, this relationship emerged only for those higher in intrinsic regulation. External regulation did not emerge as a moderator, but presented a positive relationship with competence frustration. Findings are discussed in light of both <b>Achievement</b> <b>Goal</b> Theory and Self-Determination Theory, and underline the importance of considering both the “what” and “why” when attempting to understand motivation in youth sport...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} the relationship between self-efficacy and <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> (mastery-approach, mastery- avoidance, performance-approach and performance-avoidance), with metacognition. The population of this study consisted of female high school students (2010 - 2011) in Iran. The sample of this study consisted of 230 first-grade female students who were selected randomly by multi-stage random sampling method. The instruments for collecting data consisted of self-efficacy subscale of MSLQ (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia & Mckeachie, 1993) three subscales (mastery-approach, performance-approach and performance-avoidance) of Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (Midgley, 2000), mastery-avoidance subscale of <b>Achievement</b> <b>Goals</b> Scale (Andrew, Elliott, Holly, Mc-Gregor, 2001) and Metacognition Awareness Inventory (Schraw & Dennison, 1994). The results of simple correlation showed that positive relationships exist between self-efficacy, <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> (except mastery-avoidance) and metacognition. The regression analysis also revealed that self-efficacy and <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> have important roles in predicting metacognition factors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the role of graduate students’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> in their disposition towards critical thinking in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. In a descriptive- correlation study, a sample consisting 167 graduate students was selected by using stratified random sampling method. They completed Midgley et al. ’s (1998) Goal Orientations Questionnaire and Ricketts’ (2003) Critical Thinking Dispositions Questionnaire. Results showed statistically significant relationship between all three components of students’ <b>achievement</b> <b>goals</b> and their critical thinking disposition and 62 % of variance of critical thinking disposition could be predicted by <b>achievement</b> <b>goals.</b> Besides, only the master goals could singly predict critical thinking disposition...|$|R
