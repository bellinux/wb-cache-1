5000|$|According to Ernest Mandel, {{the law of}} value, as a law of exchange, did {{influence}} non-capitalist {{societies to}} some extent, inasmuch as exchange and trade persisted, but because the state directed the bulk of economic resources, the law of value no longer ruled or dominated resource allocation. The best proof of that {{was that there was}} mostly no clear relationship at all anymore between the exchange-value of goods traded, how they were allocated, and what it really cost to produce them; accounting information, insofar as it was valid, might in fact be unable to show anything about the real nature of resource allocation. The prices in the Soviet economy were, for the most part, not market prices but administered prices set by the planning boards (there was also a black market, mainly for consumer goods). [...] Insofar as the social priorities of state policy ensured that people got what they needed, that was a good thing; but insofar as resources were wasted {{because of a lack of}} sensible cost-economies, it was a bad thing.

5000|$|In a {{national}} poll released in December 2011, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind asked voters whether they “support or oppose changing {{the federal law}} to allow sports betting” in their respective states. Just as many voters approved (42%) as opposed (42%) allowing sports betting. However, voters who already live in households where family members (including themselves) engage in sports betting had a strongly favored legalization of sports betting (71%-23%), while voters in households where sports betting is not an activity, opposed legalization (46%-36%). Peter J. Woolley, {{professor of political science}} and director of the poll commented on the findings, “Gambling has become, for good or ill, {{a national}} industry, and you can bet that politicians and casinos all over the country are closely following New Jersey’s plans.”In a different study released by FDU’s PublicMind in October 2011, results showed that New Jersey voters thought legalizing sports betting in New Jersey was a good idea. Half of New Jersey voters (52%) said that they approved the idea of legalizing sports betting at Atlantic City casinos and racetracks, 31% opposed it. In addition, there was a significant gender split: a majority of men approved of the idea by a wide margin (65-21), while only 39% of women approved and 41% opposed.The October results were stable, reflecting an earlier poll in April 2011 where New Jersey voters approved the legalization of sports betting in the state by a margin of 53%-30%. However, nearly two-thirds (66%) of voters were not aware of the upcoming statewide referendum on the issue. Age proved to be a divide: voters between the ages 18 and 34 were more likely to approve of sports betting than were older voters. Dr. Woolley commented: [...] "But... younger voters... are far less likely to vote than other voters... As always, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> who actually shows up to vote." ...|$|E

Kashyap Colony will be made a part of the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), which is for urban areas." [...] When asked when the village was likely to get power, he stated, [...] "The scheme is not ready yet but it will happen soon." [...] Three months later, electric poles were installed in Kashyap Colony. Pankaj Sharma, representing Meerut Nagrik Adhikar Manch (MNAM), the local NGO that had been supporting the village in its effort, said: [...] "For years, the villagers had approached various authorities and made rounds to the corridors of power. But all they got were empty promises. Whomever the villagers approached said they would ensure that the village got electricity, but nobody gave them a timeline. When we met the villagers, we advised them to launch an organized protest, and only after that the authorities woke up and promised the villagers that they would get electricity supply by Diwali. But, villagers, who had earlier got only empty promises, would not be satisfied till they actually saw something concrete. On Monday, electric poles were finally erected in the area, bringing the hope to the villagers that they won't have to celebrate Diwali in the dark this year." [...] V. V. Panth, managing director of Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), the engineering company in charge of the project, said:"The work was initially thrown off schedule for a while, but now we are back on track. The poles that were given to us earlier were of substandard quality. We rejected those poles. After about a week's delay, the work is back on track. Poles have been erected and it will take about a month to complete the work.
