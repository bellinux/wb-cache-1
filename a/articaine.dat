50|$|Studies {{comparing}} lidocaine and <b>articaine</b> {{found that}} <b>articaine</b> {{is more effective}} than lidocaine in anaesthetising the posterior first molar region. <b>Articaine</b> {{has been found to be}} 3.81 times more likely than lidocaine to produce successful anaesthesia when used for infiltration injections.

50|$|The amide {{structure}} of <b>articaine</b> {{is similar to}} that of other local anesthetics, but its molecular structure differs through the presence of a thiophene ring instead of a benzene ring. <b>Articaine</b> is exceptional because it contains an additional ester group that is metabolized by esterases in blood and tissue. The elimination of <b>articaine</b> is exponential with a half-life of 20 minutes. Since <b>articaine</b> is hydrolized very quickly in the blood, the risk of systemic intoxication seems to be lower than with other anesthetics, especially if repeated injection is performed.|$|E

50|$|Injections without anesthetics, or dry needling, and {{injections}} including saline, {{local anesthetics}} such as procaine hydrochloride (Novocain) or <b>articaine</b> without vasoconstrictors like epinephrine, steroids, and botulinum toxin provide more immediate relief {{and can be}} effective when other methods fail. In regards to injections with anesthetics, a low concentration, short acting local anesthetic such as procaine 0.5% without steroids or adrenalin is recommended. High concentrations or long acting local anesthetics as well as epinephrine can cause muscle necrosis, while use of steroids can cause tissue damage.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used local anesthetic is lidocaine (also called xylocaine or lignocaine), a modern replacement for procaine (also known as novocaine).

Other local anesthetic agents in current use include <b>articaine</b> (also called septocaine or ubistesin), bupivacaine (a long-acting anesthetic), and mepivacaine. A combination of these may be used depending on the situation. Also, most agents come in two forms: with and without epinephrine (adrenaline) or other vasoconstrictor that allow the agent to last longer and also controls bleeding in the tissue during procedures. Usually the case is classified using the ASA Physical Status Classification System before any anesthesia is given.|$|E

The results from their analysis seemed to indicate that 4% local anesthetics had a higher incidence of causing paresthesia, an undesirable temporary or permanent complication, after the injection. The authors concluded that “...the overall incidence of paresthesia following local anesthetic administration for non-surgical procedures in dentistry in Ontario is very low, with only 14 cases being reported out of an estimated 11,000,000 injections in 1993.

40|$|Background: Successful local {{anesthesia}} is {{the bedrock of}} pain control in endodontics. Pain control is essential to reduce fear and anxiety associated with endodontic procedure. The aim of study was, identifying and comparison of the anesthesia efficacy of <b>articaine</b> and <b>articaine</b> plus morphine for buccal infiltration in mandibular posterior teeth with irriversible pulpitis. Materials and Methods: This randomized double-blind clinical trial included 75 patients with symtomatically irreversible pulpitis in mandibular teeth. Patient divided 3 groups randomly received either a buccal infiltration of 4 % <b>articaine</b> with 1 : 100000 epinephrine or <b>articaine</b> morphine with 1 : 100000 epinephrine or IAN block of 2 % lidocaine with 1 : 800000 epinephrine. Self-reported pain response was recorded on VAS scale before and after local anesthetic injection during access preparation. For statistical analysis were used χ 2, t-test, one way ANOVA and Mann Whitney. Results: Statistical analysis result show success rate of <b>articaine</b> (68 %), <b>articaine</b> morphine (52 %) and lidocaine (64 %).

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the speed of}} action and injection discomfort of 4 % <b>articaine</b> and 2 % mepivacaine for upper teeth extractions. Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients {{were included in the}} <b>articaine</b> 4 % group, and 45 in the mepivacaine 2 % control group. After all injections, soft and hard tissue numbness was objectively gauged by dental probe at intervals of 15 s. Furthermore, the discomfort of the injections were recorded by the patients after each treatment on standard 100 mm visual analog scales, tagged at the endpoints with “no pain” (0 mm) and “unbearable pain” (100 mm). Results: There were significant differences in the meantime of first numbness to associated palatal mucosa and tooth of patients between mepivacaine and <b>articaine</b> buccal infiltration (BI) groups P = 0. 01 and 0. 01. Patients in the <b>articaine</b> group recorded earlier palatal mucosa and teeth numbness than those in the mepivacaine group. With regards to the discomfort of the needle injections, palatal injection was significantly more painful than BI (t-test: P< 0. 001). <b>Articaine</b> buccal injection was significantly more painful than mepivacaine buccal injection (t-test: P< 0. 001). However, <b>articaine</b> palatal injection was less painful than <b>articaine</b> BI. Clinically, anesthesia onset time was faster in anterior upper teeth than upper middle and posterior teeth. Conclusions: BIs with 4 % <b>articaine</b> was faster in achieving palate and teeth anesthesia than 2 % mepivacaine for extraction of upper maxillary teeth. Patients in mepivacaine BI and <b>articaine</b> palatal injection groups reported less pain with needle injection. Failure of anesthesia was noticeable with maxillary multiple-rooted teeth...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{prilocaine}} and <b>articaine</b> are short-acting {{local anaesthetics}} suited for spinal anaesthesia for day-case knee arthroscopy. <b>Articaine</b> {{is thought to}} have a faster onset and shorter duration of action than prilocaine, although no comparative study has been published in the anaesthetic literature. METHODS: In this prospective randomized double-blind study, spinal anaesthesia was performed in 72 ASA I-II patients undergoing knee arthroscopy with 50 mg of either plain prilocaine or plain <b>articaine.</b> The primary outcome variable was duration of motor block. Secondary outcomes were onset of sensory and motor blocks, maximum spread of the sensory block, time to spontaneous voiding, and side-effects. RESULTS: Time to full motor function recovery was shorter after <b>articaine</b> than prilocaine [mean (SD) 140 (33) vs 184 (46) min, respectively, P< 0. 001]. Time to spontaneous voiding was shorter after <b>articaine</b> than prilocaine [mean (SD) 184 (39) vs 227 (45) min, respectively, P< 0. 001]. One patient in the <b>articaine</b> group reported mild transient neurological symptoms (TNS) limited to the first postoperative day, but {{there were no significant differences}} in adverse effects between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anaesthesia with plain <b>articaine</b> 50 mg resulted in a faster recovery of motor function and earlier spontaneous voiding compared with plain prilocaine 50 mg.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare <b>articaine</b> and bupivacaine for day-case lower limb surgery. Methods. Eighty patients planned for day-case lower limb surgery enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized to receive hyperbaric <b>articaine</b> 80 mg or plain bupivacaine 15 mg intrathecally. Primary outcome variable was recovery time from motor block. Secondary outcomes were: onset of sensory and motor block, maximum spread of sensory block, time to micturition, discharge from the hospital, and complications. Results. The groups were comparable for the medians and the range of the maximum blocks after 30 min. Median time to complete regression of motor block was 101 min (range 80 - 129) for <b>articaine</b> compared with 307 min (range 225 - 350) for bupivacaine (P< 0. 0005). First spontaneous micturition occurred after 257 min (210 - 293) in the <b>articaine</b> group and after 350 min (304 - 370) in the bupivacaine group (P< 0. 0005). In the <b>articaine</b> and bupivacaine groups, patients were discharged after 300 min (273 - 347) and 380 min (332 - 431), respectively (P< 0. 0005).

Materials and Methods: A total of 23 healthy adult volunteers received two regimens with at least 1 -week apart; one with 4 % <b>articaine</b> buccal infiltration and 2 % mepivacaine IANB (<b>articaine</b> regimen) and another with 2 % mepivacaine buccal infiltration supplemented to 2 % mepivacaine IANB (mepivacaine regimen). Pulp testing of first molar tooth was electronically measured twice at baseline, then at intervals of 2 min for the first 10 min, then every 5 min until 45 min postinjection. Anesthetic success was considered when two consecutive maximal stimulation on pulp testing readings without sensation were obtained within 10 min and continuously sustained for 45 min postinjection. Results: In total, the number of no sensations to maximum pulp testing for first molar teeth were significantly higher after <b>articaine</b> regimen than mepivacaine during 45 min postinjection (267 vs. 250 episodes, respectively, P 0. 05).
