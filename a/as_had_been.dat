5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220. The fleet was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> agreed at the congress in 481 BC. Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.|$|E
5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done in the original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, {{although much of the}} matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E

5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began to run out the clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to massive}} {{destruction}} {{in the town}} of Sandakan since the war, Jesselton was chosen to replace the capital with the Crown continued to rule North Borneo until 1963. The Crown colony government established many departments to oversee the welfare of its residents and to revive the economy of North Borneo after the war. Upon Philippine independence in 1946, seven of the British-controlled Turtle Islands (including Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi and Mangsee Islands) off the north coast of Borneo were ceded to the Philippines <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> negotiated by the American and British colonial governments.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Constantinople (1453), the newly {{expanded}} Ottoman Empire welcomed European embassies in its capital, which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire. In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the Silk Road <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> transported in the previous two thousand years, mainly as bulbs. Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value. Initially Italy benefited from this new knowledge, especially Venice, which traded extensively with the East. From there these new plants rapidly spread {{to the rest of}} Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|From May 1945 No.75 Squadron {{participated in}} the Borneo Campaign. While the squadron's ground crew landed on Tarakan with the {{invasion}} force in early May 1945, delays with repairing the island's airfield meant that its aircraft could not be deployed there until mid-July rather than 3May <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> originally planned. During this period No.75 Squadron's pilots remained at Morotai but conducted little flying, causing their morale to decline. Once established at Tarakan the Kittyhawks attacked targets near Sandakan and supported Australian forces during the Battle of Balikpapan in the war's last weeks.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the case in Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated {{in the discussion of}} how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E
5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. <b>As</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done to Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and when {{given the opportunity to}} debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, the Ministry of Justice {{announced}} plans to close 54 county courts and 103 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, {{in order to save}} £15m in annual running costs and £22m in necessary maintenance.

In addition, it was proposed that Newport County Court would no longer hold hearings at Chepstow every fortnight (<b>as</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done since the county court there closed in 2002). After consultation, it was decided to keep Llangefni County Court open, but the other closures were confirmed.|$|E
