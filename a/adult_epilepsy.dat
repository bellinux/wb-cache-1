40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the direct and indirect cost of epilepsy using the latest survey data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The study pooled MEPS data from 2003 through 2012 for the civilian non-institutionalized adult population. To estimate the direct cost of epilepsy, self-reported healthcare utilization, payment record and personal characteristics were obtained from the survey for <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy,</b> and compared to the general population of <b>adults</b> without <b>epilepsy.</b> For indirect costs, the forgone current dollar value of earnings due to epilepsy was estimated by comparing differences in employment, wage income, and days of work missed for <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> to the general adult population. Multivariate regression modeling and propensity score matching were used to control for differences in the characteristics of the epilepsy and general population in making the comparisons. ^ There were 684 epilepsy-diagnosed (0. 28 %) and 241, 418 non-epilepsy adult respondents in the 10 -year cohort of the pooled MEPS data from 2003 through 2012. The baseline characteristics of <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> were significantly different from those without epilepsy except for sex, and diagnosed status as asthma, diabetes and hypertension. status. ^ <b>Adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> were married less often than those without epilepsy, were covered by public insurance more often than by private insurance, responded their perceived health status as poor more often, and felt depression daily most of time more often than those with no epilepsy. But, these characteristics were no longer significantly different between the two groups in the matched cohort, except for the insurance type. ^ The average annual direct cost of <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> was $ 2, 515 higher than <b>adults</b> with no <b>epilepsy.</b> The excess cost is attributable to the following differences in utilization. The utilization rate of office-based physician visits for <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> was 1. 2 times higher, compared to the matched cohort of <b>adults</b> without <b>epilepsy.</b> The rate of all health provider visits, including non-physician visits, of <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> was also 1. 2 times higher.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of autism spectrum disorders in epilepsy is approximately 15 %- 47 %, {{with previous research}} by Wakeford and colleagues reporting higher autistic traits in <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate autistic characteristics and their relationship to having seizures by employing two behavioral assessments in two samples: <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> and controls. Method: The study employed the Social Responsiveness Scale - Shortened (SRS-S) (patients with epilepsy (n. =. 76), control (n. =. 19)) and the brief Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) (patients with epilepsy (n. =. 47), control (n. =. 21)). This study employed a unique method to quantify the extent to which autistic characteristics are related to perceived mild seizure activity. <b>Adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> were instructed to rate their usual behavior on each assessment and, at the same time, rate their behavior again when they perceived that they were having mild seizure activity.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{examine the}} process for {{transitioning}} adolescents on dietary management for intractable epilepsy to adult neurologic care. MethodsTen patients, ages 6 – 16 years when the ketogenic or modified Atkins diet was initiated, were identified; age at transition was 18 – 43 years. All patients were seen at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. ResultsSeven remain on diets (4 Ketogenic, 3 modified Atkins diet) at this time with mean diet duration of 15. 5 years (range 4 – 32 years). Most patients had excellent but not complete seizure control and several had recurrence or worsening of seizures with attempts to wean dietary therapy, hence the need to continue. Three main transition options were utilized: (1) continue being followed in pediatric clinic (n= 2), (2) establish care with an adult neurologist (n= 2), or 3) receive care from the <b>Adult</b> <b>Epilepsy</b> Diet Center (n= 6).

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of autism spectrum disorders [ASD] in epilepsy is approximately 20 %- 32 %, {{with previous research}} reporting high rates of under-diagnosis of ASD in epilepsy. Current psychological assessments were adapted to provide epilepsy-specific measures of behaviour, which increased validity by addressing specific methodological problems highlighted by several researchers. The initial experiments provided a comprehensive investigation of autistic traits and characteristics in a heterogeneous group of <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> without any ASD diagnosis to quantify {{the extent to which}} autistic characteristics are related to seizure activity. <b>Adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> showed higher autistic traits and impaired social responsiveness while systemizing and empathising abilities remained intact. Further, autistic traits and impaired social responsiveness increased again during seizure activity. Social responsiveness positively correlated with anti-epileptic drug [AED] control. <b>Adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> and seizure remission demonstrated significant improvements in restricted, repetitive behaviours compared to adults with current epileptic seizures. Together, these results demonstrate a relationship between seizure activity and autistic characteristics, and are consistent with previous suggestions that AEDs may mask autistic characteristics. The impaired social skills and communication are consistent with research suggesting that the pathogenesis of epilepsy may disrupt social functioning. However, whether this can be directly attributed to social cognitive deficits remains uncertain. The main research addresses this uncertainty by conducting three experiments to assess the Somatic Marker Hypothesis and the mechanisms which underpin it. The rationale is to establish whether this is a valid explanatory model for disrupted neurobiological factors implicated in social cognitive processing. This hypothesis is appropriate for investigating <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy,</b> some who may have developed typical social abilities in early life before epilepsy onset. Results from the IOWA Gambling Task demonstrated that <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> had impaired decision making abilities compromising somatic marker formation, crucial for social cognition. However, this deficit occurred in the absence of other socio-emotional and memory impairments. In conclusion, <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> have a higher rate of autistic characteristics, and their social difficulties may be associated with compromised somatic marker formation.

40|$|Introduction: The {{reported}} {{prevalence of}} autism spectrum disorders {{in people with}} epilepsy ranges from 15 % to 47 %. Despite the high comorbidity, {{there has been a}} lack of systematic studies of autistic characteristics in epilepsy. Little is known about the relationship of epilepsy to the core characteristics of autism. The aim of this research was to measure autistic traits and characteristics in <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> who do not have a diagnosis of any autism disorder. Method: We investigated autistic characteristics in <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> and those without epilepsy employing the Autism Spectrum Quotient (group with epilepsy, n=. 40; control group, n=. 38) and systemizing and empathizing abilities employing the Intuitive Physics test and the Adult Eyes Task-Revised (group with epilepsy, n=. 19; control group, n=. 23). Results: Significantly more autistic behavioral traits, as measured by the AQ, were related to having epilepsy, but intact systemizing and empathizing abilities in these adults suggest that, in <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy,</b> autism-like symptoms may be present in the absence of wider cognitive profiles characteristic of autism.

40|$|Introduction: There {{is a high}} {{prevalence}} of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) inepilepsy. ASDs are characterised by a deficit of social interaction, social communication,and restricted, repetitive behaviours. Previous research by Wakeford and colleaguesreported higher autistic characteristics in <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> who had no diagnosis ofan ASD. A subsequent study found that while sameness behaviours were unimpaired,adults with epilepsy reported poor reciprocal social interaction, revealing difficultiesin social interactions, a characteristic of autism. The Somatic Marker Hypothesisproposes that neural systems supporting decision-making overlap with componentsof a neural circuitry which guide social behaviour. Impaired decision-making abilitiesunder ambiguity may indicate compromised somatic marker formation, crucial forsocial cognition. The present paper aims to investigate ambiguous decision making,and whether the Somatic Marker Hypothesis is a valid explanatory model for thesecognitive features of epilepsy. Method: Our experiment investigated ambiguous decision-making abilitymeasured by the IOWA Gambling Task in <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy.</b> Results: <b>Adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> demonstrated impaired decision-making abilitiescompared to <b>adults</b> without <b>epilepsy,</b> likely to result from compromised somatic markerformation.

The short-term open-label prospective observational study that maximally approximated to routine clinical practice was conducted. The follow-up of patients lasted 2 months. The study included 494 patients over 18 years of age (mean age 30. 2 ± 14. 1 years) with different types of epilepsy. Symptomatic focal epilepsies were noted in 52 % of all cases, presumably symptomatic and idiopathic generalized epilepsies in 16. 8  and 29. 8 %, respectively; unspecified ones in 1. 4 % of cases. The patients received Depakine Chronosphere in an average daily dose of 18. 58 ± 5. 53  mg/kg. The efficacy of the drug was evaluated from the change in the number of seizures; moreover, subjective assessments of therapeutic effectiveness were made by a physician and a patient. The safety was estimated from patients' reports on adverse reactions during the follow-up. Results. More than 90 % of all the patients responded to Depakine Chronosphere positively (seizures ceased or decreased in number).  Seizures completely disappeared in 64. 6 % of the patients. The drug was proven to be effective in different types of epilepsy (both partial and generalized ones). Depakine Chronosphere was well tolerated in this study. Adverse events were observed in 15. 7 % of the patients, but they gave grounds to discontinue the drug only in 0. 8 % of all cases. The physicians and patients unanimously assessed the efficiency of therapy as very good and good in over 90 % of cases. The good efficacy and tolerance of the agent are supported by the data of an analysis using the global clinical rating scale: during the treatment, there was a marked improvement and no side effects in 61. 1 % and a marked improvement and mild side effects in 17 %.

We examine our 5 -year experience creating and implementing a dedicated <b>Adult</b> <b>Epilepsy</b> Diet Center designed to provide adults with epilepsy access to ketogenic diets. Material and methodsOutpatients seen at the Johns Hopkins <b>Adult</b> <b>Epilepsy</b> Diet Center from August 2010 thru September 2015 age 18 years and older were enrolled in a prospective open-label observational study. Patients that also enrolled in ongoing clinical diet trials were excluded from this study. Participant demographics, diet type, urine and/or serum ketones, laboratory studies, seizure frequency, diet duration, reason for discontinuing diet therapy, and side effects were recorded. A subgroup analysis of participants that met International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and were treated de novo with a Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) was performed to compare outcomes with the current literature regarding efficacy of other antiseizure treatments for DRE. ResultsTwo hundred and twenty-nine adults attended the <b>Adult</b> <b>Epilepsy</b> Diet Center, and 168 met inclusion criteria. Two-thirds (n= 113, 67 %) were women with an age range of 18 – 86 years at the initial visit. Thirty-five participants (21 %, n= 133) were already on a therapeutic diet while 79 % (n= 133) were naïve to diet therapy {{at the time of}} the initial visit. Diet-naïve participants were typically prescribed MAD (n= 130, 98 %), unless unable to intake adequate oral nutrition, in which case they were prescribed KD (n= 1) or a combination of oral MAD and ketogenic formula (n= 2). Twenty-nine of 130 (22 %) participants prescribed MAD elected not to start or were lost to follow-up, and 101 (78 %) began MAD. A subgroup analysis was performed on one hundred and six participants naïve to diet therapy that met International League Against Epilepsy criteria for DRE, were able to tolerate oral nutrition, and were prescribed a MAD. Relative to the number of enrolled participants who had reliable follow-up results for a given duration (including those that ultimately elected not to start or were later lost to follow-up), at 3 months, 36 % of these participants responded (≥ 50 % seizure reduction) to diet therapy, and 16 % were seizure-free. At 1 year, 30 % responded, and 13 % were seizure-free. At 4 years, 21 % responded, and 7 % were seizure-free. Hyperlipidemia was the most common side effect (occurring in 39 % of screened participants, including those on a therapeutic diet prior to the initial visit). Weight loss was also common (occurring in 19 % of all participants treated with a ketogenic diet therapy) yet was often an intended effect. SignificanceThis study, the largest series of adults with epilepsy treated with ketogenic diet therapies to date, provides evidence that ketogenic diets may be feasible, effective, and safe long-term in adults, although long-term adherence was limited and further adequately controlled studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of ketogenic diets in the treatment of adults with epilepsy...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Familial <b>adult</b> myoclonic <b>epilepsy</b> (FAME) is {{associated}} with myoclonus, tremor, and rare seizures, and is a nonprogressive disorder linked to the FAME 1 locus. A similar disorder {{has been linked to}} the FAME 2 locus. METHODS: Seventeen patients from two families with myoclonus and epilepsy were evaluated clinically and underwent EEG, EMG, jerk-locked averaging, and MRI scanning. Three had responses to magnetic stimulation assessed. Linkage was assessed for microsatellite markers across the FAME 1 and 2 loci. RESULTS: The median age at onset was 20 years, with many patients having frequent seizures, cognitive impairment, and cerebellar dysfunction. Electrophysiologic features of cortical myoclonus were typically present, but photosensitivity was uncommon. MRI frequently demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Pathology of a single case showed Purkinje cell loss, dentate atrophy, and neuronal loss and gliosis in the olives and pallidum. Analysis of genotypes for markers at the FAME 1 and FAME 2 loci excluded these as the region containing the same locus in one family, but only the FAME 2 locus was excluded in the other family. CONCLUSIONS: This form of familial <b>adult</b> myoclonic <b>epilepsy</b> does not show linkage to either of the known familial <b>adult</b> myoclonic <b>epilepsy</b> loci, and is characterized in some members by frequent seizures, cerebellar ataxia, dementia, and progression of the disease.

40|$|IntroductionCommunity-based {{and other}} {{epidemiologic}} studies within the United States have identified substantial disparities {{in health care}} among <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy.</b> However, few data analyses addressing their health-care access {{are representative of the}} entire United States. This study aimed to examine national survey data about <b>adults</b> with <b>epilepsy</b> and to identify barriers to their health care. Materials and methodsWe analyzed data from U. S. adults in the 2010 and the 2013 National Health Interview Surveys, multistage probability samples with supplemental questions on epilepsy. We defined active epilepsy as a history of physician-diagnosed epilepsy either currently under treatment or accompanied by seizures during the preceding year. We employed SAS-callable SUDAAN software to obtain weighted estimates of population proportions and rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. ResultsCompared to adults reporting no history of <b>epilepsy,</b> <b>adults</b> reporting active <b>epilepsy</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} be insured under Medicaid (RR = 3. 58) and less likely to have private health insurance (RR = 0. 58). <b>Adults</b> with active <b>epilepsy</b> were also less likely to be employed (RR = 0. 53) and much more likely to report being disabled (RR = 6. 14). They experience greater barriers to health-care access including an inability to afford medication (RR = 2. 40), mental health care (RR = 3. 23), eyeglasses (RR = 2. 36), or dental care (RR = 1. 98) and are more likely to report transportation as a barrier to health care (RR = 5. 28). ConclusionsThese reported substantial disparities in, and barriers to, access to health care for <b>adults</b> with active <b>epilepsy</b> are amenable to intervention.

Partial-onset epilepsies account for about 60 % of all <b>adult</b> <b>epilepsy</b> cases, and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) {{is the most common}} type of partial epilepsy referred for epilepsy surgery and often refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Little is known about the epidemiology of TLE, because it requires advanced neuroimaging, positive EEG, and appropriate clinical semiology to confirm the diagnosis. Moreover, recently recognized incidentally detected mesial temporal sclerosis in otherwise healthy individuals and benign temporal epilepsy indicate that the true epidemiology of TLE is underestimated. Our current knowledge on the epidemiology of TLE derives from data published from tertiary referral centers and/or inferred from population-based studies dealing with epilepsy. This article reviews the following aspects of the epidemiology of TLE: definitions, studies describing epidemiological rates, methodological observations, the interpretation of available studies, and recommendations for future studies. 1...|$|E
40|$|Non-compliances to anti epileptic {{drug therapy}} {{is one of}} the commonest causes of relapse of seizure. The various factors {{influencing}} non-compliance in a state government hospital where patients below poverty line are issued free drugs once in 2 weeks are unknown. In this study, 200 <b>adult</b> <b>epilepsy</b> patients consisting 100 complaint and non- complaint in each group were interviewed with a structured questionnaire. The relevant demographic and clinical characteristics such as awareness of altitude towards purchasing the drugs were collected. The data was analyzed using student "t" test and chi square test. The factors influencing non-compliance were, a) difficulty in collecting the drugs once in 2 weeks from the hospital (45 &#x 0025; vs. 21 &#x 0025;:p value < 0. 001), b) Lack of family supported (42 &#x 0025;vs. 29 &#x 0025;:p value < 0. 05), c) Mental adverse effects of the drugs (54 &#x 0025;vs. 33 &#x 0025;: value < 0. 002) and d) Poor motivation. The attitude of the patients was negative towards purchasing drugs even at times of emergency (84 &#x 0025; vs. 44 &#x 0025;:p value < 0. 001).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that JME (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy), when compared to other <b>adult</b> <b>epilepsy</b> syndromes, is most likely to have a genetic cause. However, decades of research have not brought us closer to finding a single 'JME gene' that is important on a population basis. Is this {{due in part to the}} genetic complexity of the syndrome, the cryptic nature of the genes of effect, or perhaps because JME is not one condition at all but many? Before we can begin to harness the power of next-generation sequencing techniques, we must first reduce JME down to lacunae of homogeneity [...] using increasingly more sophisticated phenotyping tools. The current technological advances in gene sequencing have been used to dramatic effect to identify single gene causes in rare syndromes and identify risk variants in malignancies. Filtering the variety of the human exome or genome down into a handful of biologically plausible candidates now relies on a pipeline of biostatistics, software, and functional analyses. It is simply unacceptable to return uncertain findings to the clinical domain and, therefore, it is crucial that pathogenicity is fully determined before families receive genetic counseling and test results...|$|E
