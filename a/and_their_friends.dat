5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends.</b> However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's family, Yuri, Galina and Yuri Churbanov, were {{investigated}} and all, {{with the exception}} of Galina, were arrested on charges of political corruption during Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law, was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption. By December 1988 Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, {{along with the rest of}} Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges. The city of Brezhnev reverted to its old name Naberezhnye Chelny, and a group within the Soviet leadership wanted to rename all towns, street, factories and institutions bearing Brezhnev's name. This was actually carried through by the authorities in December 1988 when the Soviet Government issued a decree which stated all town, streets, factories, institutions and the like bearing Brezhnev's and Konstantin Chernenko's were to revert to their former name. According to his grandson Andrei Brezhnev, the very name Brezhnev had become a curse for the family, and several family members had been forced out of their jobs <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends</b> had deserted them. Brezhnev, who had inflated his role in World War II, was rescinded the Order of Victory on 21 September 1989 in a Supreme Soviet convocation.|$|E

5|$|Months before Entre a Mi Mundo was {{scheduled}} to be released, Pérez was booked on charges for driving under the influence, assaulting police officers, resisting arrest, and initiating a high-speed chase with police. In December 1992, Pérez was convicted and was ordered to pay $670 (1992 USD) in fines, court costs, and attorney fees. Pérez wrote that he felt guilty for the crimes that he was charged with, noting that Selena tried to convince Abraham that Pérez was a well-rounded person. Pérez later told Abraham about his wrongdoing, but was dumbfounded when Abraham forgave him, a reaction that Pérez was not expecting. After the band completed the recording sessions for Entre a Mi Mundo, several members of the band <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends</b> went to a hotel in San Antonio, Texas to celebrate. According to Pérez, he, along with several of his friends, trashed the hotel. The next morning, Abraham was contacted by the manager of the hotel where the incident took place; Abraham immediately fired two road crew members. Pérez believed that Abraham would come for him next and fire him, but found that after he had apologized, Abraham accepted his apology and allowed him to continue being the band's guitarist.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine {{had died in}} apartment 5A {{as a result of}} an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop.

5|$|Though {{they were}} influential, Pericles, Aspasia <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends</b> were not immune from attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Her relationship with Pericles and her subsequent political influence aroused many reactions. Donald Kagan, a Yale historian, believes that Aspasia was particularly unpopular {{in the years}} immediately following the Samian War. In 440 BC, Samos was at war with Miletus over Priene, an ancient city of Ionia in the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians. When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration at Athens, the Samians refused. In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos. The campaign proved to be difficult and the Athenians had to endure heavy casualties before Samos was defeated. According to Plutarch, it was thought that Aspasia, who came from Miletus, was responsible for the Samian War, and that Pericles had decided against and attacked Samos to gratify her.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Howard Thurman {{became the}} Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, {{after ten years}} in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was {{prompted}} {{by the desire to}} share their ideas of outreach and inclusion in a university setting, though they were aware that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends.</b> Shortly after they arrived, a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith, author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation, as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.|$|E

40|$|Machiavellianism and {{emotional}} manipulation {{has not been}} investigated in friendships. The current studies investigated Machiavellianism, emotional manipulation, and six friendship functions in women's same-sex friendships. For study 1, women (N = 221) completed the Mach IV, emotional manipulation measure (with reference to <b>their</b> own behaviour <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>friend's</b> behaviour), mood worsening and use of inauthentic displays from the managing emotions of others scale, and the friendship function measure. Machiavellianism predicted the self-perceived ability to employ emotional manipulation towards a same-sex <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> perceiving <b>their</b> <b>friend</b> to use emotional manipulation towards them. Machiavellianism predicted lower scores on all six friendship functions. For study 2, women (N = 186) completed the Mach IV, the modified emotional manipulation measure (with reference to <b>their</b> own behaviour <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>friend's</b> behaviour), <b>and</b> the friendship function measure. Women high on Machiavellianism reported using emotional manipulation more frequently towards <b>their</b> same-sex <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> perceived <b>their</b> same-sex <b>friend</b> to frequently use emotional manipulation towards them. Machiavellianism predicted lower scores on five of the friendship functions.
