Therefore, once the P. rebeli begin to mimic {{the sound of the}} queen ant, the worker ants begin to treat the P. rebeli <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> queen ant. On the other hand, the queen ant treats the P. rebeli larvae and pupae as if they were rivals, as she is {{the only one in the}} colony that recognizes that the P. rebeli larvae is not ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Though different, the children's stories {{share similar}} structures. The story reaches its climax as a {{stairway}} {{appears at the}} Dream Gate and Helen and Nights ascend, only to be trapped by Wizeman and pulled into darkness. Will arrives too late and dives in after them, arriving in the night skies above Bellbridge, where he finds {{that he has the}} ability to fly without Nights or their Ideya. He rescues Helen, and the two attempt to save Nights, who has been imprisoned at the top of Bellbridge's clock tower. Reala arrives to stop their efforts and accepts Nights' challenge to battle. After defeating Reala, the trio prepare to face Wizeman. Both Will and Helen defeat Wizeman, who is subsequently destroyed. Since Wizeman kept all of his creations alive, Nights vanishes in a white light, bowing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> end of a performance, and the children wake up crying. That evening, Helen plays her violin for her mother in a crowded hall, while Will celebrates with his father after winning a football game. He then loses the ball and goes after it, only to come upon Helen playing her violin. The lights suffer a temporary blackout, and when they turn back on, Helen sees Will extending a friendly hand to her. Recognising each other from their adventures in Nightopia, the two reach for each other as it begins to snow. The final scene is of either child sleeping in their rooms at home as the camera pulls back towards Bellbridge's clock tower, atop which Nights is seen to be alive and peacefully watching over the city.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{interests}} of collectors and EJO Society members is finding and visiting the original sites used by Oxenham in her books. As well as the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire area which is the background for Girls of the Hamlet Club and the village of Washford, Somerset where Cleeve Abbey is situated, Oxenham used parts of Sussex, Wales, Lancashire, the English Lake District and Scotland for the settings of several books. The UK Society holds a biennial meeting at Halsway Manor in the summer, which includes folk-dancing and tours of nearby Cleeve Abbey <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> fictional one. These places are not always depicted in the books exactly as the real sites; Oxenham was writing fiction, and given that she could move an abbey several hundred miles for her purposes, changing a few names and telescoping or stretching distances was also well within her remit.|$|E

500|$|The {{book is a}} travelogue and {{biological}} record, but also reveals the two men's philosophies: it dwells on the place of humans in the environment, the interconnection between single organisms and the larger ecosystem, and the themes of leaving and returning home. A number of ecological concerns, rare in 1940, are voiced, such as an imagined but horrific vision of the long term damage that the Japanese bottom fishing trawlers are doing to the sea bed. Although written <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> journal kept by Steinbeck during the voyage, the book is to some extent a work of fiction: the journals are not Steinbeck's, and his wife, who had accompanied him on the trip, is not mentioned (though at one point Steinbeck slips and mentions the matter of food for seven people). Since returning home is a theme throughout the narrative, the inclusion of his wife, a symbol of home, would have dissipated the effect. Steinbeck and Ricketts are never mentioned by name but are amalgamated into the first person [...] "we" [...] who narrate the log.|$|E
500|$|The narrator {{was added}} {{early in the}} game's {{development}} {{as a way to}} provide background details and depth to the world without requiring the player to read long strings of text or wait through cutscenes. To avoid slowing the pace of the action-oriented gameplay, the team had the narrator mainly speak in short, evocative phrases, with long pauses between speaking parts. The narrator is intended to feel like an [...] "old acquaintance" [...] to the player, a connection built by his commentary on the player's actions as they happen, both major and minor. Kasavin sought to make the game feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> player's story, rather than just a story being watched. The development of Bastion was chronicled in the monthly Building the Bastion video series from October 2010 to May 2011 in which Supergiant Games collaborated with Kasavin's former GameSpot co-workers at Giant Bomb. The videos showed early game concepts in addition to the process of building the final game, as well as interviews with the team.|$|E
500|$|Ezrin {{was intent}} on {{developing}} a cohesive sound for the album, and his earnestness {{was a source of}} humor for the band. [...] At a time when the Beatles had a reputation that made them seem beyond criticism, the Alice Cooper band intended [...] "Second Coming" [...] as a jab at the recently released track [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] with Phil Spector's elaborate production—the hyperbolic acclaim it received struck the band <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Second Coming of a master composer on the order of Beethoven—as well as Ezrin's attempts to bring such production values to Alice Cooper's music. [...] Ezrin did not realize the joke was largely at his expense. [...] When recording the [...] "I wanna get out of here" [...] sequence of [...] "Ballad of Dwight Fry", Ezrin had Cooper lie on the floor surrounded by a cage of metal chairs to create an element of realism to the singer's frantic screams. [...] "Black Juju" [...] was the only track recorded live in the studio. [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] was a sixteen-track recording at 15 IPS; other tracks were recorded at 30 IPS.|$|E

500|$|The film {{presents}} a legal system where the PreCrime office gathers the {{images from the}} minds of the precogs then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges. The judges appear via video feeds, analyze the images, and according to Cooper, they view the images, listen to Anderton rattle off [...] "a string of legalistic verbiage", then give it a [...] "pro forma ratification." [...] Thus the accused is never present, is not allowed a defense, and is convicted before he is aware he is on trial. The program is marketed in a similar basic fashion, as in its tag line: [...] "It works." [...] Cooper says that in a typical American courtroom drama, the audience is treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> jury, but in this system, instead of desiring the hero be proven innocent, the audience seeks instead to have the guilt transferred from Anderton to Burgess. But to do so, Anderton has to disprove the system, which he does by proving the existence of the minority report. This renders the PreCrime justice system inoperable, as if there is doubt related not merely to the gathering of the images, or their ability to be interpreted, but their ability to be correct even in perfect circumstances, then the system of infallible guilt can not exist.|$|E

2500|$|The tomb of Fabio Chigi, Pope Alexander VII, {{towards the}} end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne [...] "one of the {{greatest}} tombs of the Baroque Age". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent Charity and Truth. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant England. Coming forth, seemingly, from the doorway <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of Death, its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an hourglass stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.|$|E
