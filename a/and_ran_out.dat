5|$|After {{receiving}} the Wake Forest kickoff, however, Georgia Tech's hopes were quickly deflated by three plays {{that resulted in}} negative yardage or no gain. Georgia Tech was forced into its final punt of the game, and Wake Forest received the ball <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> the remaining time on the clock. Wake Forest won the 2006 ACC Championship Game by a 96 score.|$|E
5|$|As for the studio, {{despite the}} film's huge {{monetary}} success, Vestron followed {{it up with}} a series of flops <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money. Vestron's parent company, Vestron Inc., went bankrupt in 1989, and was bought out in January 1991 by LIVE Entertainment for $26 million. The rights to Dirty Dancing now rest with Lionsgate Entertainment, which purchased Artisan Entertainment in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, O'Brien {{skipped the}} Australian Championships {{because he had}} no {{sponsorship}} <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} main match, Ric Flair faced Shawn Michaels. During the match, Michaels {{set up a}} table at ringside and {{positioned}} Flair on it. Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted to interfere in the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put Flair through {{the table with a}} Splash. Near the end of the match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair.|$|E
5|$|Search {{teams were}} sent {{from the lower}} floors and searched the 30th floor, but did not find the missing firefighters. The teams then moved onto the upper levels where one team got lost on the 38th floor <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of air in their {{self-contained}} breathing apparatus (SCBA). That team was rescued by a search team that had {{been placed on the}} roof by a helicopter. Rescue attempts continued until helicopter operations were suspended due to heavy smoke and thermal drafts caused by the blaze.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, both teams had more {{offensive}} success. Auburn scored the game's first touchdown {{four and a}} half minutes into the third quarter, widening the Tigers' lead to 16–0. Virginia Tech fought back, driving inside the Auburn 10-yard line before settling for a field goal attempt. Kicker Brandon Pace missed the 23-yard field goal try, leaving the score at 16–0. Tech would have other chances, however. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, Tech scored its first points of the game after a six-play, 78-yard drive. A 29-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Bryan Randall made the score 16–6 after a missed two-point conversion. As time ran down, Tech closed the gap even further. With just over twominutes remaining in the game, Randall connected on an 80-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan for a touchdown. With the score now at 16–13 and time running out, Tech elected to attempt an onside kick in hopes of having a chance for a game-winning offensive drive. Auburn recovered the kick, however, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> the clock.|$|E

5|$|The game {{began at}} 1:35p.m. PST in rainy {{conditions}} that had affected the San Francisco Bay Area for {{days before the}} contest. The Lobos scored a touchdown on the game's first drive to take an early lead, but the Midshipmen scored three touchdowns to bring the score to 21–7 {{early in the second}} quarter. After the Lobos narrowed that lead to 12 points {{by the end of the}} third quarter, the Midshipmen began a long drive which took up much of the fourth quarter. The drive ended with a field goal, which gave Navy a 15-point lead with a little over two minutes remaining in the game. On the next drive from the Lobos, the Midshipmen forced a turnover on downs <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> the clock with their last possession to win the game.|$|E
5|$|The plan went awry {{when the}} 2nd Platoon got lost and missed a {{rendezvous}} with the 1st and 3rd Platoon, which {{were waiting for}} them near Mravince. The 2nd Platoon was therefore disbanded {{while the rest of}} the detachment continued via Mosor to Dicmo where they were to meet up with their guides. They arrived on the night of 12 August, and upon realizing their guides were not there, decided to continue alone towards Kamešnica, but got lost <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of supplies during the night. At dawn on 13 August the detachment camped near the village of Krušvar. In the evening they once again continued towards Kamešnica, and at dawn on 14 August, they camped near the village of Košute, near Trilj. Borovčić-Kurir tasked two fighters to go into the village and ask the locals for water and directions. After talking to some locals, the fighters were fired upon by a member of the Ustaše Militia of the village. They returned fire then continued back to their camp and notified the others about the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} started advancing {{towards the}} village, the 8th Squadron on the left, and the 10th with the 1st Squadron on the right. Covered by their machine-guns, but under heavy Turkish fire, they gradually moved forward on foot. Troops took turns to run forward {{while the rest}} of the squadron covered them. The intensity of the battle was demonstrated by the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery, which was supporting the brigade <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of ammunition at 14:00. Two hours later the division's covering force reported Turkish reinforcements approaching, and Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, who was commanding the attack, decided to call it off. Almost simultaneously Edward Chaytor, commanding the brigade, ordered another attack. Covered by their machine-guns the men carried out a bayonet charge and the Turks to their front surrendered. By this time the other brigades had started to withdraw, but seeing what had happened, they turned back and also charge, capturing the position. The battle cost the regiment six dead and nineteen wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} {{started off with}} traded punts. Boston College took over with {{excellent}} field position on the Maryland 34-yard line, but was held to fourth and eight yards on the Terrapins' nine-yard line. The Eagles faked a field goal attempt, and holder Billy Flutie, nephew of Heisman winner Doug Flutie, rolled right and passed to Jordon McMichael for a nine-yard touchdown. The teams traded punts again, before Turner led the Terrapins on a 70-yard drive into the final quarter. A 13-yard reception by Danny Oquendo brought the score to 21–14. Boston College was then held three-and-out and punted. The Terrapins drove to the Eagles' 19-yard line, but Obi Egekeze missed the 36-yard field goal attempt. Boston College's next drive consisted of ten rush attempts by Montel Harris and burned three minutes off the clock. The Eagles punted and Turner completed three passes to advance to their own 35-yard line. Linebacker Robert Francois intercepted a pass and ran it 36yards into the endzone. Steve Aponavicius's extra point brought it to 28–14. With 1:42 left, Turner completed eight passes including an 8-yard touchdown toss to Torrey Smith. With 0:14remaining in the game, Maryland attempted an onside kick, but it bounced out of bounds. Boston College took possession <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> the clock to end the game, 28–21.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} maximum population in the millions. The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used this vulnerable species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of these great auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were {{three times the size of}} a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands, that preyed upon nests.|$|E
