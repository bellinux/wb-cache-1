40|$|This Article {{addresses}} one of {{the most}} difficult issues under the reasonable <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision</b> of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) : how to resolve the conflict that arises when accommodating a disabled employee negatively affects or interferes with the rights of other employees. Several scholars and the Supreme Court (in US Airways v. Barnett) have weighed in on this debate but their analyses fall short of the ultimate goal of this Article—to achieve equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities without unnecessarily interfering with the rights of other employees. In order to achieve that goal, this Article proposes a statutory amendment to the reasonable <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision</b> of the ADA. This amendment would make reasonable most accommodations that affect other employees, unless the accommodation results in the termination of another employee. In this way, more productive disabled employees will remain employed, while only placing a reasonable burden on the rest of the workforce...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{marginalization}} of {{two groups of}} employees—individuals with disabilities and workers with caregiving responsibilities. One might argue that these two groups have little in common. However, while these groups are not perfectly aligned, they do {{have much in common}} in the workplace. First, these employees are unable to consistently meet their employers’ expectations of an “ideal worker. ” Thus, they often must seek adjustments or modifications in the workplace to accommodate for their failure to conform to the ideal-worker norm. The need for accommodation causes both groups of employees to suffer from “special-treatment stigma,” which manifests itself in resentment by coworkers about the special benefits these employees receive, and in employers’ reluctance to hire these employees because of the real or perceived costs of employing such individuals. Despite these similarities, the law deals with these two groups of employees very differently. Individuals with disabilities are entitled to broad protection in the workplace, including the rather unique reasonable <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision</b> in the Americans with Disabilities Act. On the other hand, despite some laws protecting some aspects of pregnancy and caregiving, workers with caregiving responsibilities do not enjoy the same broad protection as individuals with disabilities. This Article explores why the law treats these groups of employees differently. It addresses many of the concepts that are thought to distinguish individuals with disabilities and workers with caregiving responsibilities and that are therefore used to justify their different treatment under the law. But this Article ultimately concludes that these distinctions, once unpacked, do not justify the law’s different treatment of the two groups. Moreover, these differences are not as significant as the similarity that binds these two groups together—special-treatment stigma. Thus, this Article explores whether a combined legal and theoretical approach to eliminating the special-treatment stigma is feasible and defensible. Specifically, this Article seeks to provide theoretical justification for the reasonable <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision</b> under the ADA and argue that the same justification can be used to support an accommodation mandate for workers with caregiving responsibilities...|$|E

To illustrate the policy and legislative dynamics underpinning Traveller/Roma exclusion, this article critically analyses the difficulties of accessing culturally appropriate housing for the Irish Travelling Community. It highlights how Irish litigation on behalf of Travellers has tested the boundaries of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly {{the extent to which}} a minimum core of <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision</b> may be secured.

50|$|The Iowa state courts, however, {{tended to}} {{interpret}} narrowly the legislative {{intent of the}} 1884 Act. Because the public <b>accommodations</b> <b>provision</b> specifically enumerated types of facilities, the court construed that it necessarily meant to exclude from its operation those facilities not so listed. Many kinds of establishments catering to the public were therefore left untouched by this provision; these establishments retained an unfettered discretion to discriminate among their patrons on such bases as race, religion, or ethnic background. Among establishments that were exempt from the proscriptions of the 1884 Civil Rights Act, were retail stores, beauty shops and salons, parking lots, gas stations, schools, health clinics, doctors' and dentists' offices, hospitals, banks, loan companies, lawyers' offices, real estate brokers' offices, employment agency offices, {{as well as many}} others.|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} explores the sociocultural adjustment of international {{students and the}} role played by university structures in the process. The adjustment process of international students has been modelled in psychological literature as a U-curve, a learning curve and most recently as a long, uneven and unending process of change. Yet, little of the literature has addressed the role played in this process by university structures. The research was conducted in the UK with 58 undergraduates from Malaysia. It utilized a qualitative design and consisted of two waves of semi-structured small-group interviews. It was found that university structures, in the form of <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision,</b> course provision, and student union clubs and societies, provide opportunities for integration and adjustment support {{in the early stages of}} the sojourn. However, the desire for contact with a wide range of others, central to the adjustment process, takes time to develop in international students. It is suggested that an understanding of adjustment as a long and uneven process should be built into structures aiming to support the adjustment of international students...|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} the above model, economists {{have focused on the}} high {{compliance}} costs the Act imposed on employers, particularly the compliance costs imposed by the reasonable <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision,</b> to explain their findings that employment of the disabled declined after the ADA. DeLeire (2000), for instance, concluded that the increased costs to firms arising from the ADA’s accommodation mandate was responsible for a 7.2 percentage point decline in employment of disabled men after 1990. Acemoglu and Angrist (2001) similarly blamed accommodation costs (and costs arising from disputes over what constitutes a reasonable accommodation 5) for their finding that disabled men and women worked between 1 and 4 fewer weeks per year after passage of the 1990 ADA. Yet the evidence available on the costs of reasonable accommodation casts some doubt on the argument that compliance costs are solely responsible for the ineffectiveness of the original ADA. According to a 2013 employer interview study by the Job Accommodation Network (2013), 58  % of disability accommodations cost the employer nothing. Of the 42  % of accommodations that are costly, the median employer expenditure is only $ 500.|$|E

Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of international case studies focusing on Indigenous <b>accommodation</b> <b>provision</b> was carried out to complement the research, as were observations during site visits. By offering a framework for the Indigenous tourism development process, we contribute in a positive and flexible way to the complex, and evolving, discourse on Indigenous tourism practice. It is argued that the effectiveness of governance structures and the level of involvement of Indigenous stakeholders as well as the selection of legislative and policy instruments are key to ensuring a more sustainable approach to Indigenous tourism development...|$|E
40|$|In 1990, Congress {{enacted the}} Ameri canswith Disabilities Act as a comprehensivemandate to {{eliminate}} discrimin ationagainst individuals with disabilities. The ADA’s primary {{intent was to}} extend the pro-tection of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

40|$|Abstract Background Many western {{countries}} have policies of dispersal and direct <b>provision</b> <b>accommodation</b> (state-funded accommodation in an institutional centre) for asylum seekers. Most {{research focuses on}} {{its effect on the}} asylum seeking population. Little is known about the impact of direct <b>provision</b> <b>accommodation</b> on organisation and delivery of local primary care and social care services in the community. The aim of this research is to explore this issue. Methods In 2005 a direct <b>provision</b> <b>accommodation</b> centre was opened in a rural area in Ireland. A retrospective qualitative case study was designed comprising in-depth interviews with 37 relevant stakeholders. Thematic analysis following the principles of framework analysis was applied. Results There was lack of advance notification to primary care and social care professionals and the community about the new accommodation centre. This caused anxiety and stress among relevant stakeholders. There was insufficient time to plan and prepare appropriate primary care and social care for the residents, causing a significant strain on service delivery. There was lack of clarity about how primary care and social care needs of the incoming residents were to be addressed. Interdisciplinary support systems developed informally between healthcare professionals. This ensured that residents of the accommodation centre were appropriately cared for. Conclusions Direct <b>provision</b> <b>accommodation</b> impacts on the organisation and delivery of local primary care and social care services. There needs to be sufficient advance notification and inter-agency, inter-professional dialogue to manage this. Primary care and social care professionals working with asylum seekers should have access to training to enhance their skills for working in cross-cultural consultations. </p...|$|R
