5|$|<b>A</b> <b>dam</b> {{was built}} across the Cefni river north of Llangefni {{in the late}} 1940s to {{increase}} the water supply available to the island. The new reservoir, Llyn Cefni, crossed the railway's trackbed, and a bridge was built to support it. A second reservoir, Llyn Alaw, was formed adjacent to the railway north of Llanerchymedd in the 1960s, but did {{not interfere with the}} line's alignment.|$|E
5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1898, without {{building}} <b>a</b> <b>dam,</b> the original Lower Bonnington Power Plant was generating hydroelectricity from Bonnington Falls in the Kootenay River near {{the confluence of}} the Slocan River in order to supply water to mines in Rossland, British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Cubzac's {{climate is}} oceanic, {{part of the}} Dfb group in the Köppen climate classification. Periodically, the river Dordogne causes flooding.

The 1999 storm destroyed many trees from the Terrefort castle park. In 1708, a temperature extremum of -15°C caused the river and vineyards to freeze.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> in the {{northern}} portion of the park was proposed. Located in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, supported it. In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the O'Shaughnessy Dam through passage of the Raker Act.|$|E

5|$|John was succeeded as {{owner of}} Rùm by his son, George (later Sir George). George built Kinloch Castle in 1900 using {{sandstone}} quarried at Annan. The interior boasted an orchestrion that could simulate {{the sounds of}} brass, drum and woodwind, an air-conditioned billiards room, and a jacuzzi. <b>A</b> <b>dam</b> was built on Coire Dubh burn for hydroelectric purposes; the house was the first private home in Scotland, outside of Glasgow, to have an electricity supply.|$|E

50|$|When {{properly}} {{situated on}} an appropriate site, the arch-gravity dam, combining the load resisting qualities of both <b>a</b> gravity <b>dam</b> and <b>an</b> arch <b>dam,</b> inspires the most public confidence {{because of its}} appearance of massive permanence. However, curving <b>a</b> gravity <b>dam</b> may make it look stronger, but some of this effect may be psychological factors in operation in making <b>a</b> choice of <b>dam</b> style.|$|R

Three small natural lakes can be found near Smiljkovci, on the northeastern edge of the urban area.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of Pushkar Lake, as an artificial lake, is also credited to the 12th century when <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> was built across {{the headwaters of}} the Luni River. The 10th Sikh guru, Guru Govind Singh (1666–1708), is said to have recited the Sikh sacred text Guru Granth Sahib {{on the banks of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>dam</b> {{constructed}} by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the Cumberland River in 1966, and the lake it forms, were named Barkley Dam and Lake Barkley in Barkley's honor.

In February 2008, Paducah's American Justice School of Law changed owners after failing to secure accreditation from the American Bar Association. It was renamed the Alben W. Barkley School of Law, but remained unaccredited, and closed in December 2008.|$|E

5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
5|$|A primary issue {{during the}} {{election}} was the construction of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state's budget surplus to its construction. In the election, Ford defeated Cook {{by a vote of}} 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E
