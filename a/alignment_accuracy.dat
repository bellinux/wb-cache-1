50|$|Profile-profile {{alignment}} algorithms {{are powerful}} tools for detecting protein homology relationships with improved <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Profile-profile alignments {{are based on}} the statistical indel frequency profiles from multiple sequence alignments generated by PSI-BLAST searches. Rather than using substitution matrices to measure the similarity of amino acid pairs, profile-profile alignment methods require a profile-based scoring function to measure the similarity of profile vector pairs. Profile-profile alignments employ gap penalty functions. The gap information is usually used in the form of indel frequency profiles, which is more specific for the sequences to be aligned. ClustalW and MAFFT adopted this kind of gap penalty determination for their multiple sequence alignments. Alignment accuracies can be improved using this model, especially for proteins with low sequence identity. Some profile-profile alignment algorithms also run the secondary structure information as one term in their scoring functions, which improves <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the scoring {{function}}: Design a good scoring function to measure the fitness between target sequences and templates based on {{the knowledge of the}} known relationships between the structures and the sequences. A good scoring function should contain mutation potential, environment fitness potential, pairwise potential, secondary structure compatibilities, and gap penalties. The quality of the energy function is closely related to the prediction accuracy, especially the <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy.</b>|$|E

50|$|Subsequently the BCB {{layer is}} spin or spray coated, usually 1 to 50 µm thick, {{to the same}} wafer. To prevent that the {{patterned}} layer has a lower bond strength than the unpatterned layer, due to the cross-linking of the polymer, a soft-curing step is applied before bonding. The pre-curing of the BCB takes place for several minutes on the hot plate at a specific temperature ≤ 300 °C. The soft cure prevents bubble formation and unbonded areas {{as well as the}} distortion of the adhesive layer during compression to improve the <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The degree of polymerization should not be over 50%, so it is robust enough to be patterned and still sufficiently adhesive to be bonded.|$|E
5000|$|Most typical {{limitations}} to high-throughput, {{next generation sequencing}} apply. The problem of <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> to repetitive regions in the genome will result in less accurate analysis of methylation in those regions. Also, as was mentioned above, short reads (e.g. 36-50bp from an Illumina Genome Analyzer) represent {{a part of a}} sheared fragment when aligned to the genome; therefore, the exact methylation site can fall anywhere within a window that {{is a function of the}} fragment size. [...] In this respect, bisulfite sequencing has much higher resolution (down to a single CpG site; single nucleotide level). However, this level of resolution may not be required for most applications, as the methylation status of CpG sites within < 1000 bp has been shown to be significantly correlated.|$|E

5000|$|Progressive, hierarchical, or tree methods {{generate}} a multiple sequence alignment by first aligning the most similar sequences and then adding successively less related sequences or groups to the alignment until the entire query set has {{been incorporated into}} the solution. The initial tree describing the sequence relatedness is based on pairwise comparisons that may include heuristic pairwise alignment methods similar to FASTA. Progressive alignment results are dependent on the choice of [...] "most related" [...] sequences and thus can be sensitive to inaccuracies in the initial pairwise alignments. Most progressive multiple sequence alignment methods additionally weight the sequences in the query set according to their relatedness, which reduces the likelihood of making a poor choice of initial sequences and thus improves <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy.</b>|$|E

We discuss the use of fabricated structures on wafer surfaces to mechanically achieve higher <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> than can be achieved with our existing (baseline) alignment protocol. The keyed alignment structures rely on structures with tapered side-walls that can slide into each after two wafers are “pre-aligned” using our baseline alignment protocol. Results indicate that <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> is about a quarter micron, well below the one micron <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> obtained in our baseline alignment procedure using commercial state-of-the-art wafer alignment equipment. In addition to improving alignment, the alignment structures also hinder undesirable bonding-induced misalignment.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that multilevel nanoimprint lithography (NIL) with submicron alignment over an entire 4 in. Si wafer can be achieved. Average <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> of 1 μm {{with a standard}} deviation 0. 4 μm in both X and Y directions was obtained in ten consecutive tests of multilevel NIL. The multilevel alignment was achieved by aligning the wafer and the mask with an aligner, fixing them with a holder, and imprinting in an imprint machine. The issues that are critical to the <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy,</b> such as relative movement during the press, relative thermal expansion, wafer bending, and resist, are discussed.

40|$|Abstract Background Molecular {{evolutionary}} {{studies of}} noncoding sequences rely on multiple alignments. Yet how multiple <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> varies across sequence types, tree topologies, divergences and tools, and further how this variation impacts specific inferences, remains unclear. Results Here we develop a molecular evolution simulation platform, CisEvolver, with models of background noncoding and transcription factor binding site evolution, and use simulated alignments to systematically examine multiple <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{and its impact}} on two key molecular evolutionary inferences: transcription factor binding site conservation and divergence estimation. We find that the accuracy of multiple alignments is determined almost exclusively by the pairwise divergence distance of the two most diverged species and that additional species have a negligible influence on <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Conserved transcription factor binding sites align better than surrounding noncoding DNA yet are often found to be misaligned at relatively short divergence distances, such that studies of binding site gain and loss could easily be confounded by alignment error. Divergence estimates from multiple alignments tend to be overestimated at short divergence distances but reach a tool specific divergence at which they cease to increase, leading to underestimation at long divergences. Our most striking finding was that overall <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy,</b> binding site <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> and divergence estimation accuracy vary greatly across branches in a tree and are most accurate for terminal branches connecting sister taxa and least accurate for internal branches connecting sub-alignments. Conclusion Our results suggest that variation in <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> can lead to errors in molecular evolutionary inferences that could be construed as biological variation. These findings have implications for which species to choose for analyses, what kind of errors would be expected for a given set of species and how multiple alignment tools and phylogenetic inference methods might be improved to minimize or control for alignment errors. </p...|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{alignment}} of laser beams {{was done with}} irises. Two irises uniquely defined a beam path; the farther apart the irises and the smaller the iris holes, the better the path was defined. The smallest aperture that an iris can define is about 0.8 mm. In comparison, the centroid of a laser beam can be determined to sub-micrometre accuracy with a laser beam profiler. The laser beam profiler's effective aperture size is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of an iris. Consequently, the ability to define an optical path is 1000 times better when using beam profilers over irises. Applications that need microradian <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracies</b> include earth-to-space communications, earth-to-space ladar, master oscillator to power oscillator alignment, and multi-pass amplifiers.|$|R

An inter-modality {{registration}} algorithm {{that uses}} textured point clouds and mutual information is presented {{within the context}} of a new physical-space to image-space registration technique for imageguided neurosurgery.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new integration technology for cost-effective high-precision mechanical and electrical integration of mesoscopic functional foil components onto foil substrates. The foil-to-foil assembly process {{is based on}} topological surface structuring via laser patterning that enables accurate capillarity-driven self-alignment of foil dies.

40|$|Most recently, a {{miniature}} rotation robot {{has been proposed}} to allow imaging samples from multidirection for the first time. However, one existing problem for that rotation robot is that the alignment efficiency and accuracy is affected greatly by the alignment angle. This article investigates the effect of alignment angle on the <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy.</b> <b>Alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> is measured by sample’s position shift during a 360 ° rotation. Firstly, the miniature robotic system and its alignment principle are introduced briefly. Then, the source of alignment error is analyzed and the error model is built. After that, simulation results are given and indicate that as alignment angle increases, alignment error first decreases, then becomes stable and finally increases. Reasons for the trend of alignment error are explained. Finally, experiment results are demonstrated {{and have a good}} agreement with theoretical analysis and simulation results.

40|$|Phylogenies {{are often}} {{thought to be}} more {{dependent}} upon {{the specifics of the}} sequence alignment rather than on the method of reconstruction. Simulation of sequences containing insertion and deletion events was performed {{in order to determine the}} role that <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> plays during phylogenetic inference. Data sets were simulated for pectinate, balanced, and random tree shapes under different conditions (ultrametric equal branch length, ultrametric random branch length, nonultrametric random branch length). Comparisons between hypothesized alignments and true alignments enabled determination of two measures of <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy,</b> that of the total data set and that of individual branches. In general, our results indicate that as alignment error increases, topological accuracy decreases. This trend was much more pronounced for data sets derived from more pectinate topologies. In contrast, for balanced, ultrametric, equal branch length tree shapes, alignment inaccuracy had little average effect on tree reconstruction. These conclusions are based on average trends of many analyses under different conditions, and any one specific analysis, independent of the <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy,</b> may recover very accurate or inaccurate topologies. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian, in general, outperformed neighbor joining and maximum parsimony in terms of tree reconstruction accuracy. Results also indicated that as the length of the branch and of the neighboring branches increase, <b>alignment</b> <b>accuracy</b> decreases, and the length of the neighboring branches is the major factor in topological accuracy. Thus, multiple-sequence alignment can be an important factor in downstream effects on topological reconstruction.
