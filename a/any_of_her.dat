5|$|Both Britain and France claimed {{victory in}} the battle: Britain by virtue of {{capturing}} or sinking seven French ships without losing <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own and remaining {{in control of the}} battle site; France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting. The British fleet in Spithead was treated with a Royal visit by King George III and the entire royal household.|$|E
5|$|Her {{reign of}} 63 years and seven months {{is known as}} the Victorian era and was longer than that of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> predecessors. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and {{military}} change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, inaugurated the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} her accession, Mary issued a proclamation {{that she would}} not compel <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> subjects to follow her religion, {{but by the end of}} September leading Protestant churchmen—including John Bradford, John Rogers, John Hooper, Hugh Latimer, and Thomas Cranmer—were imprisoned. Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents valid and abolished Edward's religious laws. Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles, which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their benefices.|$|E

As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Sherwood also adopted {{neglected}} or orphaned {{children from}} the camp. In 1807 she adopted Annie Child, a three-year-old who had been given too much medicinal gin and in 1808 a malnourished two-year-old Sally Pownal. She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage. In 1816, {{on the advice of}} doctors, she and her family returned to Britain; in her autobiography Sherwood relates that she was continually ill in India and it was believed at the time that neither she nor <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> children could survive in a tropical climate.|$|E
5|$|There is scant {{record of}} the ship's {{movements}} under <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> later names. The Los Angeles Times reports her arrival at West Coast ports as Seisho Maru at least twice. In March 1930, the ship arrived at Tacoma, Washington, from Singapore {{to pick up a}} load of logs for export. Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.|$|E

5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
5|$|Both Wilson {{and critics}} responded {{positively}} to the film, with Wilson saying {{she thought it}} was the best film adaptation of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> works. It was released on DVD on 12 January 2009. Dustbin Baby was awarded the International Emmy in the Children and Young People category at the 2009 ceremony. Helen Blakeman won a Children's BAFTA for the screenplay, while the film itself was shortlisted for a Children's BAFTA in the Drama category and shortlisted for the Kids' Vote award. The film was also awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for Best One-off, Special, or TV movie aimed at a Family Audience and the KidScreen Award for Best Acting.|$|E

5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|Chandrasekaran, Gnanasekaran and Gunasekaran {{are three}} Indian {{immigrant}} brothers from Madurai, Tamil Nadu living in Rangoon, Burma with Chandrasekaran's wife Saraswati. Their younger sister Kalyani {{was raised in}} their home town by their father Manickampillai. In 1942, during World War II, the three brothers and Saraswati plan to visit Madurai to attend the impending wedding of Kalyani to a writer named Thangappan. Due to war conditions and bombardment of Burmese ports by Japan, the shipping company offers only one ticket and Gunasekaran, the youngest brother, takes it and leaves for Tamil Nadu. The ship fails to reach on time due {{to the dangers of}} the war, and Kalyani's marriage takes place without <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brothers present.|$|E
5|$|Dismasted, Defence {{was unable}} to hold <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> various opponents to a {{protracted}} duel, and by 13:00 was threatened by the damaged Républicain moving from the east. Although Républicain later hauled off to join Villaret to the north, Gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet's frigates and was aided by HMS Phaeton under Captain William Bentinck. As Impétueux passed she fired on Phaeton, to which Bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own. Invincible, the only ship of the forward division of the British centre to engage the enemy closely, became embroiled in the confusion surrounding Queen Charlotte. Invincible's guns drove Juste onto the broadside of Queen Charlotte, where {{she was forced to}} surrender to Lieutenant Henry Blackwood in a boat from Invincible. Among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties, although HMS Impregnable lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers, Lieutenant Robert Otway and Midshipman Charles Dashwood.|$|E

5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as {{was done in the}} earlier , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but Moulder supported {{the effort and}} was given credit as co-producer. Marks set {{the tone of the}} environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence. Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E

A few years later, Krishna, {{a supporter of the}} Pandavas, learns about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first son whom she abandoned. Karnan gets to know about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sons (the Pandavas) except Arjuna during the impending Kurukshetra War, and that he will attack Arjuna with the Nagastra weapon only once. Karnan refuses to join his brothers, the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhana.|$|E
