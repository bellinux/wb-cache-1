Drawing {{inspiration}} from the game's concept art and other visuals, he began writing music for the game in December 2010. Davidge described his music as an evolution of previous Halo music, designed to accompany the new style of the universe.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> effect {{spreading}} to anything {{connected to the}} self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E

5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E

5|$|On July 12, 2002, <b>a</b> <b>Halo</b> {{port for}} Windows was {{announced}} {{to be under}} development by Gearbox Software. Its showing at E3 2003 was positively received by some critics, with skepticism by others. It was released on September 30, 2003, and included support for online multiplayer play and featured sharper graphics, but had compatibility issues that caused poor performance. Halo was later released for Mac OS X on December 11, 2003. On December 4, 2007, the game became available for the Xbox 360 via download from the Xbox Live Marketplace.|$|E
5|$|The Firefight game mode was a late {{addition}} to the game. Staffer Tim Williams built a prototype shortly after Halo 3 shipped, placing the player in a portion of <b>a</b> <b>Halo</b> 3 campaign map and fighting enemies. When development commenced on ODST, William's concept was adopted for the game and refined. Designer Lars Bakken described one advantage of the game mode as providing a more friendly multiplayer environment than hardcore players online. The designers reused the campaign scoring and medal system from Halo 3 to add a competitive edge.|$|E
5|$|After {{destroying}} the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony. The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind {{to oppose the}} Didact. Infinity executive officer Commander Lasky gives Chief an armed transport and wishes him luck. Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, but when they are unsuccessful they follow the Didact to <b>a</b> <b>Halo</b> ring, Installation 03. The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station, which the Covenant attack. The Chief defends Ivanoff, but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses it on the station, composing every individual except the Chief.|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} merger {{trees of}} dark matter haloes and quantify their merger rates and mass growth rates using the joint dataset from the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations. The finer resolution of the Millennium-II Simulation has allowed us to extend our earlier analysis of halo merger statistics to an unprecedentedly wide range of descendant halo mass (10 ^ 10 1). When the fit for the mean mass growth rate is integrated over <b>a</b> <b>halo's</b> history, we find excellent match to the mean mass assembly histories of the simulated haloes. By combining merger rates and mass assembly histories, we present results {{for the number of}} mergers over <b>a</b> <b>halo's</b> history and the statistics of the redshift of the last major merger.

2500|$|Halos {{in effect}} {{represent}} an excited state with nucleons in an outer quantum shell which has unfilled energy levels [...] "below" [...] it (both {{in terms of}} radius and energy). The halo may be made of either neutrons [...] or protons [...] Nuclei which have <b>a</b> single neutron <b>halo</b> include 11Be and 19C. <b>A</b> two-neutron <b>halo</b> is exhibited by 6He, 11Li, 17B, 19B and 22C. Two-neutron halo nuclei break into three fragments, never two, and are called Borromean nuclei because of this behavior (referring {{to a system of}} three interlocked rings in which breaking any ring frees both of the others). 8He and 14Be both exhibit <b>a</b> four-neutron <b>halo.</b> Nuclei which have <b>a</b> proton <b>halo</b> include 8B and 26P. <b>A</b> two-proton <b>halo</b> is exhibited by 17Ne and 27S.

5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, <b>a</b> <b>Halo</b> would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E

40|$|Aims: We aim {{to develop}} an {{algorithm}} for constructing equilibrium initial conditions for simulations of disk galaxies with <b>a</b> triaxial <b>halo</b> and/or <b>a</b> gaseous component. This will {{pave the way for}} N-body simulations of realistic disk galaxies. Methods: We use the iterative method, which we presented in a previous article. The idea of this method is very simple. It relies on constrained evolution. Results: We develop an algorithm for constructing equilibrium models of disk galaxies including a gaseous disk and a triaxial or axisymmetric halo. We discuss two test models. The first model consists of <b>a</b> spherical <b>halo,</b> <b>a</b> stellar disk, and an isothermal gaseous disk. The second model consists of <b>a</b> triaxial <b>halo,</b> <b>a</b> stellar disk, and a star-forming gaseous disk. We demonstrate that both test models are very close to equilibrium, as we had intended. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, published in A&...|$|R

5|$|Numerous printed adaptations {{based on}} the Halo video games canon have been published. Larry Niven (author of Ringworld) was {{originally}} approached to write <b>a</b> <b>Halo</b> novelization, but declined due to unfamiliarity with the subject matter. The first novel was , a prequel to Halo: Combat Evolved. It was written by Eric Nylund in seven weeks, and published in October 2001. William C. Dietz wrote an adaptation of Halo: Combat Evolved called , which was released in 2003. Eric Nylund returned to write the third novel, , which takes place between Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo2, and was published in December 2003. Nylund also wrote the fourth adaptation, , which was published on October 31, 2006. Bungie employee Joseph Staten wrote the fifth book, , which was released on October 30, 2007, while Tobias S. Buckell produced the sixth, Halo: The Cole Protocol, published in November 2008. Bungie considers the Halo novels as additions to the Halo canon.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
