40|$|In {{the present}} 			research the Early Segregated Education and Vulnerability to 			Emotional Problems In Adulthood was investigated. The main {{objective}} 			was {{to highlight the}} emotional problems prevalent in the Pakistani 			youth with <b>an</b> <b>Early</b> Segregated Education. For this purpose a study 			was carried out on the individuals with <b>an</b> <b>Early</b> Segregated and <b>an</b> 			<b>Early</b> Non Segregated Education. 			In order {{to find out the}} Vulnerability to Emotional Problems the 			IPAT Anxiety scale and IPAT Depression scale were administered on a 			sample of 400 individuals within the age range of 20 to 35 years. 			The 400 participants were further divided into four categories 			comprising of 100 females with <b>an</b> <b>Early</b> Segregated educational 			background, 100 males with <b>an</b> <b>Early</b> Segregated educational 			background, 100 females with <b>an</b> <b>Early</b> Non Segregated educational 			background and 100 males with <b>an</b> <b>Early</b> Non Segregated educational 			background. 			Chi square test was computed in order to obtain the statistical 			significance of the data. All the hypotheses were found to be 			statistically significant at 001 level. The findings of the 			present research data provide the evidence that the individuals who 			received <b>an</b> <b>early</b> Segregated education have high anxiety and 			depression sten scores than the individuals who received <b>an</b> <b>early</b> 			Non Segregated education 			Overall, the depression sten scores were found to be higher than the 			anxiety sten scores. The results of the present research also show 			that the females who received <b>an</b> <b>early</b> Segregated education have 			high depression sten scores than the anxiety sten scores of the 			males who received <b>an</b> <b>early</b> Segregated education. In the light of 			the above given results it can be concluded that in order to improve 			the mental health of the Pakistani youth with <b>an</b> <b>Early</b> Segregated 			Education some specific preventive measures should be taken into 			account by the concerned authorities...|$|R

5|$|Deleury {{suggests}} {{that although the}} temple may have {{been built in the}} 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> style so may have been carved for <b>an</b> <b>earlier,</b> smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur. The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava (1175–1318), the Anhivad Chalukya (943–1210) and even the Ajmer Chohans (685–1193) eras. Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur's Vithoba, Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third-century, arms-akimbo Vishnu images at Udaygiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh but declares that they are from different schools of sculpture.|$|E
