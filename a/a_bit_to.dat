25|$|Une Larme du diable (1839) ("The Devil's Tear") {{was written}} shortly after Gautier's trip to Belgium in 1836. The work is {{considered}} an imitation of a Medieval mystery play, a type of drama popular in the 14th century. These plays were usually performed in churches because they were religious in nature. In Gautier's play God cheats <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> win a bet with Satan. The play is humorous and preaches both in favour and against human love.|$|E
25|$|Yet they cannot boil it all, for – first, fuel is very scarce; {{that which}} is {{supplied}} weekly would not cook a meal a day…and they have to search the already bare kopjes for a supply. There is hardly <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> be had. Second, they have no extra utensil to hold the water when boiled. I propose, therefore, to give each tent a pail or crock, and get a proclamation issued that all drinking water must be boiled.|$|E

25|$|The First Test was, I {{honestly}} think, the dullest {{and most}} depressing I have ever watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection {{of a piece}} of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? The answer is that the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> spare.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the rebuilding, {{the trains}} {{on the line}} to Erkner stopped at one {{platform}} and the trains on the lines to Strausberg, Ahrensfelde and Wartenberg via Lichtenberg stopped at another platform. In future, the two lower platforms will each be served by train running in the same direction. The northern platform will be served by all trains running towards the city centre, while the southern platform will be used by trains running in the opposite direction. For this purpose, a bridge structure will be built east of the platforms at the intersection of the Erkner and Lichtenberg lines. The platforms are being moved <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> the east to be under the Ringbahn platforms.|$|E
25|$|The second {{trophic level}} (primary consumers) is {{occupied}} by zooplankton which feed off the phytoplankton. Together with the phytoplankton, they form {{the base of the}} food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.|$|E

25|$|Baker quickly {{made the}} part his own, viewing figures {{for his first}} few years {{returning}} to a level {{not seen since the}} height of 'Dalekmania' a decade earlier. His eccentric style of dress and quirky personality (particularly his trademark long scarf and fondness for jelly babies), as well as his distinctive voice, made him an immediately recognisable figure and he quickly caught the viewing public's imagination. Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part. Baker himself suggested many aspects of his Doctor's personality, but the distinctive scarf was created by accident. James Acheson, the costume designer assigned to his first story, had provided far more wool than was necessary to the knitter, Begonia Pope, intending for her to choose a suitable colour. However, due to miscommunication Pope knitted all the wool she was given. It was Baker who suggested that he wear the ridiculously long scarf, which he did once it had been shortened <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> make it more manageable.|$|E
25|$|Mashrafe Mortaza was hit {{around for}} 12 {{in the first}} over, however, and the {{momentum}} swung towards Australia. Mortaza hit back by inducing an outside edge from Matthew Hayden to wicketkeeper Mashud for 1, and four balls later a ball from Mortaza hit captain Ricky Ponting on the pads – but too high to be given out. Gilchrist and Ponting paired up well, however, even though Gilchrist rode his luck with a few drives in the air, but in the tenth over he gave a somewhat dubious catch to slip Khaled Mahmud, and was gone for 45 – all while rain threatened to damage the match. However, the weather gradually improved, along with Australia's chances – after 15 overs, they were 83 for three, having lost Damien Martyn for 9, but only needed slightly less than five an over. However, economical bowling and riskless batting from Australia saw Bangladesh in with a chance again. Ponting and Michael Clarke let the run rate go to more than six an over, but Khaled Mahmud's bowling at the death to Andrew Symonds left <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> be desired, as Australia could take the necessary runs and win by 11 balls and six wickets to spare. Interestingly, a Bangladeshi – Shahriar Nafees – got the Man of the Match award, possibly for his effort to keep the match exciting after Bangladesh had crumbled to 75 for 5.|$|E

According to Topiary, {{who was in the}} command channel during the attack, the LOIC proved ineffective, and Anons were forced to rely on the botnets of two hackers for the attack, marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault. Security researcher Sean-Paul Correll also reported that the [...] "zombie computers" [...] of involuntary botnets had provided 90% of the attack. Topiary states that he and other Anons then [...] "lied <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> the press to give it that sense of abundance", exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership.

As the horse gains skill with a rider, it moves to lighter bosals, and next into a transitional period in its training; carrying a bridle with a type of curb bit called a [...] "half breed" [...] which is a modified spade bit worn {{in conjunction with a}} light bosal. The rider carries two sets of reins, one set on the bosal and one on the curb, giving this gear its name, the [...] "two-rein."

500|$|Akihiko Yoshida {{has stated}} that Ashe's {{physical}} features were designed {{with the intent of}} making her look vaguely French, stating that [...] "the base of her bone structure is a French person's. We were given orders from the start to not make her look like an Asian. But we modified her <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> look more like a Japanese {{for the sake of the}} Japanese audience, and also since a character that looks completely French makes some of the CG expressions difficult." [...] Ashe was voiced by Kari Wahlgren in English and by Mie Sonozaki in Japanese. Despite having been created for Final Fantasy XII, she was first introduced in the 2004 crossover board game Itadaki Street Special. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable, and was set to appear in Fortress, as revealed in concept art for the game.|$|E
500|$|Nordby spent a {{significant}} amount of time shooting [...] "the articulating jaw" [...] scene because they had [...] "ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head". He said, [...] "This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough." [...] Because of this, [...] "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. [...] "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, [...] "there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film." [...] Since the team was on a small budget, they [...] "relied more on skilled artists to think through shots rather than a brute force approach".|$|E

500|$|Following release, IGN interviewed Hiroyuki {{regarding}} {{the development of}} the game. He revealed that Camelot had received co-operation from Nintendo in relation to voice acting and animation, which Takahashi stated as [...] "contributing quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> the improvement of the game's graphics". Takahashi proceeded to explain why the role-playing game elements that were present in Mario Tennis were excluded from Power Tennis, stating that he felt they were more suitable for the [...] "deep single-player experience" [...] present in portable consoles. Regarding the themed courts in the game, he explained that the concepts were conceived during long brainstorming sessions, with courts selected that would both remind gamers of older Mario games and introduce new gamers to Mario games they may not have played. When questioned regarding difficulties in developing the game, Takahashi noted the effort used in making the opening sequences, developing the Special Games, and animations, which caused problems with meeting the schedule. Although there was speculation about online capabilities before release, Takahashi refrained from making the game online-compatible due to fear of lagging problems, stating [...] "I don't think you can play a tennis game online under the current Internet environment and feel satisfied".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Tapping {{found it}} a {{challenge}} to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; [...] "after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable – Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and {{it was sort of}} finding that because Carter always looks on the bright side and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will." [...] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a [...] "very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> that Britishness." [...] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just doing what I can {{to make it look}} good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E
