5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> or said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> or said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E

25|$|The arbitrators which {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} the dispute are called the arbitral tribunal. The composition of the arbitral tribunal can vary enormously, with either a sole arbitrator sitting, two or more arbitrators, with or without a chairman or umpire, and various other combinations. In most jurisdictions, an arbitrator enjoys immunity from liability for <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> or omitted whilst acting as arbitrator unless the arbitrator acts in bad faith.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1913, Deakin {{resigned}} as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning {{by a single}} vote. Forrest was very disappointed, especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government's majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor's large majority in the Senate, {{made it difficult to}} get <b>anything</b> <b>done.</b> In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia was sent back to the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the disposal of business in the Supreme Court, the President, if he, acting in his discretion, concurs with {{the advice of the}} Prime Minister, may appoint a person qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court to be a Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court for such period or periods as the President thinks fit. A Judicial Commissioner so appointed may, in respect of such class or classes of cases as the Chief Justice may specify, exercise the powers and perform the functions of a Judge of the High Court. <b>Anything</b> <b>done</b> by a Judicial Commissioner when acting in accordance with the terms of his or her appointment shall have the same validity and effect as if done by a Judge of that Court and, in respect thereof, he or she shall have the same powers and enjoy the same immunities as if he or she had been a Judge of that Court. A person may be appointed to be a Judicial Commissioner to hear and determine a specified case only, although this has not yet happened. In recent years, the Judicial Commissioner's post {{has been used as a}} testing ground to see if qualified persons are suited for elevation to the Bench as Judges of the High Court.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.|$|E

500|$|In 1958, Kneale's play Mrs Wickens in the Fall, {{transmitted}} by the BBC the previous year, was remade by the CBS {{network in the}} United States, retitled The Littlest Enemy. Broadcast on 18 June as part of The United States Steel Hour anthology series, the script was severely cut back in length. It was Kneale's only involvement with American television, {{and he was not}} pleased with the result. [...] "I made up my mind I would never ever again have <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> on a television network in America," [...] he later commented.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{continued}} {{to shape the}} negative view of Harding with several nonfiction works in the 1930s, culminating with The Incredible Era—The Life and Times of Warren G. Harding (1939) in which he called his subject [...] "an amiable, well-meaning third-rate Mr. Babbitt, with the equipment of a small-town semi-educated journalist... It could not work. It did not work." [...] Dean deems the works of White and Adams [...] "remarkably unbalanced and unfair accounts, exaggerating the negative, assigning responsibility to Harding for all wrongs, and denying him credit for <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> right. Today there is considerable evidence refuting their portrayals of Harding. Yet the myth has persisted." ...|$|E
500|$|Northern {{and central}} Sudan had been {{nominally}} under Egyptian suzerainty since an Ottoman force had conquered and occupied {{the region in}} 1821. The primary motive was not territorial conquest but to secure a source of slaves {{to serve in the}} Egyptian army. The slaves, paid in lieu of taxes, were brought from the formerly inaccessible regions of south Sudan. When the British explorer Samuel Baker visited Khartoum in 1862, he found that everyone in the town was involved in the slave trade, including the Governor-General. The Egyptian and Nubian garrison lived on the land like an army of occupation. Bribery {{was the only way to}} get <b>anything</b> <b>done.</b> Torture and floggings were routine in the prisons. Baker said of Khartoum [...] "a more miserable and unhealthy place can hardly be imagined". He described the Governor General Musa Pasha as combining [...] "the worst of Oriental failings with the brutality of a wild animal".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that an arbitrator is not liable for <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> or omitted {{to be done}} in the discharge of his or her duties as an arbitrator unless bad faith is shown.

2500|$|The Xinhai Revolution mainly {{got rid of}} feudalism (fengjian) from Late Imperial China.
