Wills that left items to Tiberius were reinterpreted to leave the items instead to Caligula. Centurions who had <b>acquired</b> <b>property</b> by plunder were forced to turn over spoils to the state.|$|E

25|$|Straw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education {{spokesman}} from 1987. In this role, {{he called}} on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right {{to opt out of}} the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women <b>acquired</b> <b>property</b> rights centuries before European women.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{contributions}} of the free men of color during the Natchez War, the French allowed them to join Louisiana's militias. This gave them important connections into the colonial society, contributing to their achieving an independent social status between the French colonists and slaves. In the 19th century, the free people of color established a relatively large class, especially in New Orleans. Many worked as highly skilled artisans; others became educated; they established businesses and <b>acquired</b> <b>property.</b> Of French and African ancestry, the base of Louisiana Creole people, they chiefly spoke French (developing a Creole French) and practiced Catholicism, while sometimes retaining ties to voodou and African practices.|$|E

Riley Hospital for Children opened in 1924, built with $45,000 donated by a mass fundraising event by Indiana civilians. Myers Hall was built in 1937, and Fesler Hall in 1939. 1947 saw the expansion of the medical research building using a five-year grant from the Riley Children's Foundation.

25|$|Things {{were put}} on hold for several months as Verdi became preoccupied with family matters, which {{included}} the illnesses of both his mother (who died in July) and father, the estrangement from his parents with communications conducted only between lawyers, and the administration of his newly <b>acquired</b> <b>property</b> at Sant'Agata (now the Villa Verdi near his hometown of Busseto), where he had established his parents. But {{his relationship with his}} parents, albeit legally severed, as well as Strepponi's situation living with the composer in an unmarried state, continued to preoccupy him, as did the deterioration of his relationship with his father-in-law, Antonio Barezzi. Finally, in April 1851, agreement was reached with the elder Verdis on the payment of debts mutually owed and the couple were given time to resettle, leaving Sant'Agata for Verdi and Strepponi to occupy for the next fifty years.|$|E

25|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, the Honduran government and some private groups came increasingly to place blame for the nation's economic problems on the approximately 300,000 undocumented Salvadoran immigrants in Honduras. Fenagh began to associate Salvadoran immigrants with illegal land invasions, and in January 1969, the Honduran government refused to renew the 1967 Bilateral Treaty on Immigration with El Salvador that had been designed to regulate the flow of individuals across their common border. In April INA {{announced that it would}} begin to expel from their lands those who had <b>acquired</b> <b>property</b> under agrarian reform without fulfilling the legal requirement that they be Honduran by birth. Attacks were also launched in the media on the impact of Salvadoran immigrant labor on unemployment and wages on the Caribbean coast. By late May, Salvadorans began to stream out of Honduras back to an overpopulated El Salvador.|$|E

500|$|The {{collective}} {{survived for}} about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, William and Frank Fay, Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary Annie Horniman, and the leading West End actress Florence Farr, the group established the Irish National Theatre Society. Along with Synge, they <b>acquired</b> <b>property</b> in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the Abbey Theatre. Yeats's play Cathleen ni Houlihan and Lady Gregory's Spreading the News were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both {{as a member of the}} board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the Dun Emer Press to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the Cuala Press in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to [...] "find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things." [...] From then until its closure in 1946, the press—which was run by the poet's sisters—produced over 70 titles; 48 of them books by Yeats himself.|$|E

On February 12, 2008 Yushchenko signed a decree for relieving a state property security personnel from duties at the State cottages area in Mezhyhirya. His decree canceled the previous presidential decree of January 12, 2006 where the security personnel was assigned to properties at Zalissya, instead of Zalissya and Mezhyhirya.|$|E
500|$|In 1770, Custine <b>acquired</b> <b>property</b> in the Niderviller region, which {{included}} a faience factory. The manufactory had been founded in 1735, but had enjoyed limited profitability. [...] Various difficulties, including a fire that gutted the production building and a limitation on the manufacture of soft-paste porcelain, discouraged the original investors. When Custine purchased the property in 1770, it was a struggling investment. He encountered significant financial problems over the next eight years, and considered bankruptcy in 1778. He subsequently entered into business with François-Henri Lenfrey and the factory began producing faience in the English style of tableware. Lenfrey also revamped the production process, producing cailloutage, which combined faience production techniques with a new process that mixed crushed limestone with the clay. Custine's execution led to the temporary closing of the plant when the regime confiscated his property; the workmen, summarily laid off, traveled to Paris to find work, and several signed a petition for her release. The continued war with the Coalition {{reduced the number of}} employees to 15; the factory survived, however, and enjoyed a renaissance in the mid-nineteenth century. Custine presented George Washington with a set of this tableware service in 1782.|$|E
500|$|Aside from politics, Kaʻauwai was a {{successful}} entrepreneur and {{was regarded as a}} [...] "man of wealth". He acquired and accumulated extensive property in Honolulu and Maui, and according to Reverend Armstrong, who was pastor at Kawaiahaʻo Church and knew him in later life, stated [...] "He did accumulate property; he had lands, houses, cattle, and money. But he did not hoard these fruits of his industry—he gave freely to aid in every good work; gave for the support of the Gospel; aided in building meeting houses and school houses; in sending the Gospel to the heathen, and in assisting the needy.” On March 1849, he attempted to purchase the island of Kahoʻolawe from the King and the Land Commission. Kaʻauwai offered $400 for the entire island, which had been previously used unsuccessfully as a male penal colony. The offer was refused by the King and his Privy Council of State, and a subsequent application dated to August 18, 1854 for a fifty-year lease at $200 per year was also declined. He also worked as a farmer and <b>acquired</b> <b>property</b> on Maui for growing taro and banana, which he won prizes for at the Hawaiian Agricultural Society in 1851.|$|E
