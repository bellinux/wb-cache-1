For aqueous potassium taurate solutions, the temperature effect on the reaction kinetics was measured at 285 and 305 K. Unlike aqueous primary <b>alkanolamines,</b> the partial reaction order in amino acid salt changes from one at low salt concentration to approximately 1. 5 at salt concentrations as high as 3, 000 mol·m− 3.

In the absence of reliable information in the literature on the kinetics and mechanism {{of the reaction}}, the applicability of the zwitterion and termolecular mechanism (proposed originally for <b>alkanolamines)</b> was explored. For the zwitterion mechanism, the forward second-order reaction rate constant (k 2) of the CO 2 reaction with amino acid salt seems to be much higher than for <b>alkanolamines</b> of similar basicity, indicating that the Bronsted plot for amino acid salts might differ from that of <b>alkanolamines.</b> The contribution of water to the deprotonation of zwitterion seems to be more significant than reported values for aqueous secondary <b>alkanolamines.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{classical}} {{force field}} is {{proposed for the}} molecular simulation of primary <b>alkanolamines</b> containing a NH 2 C C OH backbone. A method is devised {{to take into account}} the polar (Hbonding) environment of the <b>alkanolamines</b> by calculating electrostatic charges in the presence of explicit solvent molecules. The force field does not use a universal set of charges, but is rather constructed by following a general method for obtaining specific charges for the different <b>alkanolamines.</b> The model is parameterized on the two simplest primary <b>alkanolamines</b> and then validated by calculating thermodynamic properties of five other molecules. Experimental liquid densities and enthalpies of vaporization are also reported in order to complete existing literature data. The predicted ability of the force field is evaluated by comparing the simulation results with experimental densities and enthalpies of vaporization. Densities are predicted with an uncertainty of 1. 5 % and enthalpies of vaporization with an uncertainty of 1 kJmol 1. A decomposition of the interaction energy into electrostatic and repulsive- dispersive interactions and an analysis of hydrogenbond statistics lead to a complex picture. Some terms of these interactions are related to the molecular structure in a clear way, others are not.

Herein, advancements in the application of HPLC-PED to amine compounds are demonstrated. Chromatographic methods are provided for the separation of <b>alkanolamines,</b> amines and diamines. <b>Alkanolamines</b> and amines are separated on a multimodal column that combines reverse-phase and cation-exchange retention behavior, and the chromatographic results are compared to results from a C 18 reverse-phase column.

40|$|Background: Interaction of the iminium and <b>alkanolamine</b> {{forms of}} sanguinarine with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was {{characterized}} by spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings: Formation of strong complexes of BSA with both iminium and <b>alkanolamine</b> forms was revealed from fluorescence quenching of sanguinarine. Binding parameters calculated from Stern-Volmer quenching method revealed that the neutral <b>alkanolamine</b> had higher affinity to BSA compared to the charged iminium form. Specific binding distances of 3. 37 and 2. 38 nm between Trp 212 (donor) and iminium and <b>alkanolamine</b> forms (acceptor), respectively, were obtained from Forster resonance energy transfer studies. Competitive binding using the site markers warfarin and ibuprofen, having definite binding sites, demonstrated that both forms of sanguinarine bind to site I (subdomain IIA) on BSA. Sanguinarine binding alters protein conformation by reducing the a-helical organization and increasing the coiled structure, indicating a small but definitive partial unfolding of the protein. Thermodynamic parameters evaluated from isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that the binding was enthalpy driven for the iminium form but favoured by negative enthalpy and strong favourable entropy contributions for the <b>alkanolamine</b> form, revealing the involvement of different molecular forces in the complexation.

40|$|Binding of the iminium and <b>alkanolamine</b> {{forms of}} the benzophenanthridine anticancer {{alkaloid}} sanguinarine to hemoglobin (Hb) was investigated by absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectral techniques, and by calorimetry. The binding affinity of the charged iminium {{was found to be}} of the order of 106 M− 1, higher by one order than that of the neutral <b>alkanolamine,</b> from the analysis of the absorbance data. The fluorescence spectral data revealed that the quenching of Hb fluorescence by both forms of sanguinarine is due to the formation of a complex in the ground state and is of an unusual, static nature. Thermodynamic data revealed that the binding of the iminium form was exothermic in nature while that of the <b>alkanolamine</b> was endothermic; the former case predominantly involved electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions but the latter was dominated by mostly hydrophobic interactions. Calculation of the molecular distances (r) between the donor (β- Trp 37) and acceptor (iminium and <b>alkanolamine)</b> according to Förster’s theory suggests both {{forms of the}} alkaloid to be bound close to β-Trp 37 at the α 1 β 2 interface of the protein. The iminium form induced greater secondary structural changes in Hb than the <b>alkanolamine</b> as revealed by synchronous fluorescence, circular dichroism and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopic studies. These results are consistent with a stronger binding of the iminium over the <b>alkanolamine</b> form. Nevertheless, the hydrophobic probe ANS was displaced from hemoglobin more easily by the <b>alkanolamine</b> form than by the iminium. The study showed that Hb binds more strongly to the biologically active iminium form than the <b>alkanolamine,</b> in contrast to the stronger binding of the latter to plasma protein serum albumin.

In spite of the resistance of <b>alkanolamines</b> to chemical breakdown, plant and laboratory reports indicate that, on prolonged use, <b>alkanolamines</b> may be transformed into undesirable products from which the amines are not easily recovered. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as 'amine degradation', not only leads to amine losses, but may also contribute to operational problems such as foaming, corrosion, high solution viscosity and fouling as a result of decreasing the plant life. Amine based gas purification plants having absorption and stripping system, solvents are degraded at these two units mainly by oxidative degradation at absorber condition and thermal degradation at stripper condition.

With increased awareness of the consequences of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere, the focus of removing CO 2 from low pressure gas streams has gained increased attention the last years. In particular, this applies to the removal of CO 2 from the flue gases of fossil-fueled power plants. In the current work, efforts have been made to develop and understand the fundamentals of; (1) a CO 2 removal process based on <b>alkanolamines</b> in aqueous organic solvents, and (2) gas-liquid desorption processes. Dissociation constants of several amines, <b>alkanolamines,</b> and amino acids have been experimentally determined in aqueous and aqueous organic solvents.
