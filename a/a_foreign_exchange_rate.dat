40|$|This paper {{describes}} some long-run {{aspects of}} the Swiss balance of payments, highlighting two macroeconomic phenomena that make Switzerland stand out among other countries: first, it has had a persistent current account surplus and the largest ratio of net foreign assets to GDP in the world; second, its real interest rates have been significantly {{lower than those of}} most other industrialized countries, earning it the label “interest rate island”. These two distinctive features may be related, and ultimately both may result from an excess of national savings over investment for many years.

Then we discuss a method to impose long-run restrictions for VARs with stationary variables for which the nonstationary variables in the vector time series are not cointegrated.

40|$|In practice, many {{problems}} in the valuation of derivative assets are solved by using binomial approximations to continuous distributions. In this paper, we suggest an efficient method of approximating a general, multivariate lognormal distribution by a multivariate binomial process. There are two features of such multivariate lognormal distributions that are of interest. First, the state variables may have volatilities that change over different time intervals, i. e. exhibit a term structure of volatility, either because of changing volatility or mean-reversion. Second, there may be two or more relevant state variables involved, for example a commodity price and <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> which may covary {{with each other in}} a specified manner. The binomial approach to the valuation and hedging of options has become increasingly important with the creation of new exotic derivative products. Many options with path-dependent payoffs, for example, American options and Asian or average-rate options, may be valued using the binomial methodology 1. Also, in the analysis of interest rate derivative products, it is often useful to model the construction and evolution of the term structure of interest rates using a binomial process.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{performance}} of a stylized supply chain where two firms, a retailer and a producer, compete in a Stackelberg game. The retailer purchases a single product from the producer and afterwards sells it in the retail market at a stochastic clearance price. The retailer, however, is budget-constrained and is therefore limited in the number of units that he may purchase from the producer. We also assume that the retailer’s profit depends in part on the realized path or terminal value of some observable stochastic process. We interpret this process as a financial process such as <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> or interest rate. More generally the process may be interpreted as any relevant economic index. We consider a variation (the flexible contract) of the traditional wholesale price contract that is offered by the producer to the retailer. Under this flexible contract, at t = 0 the producer offers a menu of wholesale prices to the retailer, one for each realization of the financial process up to a future time τ. The retailer then commits to purchasing at time τ a variable number of units, with the specific quantity depending on the realization of the process up to time τ. Because of the retailer’s budget constraint, the supply chain might be more profitable if the retailer was able to shift some of the budget from states where the constraint is not binding to states wher...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1976. Bibliography: leaves [86]- 88. Microfiche. v, 88 leaves illEconomists have {{suggested}} {{a variety of}} policies for the adjustment of balance of payments. The broad policies of adjusting internal demand or changing the foreign exchange rate to adjust the balance of payments have been categorized as expenditure changing and expenditure switching. Expenditure changing comes from varying the level of national income mainly through monetary and/or fiscal policy. Expenditure switching uses the foreign exchange rate to divert domestic and foreign expenditure between home and foreign goods. A change in uniform rates of export subsidy and import tariffs is often said to be identical with <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change in its effects on the balance of payments. The main purpose of my study is {{to search for the}} most satisfactory policy tool to attain a more favorable balance of payments adjustment. I set the hypothesis that changing the foreign exchange rate is the best among these alternative policy tools. I compare the policy effects of monetary and/or fiscal policies with those of the foreign exchange rate change through a theoretical analysis. The opinion that the foreign exchange rate change and a uniform change in rates of export subsidy and import tariffs are identical is analyzed theoretically as well as tested empirically using Korean data. They are identical on three assumptions: First, the subsidy-tariff scheme must be applied to all international transactions, not only to merchandise transactions. Second, the elasticities of exports and imports with respect to subsidy and tariff changes must be equal to the elasticities of exports and imports with respect to foreign exchange rate change. Third, there must not be any inefficiency or corruption in the bureaucracy controlling the subsidy and tariff. Even if the second and third assumptions are met, the first is denied by the existence of international capital movements and the debt service transactions associated with them. In this case, the interest rate differential between local and foreign financing and the potential gap between the social and private cost of foreign borrowing plays the essential role in comparing the effects of the two policies. The theoretical discussion shows that the change of foreign exchange rate is better than monetary and/or fiscal policy as long as the foreign sector's fluctuations are not temporary phenomena. It is also found that changing the foreign exchange rate is better than the uniform subsidy-tariff scheme, when the latter is applied only to merchandise transactions, because of the foreign capital flow and its effects on merchandise transactions. The empirical test using Korean data for the period from 1962 to 1973 supports the theoretical conclusion of the advantage of changing the foreign exchange rate over the subsidy-tariff scheme. A non-uniform subsidy-tariff scheme, the subsidy on exports exceeding the tariff on imports, has been applied to merchandise transactions in Korea. The effects of foreign capital inflow on imports, which is the main point in the theoretical discussion are supplemented {{by the fact that the}} elasticities of several categories of exports with respect to foreign exchange rate change are higher than those with respect to the subsidy-tariff. The empirical findings show that the balance of payments would have improved by 3. 5 billion dollars more with the use of exchange rate policy than with the use of the uniform subsidy-tariff scheme during the period studied...|$|E
