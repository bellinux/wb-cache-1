In one quantitative study, the reduction of nitrobenzene to <b>aniline</b> receives 64 <b>points</b> out of 100 marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an amide using HMDS is only described as adequate with a combined 32 points.|$|R

Significant chemical functionalization of the oil (chlorination, sulfonation, etc.) can interfere with the measurement, due to changes to the solvency of the functionalized oil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{applicability}} of a structural method of analysis (the <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> method) for light petroleum fractions like kerosene and jet fuel. As <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> method requires, mixtures of pure hydrocarbons were used- typical for the corresponding classes of hydrocarbon within the same range of boiling points, thuse mimicking the petroleum fractions. The structural groups method n-d-M was applied further {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained by <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> method. Results on hydrocarbon mixtures were compared with those for real petroleum fractions. It was demonstrated that chemical composition of kerosene and jet fuel can be determined either by <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> method with good accuracy or with n-d-M method, both methods having the advantage to be cheap and fast. These methods can be used for intermediate products (raw or hydrogenated) but not for additivated finished product...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two sets {{of numbers}} {{can be used to}} {{describe}} the polarity of a liq-uid. One set, which includes the Hildebrand solubility parameter and dielec-tric constant, is based solely on the properties of the liquid itself. The other set depends on the interaction of the liquid with one or more reference materials. This group includes <b>aniline</b> <b>point,</b> miscibility number, molar transition energy, and polarity index. Since the <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> is mainly concerned with paraffin hydrocarbons, no attempt was made to relate it to the other parameters. How-ever, it was found that a parabolic rather than a straight line relationship ex-ists between the logarithm of the volume change of the NBR vulcanizate and the <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> of the oils. There is no correlation between the solubility pa-rameter and either dielectric constant or the members of the other group. While the molar transition energy increases with increasing polarity index, there is a large amount of scatter. There is better correlation between polarity index and the miscibility number, particularly if the values for alcohols are ignored...|$|E

The experiments were performed using a fuel matrix of 128 gas oils, which covered the cetane index range 23 - 62. Although other parameters were also considered, the majority of the predictions were based on the distillation curve and the density of the fuels. Very good predictions were obtained for the <b>aniline</b> <b>point,</b> the kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, and for the fuels' aromatic content.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{operation}} temperature and furfural/oil ratio on a single-stage furfural refining process for two distillates was studied. The acid number, basic nitrogen, refractive index and <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> {{of each of}} the distillates and the refined oils were measured. They were assumed as four oil components, and the liquid-liquid equilibrium data and corresponding partition coefficients of the pseudo-components could be determined through mass conservation equations and simulated based on the artificial neural networks method. A multistage mathematical model for the refining process was established and solved numerically to give the refined oil quality and recovery under various furfural/oil ratios, temperatures, and stages, which showed a good agreement with those obtained from a pilot plant and the separatory funnel experiments under similar operation conditions. This paper may provide a useful way to assist in determining the optimum conditions and designing plant for the furfural refining process...|$|E
40|$|The {{petroleum}} solvents {{covered in}} this monograph are all complex mixures of hydrocarbns produced from petroleum distilation fractions {{which have been}} further refined {{by one or more}} process. U nlike petroleum fuels (lARC, 1989), these miures are not produced by blending various refineiy procss streams but rather by further refining and distiling one or two streams to make a product significantly different in chemical composition and much narrower in boiling range (tyically 15 - 30 °C) than its source streams. Petroleum solvents are generally defined and differentiated by certain physical properties and by chemical composition. Among the properties of importnce, depending on the intended end-use of the solvent, are boiling range, flash-point, solvent strength (solvency), colour, odour, aromatic content and sulfur content. Some of these properties are interrelated; for example, increasing the aromatic content often increases solvency, but also increases odour. ln addition, the same propert may be measured in different ways in different industries or in different geographic regions; for example, kauri-butanol value (the amount of petroleum solvent in mililtres required to cause cloudiness in a solution of kauri gum and n-butanol) and <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> (the minimal temperature for complete mixg of aniline with a petroleum solvent) are both indicators of solvency but kauri-butanol value is more commonly used in Europe and <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> more commonly in the USA. It is not surpriing, then, that the same names may be used for solvents that are not identical, and that different classification systems or names may be more common in one industiy or geographic region than another. 'White spirts', for example, is a common term in Europe but is seldom used in the USA.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is on the}} determination of the properties of palm oil as potential base oil for producing bio based lubricants. The samples analysed were obtained from the open markets in the South West, South East and South South zones of Nigeria. Some of the physical and chemical properties such as viscosity, flash point, pour point, cloud point, specific gravity, acid number, noack volatility and <b>aniline</b> <b>point</b> were analysed. The samples were degummed, neutralised and bleached to remove the red colour (carotene) and gummy materials. The bleached samples were tested to determine the above mentioned properties. Comparison of the crude palm oil and the bleached samples with the conventional lubricants Mobil Super SAE 20 W 40 and Mobil gear oil SAE 75 W 90 was made. Finally, it was observed that the crude palm oil and the bleached sample exhibit good lubricating characteristics to be used as base oils for formulation of bio-lubricants. Despite palm oil being a food crop, an abundance of available land and the scale of prospective market demand suggest that commercial cultivation is unlikely to negatively affect food cultivation and the prices of food products...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{regarding}} {{molecular modelling}} of refining processes {{have been carried}} out during last decades, which demonstrate the importance of molecular management in the optimisation of petroleum operations. One of the most studied processes has been hydrotreating, {{not only because of the}} technical, safety and operating importance of removing olefins, heavy metals, sulphur, nitrogen and oxygen compounds from petroleum fractions but also due to the stricter environmental control that demands the removal of harmful compounds, such as aromatics. Hence, it is essential to have a better understanding of the chemistry involved in hydrodesulphurisation and to include it as part of the process modelling to get a better perspective of the overall process. One of the main issues of building reliable molecular models of petroleum refining processes has been the difficulty of validating these models with appropriate information regarding the true composition of the different components of crude oil. Therefore, the improvement and development of analytical methods for hydrocarbon research during last years is regarded as a valuable breakthrough, for making possible a deeper analysis of the composition of complex mixtures and for enabling a greater availability of this essential information. With this background, it was proposed the molecular modelling and optimisation of diesel hydrotreating processes, based on the available information of the reactor model, the actual composition of different reactor feeds and products, their distillation curves and densities. Moreover, for the representation of the molecular composition of the feedstocks and products, Molecular Type and Homologous Series (MTHS) matrices were built and utilised through the entire modelling process. Furthermore, the molecular composition of the different components (organised by carbon number) of each homologous series were considered to follow statistical distributions, which were fitted by probability density functions (PDFs). Finally, by the employment of the proposed models, it was achieved a precise estimation of other bulk properties of feedstocks and products of the diesel hydrotreating processes, such as molecular weight, cetane number, kinematic viscosity, flash point, <b>aniline</b> <b>point,</b> cloud point and pour point. In a nutshell, the building of reliable and integrated models of the entire hydrotreating process, containing a strong chemical background, is expected to allow a better selection and application of optimisation strategies to improve the economic, operating and environmental performance of refineries. Additionally, the developed methodology could be extended for being applied in the modelling and optimising of other refining processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} H 2 partial {{pressure}} (H 2 pp) during the hydrotreating of heavy gas oil, derived from Athabasca bitumen, over commercial NiMo/¥ã-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was studied in a micro-trickle bed reactor. The experimental conditions were varied as follows: temperature: 360 to 400 ¨¬C, pressure: 7 to 11 MPa, gas/oil ratio: 400 to 1270 mL/mL, H 2 purity range of 0 to 100 vol. % (with the rest either CH 4 or He), and LHSV range of 0. 65 to 2 h- 1. The two main {{objectives of the}} project were to study {{the nature of the}} dependence of H 2 pp on temperature, pressure, gas/oil ratio, LHSV (Liquid Hourly Space Velocity), and H 2 purity. The project was divided into three phases: in phase one the effect of H 2 purity on hydrotreating of heavy gas oil (HGO) was studied, in phase two the nature of H 2 pp dependency and the effect of H 2 pp on hydrotreating of HGO was investigated, and in phase three kinetic studies were carried out using different kinetic models. The objective of phase one was to study the effect of hydrogen purity on hydrotreating of HGO was studied in a trickle bed reactor over a commercial Ni&# 8722;Mo/¥ã-alumina catalyst. Methane was used as a diluent for the hydrogen stream, and its effect on the catalyst performance was compared to that of helium, which is inert toward the catalyst. Furthermore, a deactivation study was conducted over a period of 66 days, during which the catalyst was subjected to H 2 purities ranging from 75 to 95 % (with the rest methane); no significant deterioration in the hydroprocessing activities of the catalyst was observed. Therefore, it was concluded that methane was inert toward a commercial Ni&# 8722;Mo/¥ã-alumina catalyst. However, its presence resulted in hydrogen partial pressure reduction, which in turn led to a decrease in hydrodesulphurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodearomatization (HDA) conversions. This reduction can be offset by increasing the total pressure of the system. HDS, HDN, HDA, and mild hydrocracking (MHC) conversions were studied. Also determined were cetane index, density, <b>aniline</b> <b>point,</b> diesel index, and fractional distribution of the products. The main objective of phase two was to study the effects of H 2 pp on hydrotreating conversions, feed vaporization, H 2 dissolution, and H 2 consumption were studied. The results show that HDN and HDA are significantly more affected by H 2 partial pressure than HDS; with the HDN being the most affected. For instance as the inlet H 2 partial pressure was increased from 4. 6 to 8. 9 MPa HDS, HDN, and HDA conversions increased for 94. 9 %, 55. 1 %, and 46. 0 % to 96. 7 %, 83. 9 %, and 58. 0 %, respectively. Moreover, it was observed that H 2 dissolution and H 2 consumption increased with increasing H 2 pp. No clear trend was observed for the effect of H 2 pp on feed vaporization. In phase three the kinetics of HDS, HDN, and HDA were studied. The power law, multi-parameter, and Langmuir - Hinshelwood type models were used to fit the data. The prediction capacities of the resulting models were tested. It was determined that, while multi-parameter model yielded better prediction, L-H had an advantage in that it took a lesser number of experimental data to determine its parameters. Kinetic fitting of the data to a pseudo-first-order power law model suggested that conclusions on the effect of H 2 pp on hydrotreating activities could be equally drawn from either inlet or outlet hydrogen partial pressure. However, from the catalyst deactivation standpoint, it is recommended that such conclusions are drawn from the outlet H 2 partial pressure, since it is the reactor point with the lowest hydrogen partial pressure...|$|E
