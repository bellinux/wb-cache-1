This book is a summary of doctoral research, which combines nearly ten years of training to teachers on computational problems, and ten years of education of the blind. These two large parallel experiences allow a new synthesis: math is not just numbers and formulas, but a real educational tool that we use many times without full awareness of its potential. Through the most recent contributions of neurosciences, we realized that the blind access to mathematics in a very special way, opening up new perspectives on a issue unfairly mystified...|$|R

50|$|In {{the short}} film, Vezo the 14-year-old {{daughter}} of a Vezo family, Narcia, {{tells the story of}} their survival in the style of a fable. In simple and poetic terms she describes how things were before she was born, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> afterwards. She begins: “Before I was born people used to say: go out with a boat and you will come back with a boat full of fish. Go to the reef and you will come back with all of the octopus you need.” She goes on to explain that when she was born villages were growing in size, families were getting bigger and there were more mouths to feed. As a result, the fish and octopus began to dwindle. Then scientists, who had heard of their plight, came to Madagascar and worked beside them. The Vezo learned how to rotate their fishing grounds, avoid hunting octopus for a season and how to plant seaweed which would not only become a crash crop for them but would supplement their livelihood, further relieving the pressure on fishing and octopus hunting.|$|E

Qualitative evidence will be provided in the form of eye-witness accounts of Indigenous language use fostering health such as: elders reversing mental aging during extended language documentation work, language learning fostering sobriety, and positive changes in children engaged in learning their ancestral Indigenous language. Though quantitative data in this eld is scarce, we will look at studies linking Indigenous language use to suicide rate, drug abuse, physical violence, diabetes, social and emotional well-being, obesity, cognitive function, and economic opportunities. We’ll look at studies of bilingualism itself and its effects on health, finding information that language communities, health care workers and educators should con- sider; compared to monolinguals, bilinguals live longer without dementia; bilinguals of any age have greater executive function and cognitive flexibility; bi- and multi-lingual brains have more grey and white matter. We will conclude by considering ideas for future studies in this eld, for instance: <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the brain when an ancestral language goes into disuse under duress <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the brain when that language’s dormant neurology is reawakened...|$|R

We summarize {{a lot of what}} is known about the reside class domains C(X) /P and add many new results about this subject with an emphasis on determining when the ordered C(X) /P is a valuation domain (i. e., when given two nonzero elements, one of them must divide the other). The interaction between the space X and the prime ideal P is of great importance in this study. We summarize first what is known when P is a maximal ideal, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when C(X) /P is a valuation domain for every prime ideal P (in which case X is called an SV-space and C(X) an SV-ring). Two new generalizations are introduced and studied. The first is that of an almost SV-spaces in which each maximal ideal contains a minimal prime ideal P such that C(X) /P is a valuation domain. In the second, we assume that each real maximal ideal that fails to be minimal contains a nonmaximal prime ideal P such that C(X) /P is a valuation domain. Some of our results depend on whether or not βω ω contains a P-point. Some concluding remarks include unsolved problems...|$|R
