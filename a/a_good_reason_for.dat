25|$|Magnan v. Anaconda Industries, Inc 193 Conn. 558, 479 A.2d 781 (1984) the Connecticut Supreme Court {{held that}} good faith was {{a rule of}} construction, which could not {{contradict}} the express terms of a contract.

25|$|Because {{the family}} {{spent much of}} his {{childhood}} travelling round Europe, most of his education was by private tutors. He only spent about two years in formal schooling, first at King's College School in London (then located in Somerset House) and then, for a few months, at Warwick Grammar School (now Warwick School). Here his time was ended by a bronchial disease of the kind that was to plague him throughout his long life. His father considered his ill-health as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> another European tour.|$|E

25|$|After the An Shi Rebellion (755–763), {{the economy}} of {{northern}} China was greatly damaged and never recovered due to wars and to constant flooding of the Yellow River. Such a case occurred in the year 858 when an enormous flood along the Grand Canal inundated {{thousands of acres of}} farmland and killed {{tens of thousands of people}} in the North China Plain. Such an unfortunate event could reduce the legitimacy of a ruling dynasty by causing others to perceive it as having lost the Mandate of Heaven; this was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> dynastic authorities to maintain a smooth and efficient canal system.|$|E
25|$|Although an American citizen {{for many}} years, Joe McManus {{continued}} {{to visit his}} Canadian friends and attend many Canadian meetings {{in spite of the}} numerous demanding professional and scientific positions which he held for more than 3 decades. His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Canadians to remember him. To those of us who met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.|$|E
500|$|With {{the opening}} of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, [...] "I cannot give you <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think {{that the idea of}} a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E

500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a handle on the character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody has come up with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E
500|$|More than 40 {{years after}} the Meckiff incident, Jones was sure the bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said [...] "They'd {{decided to do it}} a week before the game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was {{chairman}} of the umpires selection committee." [...] Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied. Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler—the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen—instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> that which I can't disclose and won't disclose." [...] Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff's last match, hinted at the same. He recalled [...] Rowan's words at the pre-match function: [...] "It's {{going to be a very}} interesting game".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave a [...] "B+" [...] rating to {{the first}} half of the film and a [...] "C-" [...] rating to the second half, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "As {{political}} theater, Che moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, so much information was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. How else to explain one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E

2500|$|Even so, {{as is true}} with {{virtually}} all major denominations, the debate between the conservative and liberal persuasions of the Lutheran Church continues today. As the Gotwald heresy trial book puts it, in [...] "the Twenty-first Century, {{in the wake of}} the ecumenical movement, Lutherans are again being challenged to identify their reasons for being and knowing their true identity.

2500|$|The {{story was}} dramatised in more-or-less this {{form in the}} 1999 film Topsy-Turvy. However, even though the 1885–87 Japanese {{exhibition}} in Knightsbridge had not opened when Gilbert conceived of The Mikado, European trade with Japan had increased in recent decades, and an English craze for all things Japanese had built through the 1860s and 1870s. This made the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert told a journalist, [...] "I cannot give you <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> our ... piece being laid in Japan. It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think {{that the idea of}} a chief magistrate, who is ... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{was born}} in Pensacola, Florida, to two very {{different}} parents. His mother, Carol, was warm and easy-going, whereas his father, Roy Sr., was much like a Marine Drill Instructor with respect to his son. A decorated Vietnam veteran, ex-club fighter and retired aircraft engineer who had taken up hog farming, Roy Sr. was harsh on his son from early on, taunting the child, [...] "sparring" [...] with him, enraging on him, yelling at him and abusing him, often for 20 minutes at a time. This behavior never really changed; if anything it became more brutal as Roy Jr. grew up. Many people would call Roy's father's treatment out-and-out abuse, but he believed he had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> it: to make Roy Jr. tough {{enough to be a}} champion. In this pursuit, he was relentless and Roy Jr. lived in constant fear of his father's verbal and physical violence against him.|$|E
2500|$|These {{examples}} {{suggest that}} a [...] "bare presence"—that is, knowledgeless sensation that {{is no more than}} evidence—may really occur. Present supporters of the non-epistemic theory thus regard sensations as only data {{in the sense that they}} are [...] "given" [...] (Latin datum, [...] "given") and fundamentally involuntary, which is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> not regarding them as basically mental. In the last century they were called [...] "sense-data" [...] by the proponents of qualia, but this led to the confusion that they carried with them reliable proofs of objective causal origins. For instance, one supporter of qualia was happy to speak of the redness and bulginess of a cricket ball as a typical [...] "sense-datum", though not all of them were happy to define qualia by their relation to external entities (see Roy Wood Sellars). The modern argument, following Sellars' lead, centers on how we learn under the regime of motivation to interpret the sensory evidence in terms of [...] "things", [...] "persons", and [...] "selves" [...] through a continuing process of feedback.|$|E
5000|$|A {{trademark}} of Parkin's Doctor Who novels is {{the inclusion of}} a character written as if played by Ian Richardson, beginning with Oscar Steinmann in Just War.

2500|$|Many {{members of}} the Australian media alleged a {{conspiracy}} against Meckiff, using words such as [...] "the whole affair smacks of a set-up", [...] "obvious fall-guy", and [...] "sacrificial goat". Several called for Bradman and his colleagues to resign. Cricketer-turned-journalist Dick Whitington cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot. Gibbs later claimed that the selection of an extra bowler for the match hinted at fears that Meckiff {{would not be able}} to bowl. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> that which I can't disclose and won't disclose." [...] Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff’s last match, hinted at the same. He recalled that Rowan had said [...] "It's going to be a very interesting game" [...] at the pre-match function. For his part, Egar always denied any conspiracy had occurred or that he agreed to a premeditated course of events against Meckiff.|$|E
2500|$|Sunderland’s {{relations}} with Paul Barillon, whose long tenure as Ambassador from Louis XIV (from 1677 to 1688) produced many memorable exchanges between the twain, were tenuous and strained. When Louis failed to give James any assistance against the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Sunderland told Barillon sharply [...] "the King your master may have plans I cannot discern, but I hope he will put things right {{by making it}} clear that this has all been a misunderstanding". When Barillon protested that his master's aim was [...] "the Peace of Europe" [...] Sunderland said that it was impossible for everyone in Europe to want peace at the same time: [...] "myself I think it will last until {{one side or the other}} has <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> breaking it". To prevent Barillon from gaining too much influence, Sunderland intercepted and leaked an unusually indiscreet dispatch where the Ambassador boasted of having blocked an Anglo-Dutch treaty. Charles II was predictably furious, and Barillon was for a time forbidden the Court. [...] Sunderland remarked that if Barillon would behave himself so, it was “but just that it come home to him".|$|E
2500|$|An Iowa poll {{conducted}} on July 26 placed Huckabee far behind front-runners Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson, but ahead of second tier candidates Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, Duncan Hunter, and Tommy Thompson. Huckabee has {{also agreed to}} be part of a Cancer Forum in Iowa on August 28, held by cancer survivor Lance Armstrong. In the summer of 2007, Huckabee began to become closely compared to Kansas Senator Sam Brownback, also a Presidential candidate, for their similar socially conservative views. Huckabee and Brownback have been said to be the top candidates among evangelicals and other Christians. Huckabee tried to separate himself from Brownback (and succeeded, as Brownback dropped from the campaign) whom he saw as his main rival at that point. When asked what separates him from Brownback, he said that [...] "the key difference is I've actually been a Governor for ten and a half years and I've run a government." [...] He also said that no senator has been elected since JFK, and [...] "frankly there's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> that." [...] Several polls in the state have placed Huckabee ahead of Brownback; a Mason-Dixon poll placed him at 7% with Brownback at 6. Huckabee acknowledged their similarities and said that [...] "without a doubt, we're going after the same voters." [...] Other sources have expressed concern that there is room for only one of them in the race, and that if Huckabee comes out on top, Brownback will struggle to raise money and vice versa.|$|E
