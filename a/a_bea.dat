25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} <b>a</b> <b>BEA</b> requirement for a 100-seat aircraft to replace their Viscounts. The original Type 870 design was then modified when TCA expressed their interest in the design as well, and Vickers returned the updated Type 950 that filled both requirements. The main difference between the Viscount and Vanguard was {{the construction of the}} fuselage. The Vanguard started with the original Viscount fuselage, but cut it off about halfway up from the bottom, replacing the top section with a larger-diameter fuselage to give it a double bubble cross-section (similar to the Boeing Stratocruiser). The result of the larger upper portion was a roomier interior, with increased cargo capacity below the floor.|$|E
25|$|At 15:36, flight {{dispatcher}} J. Coleman presented the load sheet to Key whose request for engine start clearance was granted three minutes later. As {{the doors were}} about to close, Coleman asked Key to accommodate <b>a</b> <b>BEA</b> flight crew that had to collect a Merchantman aircraft from Brussels. The additional weight of the three crew members necessitated the removal of a quantity of mail and freight from the Trident to ensure its total weight (less fuel) did not exceed the permitted maximum of 41,730kg. This was exceeded by 24kg, but as there had been considerable fuel burnoff between startup and takeoff, the total aircraft weight (including fuel) was within the maximum permitted take-off weight.|$|E

The design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before {{settling}} on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 [...] "Airbus" [...] in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident, which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design.

40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Aspergillus nidulans {{can use a}} wide range of compounds as nitrogen sources. The synthesis of the various catabolic enzymes needed to breakdown these nitrogen sources is regulated by the areA gene, which encodes a GATA transcription factor required to activate gene expression under nitrogen-limiting conditions. The areA 102 mutation results in pleiotropic effects on nitrogen source utilization, including better growth on certain amino acids as nitrogen sources. Mutations in the sarA gene were previously isolated as suppressors of the strong growth of <b>an</b> <b>areA</b> 102 strain on l-histidine as a sole nitrogen source. We cloned the sarA gene by complementation of a sarA mutant and showed that it encodes an l-amino acid oxidase enzyme with broad substrate specificity. Elevated expression of this enzyme activity in <b>an</b> <b>areA</b> 102 background accounts for the strong growth of these strains on amino acids that are substrates for this enzyme. Loss of function sarA mutations, which abolish the l-amino acid oxidase activity, reverse the areA 102 phenotype. Growth tests with areA 102 and sarA mutants show that this enzyme is the primary route of catabolism for some amino acids, while other amino acids are metabolized through alternative pathways that yield either ammonium or glutamate for growth...|$|R

2500|$|In {{his studies}} of Turkish and Turkic {{borrowings}} into the Romanian lexis, Lazăr Șăineanu looked back on historical events leading {{back to the}} Age of Migrations, such as in highlighting the possible Pecheneg origin of relatively common Romanian words such as buzdugan ("mace"), duium ("multitude"), dușman ("enemy"), caia ("horseshoe nail"), colibă ("hut") and fotă ("skirt"). However, one of his primary focuses was on Ottoman Turkish as a mediator between Romanian and other languages: the Romanian word giuvaier ("jewel"), borrowed from the Turkish cevahir, but originating with a Persian source; trampă ("barter"), taken from the Turkish trampa, but sourced to the Italian tramutare ("to transform"); talaz ("high wave"), identical to the Turkish intermediary, and through it borrowed from the Greek Θάλασσα (thalassa, [...] "sea"). Additionally, the scholar documented the distant impression of Levantine territories, as first introduced through Ottoman culture—as illustrated by the original references to Egypt as Misir, from the Arabic مصر (Miṣr), {{as opposed to the}} more modern [...] He also discussed the professional suffixes -giu and -angiu, both of Turkish origin and present in words borrowed during the early modern and Phanariote eras. Main examples include barcagiu ("boater" [...] or [...] "ferryman"), bragagiu ("boza maker"), geamgiu ("window fitter"), toptangiu ("wholesale vendor") etc., but the suffix is also applied ironically in various other contexts—for example, mahalagiu ("inhabitant of the mahala", [...] "suburbanite" [...] or [...] "uncouth person") and duelgiu ("dueler"). Șăineanu's texts followed the evolutions of similar words ending in -liu (such as hazliu, [...] "funny", from haz, [...] "laughter"), of popular figures of speech directly translated from their Turkish original (<b>a</b> <b>bea</b> tutun, [...] "to drink tobacco", or the question în ce ape te scalzi?, [...] "what waters do you bathe in?", figurative for [...] "how are you feeling?"), and of strong obscenities reflecting Oriental sources. In general, Șăineanu concluded, such appropriation from an area mediated by Islam and Islamic culture was not present in areas directed related to Christian practice and intellectual life.|$|E

40|$|The areA gene of Aspergillus oryzae was cloned by cross-hybridization {{with the}} Aspergillus nidulans areA gene {{and was found}} to encode an 866 -amino-acid protein that {{is very similar to}} other fungal {{nitrogen}} regulatory proteins. The <b>A.</b> oryzae <b>areA</b> gene can complement <b>A.</b> nidulans <b>areA</b> loss-of-function mutations. Functional analyses indicated that the N-terminal region of the A. oryzae AreA protein was dispensable for function and revealed a probable acidic activation domain in the protein. C-terminal truncation of the protein resulted in derepression of several nitrogen-controlled activities in A. nidulans, while deletions extending into the conserved GATA type zinc finger region abolished the activator function. The <b>A.</b> oryzae <b>areA</b> gene was inactivated by replacement with the A. oryzae pyrG gene. Strains containing the resulting areA deletion grew as well as the wild-type strain on glutamine but were unable to grow vigorously on other nitrogen sources, including ammonium. While A. oryzae exhibited reduced growth on 10 mM ammonium, the results of growth tests indicated that areA mutants of both A. oryzae and A. nidulans were affected in utilization of low concentrations of ammonium. The levels of the major nitrogen assimilatory enzymes, NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 4. 1. 4) and glutamine synthetase (EC 6. 3. 1. 2), were determined. In both A. oryzae and <b>A.</b> nidulans <b>areA</b> mutants, the NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase levels were reduced, whereas the glutamine synthetase levels were not affected. These results suggest that the AreA protein may {{play an important role in}} the regulation of nitrogen assimilation in addition to its previously established regulatory role in nitrogen catabolism...|$|R
