40|$|In recent years, {{cutaneous}} {{stem cells}} have been implicated {{not only in}} epidermal and hair follicle renewal and repair but also in epidermal tumourigenesis. Stem cells {{have been identified in}} human, rodent, and, recently, canine hair follicles. However, to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in the dog to elucidate the role of stem cells in the development of hair follicle tumours. In this study, 10 infundibular keratinizing <b>acanthomas,</b> 10 trichoblastomas, 10 trichoepitheliomas, 10 pilomatricomas, and four tricholemmomas were retrospectively investigated for the expression of keratin 15 (K 15) and nestin, two recognized markers of epidermal/follicular and follicular stem cells, respectively. Inaddition, 30 squamous cell carcinomas were evaluatedfor K 15 expression. Four samples of normal-haired skinfrom healthy dogs were used as positive controls. Immunohistochemical expression was determined usingcommercially available antibodies (Keratin 15, cloneLHK 15, Thermoscientific; Nestin, clone ab 7659; Abcam) that had already been tested and described in theveterinary literature. Expression of K 15 and nestin inthe cytoplasm of neoplastic cells was semi-quantitativelyscored as negative (0) (75 % of positive cells). The intensity of the reaction of single cells was furtherevaluated as faint (+), medium (++) or strong(+++). In normal adult canine skin, K 15 was expressedin the outer root sheath cells of the isthmic portion of thehair follicle (bulge region) and multifocally in the basalcell layer of the epidermis. Nestin expression was lesspronounced and restricted to the middle portion of thehair follicle. For K 15, expression was negative or mild inthe majority of infundibular keratinizing <b>acanthomas</b> (9 / 10), pilomatricomas (10 / 10), and squamous cells carcinomas(27 / 30). The trichoepitheliomas were the mostheterogeneous group regarding the expression of K 15, interms of both percentage of positive cells and intensity ofexpression. Trichoblastomas were moderately to stronglypositive (7 / 10) and showed the highest intensity ofreaction of all the tumours studied. Tricholemmomaswere either negative (2 / 4) or moderately to stronglypositive (2 / 4). In all samples, K 15 immunostaining ofneoplastic cells and lobuli was generally more prominentin the external or deep portions of the tumour. Althoughmilder and not equivalent, the trend of nestin expressionin follicular tumours was similar, with the highestpositivity in trichoblastomas and a high variability intrichoepitheliomas. However, the reaction was alwaysvery faint, and nestin was therefore judged a non-optimalmarker {{for the study of the}} role of stem cells in hairfollicle tumours of the dog. Our results suggest that hairfollicle stem cells in the bulge may play a role intumourigenesis of tumours originating from this portion,namely trichoepitheliomas and trichoblastomas, wherethe highest K 15 immunostaining was observed. The lossof K 15 expression in squamous cell carcinomas comparedto normal skin suggests that this event could becritical in the malignant transformation of epidermaltumours, although further studies are needed to confirmthis.

40|$|Background - Although {{cutaneous}} {{stem cells}} have {{been implicated in}} skin tumourigenesis in humans, no {{studies have been conducted}} to our knowledge to elucidate the role of stem cells in the development of hair follicle tumours in the dog. Animals and Methods - In the current study, normal skin sections and 44 follicular tumours were retrospectively investigated for the immunohistochemical expression of keratin 15 (K 15) and nestin. In addition, 30 squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated for K 15 expression. Results - In normal skin, K 15 and nestin were expressed in the outer root sheath cells of the isthmic portion of the hair follicle (bulge region) and K 15 expression was also scattered in the basal cell layer of the epidermis. Infundibular keratinizing <b>acanthomas,</b> pilomatricomas and squamous cell carcinomas were mostly negative for K 15, trichoblastomas were moderately to strongly positive, and trichoepitheliomas had heterogeneous staining. Nestin expression was generally faint in all follicular tumours. Conclusions - Our results show that K 15 can be a reliable marker {{for the study of the}} role of stem cells in hair follicle tumours of the dog, while nestin was judged a non optimal marker. Furthermore, our study suggests that hair follicle stem cells in the bulge region of hair follicles may play a role in tumourigenesis of canine tumours originating from this portion of the follicle, namely trichoblastomas and trichoepitheliomas. The loss of K 15 expression in squamous cell carcinomas compared to normal skin suggests that this event could be critical in the malignant transformation. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Background - Epithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) is a multistep process, {{important in}} tumour invasion and metastasis, characterized by loss of epithelial markers, redistribution of β-catenin and gain of mesenchymal markers. Hyposthesis/Objectives - Our {{aim was to}} investigate the immunohistochemical aberrant expression of cytokeratin, vimentin, survivin and heat shock protein  72 (Hsp 72) in canine cutaneous epithelial tumours, to understand the association of expression of these molecules with features of malignancy and their role in the EMT phenotype. Methods - Ten canine squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs; one with lymph node metastasis), 30 canine hair follicle tumours (six pilomatricomas, eight infundibular keratinizing <b>acanthomas,</b> six trichoepitheliomas and 10 trichoblastomas) and five normal skin samples were investigated by immunohistochemistry using specific anti-vimentin, -cytokeratin, -survivin and -Hsp 72 antibodies. A semi-quantitative method was used to analyse the results, as follows: 0 to < 5 %; ≥ 5 to < 10 %; ≥ 10 to < 25 %; and ≥ 25 % of positive cells. Immunofluorescence was performed to investigate survivin-vimentin and survivin-Hsp 72 colocalization in selected SCCs. Results - In malignant hair follicle tumours and SCCs, a reduced intensity of cytokeratin and increased survivin and Hsp 72 expression were observed. In SCCs, loss of cytokeratin expression and vimentin immunolabelling, suggestive of the EMT phenotype, were evident in < 5 % of neoplastic cells in the front of tumour invasion. In the same areas, strong nuclear survivin and cytoplasmic Hsp 72 staining was evident, often colocalizing. Only a few neoplastic cells in the front of tumour invasion showed vimentin-survivin colocalization. Conclusions and clinical importance - A possible simultaneous involvement of survivin and Hsp 72 in tumour invasion and the multistep process of EMT of cutaneous epithelial tumours of dogs is suggested.

50|$|The {{outcome of}} this disease can be fatal with a median {{survival}} of 2 to 3 years, although some {{appear to have a}} benign form (Degos <b>acanthoma)</b> which affects only the skin. Laparoscopy may be an effective means of screening those with cutaneous lesions to determine if systemic disease is present. Treatment options are limited, and until recently consisted mainly of antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants or immunosuppressants with few reports of prolonged survival. More recently eculizumab and treprostinil have been employed. Discovered by dermatopathologist, Cynthia Magro, response to eculizumab is often immediate and dramatic, but has been of limited duration and is expensive, needing to be infused every 14 days. Treprostinil use has been reported to result in clearing of gastrointestinal and CNS findings as well as clearing of cutaneous lesions, but reports are limited. Treprostinil may be more effective than other vasodilators because it may also increase the population of circulating endothelial cells, allowing angiogenesis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{cutaneous}} melanocytoma-acanthoma in a 2 -year-old female German Shepherd Dog was char-acterized by {{the presence}} of two populations of neoplastic cells: epithelial and melanocytic. The epithelial component consisted of nests of well-differentiated stratified squamous epithelium closely associated with neo-plastic melanocytes. The epithelial cells immunoreacted with both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-cytokeratin antibodies, and immunoreaction to S- 100 protein and vimentin was observed in the melanocytic cells. This rare pigmented skin neoplasm of the dog apparently has a benign behavior. Key words: Dogs; immunohistochemistry; melanocytoma-acanthoma; skin. Melanocytic tumors represent 6 – 10 % of all skin tumors in dogs. 2, 12 Benign tumors (melanocytomas) occur more fre-quently in the eyelids and trunk, and malignant tumors (mel-anomas) are more frequently found in distal extremities.
