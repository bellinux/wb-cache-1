5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely {{the side effects of}} increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E
5|$|Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) is a {{composite}} material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> reinforced by fine glass fibers.

5|$|Mir {{featured}} a shower, the Bania, located in Kvant-2. It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which featured <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso {{were found in the}} same area, also in <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E

Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive (Mark Benton), who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose the Doctor is dangerous, and that if he's there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> doppelgänger.|$|E
5|$|The high melting point, {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of iridium and its alloys determine {{most of its}} applications. Iridium and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as rayon. Osmium–iridium is used for compass bearings and for balances.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> cup.

Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E

5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning up any spill {{immediately}} and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material {{directly on the}} spill.

The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, {{seven years}} after his arrest in 1982, Andrew Wilson filed a civil suit against four detectives (including Burge), a former police superintendent, and the City of Chicago. He {{said that he had}} been beaten, suffocated with <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag, burned (by {{cigarette}} and radiator), and treated with electric shock by police officers when interrogated about the February 1982 murders; he also had been the victim of the pattern of a police and city cover-up.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. <b>A</b> <b>plastic</b> bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1986, the accused, {{a career}} {{criminal}} named Olaf Dietrich (born 1952), flew from Bangkok, Thailand, to Melbourne Airport.

He was arrested the next morning by the Australian Federal Police, who searched his flat and found one of the condoms in the kitchen, and some heroin in <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag under a hirug in another room. He was taken into custody, and passed {{the remainder of the}} condoms during the night at the hospital in Pentridge Prison. Dietrich alleged that the drugs had been planted by the police.|$|E

5|$|Since {{much of the}} {{criticism}} {{is the result of}} photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still of which can be seen on the right), shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E
