5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> {{door on the}} north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on {{the north end of}} the west front, to an octagonal turret <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> portcullis from the west entrance.|$|E
5|$|Charles Leale, a young Army surgeon, {{pushed through}} the crowd {{to the door of}} Lincoln's box but found it would not open. Rathbone, inside the door, soon noticed <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> wooden brace with which Booth had jammed it shut.|$|E
5|$|George {{objected to}} the anti-Catholic wording of the Accession Declaration {{that he would be}} {{required}} to make at the opening of his first parliament. He made it known that he would refuse to open parliament unless it was changed.

5|$|The Cambodian–Vietnamese War was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea. The war began with isolated clashes along the land and maritime boundaries of Vietnam and Kampuchea between 1975 and 1977, occasionally involving division-sized military formations. On 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> Khmer Rouge government from power.|$|E
5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The Germans had evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> pumps which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker inaccessible to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|As Ali Riza Bey, the {{commander}} of the 13th Regiment, took charge of the Ottoman effort around Lone Pine, the grenading continued into the next day as the Ottomans began to prepare for a large-scale counterattack. Throughout the morning the remaining Australian positions overlooking The Cup were abandoned before the fighting stopped briefly as both the Australians and Ottomans evacuated their wounded <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> dead from the front-line. By this time the 1st and 2nd Battalions, which had been defending the heavily counterattacked southern flank, had suffered so many casualties that they were withdrawn from the line, with the 7th Battalion moving into their positions late in the afternoon. The 3rd, 4th and 12th Battalions remained holding the north and centre of the Australian line.|$|E

5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and the coffin plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> coffin plaque.|$|E
5|$|Calthrop {{constructed}} {{the line for}} £35,944, £11,000 less than the original estimate. He had Kitson & Co construct two 2-6-4T locomotives, similar in outline but smaller than the Barsi Light Railway locomotives. Goods rolling stock included four coaches, two bogie open wagons and one bogie van, once again similar to Barsi stock. He also introduced four transporter wagons, designed to transport standard-gauge wagons. Each station on route had a short section of standard-gauge track where the wagons could be placed. The use of transporter wagons eliminated transshipment, <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> need for large numbers of goods wagons.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} grew {{that the}} Thames might {{be vulnerable to}} attack from torpedo boats and armoured cruisers, and in 1903 four quick-firing 12-pounder, 12 cwt (5.4 kg, 50.8 kg) guns were positioned on Tilbury's south-east curtain wall, supplemented in 1904 by two 6-inch (15 cm) breech loading guns. In 1905, however, the government decided that the Royal Navy and the forts downstream gave sufficient protection for the capital <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> artillery, leaving only machine-guns in place.|$|E

5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he {{has been criticized for}} not respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Hsu {{went to the}} United States as a Columbia University {{exchange}} scholar. In {{the same}} year, he joined the World United Formosans for Independence, and he also served as the literary editor for the Taiwan Tribune. As a result, he {{was placed on the}} Kuomintang's black list and was unable to return to Taiwan. He then earned his PhD candidacy from New School for Social Research. In 1990, Hsu was invited to a meeting by President Lee Teng-hui and returned to Taiwan as a Taiwanese-American professor. With the influence of then-legislators Chen Shui-bian, Peng Pai-hsien, Hung Chi-chang, and Lu Hsiu-yi, the government relented <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> restriction for Hsu to exit and enter the country, finally issuing him a new passport.|$|E

See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control {{of the city and}} Strip.|$|E
5|$|In 226 BC, the {{citizens}} of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaeans from the city. One night, he and his troops crept into the citadel <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> Achaean garrison. The king reinstated the ancient laws {{of the city and}} returned to Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into Achaea, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to Dyme, where he was met by the entire Achaean army. In the Battle of Dyme, the Spartans routed the Achaean phalanx, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and presented it to the Elians.|$|E
5|$|Ismael {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} {{further to the}} north, peaking at 10.9inches (276mm) in Sonora. Severe flooding was reported in Huatabampo. The hurricane directly affected 24,111people in 8 municipalities. Throughout Sonora, the strong winds destroyed 4,728 houses <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> roofs of 6,827 homes. The hurricane also destroyed 107 schools and 2 health centers in the state. The passage of Hurricane Ismael damaged high-tension power lines and cable lines, causing interruptions to the communication system. The hurricane also weakened 2,163miles (3,481km) of gravel roads and damaged about 100miles (165km) of paved highways. 250people lost their jobs in Sonora due to sunken or damaged fishing boats. In addition, about 83 sq. miles (215km²) of crop lands were impacted. Damage in Sonora amounted to $8.6million (1995USD, $50million 1995 MXN, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|Priestley also {{defended the}} rights of Dissenters against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69) had become the {{standard}} legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his Commentaries: he rephrased the offending passages <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth {{season was}} coached by former UFC Heavyweight {{champion}} Brock Lesnar and Junior dos Santos, {{who would later}} go {{on to win the}} same title. This season featured welterweights <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> elimination bouts to get into the house, with 14 fighters immediately gaining entry into the house. The first day of training saw Myles Jury pull out of the competition with a knee injury. The wildcard made another appearance, with Javier Torres and Chuck O'Neil getting the slots, leading to a submission victory for O'Neil. The final of this season saw Tony Ferguson defeat Ramsey Nijem via KO in the first round.|$|E
5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>the</b> intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
