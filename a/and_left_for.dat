5|$|Exeter {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his armour <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> dead on the battlefield at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured. His followers found him {{and took him to}} Westminster Abbey. On his recovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for four years before submitting to Edward's rule. Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of the Roses. Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475, and the duke was reported to have fallen overboard and drowned without any witnesses.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, 1863, General Ewing retaliated {{against the}} Confederate guerrillas by issuing General Order No. 11, an {{evacuation}} order that evicted almost 20,000 people from four Missouri counties and burned {{many of their}} homes. The order was intended to rob the guerrillas of their support network in Missouri. On October 2, a group of 450 guerrillas under Quantrill's leadership met at Blackwater River in Jackson County <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Texas.|$|E
5|$|After the Villa Expedition, Patton was {{detailed}} to Front Royal, Virginia, {{to oversee}} horse procurement for the Army, but Pershing intervened on his behalf. After the United States entered World War I, and Pershing was named {{commander of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front, Patton requested to join his staff. Patton was promoted to captain on May 15, 1917 <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Europe, among the 180 men of Pershing's advance party which departed May 28 and arrived in Liverpool, England, on June 8. Taken as Pershing's personal aide, Patton oversaw the training of American troops in Paris until September, then moved to Chaumont and assigned as a post adjutant, commanding the headquarters company overseeing the base. Patton was dissatisfied with the post and began to {{take an interest in}} tanks, as Pershing sought to give him command of an infantry battalion. While in a hospital for jaundice, Patton met Colonel Fox Conner, who encouraged him to work with tanks instead of infantry.|$|E

5|$|After {{the court}} adjourned, St-Calais was held as a {{prisoner}} at Wilton Abbey until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Normandy, and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope Urban II did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his see, but nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return, perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering {{the end of a}} siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Anarawd's brother, Cadell ap Gruffydd, {{took over}} {{as head of the}} family. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, rebuilt Carmarthen castle in 1145 then began a {{campaign}} to reclaim Ceredigion. He built a castle in the commote of Mabudryd, but Cadell, aided by Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd who held Ceredigion for Gwynedd, destroyed it in 1146. Rhys appears in the annals {{for the first time in}} 1146, fighting alongside his brothers Cadell and Maredudd in the capture by assault of Llansteffan Castle. This was followed by the capture of Wiston in 1147, Carmarthen in 1150 and Loughor in 1151. In 1151 Cadell was attacked while out hunting by a group of Norman and Flemish knights from Tenby, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> dead. He survived, but suffered injuries which left him unable to play an active role, and in 1153 he left on a pilgrimage to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Bjaðmunjo Mýrjartaksdóttir (also {{known in}} Old Norse as Bjaðmynja; and in Gaelic as Ben Muman, Bé Binn, Blathmuine, and Bláthmín; fl. 1102/1103) was a {{daughter}} of a Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. In 1102 whilst still a child, {{she was married to}} Sigurðr, son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway. At this time, Magnús appears to have been in the process of setting up his son as king over the Earldom of Orkney, the Kingdom of the Isles, and the Kingdom of Dublin. The marriage itself temporarily bound Muirchertach and Magnús together as allies before the latter's death the following year. Sigurðr thereupon repudiated Bjaðmunjo, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Scandinavia, where he proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his brothers.|$|E

5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached Asunción. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy II {{begins as}} Firion, Maria, Guy and Leon are {{attacked}} by Palamecian Black Knight soldiers <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> dead. Firion, Maria, and Guy are rescued by Princess Hilda, who {{has established a}} rebel base {{in the town of}} Altair after her kingdom of Fynn was invaded by the Emperor. Hilda denies their request to join the rebel army because they are too young and inexperienced. The three set off for Fynn in search of Leon; there they find a dying Prince Scott of Kashuan, Hilda's fiancé, who informs them that a former knight of Fynn, Borghen, betrayed the rebellion and became a General in the Imperial army. The party returns to Altair to inform Hilda. She allows the group to join the rebellion and asks them to journey north to find mythril, a metal which could be used to create powerful weapons. The party makes its way north to the occupied village of Salamand, saves the villagers forced to work in the nearby mines, and retrieves the mythril.|$|E
5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels {{to the other end of}} the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E

5|$|Having {{trained with}} Walsall's Centre of Excellence as a boy, and then played local {{football}} for Tividale, Davis began a scholarship in Wolverhampton Wanderers' youth academy in 2007. He turned professional in 2009, {{and made his}} senior debut the same year while on loan to Darlington of League Two. He spent time on loan at three other clubs in the lower leagues– Walsall and Chesterfield of League One and League Two Shrewsbury Town– {{as well as at}} Scottish Premier League side Inverness Caledonian Thistle, before making seven appearances for Wolves in the Premier League {{at the end of the}} 2011–12 season during their unsuccessful fight against relegation. Although playing fairly regularly in the Championship, he never established himself as a consistent member of the starting eleven as Wolves were again relegated. He fell out of favour the following season, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> West Midlands neighbours Birmingham City in August 2014.|$|E
5|$|Helios– The former God of the Sun. Helios {{had entered}} into Ares' wager, {{choosing}} the fiery-being Cereyon, who was drowned by Kratos in the God of War comic series. Years later, in Chains of Olympus, Helios was kidnapped by the Titan Atlas {{on behalf of}} the goddess Persephone, who intended to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World, causing the destruction of Olympus. The plan was thwarted by Kratos, and Helios was rescued. When Kratos turned against the gods and lead the Titans in an assault against Olympus in God of War III, Helios was injured <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> dead by the Titan Perses. Found by Kratos, Helios remained loyal to Zeus and attempted to trick Kratos, but was decapitated by the Spartan, which caused worldwide darkness and storms. The Head of Helios became a weapon for Kratos, using it to cast a blinding light and reveal hidden doorways. The character was voiced by Dwight Schultz in Chains of Olympus, and Crispin Freeman in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|In October 1887, Dubois {{abandoned}} his academic career <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) {{to look for}} the fossilized ancestor of modern man. Having received no funding from the Dutch government for his eccentric endeavorsince no one at the time had ever found an early human fossil while looking for ithe joined the Dutch East Indies Army as a military surgeon. Because of his work duties, it was only in July 1888 that he began to excavate caves in Sumatra. Having quickly found abundant fossils of large mammals, Dubois was relieved of his military duties (March 1889), and the colonial government assigned two engineers and fifty convicts to help him with his excavations. After he failed to find the fossils he was looking for on Sumatra, he moved on to Java in 1890.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland, former Covenanter James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose led a {{campaign}} {{in favour of}} the king in the Highlands from 1644. Few Lowland Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen sent by the Irish Confederates under Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla), he began a highly successful mobile campaign, winning victories over local Covenanter forces at Tippermuir and Aberdeen against local levies; at Inverlochy he crushed the Campbells; at Auldearn, Alford and Kilsyth he defeated well-led and disciplined armies. He was able to dictate terms to the Covenanters, but as he moved south, his forces, depleted {{by the loss of}} MacColla and the Highlanders, were caught and decisively defeated at the Battle of Philiphaugh by an army under David Leslie, nephew of Alexander. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops. By this point the king had been heavily defeated at the Battle of Naseby by Parliament's reformed New Model Army and surrendered to the Scots forces under Leslie besieging the town of Newark in July 1646. Montrose abandoned the war <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> the continent.|$|E
5|$|Josef Mengele was {{a medical}} officer {{assigned}} to Auschwitz concentration camp from 1943 {{until the end}} of the war. As well as making most of the selections of inmates as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country; he acquired a Red Cross passport <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Argentina; he set up a business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to extradite Mengele in 1960, but he could not be found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Mauve took Van Gogh on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he {{was surprised at how}} good the results were.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E
