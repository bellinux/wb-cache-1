5|$|Until this point, all {{the printed}} {{material}} (mostly just charts {{of the alphabet}} and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, which was not suitable for printing at small sizes. Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 {{the board of regents}} appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make <b>a</b> <b>business</b> <b>card</b> for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.|$|E

His phone's SIM card was missing, which made mobile phone tracking of his location impossible. He told Chilean police that unidentified armed robbers hid {{in the hotel room}} and killed Flores when she disobeyed their order to be quiet. Van der Sloot's Dutch attorney claimed that his client {{was on his way to}} Santiago to turn himself in.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at two locations in Sapporo, Studio Jack at the Yamaha Center in Chūō-ku, and at Chieria Studio in the Sapporo Lifelong Learning Center in Nishi-ku. After it was commissioned, the album {{took only a}} month to produce, as Sakanaction mostly reworked demos they had already produced to create an album. Only the song [...] "Yoru no Higashigawa" [...] was written specifically for the album. Two of the songs had been released by Yamaguchi's first band Dutchman, [...] "Inner World" [...] in 2002 and [...] "Mikazuki Sunset" [...] in 2003. As a soloist, Yamaguchi released a remix of the song [...] "Shiranami Top Water" [...] on the compilation album Music for Pardisco in 2004. Retrospectively, Yamaguchi said that Go to the Future felt like <b>a</b> <b>business</b> <b>card</b> for Sakanaction, due to the album being a compilation of already created songs.|$|E

[...] Hurley {{encounters}} an apparition of Charlie. [...] Shocked, he speeds away in his Camaro and is apprehended by Los Angeles police. [...] Hurley is interrogated by Ana Lucia Cortez's (Michelle Rodriguez) former partner Detective [...] "Big" [...] Mike Walton (Michael Cudlitz) and he lies that he has no knowledge of Ana Lucia. [...] Hurley, looking at the interrogation room's mirror glass, imagines seeing Charlie swimming in water until he breaks the glass and floods the room.

[...] Jack confirms that Hurley will not reveal the Oceanic Six's secrets. [...] Hurley apologizes for going with Locke and insists that they return to the island, but Jack refuses (which shows that these flashforwards occur before Jack's flashforwards).|$|E
500|$|In another {{scene in}} the episode, Homer shows his family an {{advertisement}} for his security company. In it, a monster is seen breaking into an elderly woman's house. When the woman screams, the screen freezes and Homer is composited to the screen, instructing the audience about SpringShield's telephone number. In order to composit Homer into the screen, director Michels made use of a greenscreen. The advertisement resumes and the monster is subdued by Homer, Lenny and Carl. Confused, the monster turns to Homer and asks, [...] "friend?" [...] to which Homer replies [...] "the only friend you need is SpringShield," [...] and holds <b>a</b> <b>business</b> <b>card</b> {{in front of the}} camera. The monster then puts the card in his wallet and says [...] "monster put in wallet." [...] The monster's last line was written during one of the episode's rewrites, but none of the writers on The Simpsons writing staff has taken credit for it. The line has since become very popular with the series' writing staff; Jean said that it was [...] "very funny and unusual for a television show," [...] and Gould considers it to be his favorite joke in any episode he has ever written. At the end of the episode, Maggie saves Homer by shooting Fat Tony's gang members with a rifle. The scene was conceived by series co-creator and executive producer James L. Brooks while writing notes during the episode's first table-read.|$|E

While lauded by {{an increasing number of}} literary critics, DeLillo was still relatively unknown outside of small academic circles and did not reach a wide readership with this novel. Also in 1982, DeLillo finally broke his self-imposed ban on media coverage by giving his first major interview to Tom LeClair, who had first tracked DeLillo down for an interview while he was in Greece in 1979.

2500|$|In April 1971, Abagnale {{reportedly}} {{escaped from}} the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta, Georgia, while awaiting trial. In his book, Abagnale considers this {{to be one of}} the most infamous escapes in history. During the time, U.S. prisons were being condemned by civil rights groups and investigated by congressional committees. In a stroke of luck that included the accompanying U.S. marshal forgetting his detention commitment papers, Abagnale was mistaken for an undercover prison inspector and was even given privileges and food far better than the other inmates. The Federal Department of Corrections in Atlanta had already lost two employees as a result of reports written by undercover federal agents and Abagnale took advantage of their vulnerability. He contacted a friend (called in his book [...] "Jean Sebring") who posed as his fiancée and slipped him the business card of [...] "Inspector C.W. Dunlap" [...] of the Bureau of Prisons, which she had obtained by posing as a freelance writer doing an article on fire safety measures in federal detention centers. She also handed over <b>a</b> <b>business</b> <b>card</b> from [...] "Sean O'Riley" [...] (later revealed to be Joseph Shea), the FBI agent in charge of Abagnale's case, which she doctored at a stationery print shop. Abagnale told the corrections officers that he was indeed a prison inspector and handed over Dunlap's business card as proof. He told them that he needed to contact FBI Agent Sean O'Riley on a matter of urgent business.|$|E
