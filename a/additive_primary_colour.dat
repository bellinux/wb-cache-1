From these potential applications, in this article, we {{will focus on}} the electrochromic polymers and devices. Although several objective studies have been conducted in the last decade, bringing to light many advantages over other types of electrochromics, polymeric electrochromics have not yet received the industrial attention that they deserve. One of the most important and dazzling advantages of polymers over the other types of electrochromics is the ease of modification of a polymers backbone, that changes almost the entire properties of the material and switches many disadvantages into advantages. Our recent completion of the deficient third leg of <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colour</b> space was a very good example of tailoring the polymer backbone. This discovery could be considered as one of the milestones of commercialization of polymeric electrochromics. In this article, we will also discuss the completion of the additive primary colours, red, green and blue (RGB), in polymeric electrochromics and their ways of commercialization...|$|E
50|$|Starting as an {{experiment}} with a projector displaying a video of the projector itself - {{very much in the}} spirit of Nam June Paik’s work - RGB-light (1996) became just as much a study of how projected light behaves when interacting with visitors. The projection itself is in black and white, but the light cast {{on the wall of the}} exhibition space is prismatically split into a variety of colours, depending on how the three <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colours</b> (red, green and blue) of the RGB projector are affected by the movement of visitors in the space.A continued experimentation with the possibilities within these aspects of optics has resulted also in the prints RGB (1996-2012) and the computer animation RGB-information (2005).|$|R
