He {{was the voice of}} Ethan, a college student and Haley's crush, who listens to Professor Baxter's (Roger) advice about {{following}} your heart <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> new. Ethan takes this the wrong way and stabs his father 38 times (not shown) and becomes very crazy. Roger admits to being a fake, and he and Hayley leave, saying that the police are coming. This suggests that Ethan gets arrested, and is out of the show. Wood does not appear again.|$|E

[...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; it just seems to be setting Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The idea here screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E

And you can be a Republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration, and improving our education system, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country. I don’t think there's anything inconsistent with this." ...|$|E

2500|$|A new album, Sounds {{from the}} Other Side, was {{released}} on 27 September 2013 by the Permanent Records label and distributed by Shock Records. Pete Laurie of theMusic website found [...] "isn't about reinventing the wheel, but it never sounds like a lazy rehash of {{the good old days}} either". Lewis explained to The Ages Martin Boulton [...] "We got to a point after the re-formation where we decided not to put an end date on it [...] we said we can't keep playing that same period [...] {{for the rest of our}} lives [...] While we love it and we know our fans love it … in order to be a relevant, creative unit [...] for our own personal satisfaction more than anything, we've got to try writing again <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> new together and that's been really interesting and amazing". The group announced an Australian tour to promote the album during November and December 2013.|$|E
2500|$|International film actress Natalie Portman joined FINCA as its [...] "Ambassador of Hope" [...] in 2003, {{following}} {{a meeting with}} Queen Rania. About the meeting, she explains, [...] "Because I'm Israeli and Queen Rania {{is probably the most}} high-profile Palestinian woman in the world, I had this dream of meeting with her <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> that would promote peace and working together between Israeli and Palestinian women. She talked to me a lot about what she calls the 'hope gap' that exists between the one third of the world that has and the two thirds that do not. I wasn't even aware that two thirds of the world population are extremely poor, living on less than a dollar a day, and that 70 percent of those people are women and children. It's not something they teach you in school in the States". Since then, Portman has visited FINCA field projects in Mexico, Guatemala, Uganda, and Ecuador, and met with several members of Congress to argue for more government funding for microfinance ventures.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
