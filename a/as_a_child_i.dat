25|$|I {{remember}} {{as a child}} {{that she had a}} drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

[...] "I always sang <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> <b>I</b> {{was one of those}} kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror.

500|$|Since {{her death}} and the {{publication}} of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, A Childhood at Green Hedges, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure. Imogen considered her mother to be [...] "arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and {{without a trace of}} maternal instinct. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her." [...] Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as [...] "a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion".|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, Usher's father, Usher Raymond III, died. Both men regretted not {{spending}} more time in each other's lives. [...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my father always prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E
500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E

[...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|Dust Be My Destiny, co-written in 1939 by Rossen, is {{the story}} of a {{fugitive}} from justice who is eventually acquitted with help from an attorney and a journalist, the latter arguing that [...] "a million boys all over the country" [...] were in a similar plight. Warner Bros. then ordered producer Lou Edelman to cut the script, adding that [...] "This {{is the story}} of two people – not a group. It is an individual problem – not a national one."

So I {{decided to make a}} real treasure, of gold, bury it in the ground and paint real puzzles to lead people to it. The key was to be Catherine of Aragon's Cross at Ampthill, near Bedford, casting a shadow like the pointer of a sundial.|$|E
