In {{order to}} predict the <b>absorbing</b> {{properties}} of <b>absorbing</b> material effectively in theory, effective media theory was applied to reduce the effective electromagnetic parameters of several composite <b>absorbing</b> agents under different volume ratio.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to <b>absorb</b> other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player will be able to attract planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them <b>absorb</b> asteroids until they become another star.|$|E

5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission.

In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to <b>absorb</b> the X-rays.

Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to <b>absorb.</b> This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can <b>absorb</b> in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
