5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the college}} {{was founded in}} a sparsely {{populated}} area with {{only a handful of}} nearby farmhouses, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> arduous stagecoach ride from Lansing, the College built four faculty houses {{in the first year of}} classes in 1857. One of these original faculty houses, Cowles House, still exists as the President's official residence, though only two walls and part of the foundation remain of the original construction. Ultimately, ten faculty homes were built on campus between 1857 and 1885. Besides Cowles House, one other survived and was moved into the city of East Lansing; the rest were demolished between 1922 and 1948 to make room for the north complex of residence halls and the Student Union, designed by Pond and Pond.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this failure, the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that such a move could not be made and {{would lead to the}} Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake such a move because it would abandon all but a small portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> enormous technical task that would take too long to complete.|$|E

During World War II, tea was rationed in the United Kingdom. In 1953 (after rationing in the UK ended), Tetley launched the tea bag to the UK <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> immediate success.|$|E

An had initially scored a yuko with an ippon seoi nage, but was retracted by the referees. Despite earning a shido with one second left, it was still two less than Pollack, making him Korea's first finalist of the tournament. It was his fourth time winning against Pollack.|$|E

Middlesex finished second after two wins over Kent in late August, to improve five places on their 1897 finish, while Derbyshire broke their streak of 22 Championship matches without victory by beating Hampshire in late May. As for individual performances, Surrey batsman Bobby Abel made 1800 runs for the second season in succession, one run off his own Championship record from 1897.|$|E

Her persona of a ditzy dumb blonde was {{compressed}} heavily in her film roles, which sought only to market her physical assets. In an attempt to earn acting respect, Smith agreed to appear in To the Limit (1995), which would be her first starring role. In the film she played Colette Dubois, a retired spy seeking revenge on the murderer of her late husband. Although the film was highly publicized and boasted a lavish budget and script, Smith's performance drew negative reviews <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> ultimate box office bomb.

25|$|Teopanzolco is an archeological site {{located just}} east of the {{historic}} downtown of Cuernavaca. Its construction is dated to the year 1427, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> important ceremonial center during the 15th and 16th centuries when the native Tlahuicas were dominated by the Aztecs. The site shows significant Aztec influence. It has a large pyramidal base, called the Gran Basamento, topped by two shrines, much like the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan. Only the stone columns of these shrines remain today. The teocalli, or sacred plaza, contains fourteen monuments including a circular altar dedicated to the wind deity Ehécatl. There are also two concentric structures separated by a moat or ditch. Both might have been dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, the feathered-serpent deity.|$|E

During the Communist era most sports clubs {{concentrated}} on all-round sporting development, therefore CSKA, Levski, Lokomotiv and Slavia are dominant not only in football, but in many other team sports as well. Basketball and volleyball also have strong traditions in Sofia. A notable local basketball team is twice European Champions Cup finalist Lukoil Akademik. The Bulgarian Volleyball Federation is the world's second-oldest, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> exhibition tournament organised by the BVF in Sofia that convinced the International Olympic Committee to include volleyball as an olympic sport in 1957. Tennis is increasingly popular in the city. Currently there are some ten tennis court complexes within the city including the one founded by former WTA top-ten athlete Magdalena Maleeva.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after reading}} Price's sermon, Burke wrote {{a draft of}} what {{eventually}} became, Reflections on the Revolution in France. On 13 February 1790, a notice in the press said that shortly, Burke would publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its British supporters, however he spent the year revising and expanding it. On 1 November he finally published the Reflections <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> immediate best-seller. Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, {{but by the end}} of 1790, it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator, Pierre-Gaëton Dupont, wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold. The French translation ran to ten printings by June 1791.|$|E

25|$|The Sarcee Indian Reserve leased a part {{of their}} land in the summer of 1914 to the Canadian Militia to enable them to {{establish}} a prospective training site for military personnel. It was then known as Sarcee Camp (as it overlooks the Sarcee Nation), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> exclusive area in Alberta to provide training to the soldiers who were to be assigned to fight during the First World War. The military reserve was used by the Canadian Forces from before the First World War up until the 1990s. In all, 45,000 men were trained at the military camp. With this strength, the camp was the largest military training establishment in Canada during the war time. The 30 various units, housed in tents, included trainees drawn from various parts of the province. From Fort Calgary, it took a day's ride to approach the camp.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest and}} most {{important}} form of incunabula of the era was satire. There were great dangers in being associated with satire and its publication was generally done anonymously. To begin with, defamation law cast a wide net, and {{it was difficult for}} a satirist to avoid prosecution if he were proven to have written a piece that seemed to criticise a noble. More dangerously, wealthy individuals would often respond to satire by having the suspected poet physically attacked by ruffians. The Earl of Rochester hired such thugs to attack John Dryden suspected of having written An Essay on Satire. A consequence of this anonymity is that a great many poems, some of them of merit, are unpublished and largely unknown. Political satires against The Cabal, against Sunderland's government, and, most especially, against James II's rumoured conversion to Roman Catholicism, are uncollected. However, such poetry was {{a vital part of the}} vigorous Restoration scene, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> age of energetic and voluminous satire.|$|E
25|$|Coleman kicked 537 {{goals in}} just 98 appearances, {{at an average}} of 5.48 goals per game. At the time of his retirement, it was the highest goals-per-game average by any player, {{exceeding}} the next-best total of Bob Pratt (4.31 goals per game) by more than a goal. Coleman's feats were even more impressive by virtue {{of the fact that he}} achieved them at a time when the rules of the game were less favourable to full-forwards: between 1925–1939, a free kick was always awarded against the last team to play the ball before it went out of bounds, which resulted in teams of the era adopting a direct game-plan which favoured strong full-forwards, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> era which produced many of the league's heaviest goalscorers, including Pratt, Gordon Coventry, Bill Mohr and Ron Todd; but Coleman played after the boundary throw-in had been re-introduced, resulting in more play along the wings and less prominence from full-forwards. As of 2014, Coleman's record has been surpassed by only Peter Hudson (5.64 goals per game).|$|E
