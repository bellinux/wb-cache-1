5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear.

5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, {{largely as a result}} of the number of medical tests to which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Quisling, using the testimony of German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E

5|$|In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, {{high priest}} Imhotep has {{a love affair}} with Anck-su-Namun, the {{mistress}} of Pharaoh Seti I. When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles. Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return.|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti {{was influenced by}} Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu {{iconography of}} Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E

5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|From 1953 to 1961 Grant {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the study of Hinduism, becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi. He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, Lord Kusuma Haranath, and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume Lord Haranath: A Biography by Akella Ramakrishna Sastri. He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the Bombay-based The Call Divine, as well as for Richard Cavendish's Man, Myth & Magic. Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Feet</b> of the Guru in 2005. Grant believed that the O.T.O.'s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion, in doing so relying heavily on Curwen's ideas about tantra.|$|E

5|$|Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said {{immediately}} after the race that nine teams– all but Ferrari– agreed not to race, and had Jordan not reversed its decision at the last minute, Minardi would also have boycotted the race. In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, {{for the benefit of}} the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
5|$|The Pope {{commissioned}} French abbot Bernard of Clairvaux {{to preach}} the Second Crusade, and granted the same indulgences for it which Pope Urban II had accorded to the First Crusade. A parliament was convoked at Vezelay in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on March 31. Louis VII of France, his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Bernard {{to receive the}} pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed {{to the success of}} his mission. At Speyer, Conrad III of Germany and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, received the cross from the hand of Bernard. Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to earn a}} {{good living}} in the village, Harihar travels {{to the city to}} seek a better job. He {{promises}} Sarbajaya that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty. Sarbajaya grows increasingly lonely and bitter. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of her husband, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home. As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.|$|E
5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and with so little time left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of}} the area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E
