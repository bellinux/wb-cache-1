30|$|A {{discussion}} of the upper bound follows. Recall that the salient problem in generating networks from a PA model is indexing the network’s nodes {{in such a way}} that sampling, insertion, and incrementation can be accomplished efficiently. Tonelli et al. [14] provide a clever method for accomplishing all three tasks in constant time, provided that the preference function is linear and the fitness is both uniform across all nodes and constant. Given constant insertion and sampling times, the generation of a network with |V| nodes takes O(|V|) time. Considering that the lower bound is Ω(|V|), we have the <b>asymptotically</b> <b>tight</b> <b>bound</b> of T(G)=Θ(|V|).|$|E
40|$|The Shannon {{lower bound}} {{is one of}} the few lower bounds on the {{rate-distortion}} function that holds for a large class of sources. In this paper, it is demonstrated that its gap to the rate-distortion function vanishes as the allowed distortion tends to zero for all sources having a finite differential entropy and whose integer part is finite. Conversely, it is demonstrated that if the integer part of the source has an infinite entropy, then its rate-distortion function is infinite for every finite distortion. Consequently, the Shannon lower bound provides an <b>asymptotically</b> <b>tight</b> <b>bound</b> on the rate-distortion function if, and only if, the integer part of the source has a finite entropy.

40|$|An {{oriented}} graph is a directed graph with no bi-directed edges, i. e. if xy is an edge then yx {{is not an}} edge. The oriented size Ramsey number of an {{oriented graph}} H, denoted by r(H), is the minimum m for which there exists an oriented graph G with m edges, such that every 2 -colouring of G contains a monochromatic copy of H. In this paper we prove that the oriented size Ramsey number of the directed paths on n vertices satisfies r(P_n) = Ω(n^ 2 n). This improves a lower bound by Ben-Eliezer, Krivelevich and Sudakov. It also matches an upper bound by Bucić and the authors, thus establishing an <b>asymptotically</b> <b>tight</b> <b>bound</b> on r(P_n).

40|$|International audienceA large {{variety of}} {{distributed}} systems, like some classical synchronizers, routers, or schedulers, {{have been shown}} to have a periodic behavior after an initial transient phase (Malka and Rajsbaum, WDAG 1991).

Interestingly, this is the first <b>asymptotically</b> <b>tight</b> <b>bound</b> that is linear in the system size for various classes of systems. Another significant benefit of our approach lies in the straightforwardness of arguments: The proof is based on an easy convolution lemma borrowed from Nachtigall (Math. Method. Oper.

40|$|The exact {{analysis}} of the higher-order statistics of the channel capacity (i. e., higher-order ergodic capacity) often leads to complicated expressions involving advanced special functions. In this paper, we provide a generic framework for the computation of the higher-order statistics of the channel capacity over generalized fading channels. As such, this novel framework for the higher-order statistics results in simple, closed-form expressions which are shown to be asymptotically tight bounds in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime {{of a variety of}} fading environment. In addition, it reveals the existence of differences (i. e., constant capacity gaps in log-domain) among different fading environments. By <b>asymptotically</b> <b>tight</b> <b>bound</b> we mean that the high SNR limit of the difference between the actual higher-order statistics of the channel capacity and its asymptotic bound (i. e., lower bound) tends to zero.

A rainbow coloring of H is achromatic if each k-set of colors appears {{on at least}} one edge. The harmonious number (resp. achromatic number) number of H, denoted by h(H) (resp. ψ(H)) is the minimum (resp. maximum) possible number of colors in a harmonious (resp. achromatic) coloring of H. A class H of hypergraphs is fragmentable if for every H∈H, H can be fragmented to components of a bounded size by removing a "small" fraction of vertices. We show that for every fragmentable class H of bounded degree hypergraphs, for every ϵ> 0 and for every hypergraph H∈H with m≥ m_ 0 (H,ϵ) edges we have h(H) ≤ (1 +ϵ) √(k!m) and ψ(H) ≥ (1 -ϵ) √(k!m).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{deterministic}} (1 +sqrt(5)) / 2 -approximation algorithm for the s-t path TSP for an arbitrary metric. Given a symmetric metric cost on n vertices including two prespecified endpoints, {{the problem is}} to find a shortest Hamiltonian path between the two endpoints; Hoogeveen showed that the natural variant of Christofides' algorithm is a 5 / 3 -approximation algorithm for this problem, and this <b>asymptotically</b> <b>tight</b> <b>bound</b> in fact has been the best approximation ratio known until now. We modify this algorithm so that it chooses the initial spanning tree based on an optimal solution to the Held-Karp relaxation rather than a minimum spanning tree; we prove this simple but crucial modification leads to an improved approximation ratio, surpassing the 20 -year-old barrier set by the natural Christofides' algorithm variant. Our algorithm also proves an upper bound of (1 +sqrt(5)) / 2 on the integrality gap of the path-variant Held-Karp relaxation. The techniques devised in this paper can be applied to other optimization problems as well: these applications include improved approximation algorithms and improved LP integrality gap upper bounds for the prize-collecting s-t path problem and the unit-weight graphical metric s-t path TSP.

40|$|AbstractA graph G {{is said to}} have {{bandwidth}} at most b, {{if there}} exists a labeling of the vertices by 1, 2,…,n, so that |i−j|⩽b whenever {i,j} is an edge of G. Recently, Böttcher, Schacht, and Taraz verified a conjecture of Bollobás and Komlós which says that for every positive r, Δ, γ, there exists β such that if H is an n-vertex r-chromatic graph with maximum degree at most Δ which has bandwidth at most βn, then any graph G on n vertices with minimum degree at least (1 − 1 /r+γ) n contains a copy of H for large enough n. In this paper, we extend this theorem to dense random graphs. For bipartite H, this answers an open question of Böttcher, Kohayakawa, and Taraz. It appears that for non-bipartite H the direct extension is not possible, and one needs in addition that some vertices of H have independent neighborhoods.
