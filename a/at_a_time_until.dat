5|$|Citizens were {{organized}} {{on the basis}} of centuries and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had geimperium powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census. It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.|$|E
25|$|The town's Parish Church {{was used}} as the first school house. Until 1893, Lanark Grammar was a fee-paying school and until 1884 it was for boys only. From its {{beginnings}} in the Parish Church, the school would usually have only two teachers <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> 1884. The only recorded exception to this was in the 1770s when Robert Thomson is reported to have a second assistant.|$|E

Minasola fed {{the police}} band members one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> April when Giuliano {{had no more}} active operatives. Minasola was then able to persuade Aspanu Pisciotta to betray his closest friend—Pisciotta was an easy target, having long doubted Verdiani's plot to get himself and Giuliano out of the country.|$|E

25|$|A* is an {{informed}} search algorithm, or a best-first search, {{meaning that it}} solves problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. It is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific node of a graph, it constructs a tree of paths starting from that node, expanding paths one step <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> one of its paths ends at the predetermined goal node.|$|E
25|$|Life for Carson as a {{mountain}} {{man was not}} easy. After collecting beavers from traps, he had to hold onto them for months <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, held in remote areas of the West like {{the banks of the}} Green River in Wyoming. With the money received for the pelts, necessities of an independent life including fish hooks, flour and tobacco were procured. As there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself. Conflict with particular Indians sometimes occurred. Carson's primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time. This suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by Indians.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 Gaud retired at age 82 and his {{equity in}} the school was {{purchased}} by Berkeley Grimball for $125.00. Grimball began to build his school, a grade <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> he had about 180 students. The building on East Bay Street became {{too small for the}} growing school. In 1961 Grimball bought the Rutledge mansion on Broad Street, where the students had classes until 1964. Grimball continued Gaud's high academic standards, at first teaching many of the subjects himself. As the school grew, he added teachers such as Maurice McLaughlin, who taught Latin and Spanish, and Admiral Florence, who taught math. Grimball was a particularly fine teacher of literature and history. The school lacked athletic facilities, but Grimball at first used the East Bay Street playground and later took boys out to practice on his tennis courts on James Island; soccer was also added to the activities.|$|E

50|$|Charles Quander is {{the father}} of Nancy Quander, and worked on Hayfield Plantation; a slave {{plantation}} in present-day Fairfax County (the land of which is now Hayfield Secondary School). Once he was freed (probably after the Civil War), he bought two acres of land <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> up <b>until</b> his holdings amounted to 88 acres. When he died, his land around what became Quander Road was divided up among his children and then subsequently among their heirs.|$|R
50|$|In 1929, {{the state}} decided {{to double the}} size of the penitentiary because {{overcrowding}} was a problem. The 5 x 7 ft cells were too small to hold three prisoners <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> but <b>until</b> the expansion there was no other option. Two prisoners would sleep in the bunks, with the third sleeping on a mattress on the floor. The state used prison labor again and completed this phase of construction in 1959. The construction had been delayed by a steel shortage during World War II.|$|R
25|$|In some competitions, {{the game}} cannot {{end in a}} draw, so away goals, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark are the three methods for {{determining}} the winner after a match has been drawn. Away goals mean that if the team's score is level after playing one home and one away game, the goals scored in the away match count as double. Extra time consists of two periods of five minutes. If no winner is produced after these methods, 3 kicks from the penalty mark are taken, and the team that has scored the most wins. If it is not decided after 3 kicks from the penalty mark, it continues {{to go on with}} one extra kick from the penalty mark to each team <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> one of them has scored more goals than the other. Unlike extra time, the goals scored in a shoot-out do not count towards the goals scored throughout the match.|$|E
500|$|Direct {{activation}} of an AAC system is generally {{the first choice}} of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier. [...] Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or [...] "scanning". [...] In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection technique such as a switch, vocalization or gesture. Several different patterns for switch access scanning are available: in [...] "circular scanning", the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In [...] "linear scanning", items are organized in rows and are scanned one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> a choice is made. Although more demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in [...] "group-item scanning", items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> a message is selected.|$|E
500|$|The {{attack was}} renewed around 11 am on 9 May, {{and over the}} next seven hours, Hopton's army {{advanced}} slowly through the town. His forces pushed the Parliamentarian troops back one building <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> they were left with only a small area of land {{in the middle of the}} town. Within the perimeter was the castle, an entrenchment in the market square, St Mary Magdalene Church and an earthen defence known as [...] "Maiden's fort". By this time, a combination of artillery and arson attacks had set most of the east side of town on fire. An attempt by three people—two men and a woman—to set fires inside the remaining defences was quashed, and the culprits lynched.|$|E

Often after dark, one other figure walked alone before the Doctor's house. He rarely joined them on the Saturdays now. He could not bear it. He would rather come unrecognised, and look up at the windows where his son was qualifying for a man; and wait, and watch, and plan, and hope.|$|R

500|$|In {{his spare}} time during and between holding {{political}} appointments and serving in elected offices, Jones regularly embarked upon [...] "pleasure trips" [...] to various American cities including Baltimore and Richmond. Another known pastime of Jones's was gaming. According to Maxwell and Swisher in their History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), Jones had been gambling {{over the course of}} several days while in Richmond until a final game left him with only one shilling remaining in his pocketbook. Jones was wearing a coat fastened with twelve gold buttons each valued at five dollars, and undeterred after losing his last shilling, he began staking one gold button <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> he was left with one. Without hesitation, Jones removed his final button and remarked: [...] "Here goes the last button on Gabe's coat." [...] Maxwell and Swisher state that Jones's remark [...] "became a proverb in Hampshire County" [...] and was used when someone had been driven to extremes and utilized what little resources were left at their disposal.|$|E
500|$|Doom 3 was {{released}} with a four-player multiplayer element, featuring four game modes. However, the game's community created a modification to boost this to eight or sixteen players. [...] The Resurrection of Evil expansion would later officially increase the player limit to eight. [...] The four game modes are all deathmatches. [...] The standard deathmatch game mode involves each player moving around a level, collecting weaponry and killing the other players, with the {{player with the}} highest kills when the time runs out winning. [...] A team variation of this involves the same principle. [...] The third game mode is [...] "last man standing", in which each player has {{a limited amount of}} respawns, with players losing a life when they are killed. [...] Eventually, all but one player will be eliminated from the game, leaving the survivor as the winner. [...] The final game mode is [...] "tournament", in which two players fight each other while the other players watch as spectators. [...] The victor of the battle remains in the arena, facing each other player one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> the winner of previous rounds is defeated. [...] The loser then moves to the spectators and the new winner remains to fight the next player. The Xbox version of Doom 3 also incorporates an additional two-player co-operative mode for the main single-player game.|$|E

It must, however, be tried, and they set to work, laboriously carrying her up the steep slopes, a few yards <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> they reached a gully choked with brush, where progress became almost impossible. They were forced to drag her through thick bushes, stopping every two or three minutes for breath, while on the steeper pitches they buried knees and toes in the gravel as they passed her from hand to hand. The light was fading when they reached the crest, exhausted, and it cost Andrew a determined effort to go back some distance with Carnally for the provisions. Indeed, it was only hunger forced him to do so.|$|E
