5|$|In {{the sulfur}} cycle, archaea that grow by {{oxidizing}} sulfur compounds release this element from rocks, making it available to other organisms.

5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs.

5|$|The chief Roman {{contributions}} to architecture were the arch, vault and the dome.

Roman roads are considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade.

Even {{after the collapse of the}} central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> factors.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{employment}} in the park began to decline as companies closed their premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. Ellesmere Port and Runcorn at {{the western end of}} the Manchester Ship Canal were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment had fallen to 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s. In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (TRAFIC), membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by improving their own areas through landscaping <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> improvements. The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester Ship Canal during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service. By 1976, the workforce had fallen to 15,000, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.|$|E

5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler radar station in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall {{over the course of}} a day led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the study included the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions remained favorable.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{identified}} {{early on}} that pathfinding—the ability of the variable-sized characters to navigate through the environment—would be a problem. Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate {{an environment in which}} level designers are free to add stairs, ramps, and other 3D objects. They came up with a temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development. By the time they properly addressed the problem, many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement. They could identify walkable tiles but not walls, cliffs, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> hazards. Ideal solutions, such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have taken too much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels, so the programmers spent several weeks making small, iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave less obvious ones intact.|$|E
5|$|The nascent system tracked {{generally}} west-northwestward {{around a}} subtropical ridge to its north. Favorable outflow {{to the south}} counteracted moderate wind shear, though a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast disrupted the thunderstorm structure. Late on August14, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming it Goni. The storm slowly intensified and organized as it approached the Marianas Islands on August15. With diminished wind shear, rainbands were able to wrap tightly around the center. When Goni passed just north of Rota on August15, radar on Guam indicated a developing eyewall in the storm's core. At 18:00UTC on August15, the JMA upgraded Goni to a severe tropical storm, and further to typhoon status by the next day. The previously disruptive trough to the north soon aided the storm's intensification by enhancing its outflow, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions remained favorable. Consequently, Goni began a period of rapid deepening on August16. By early on August17, Goni reached an initial peak intensity; the JMA estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph), and the JTWC assessed higher 1-minute winds of 215km/h (130mph), derived from satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique. At the time, the typhoon had a small eye just 9km (6mi) in diameter.|$|E
