40|$|We {{studied the}} structure, morphology, and growth {{mechanism}} of self- organized La(0. 35) Pr(0. 275) Ca(0. 375) MnO(3) manganite nanorods grown on NdGaO(3) substrates by pulsed- laser deposition. A two- layered structure was revealed: the first layer, about 120 nm thick, was formed via layer- by- layer two- dimensional (2 D) growth; the second layer {{consisted of a}} three- dimensional assembly of nanorods lying perpendicular to the 2 D layer. The nanorods, averaging 50 nm across and 180 nm long, exhibited six crystallographic orientational domains, but only two predominated, both with their b axis lying parallel to that of substrate (parallel to the film normal) and with an in- plane a- and c- <b>axis</b> <b>interchange</b> to minimize local lattice mismatch. We consider that the formation of such self- assembled nanorods {{is related to the}} Stranski - Krastanov growth mode and discuss the associated energy terms of such growth based on density functional theory calculations.

40|$|Through brittle {{microstructure}} population analysis. {{the stress}} regime sequence in Alcaine's area during alpine tectogenesis bas been inferred. Dynamic study of fault populations {{allows us to}} distinguish stress tensors; chronological relationships of stylolitic joints and superposed striation within fault planes lead to establish its temporal sequence: (1) compression 100 - 110; (2) compression between N and ENE; (3) compression 140 - 150; (4) distension with σ 3 axis 050 - 070. The three compressive stages have worked in a wrench regime (vertical σ 2 ); the transition between the third and distensive stages {{has been done by}} a σ 1 -σ 2 <b>axis</b> <b>interchange,</b> without a break in tectonic activity. La secuencia de estados de esfuerzo durante la tectogénesis alpina en el área de Alcaine es interpretada a partir del análisis de poblaciones de microestructuras frágiles. El estudio dinámico de poblaciones de fallas permite caracterizar bien los tensores de esfuerzos; las relaciones cronológicas entre juntas estilolíticas y entre diferentes estriaciones dentro de un mismo plano de falla conducen a establecer la secuencia temporal de los mismos: (1) compresión 100 - 110; (2) compresión entre N y ENE; (3) compresión 140 - 150; (4) distensión con σ 3 050 - 070. Las tres etapas compresivas operan en régimen de décrochement (σ 2 vertical); el tránsito entre la tercera de ellas y la etapa distensiva se produce por simple intercambio de los ejes σ 1 a y σ 2 sin ruptura brusca en la actividad tectónica...|$|E
5000|$|John Pople first {{introduced}} the Pople Diagram during the Symposium on Atomic and Molecular Quantum Theory held on Sanibel Island, Florida, in January 1965. He {{called it a}} [...] "hyperbola of quantum chemistry", which illustrates the inverse relationship between the sophistication of a calculational method {{and the number of}} electrons in a molecule that can be studied by that method. [...] Alternative (reverse) arrangement of the vertical <b>axis</b> or <b>interchange</b> of the two axes are also possible.|$|R
40|$|XML {{is quickly}} {{becoming}} {{the industry standard}} data exchange format for business applications. Since most of the data is stored in relational tables, {{there must be a}} way to transform relational data into XML. For a XML document to be readable for every business associate relational database, a mapping must be provided to specify how a XML document fits a specific database model. This paper proposes <b>AXIS</b> (Automatic XML <b>Interchange</b> System), which is an architecture implemented in Java that allows the creation of such mapping and, afterwards, the conversion of relational data to XML and back to relational data. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{classify}} extended Poincaré Lie super algebras and Lie algebras of any signature (p,q), that is Lie super algebras and Z_ 2 -graded Lie algebras g = g_ 0 + g_ 1, where g_ 0 = so(V) + V is the (generalized) Poincaré Lie algebra of the pseudo Euclidean {{vector space}} V = R^p,q of signature (p,q) and g_ 1 = S is the spinor so(V) -module extended to a g_ 0 -module with kernel V. The remaining super commutators g_ 1,g_ 1 (respectively, commutators [g_ 1, g_ 1]) {{are defined by}} an so(V) -equivariant linear mapping vee^ 2 g_ 1 -> V (respectively, wedge^ 2 g_ 1 -> V). Denote by P^+(n,s) (respectively, P^-(n,s)) the vector space of all such Lie super algebras (respectively, Lie algebras), where n = p + q = dim V and s = p - q is the signature. The description of P^+-(n,s) reduces {{to the construction of}} all so(V) -invariant bilinear forms on S and to the calculation of three Z_ 2 -valued invariants for some of them. This calculation is based on a simple explicit model of an irreducible Clifford module S for the Clifford algebra Cl_p,q of arbitrary signature (p,q). As a result of the classification, we obtain the numbers L^+-(n,s) = P^+-(n,s) of independent Lie super algebras and algebras, which take values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6. Due to Bott periodicity, L^+-(n,s) may be considered as periodic functions with period 8 in each argument. They are invariant under the group Gamma generated by the four reflections with respect to the axes n=- 2, n= 2, s- 1 = - 2 and s- 1 = 2. Moreover, the reflection (n,s) -> (-n,s) with respect to the <b>axis</b> s= 0 <b>interchanges</b> L^+ and L^- : L^+(-n,s) = L^-(n,s) ...|$|R
