2500|$|The Tempest line, {{including}} the GTO, was restyled for the 1965 model year, adding [...] {{to the overall}} length while retaining the same wheelbase and interior dimensions. It had Pontiac's characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight increased about [...] The brake lining area increased nearly 15%. Heavy-duty shocks were standard, as was a stronger front <b>antisway</b> <b>bar.</b> The dashboard design was changed, and an optional rally gauge cluster ($86.08) added a more legible tachometer and oil pressure gauge. An additional option was a breakerless transistor ignition.|$|E
50|$|Front suspension: {{upper and}} lower {{transverse}} leaf springs, curved downward to raise roll centre. Generous ground clearance and travel. No <b>antisway</b> <b>bar,</b> {{which resulted in the}} lifting of one rear wheel in hard cornering. Kingpins integral with the steering knuckles, turning in sockets pivoted on the leaf spring eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Rear suspension: Torsion bars {{acting on}} {{trailing}} link-arms and joined and pivoted (between torsion bar ends) diagonal semi-trailing arms, described as [...] "semi-independent"; This gave similar geometry but less unsprung weight than a solid (tube) axle. The axle a continuous tube between rear wheel spindles, V-shaped and fastened {{in the center}} by a rubber bushing mounted on the subframe cross member. The torsion bars in sets of three, one set for {{each side of the}} rear axle. No <b>antisway</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, the Valiant was {{available}} as a Code A38 police package car and offered in three basic engine sizes: E24 (California emission standards) and E25 (Federal) [...] single-barrel Slant-6; E44 , twin-barrel V-8; E58 , four-barrel V-8 with single (California) or dual (Federal) exhaust. It was the E58 that Chrysler recommended for police service {{as it was the}} only one with [...] "added endurance features to improve durability." [...] The E58 produced 175 net hp in California trim and 220 net hp in Federal form. The E58 dual exhaust engine (sans catalytic converters) made for a very fast Valiant squad car. So equipped, this compact Chrysler cop car tripped the quarter-mile lights in 16.4 seconds with trap speeds of [...] and could catch nearly all the so-called [...] "performance cars" [...] of the day. The Seattle Police Department using the Valiant A38 reported a 46 percent drop in the preventable accident rate among police officers, and according to a Motor Trend police survey, the A38 Valiant had much better evasive capabilities, better overall visibility, and was generally easier to drive than the full-size squad cars. A special handling package applied to the A38 Valiant included front and rear <b>antisway</b> <b>bars.</b> Unfortunately, the Valiant wasn't physically durable enough; it lacked additional frame welds and rear cross-member reinforcements standard on all other Mopar A38 packages. More importantly, the front K-frame of the Valiant was prone to failure under severe police use.|$|R
