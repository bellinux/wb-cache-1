5|$|The Germans {{advanced}} {{north and}} west from Kladanj towards a cordon established by ten Croatian Home Guard battalions supported by their own artillery. The Germans believed they had thoroughly sealed off the area, <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> Croatian cordon every night, {{but the majority of}} Partisans were able to evade the cordon and escape by breaking up into small groups and infiltrating through the cordon through seemingly impassable terrain. The Germans also believed that some Partisans merely withdrew into the mountains, concealing their numbers by walking in each other's snowprints, in order to return to the valleys when the Axis forces left. The operation concluded on 4 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{joined the}} revolt of Edward's wife Isabella of France and her lover Mortimer in 1326, {{pursuing}} and capturing Edward at Neath in South Wales. Following Edward's deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at Berkeley Castle, Thomas's conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained {{possession of the}} Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas's treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King Edward III of England before his coronation. Mortimer lost support over the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton that formalised Scotland's independence, and his developing power in the Welsh Marches provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of Earl of March in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry's further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for {{the last fifteen years}} of his life.|$|E

The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two.

25|$|The {{government}} hastily approved several special {{laws for}} {{use during the}} Stammheim trial.

The authorities invaded <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> lawyers' offices for possible incriminating material. Minister of Justice Hans-Jochen Vogel stated proudly that no other Western state had such an extensive regulation to exclude defense attorneys from the trial. Klaus Croissant, Hans-Christian Ströbele, Kurt Groenewold, who had been working preparing for the trial for three years were expelled the second day of the trial. On 23 June (1975), Croissant, Ströbele (who had already been expelled) and Mary Becker were arrested, and in the meantime police invaded several defense attorneys' offices and homes, seizing several documents and files. Ströbele and Croissant were remanded and held for 4 weeks and 8 weeks accordingly.

With the war in Europe become bogged down in trench warfare, Chetwode was lucky to be transferred to the Palestine where he was given command of the Desert Mounted Corps and promoted to temporary lieutenant general with effect from 22 November 1916. He led the corps at Rafa in January 1917 and at the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917. When Edmund Allenby took command of the Allied forces in Palestine in June 1917, Chetwode was promoted to command of XX Corps. He led his corps to military success at the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917 and at the Battle of Jerusalem in November 1917.

Then the train rises up into the second inversion, a zero-g roll, where riders experience the feeling of weightlessness. It then makes a 180-degree right-handed stall turn into the third inversion, a vertical loop. After a left stall turn the train enters the second corkscrew. The train then passes through an underground tunnel, and through one more 180-degree turn, before being stopped by the brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

He criticized Islam in his book L’islam et la psychologie du musulman. Servier argued that [...] "Islam is Christianity adapted to Arab mentality," [...] and that it is [...] "incapable of adapting itself to civilization." [...] Similarly, he argued that Islamic law [...] "is only the Roman Code revised and corrected by Arabs," [...] Islamic science [...] "nothing but Greek science interpreted by the Arab brain," [...] and Islamic architecture [...] "a distorted imitation of the Byzantine style."

2500|$|The rearguard of Hodgson's {{column was}} closely {{followed}} by German and Ottoman units firing {{on the rear}} of the retreating column. When they reached the Jordan Valley, the right rear of Chaytor's force was threatened by enemy units which pressed in strongly on the piquets in the hills which were soon driven in, while German aircraft continued to machine gun the column. Five Taubes came over and for half an hour bombed the large formations and about midday German and Ottoman forces closed in on the right as our troops withdrew under heavy fire. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was being strongly pushed as it fell back following orders to retire. During this crucial part of the retirement, the 4th Light Horse Brigade's right had become uncovered but when the formations got to the lower slopes of the hills the dismounted Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment reinforced the 4th Light Horse Brigade's right. A squadron of Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) with the Berkshire, Leicester Batteries and the remaining three guns of [...] "B" [...] Battery H. A. C. came into action against this German and Ottoman force advancing down the Umm esh Shert track.

As it was seen on video, sparks were seen emanating from Montoya's car right before its hard collision with the jet dryer trailer and left driver's side of the truck. Montoya was treated at the infield care center and released. Montoya's report over the radio after the incident was [...] "I left the pits and felt a really weird vibration and I came back in <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> rear end {{and said it was}} okay and I got into the backstraight and we were are going fourth gear but wasn't going that fast. Every time I got on the gas I could feel the rear squeezing. When I was telling the spotter to have a look how the rear was moving the car just turned right." [...] The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab, Duane Barnes, was taken to a local hospital for observation and was resting comfortably. He was an employee at Michigan International Speedway, a sister track of Daytona. The tracks often share jet dryer equipment on race weekends to help in case of rain such as the case on Sunday, the original scheduled start time of the race. The entire incident took about two hours to clean up before the last 40 (later extended to 42 due to a Green-white-checkered finish) laps were able to be completed.|$|E
2500|$|In the two-light {{window on}} the north side of the chancel, the left light {{features}} the Raising of Lazarus story (John 11:1–44). The text says [...] "Lazarus come forth" [...] (John 11.43) and [...] "Jesus wept" [...] (John 11.35). The second light illustrates the story of the Raising of the son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7:11–17) This window was dedicated to William Strother by his mother. The Strothers were major landowners in the village area, living locally at Low Hall, Kennel Hall Farm and Westfield. The east window was made by Cox & Son. The design of the central two lights is based on John 20:24–29, the story of Doubting Thomas. In this image, Thomas (shown kneeling at bottom of second light from left) has finally seen the Resurrection <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> wounds, and he now believes in it. The top part of the window consists of three small rose lights, containing symbols. The left symbol is the Paschal Lamb, a heraldic symbol in which the Lamb of God carries the cross of St. George. The right-hand rose shows a pelican vulning, a heraldic symbol (a crest in this case) of a self-sacrificing pelican feeding her young with the blood from her breast, symbolising the Passion. This medieval symbol was superseded by the Lamb and Flag. The image in the uppermost rose shows the intertwined Alpha and Omega. Thomas Strother, who paid for this window, dedicated it to his wife or mother, and died while the church was in process of construction. The two-light {{window on the}} north side of the chancel is dedicated to Thomas Strother (1806–1879) by his widow. The left-hand light represents St Peter, carrying the Keys of Heaven, with his book at his feet, symbolising the Scriptures. The angel below him carries the words, [...] "Rejoice in the lord alway" [...] (Paul's Epistle to the Philippians 4:4). The right hand light shows Paul the Apostle carrying a sword symbolising his martyrdom, with the Scriptures in the form of a book at his feet. The angel below him has the words [...] "The just shall live by faith" [...] (Paul's Epistle to the Romans 1:17).|$|E
