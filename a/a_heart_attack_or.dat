5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} have already had <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, taking aspirin daily for two years {{prevented}} 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem (heart attack, stroke, or death), but also caused non-fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people.|$|E
5|$|Agent Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly), {{a friend}} of Broyles (Lance Reddick), is on a group mission in Weymouth, Massachusetts but fails to find {{evidence}} of wrongdoing in a truck they targeted. Loeb and Broyles are in a meeting afterwards when Loeb collapses, seemingly of <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> seizure. He is rushed to the hospital, where the medical staff cut open his chest, only to find his heart is being constricted by a synthetic rhizocephalan like parasite. The Fringe division of Olivia, Walter, and Peter are briefed by Broyles, who then shows them the hospitalized Loeb.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>or</b> the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
25|$|In summary, the APPROVe study {{suggested}} that long-term use of rofecoxib resulted in {{nearly twice the}} risk of suffering <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke compared to patients receiving a placebo.|$|E
25|$|According to United States {{data for}} 2004, in about 66% {{of men and}} 47% of women, the first symptom of {{atherosclerotic}} cardiovascular disease is <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> sudden cardiac death (death within one hour of onset of the symptom).|$|E

25|$|After {{retiring}} as Comptroller General, McCarl practiced law in Washington, D.C. He suffered either <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> {{a stroke}} {{at his desk}} in his law office on August 2, 1940, and died immediately. His wife, Ethel, survived him. The couple had no children.|$|E
25|$|Smoking also {{increases}} {{the chance of}} heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease. Several ingredients of tobacco lead to the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing {{the likelihood of a}} blockage, and thus <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke. According to a study by an international team of researchers, people under 40 are five {{times more likely to have}} a heart attack if they smoke.|$|E
25|$|Floyd Jarrett, {{whose home}} {{was about a}} mile from the Farm, was arrested by police on 5 October 1985, having given false details when stopped with an {{allegedly}} false tax disc. While he was in custody, four officers attended his home to conduct a search. During the search, his mother Cynthia Jarrett collapsed and died. It has never been satisfactorily concluded how and why Cynthia Jarrett died, and whether it was <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> due to police actions.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} 79 million Americans have prediabetes. Individuals with prediabetes have {{blood glucose}} levels that {{are higher than}} normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Without intervention, most people with prediabetes will develop diabetes within ten years. In addition, {{studies have shown that}} these individuals are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke. Individuals with prediabetes are also likely to have additional cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause. However, since the head-end crew of the freight train did not survive, {{it was not clear}} why they had erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk for <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{failed to}} take {{advantage}} of the chaos of the Crusaders army. As it marched across the Anatolian peninsula, it encountered frequent Turkish raids, despite official gestures of friendship from the Sultanate of Rûm under Kilij Arslan II. Not bearing to stand by and do nothing, Frederick sacked Iconium, capital of the Sultanate, before moving on. Isaac did not seize the initiative and Kilij Arslan II returned later to reclaim his fallen capital. Frederick's army would later slowly but surely disband after the Holy Roman Emperor was found dead (presumed to have either drowned in a river, suffered <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> perhaps both). More looting and damage would be done by these weary soldiers as they retreated back to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Nash was {{released}} from the hospital following Bound for Glory. Medical personnel stated he had what appeared to be <b>a</b> minor <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> {{was on the verge of}} having one when he called 9-1-1. The original plan was to have Nash and Raven start a rivalry after Bound for Glory, but due to the circumstances this was changed.|$|R
50|$|On {{scans of}} the brain, {{a person with}} {{vascular}} dementia may show evidence of multiple strokes of different sizes in various locations.

You feel an intense fear when you think of dying, or you may think of it more often than normal, or can't get it out of your mind." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{few months}} after Mitchell's trial, Galle and Mitchell split a $750,000 {{settlement}} in the civil suit. The nurses, who both live in Jal, New Mexico, were unable to find employment in nursing after being terminated from WCMH. After signing the settlement, Wiley reinforced his support of Arafiles, saying, [...] "He’s {{done a lot of}} good in this county. If you have <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> anything of that nature in the emergency room, he is definitely the doctor that you {{want to take care of}} you." ...|$|E
500|$|On 6 February 1957, the Soviet {{government}} {{released a}} document dated 17 July 1947, which stated [...] "I {{report that the}} prisoner Wallenberg who is well-known to you, died suddenly in his cell this night, probably {{as a result of}} <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> heart failure. Pursuant to the instructions given by you that I personally have Wallenberg under my care, I request approval to make an autopsy with a view to establishing cause of death.... I have personally notified the minister and it has been ordered that the body be cremated without autopsy." [...] The document was signed by Smoltsov, then the head of the Lubyanka prison infirmary, and addressed to Viktor Abakumov, the Soviet minister of state security. In 1989, Wallenberg's personal belongings were returned to his family, including his passport and cigarette case. Soviet officials said they found the materials when they were upgrading the shelves in a store room.|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} his father died of <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, Favre decided {{to play in a}} December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns {{in the first half and}} 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E

5000|$|The study defined dog attacks as [...] "a human death {{caused by}} trauma from a dog bite". Excluded {{from the study}} were deaths by disease caused by dog bites, {{strangulation}} on a scarf or leash pulled by <b>a</b> dog, <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> traffic accident, and falling injury or fire ant bites from being pushed down by a dog. The study also excluded four deaths by trauma from dog bites by police dogs or guard dogs employed by the government.|$|R
50|$|She {{appeared}} in over 70 films, including such classics as Casablanca, San Francisco, and To Have And Have Not, until about 1947, after which her film career began to decline. Her final role was in George Cukor's Les Girls, starring Gene Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor, {{in which she}} played the wardrobe woman. With the advent of television, she {{appeared in}} several series during the 1950s, working right up to her death, which was caused by <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> during <b>or</b> following <b>a</b> car accident in Los Angeles.|$|R
2500|$|A {{subsequent}} medical investigation {{determined that}} Traficant {{had not had}} <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> seizure before the accident, and was not {{under the influence of}} drugs or alcohol. [...] In addition, he had not sustained any crushing injuries in the accident. [...] The forensic pathologist who conducted the examination attributed Traficant's death to positional asphyxiation, stating that he had been unable to breathe because of the weight of the tractor, under which he had been trapped after the accident.|$|E
2500|$|On February 29, 1968, Don Demeter officially {{announced}} his retirement from Major League Baseball. He reported for spring training in Tucson, Arizona and successfully passed a complete physical examination, but still decided to end his career due to potential health concerns about his heart from September. The doctor said Demeter didn't have <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> suffer damages to his heart, but Demeter ended by saying, [...] "However, the doctor added that there was the possibility that I'd be running down the line some day and have an attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 27, 1996, Colby set {{out from}} his weekend home in Rock Point, Maryland on a solo canoe trip. His canoe was found the {{following}} day on a sandbar in the Wicomico River, {{a tributary of the}} Potomac, approximately a quarter mile from his home. On May 6, Colby's body was found in a marshy riverbank lying facedown not far from where his canoe was found. After an autopsy, Maryland's Chief Medical Examiner John E. Smialek ruled his death to be accidental. Smialek's report noted that Colby was predisposed to having <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke due to [...] "severe calcified atherosclerosis" [...] and that Colby likely [...] "suffered a complication of this atherosclerosis which precipitated him into the cold water in a debilitated state and he succumbed to the effects of hypothermia and drowned".|$|E
50|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} breeding season, {{most of the}} prey are smallish birds weighing 10 - 40 g. Almost any such species will be taken, with local preferences for whatever is most abundant—be it larks (Alaudidae), pipits (Anthus) or house sparrows (Passer domesticus)—and inexperienced s always a favorite. Smaller birds will generally avoid a hunting merlin if possible. In the Cayman Islands (where it only occurs in winter), bananaquits were noted to die of <b>an</b> apparent <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, without being physically harmed, when a merlin went at them and they could not escape.|$|R
5000|$|Only {{six weeks}} after friend Kathleen Hanna’s {{diagnosis}} of late stage Lyme disease, Anderson {{ended up in the}} hospital with signs of <b>a</b> possible <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, receiving <b>an</b> official diagnosis of late stage Lyme a month later. At first, doctors told Anderson that {{there was nothing wrong with}} her, despite her getting more ill with every passing day. [...] Not wanting to complicate the story of The Punk Singer or detract the focus from Hannah’s illness, Anderson was reluctant to admit publicly during the filming that she had been diagnosed as well.|$|R
50|$|Reviews {{support a}} {{short-term}} effect of lowering blood pressure by consuming cocoa products, {{but there is}} no evidence of long-term cardiovascular health benefit. While daily consumption of cocoa flavanols (minimum dose of 200 mg) appears to benefit platelet and vascular function, there is no good evidence to support <b>an</b> effect on <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes.|$|R
