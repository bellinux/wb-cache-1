However, we cannot help to have some doubt as to the precise location of this Synod. Mart Moura's church, the generally assumed location for that synod celebration, is well known and its patronal saint's day is still celebrated every year with the fervent participation of the faithful from our village Kfarsghab, on September 24. <b>Also,</b> <b>we</b> think that there lies our village of origin, before unknown reasons to the local memory made us go down.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. <b>Also,</b> <b>we</b> know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have learned much about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E

25|$|The biggest star of 1990s gospel was Rebecca Malope, whose 1995 album Shwele Baba was {{extremely}} popular. Malope continues to record, {{in addition to}} performers such as Lusanda Spiritual Group, Barorisi Ba Morena, Amadodana Ase Wesile, Vuyo Mokoena and International Pentacoastal Church Choir, Rayreed Soul Beat, Lundi, Joyous Celebration, and the upcoming Scent From Above who have performed in Botswana occasionally. In 2000s Vuyo Mooena {{has emerged as the}} best selling Gospel artist. His albums have been audited to be in Top 5 selling in the country. In His album he sang in all South African languages like Venda, Shangaan, Sotho, Zulu and Xhosa. The industry has also been joined by the likes of Hlengiwe Mhlaba(whose Aphendule is popular) and Solly Moholo. <b>Also</b> <b>we</b> see the new singers like Oleseng Shuping become popular and he won the king of gospel award.|$|E
25|$|If any brother, being {{priest or}} deacon or {{of any other}} {{clerical}} order, shall commit any offense, and this shall come to {{the knowledge of the}} Prior or the Master, the brethren whom the Prior shall select for the court shall judge with righteous judgment and shall impose a penance of seven days or even of forty according to the gravity of the fault, just {{as in the case of}} other brethren who are not in holy orders. For, seeing that we are all of one religion and all, both clergy and laymen, make the same profession, it seems unfitting that there should be any distinction between brethren within the Hospital. Wherefore it is ordered that, as we live under one rule, so <b>also</b> <b>we</b> ought to be subject to the same judges of the rule.|$|E

But after several tense and grueling weeks of negotiations, he finally relented and the missiles and the bombers were removed in December of that year.|$|E
500|$|The studio New Line Cinema {{released}} Surf Ninjas {{two weeks}} earlier than its commercial release date in Evansville, Indiana and Lubbock, Texas {{as part of a}} test of regional markets. The early release marked {{the first time that a}} major film was released in Evansville before its national opening without any local ties. The president of theatrical marketing at New Line, Chris Pula, selected Evansville for its family-oriented audiences. Pula explained: [...] "Evansville is traditionally a strong family market. <b>Also,</b> <b>we</b> have a strong relationship with the exhibitors in that area". The president said that the studio was testing the film in a larger market than usual due to its uncertainty about the film's reception, and that the studio would measure its marketing success with ticket receipts.|$|E

According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E
