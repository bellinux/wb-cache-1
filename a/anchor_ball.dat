5000|$|The buoys were {{of square}} or {{hexagonal}} construction {{and had a}} floor space of about 43 square feet with an 8-foot cabin rising above the float. On the upper deck of this cabin, there was an oval turret 6 feet high with a signal mast carrying a wireless antenna. Tube railings to which the distressed flyers could cling ran along the outer circumference below and above the water line. A ladder {{led up to the}} turret, in which there was a door opening into the cabin below.A 320-foot red and yellow striped rope anchored the buoy at a fixed location, but allowed a limited drift, thereby indicating the direction of the current to aircraft in distress. The buoy was painted light yellow above the water line, and red crosses against white oval backgrounds were painted {{on each side of the}} turret.The cabin accommodated four persons comfortably for several days, and in an emergency, the crews of several aircraft could be taken care of. It was electrically lit by storage batteries, but in case of a breakdown kerosene lamps or other lighting devices were provided. There were two double-deck beds and adequate cupboard space for first-aid equipment, dry clothing and shoes, emergency rations, and a water supply. Hot food could be prepared on an alcohol stove. Cognac to relieve chill and cigarettes to quiet the nerves were also provided. Games, stationery, playing cards, etc. afforded diversion until rescue was effected. Depleted supplies were always immediately replaced upon the arrival of the rescue ship. A tubular lifeboat was available for transferring the downed aviators from the buoy to the ship.Signalling was accomplished by hoisting a black <b>anchor</b> <b>ball</b> and a yellow and red striped flag on the mast during the day. At night, red and white lights in the turret indicated that rescued men were on board. A white anchor light on the mast was visible for 3,000 feet or more. SOS signals giving the location of the buoy were automatically sent out by an emergency wireless transmitter. Signal pistols with red and white lights, white-light parachute flares, or a smoke, distress-signalling apparatus completed the signalling equipment. Other equipment included plugs to stop up bullet holes in the walls of the cabin and a pump for the expulsion of seepage.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the case of}} a 60 -year-old male patient with trismus induced by radiotherapy and fabrication of a sectional mandibular complete denture to allow the insertion of the denture into the mouth. A mandibular sectional denture was designed in two pieces with a locking mechanism by using mini <b>anchor</b> and <b>ball</b> abutment housing with cap. Patients who have undergone maxillectomy often have constricted mouth openings, as a result of surgical intervention and radiotherapy, and complain of an inability to insert or remove dentures. A new approach is vital for sectional dentures because existing sectional denture fabrication techniques cannot meet the ongoing needs of trismus patients. The mini <b>anchor</b> system with <b>ball</b> abutment housing has better mechanical retention in acrylic resin and can provide favorable stabilization during masticatory function; thus, additional framework is not required for assisting in stabilization and retention...|$|R
40|$|Current microelectrodes {{designed}} to record chronic neural activity suffer from recording instabilities {{due to the}} modulus mismatch between the electrode materials and the brain. We sought to address this by microfabricating a novel flexible neural probe. Our probe was fabricated from parylene-C with a WTi metal, using contact photolithography and reactive ion etching, with three design features to address this modulus mismatch: a sinusoidal shaft, a rounded tip and a polyimide <b>anchoring</b> <b>ball.</b> The <b>anchor</b> restricts movement of the electrode recording sites and the shaft accommodates the brain motion. We successfully patterned thick metal and parylene-C layers, with a reliable device release process leading to high functional yield. This novel reliably microfabricated probe can record stable neural activity {{for up to two}} years without delamination, surpassing the current state-of-the-art intracortical probes. This challenges recent concerns that have been raised over the long-term reliability of chronic implants when Parylene-C is used as an insulator, for both research and human applications. The microfabrication and design considerations provided in this manuscript may aid in the future development of flexible devices for biomedical applications.

40|$|PURPOSE: The mandibular implant overdenture is {{a popular}} {{treatment}} modality and is well documented in the literature. Follow-up studies with a long observation period are difficult to perform due to the increasing age of patients. The present data summarize a long-term clinical observation of patients with implant overdentures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1997, edentulous patients were consecutively admitted for treatment with an implant overdenture. The dentures were connected to the implants by means of bars or <b>ball</b> <b>anchors.</b> Regular maintenance was provided {{with at least one}} or two scheduled visits per year. Recall attendance and reasons for dropout were analyzed based on the specific history of the patient. Denture maintenance service, relining, repair, and fabrication of new dentures were identified, and complications with the retention devices specified separately. RESULTS: In the time period from 1984 to 2008, 147 patients with a total of 314 implants had completed a follow-up period of > 10 years. One hundred one patients were still available in 2008, while 46 patients were not reexamined for various reasons. Compliance was high, with a regular recall attendance of > 90 %. More than 80 % of dentures remained in continuous service. Although major prosthetic maintenance was rather low in relation to the long observation period, visits to a dental hygienist and dentist resulted in an annual visit rate of 1. 5 and 2. 4, respectively. If new dentures became necessary, these were made in student courses, which increased the treatment time and number of appointments needed. Complications with the retention devices consisted mostly of the mounting of new female retainers, the repair of bars, and the changing of <b>ball</b> <b>anchors.</b> The average number of events and the rate of prosthetic service with <b>ball</b> <b>anchors</b> were significantly higher than those with bars. Twenty-two patients changed from <b>ball</b> <b>anchors</b> to bars; 9 patients switched from a clip bar to a rigid U-shaped bar. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term follow-up study demonstrates that implant overdentures are a favorable solution for edentulous patients with regular maintenance. In spite of specific circumstances in an aging population, it is possible to provide long-term care, resulting in a good prognosis and low risk for this treatment modality. For various reasons the dropout rate can be considerable in elderly patients and prosthetic service must be provided regularly...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} three conventional tree stabilization systems (staking, guying, {{and root}} <b>ball</b> <b>anchoring)</b> on 6. 4 cm (2. 5 in) caliper field-grown, balled and burlapped white ash (Fraxinus americana L. â€˜Autumn Purpleâ€™). At five weeks and at {{seven months after}} planting, performance of the stabilization systems was evaluated under ambient wind conditions as well as wind-simulating pull tests. Nonstabilized ash trees remained upright during both the 5 -week and 7 -month studies despite occasionally substantial wind gusts. From the pull tests, the study found the stabilization systems performed equally well and that even nonstabilized ash trees were tolerant of moderate to heavy wind loads. Stabilization systems differed in the maximum force they endured before component failure. The guying system withstood forces 1. 7 to 2. 5 {{times greater than the}} root <b>ball</b> <b>anchoring</b> and staking systems, respectively. Stabilization system components were very durable during the first growing season and did not substantially impact tree height growth, shoot elongation, root diameter, root length, or root mass seven months after planting. After one growing season, both nonstabilized and previously stabilized trees remained upright until unrealistically large loads were applied. Practical implications for landscape tree management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to propose a strategy to revitalize Muncie's downtown through cultural tourism. This is seen as a critical catalyst to help preserve the historical fabric of the downtown. Muncie's downtown, with its historical and cultural assets, has an opportunity to attract the tourism, convention, and conference business which in turn can support hotels, restaurants, specialty shops, and entertainment establishments. In view of above, this creative project attempts to revitalize downtown through linking and promoting cultural tourism facilities like museums, theaters and festivals, convention and conference centers, and specialty shops. A transport loop connecting the tourist <b>anchors</b> like <b>Ball</b> State University, Minnitrista Cultural Center, and downtown of has been proposed. The tourist routes in Muncie and to East Central Indiana have been identified to enable the visitors to visit tourist destinations easily. Signage, and banners have been proposed along major routes to give proper orientation to visitors and also to enhance the image of Muncie. A strategy has been outlined for the preservation historical buildings through adaptive reuse. All these proposals have been incorporated as an urban design strategy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To assess implant {{survival}} rates and peri-implant bone loss of 2 titanium-zirconium implants supporting maxillary overdentures at 1 year of loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty maxillary edentulous patients (5 women and 15 men) being {{dissatisfied with their}} complete dentures were included. In total, 40 diameter-reduced titanium-zirconium implants {{were placed in the}} anterior maxilla. Local guided bone regeneration (GBR) was allowed if the treatment did not compromise implant stability. Following 3 to 5 months of healing, implant-supported overdentures were inserted on two <b>ball</b> <b>anchors.</b> Implants and overdentures were assessed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after implant insertion and 2, 4, and 12 months after insertion of overdentures (baseline). Standardized radiographs were taken at implant loading and 1 year. Implant {{survival rates}} and bone loss were the primary outcomes. RESULTS Nineteen patients (1 dropout) with 38 implants were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 1. 1 years (range 1. 0 - 1. 7 years). One implant failed resulting in an implant survival rate of 97. 3 %. There was a significant peri-implant bone loss of the implants at 1 year of function (mean, 0. 7 mm, SD = 1. 1 mm; median: 0. 48 mm, IQR = 0. 56 mm). CONCLUSIONS There was a high 1 -year implant survival rate for edentulous patients receiving 2 maxillary implants and <b>ball</b> <b>anchors</b> as overdenture support. However, several implants exhibited an increased amount of bone loss of more than 2 mm. Overdentures supported by 2 maxillary implants should thus be used with caution as minimally invasive treatment for specific patients encountering problems with their upper dentures until more long-term data is available...|$|R
40|$|The new Swiss implant system SPI became {{available}} {{three years ago}} and is used in combination with fixed and removable prosthetic reconstructions. In a pilot study the clinical procedures were evaluated and data of prosthetic complications of maintenance service were collected. 25 patients participated in the study with a total of 79 SPI implants during the time period from 2003 - 2004. 37 implants were located in the maxilla and 42 implants in the mandible. Two implants failed during the healing period, but no loaded implant was lost. Thus, the survival rate was 97. 5 % (77 / 79). 44 implants supported a fixed prosthesis, including nine single crowns and 33 implants were used in combination with removable partial denture. Four implants were used with <b>ball</b> <b>anchor</b> retention, 29 with bar support. The ELEMENT implant with the low implant shoulder allows very good esthetics. Prosthetic complications and maintenance service {{during the first year of}} function was comparable with other implant systems. Since the design of the abutment screws, healing caps and screwdriver was changed, the system has become easier in its application...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze and compare {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) observations of ball attachments that had been worn by patients during three periods of clinical use. One hundred forty-four specimens of <b>ball</b> <b>anchor</b> attachments (gold alloy matrix and titanium patrix) were studied by SEM after periods of approximately 1, 3. 5, and 8 years of clinical use. Twenty new attachment components were examined as controls. SEM images revealed signs of mechanical wear for the ball attachments studied. The surfaces of the titanium patrix were associated primarily with roughening after short-term use, whereas surfaces of the gold alloy matrix showed wear, roughening, and loss of microscopic material in the form of flakes. Severe mechanical wear on both surfaces was noted after longer periods of use. The mechanical changes were not correlated with patient-mediated observations regarding the time-dependent retentive efficacy of the attachments. One year of clinical wear appeared to have limited effect on the ball attachment tested. Conversely, longer periods of use led to marked modifications in shape of the matrix and patrix components.

60|$|The {{last place}} {{he had to}} visit was that at which he had the longest task to perform. It was at a ship-chandler's in Tower Street, a large and dingy house, the lower portion being filled with canvas, cordage, barrels of pitch and tar, candles, oil, and matters of all sorts needed by ship-masters, {{including}} many cannon of different sizes, piles of <b>balls,</b> <b>anchors,</b> and other heavy work, {{all of which were}} stowed away in a yard behind it. The owner of this store was a one-armed man.

40|$|AIM This study {{investigated}} the pattern of resorption of the mandibular ridge under implant-supported overdentures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Files of 60 patients were available for analysis (45 women and 15 men, mean age {{at the time of}} the follow-up 76. 5 Â± 8. 5 years, 54 patients restored with bars, 6 with <b>ball</b> <b>anchors).</b> A baseline was defined by different stable landmarks and quartered. Linear measurements from this baseline at different clinical relevant sites approximately at: (i) the area close to the mental foramen/close to the implant, (ii) the chewing center, and (iii) the distal edge of the denture flange were carried out on rotational tomograms (OPTs). The OPTs were taken after prosthetic restoration and at an individual follow-up time (mean 11 Â± 4. 75 years). The known implant length served to scale each measurement to avoid any distortion errors. RESULTS The resorption rate showed a high individual variation, but among the three sites, the difference was highly significant. Median values of site (i) left = - 0. 07 mm/right = + 0. 05 mm, site (ii) left = - 0. 60 mm/right = - 0. 55 mm, and site (iii) left = - 1. 58 mm/right = - 2. 01 mm. CONCLUSIONS The load of the distal flange of a mandibular implant overdenture increases bone resorption as a local factor, whereas implants may help to prevent resorption in the neighboring bone. An individual-adapted follow-up protocol should be established for each patient restored with an implant overdenture...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{retrospective}} study reports the clinical outcome following placement of extraoral implants in severely resorbed posterior ridges to support distal-extension removable dentures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutively treated patients with partially or completely edentulous ridges, with available bone height in the posterior region of 6 mm or less, {{were included in}} the study. Implants originally intended for extraoral use (Straumann) were placed in second molar regions and allowed to heal for 4 to 6 months before abutment connection. At recall appointments, the peri-implant hard and soft tissues were evaluated. Complications with implant components, as well as mechanical and structural failures of the prostheses, were recorded. Two-year survival rates were calculated and life table analyses undertaken. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (19 women and 10 men; average age 61. 2 years, range, 44 to 75 years) {{were included in the}} study. Forty-seven extraoral implants in 26 patients were placed in the second molar site of the mandible. Two extraoral implants in 2 patients failed during the osseointegration phase, yielding an 8 -year cumulative success rate of 91. 8 %. The mean distance from the extraoral implants to the most distal tooth/implant was 28. 1 mm (range, 16. 7 to 39. 2 mm). Twenty-three extraoral implants were restored with magnets, 18 with <b>ball</b> <b>anchors,</b> and 4 with conical cylinders. Replacement of abutments and retention elements was necessary in 2 patients. Four abutments in 2 patients were disconnected from the restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the employed research design, extraoral implants may be used successfully to provide support for distal-extension removable dentures in severely resorbed posterior alveolar ridges...|$|R
