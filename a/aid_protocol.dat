40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have recently}} gained {{a great deal}} of attention as a topic of research, with a wide range of applications being explored. Bulk data dissemination is a basic building block for sensor network applications. The problem of designing efficient bulk data dissemination protocols has been addressed in a number of recent studies. The problem of mathematically analyzing the performance of these protocols, however, has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. In this work, we show a way of analyzing mathematically the performance of bulk data dissemination protocols in WSNs. Our model can be applied to general networks by use of the shortest propagation path. Our model is accurate by considering topological information, impact of contention, and impact of pipelining. We validate the analytical results through detailed simulations, and we find the analytical results fit well with the simulation results. Further, we demonstrate that the analytical results can be used to <b>aid</b> <b>protocol</b> design for performance optimizations, e. g., page size tuning for shortening the completion time. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Background: A multidisciplinary, {{evidence-based}} {{care program}} {{to improve the}} management of depression in nursing home residents was implemented and tested using a stepped-wedge design in 23 nursing homes (NHs) : " Act in case of Depression" (AiD). Objective: Before effect analyses, to evaluate AiD process data on sampling quality (recruitment and randomization, reach) and intervention quality (relevance and feasibility, extent to which AiD was performed), {{which can be used}} for understanding internal and external validity. In this article, a model is presented that divides process evaluation data into first- and second-order process data. Methods: Qualitative and quantitative data based on personal files of residents, interviews of nursing home professionals, and a research database were analyzed according to the following process evaluation components: sampling quality and intervention quality. Setting: Nursing home. Results: The pattern of residents' informed consent rates differed for dementia special care units and somatic units during the study. The nursing home staff was satisfied with the AiD program and reported that the program was feasible and relevant. With the exception of the first screening step (nursing staff members using a short observer-based depression scale), AiD components were not performed fully by NH staff as prescribed in the <b>AiD</b> <b>protocol.</b> Conclusion: Although NH staff found the program relevant and feasible and was satisfied with the program content, individual AiD components may have different feasibility. The results on sampling quality implied that statistical analyses of AiD effectiveness should account for the type of unit, whereas the findings on intervention quality implied that, next to the type of unit, analyses should account for the extent to which individual AiD program components were performed. In general, our first-order process data evaluation confirmed internal and external validity of the AiD trial, and this evaluation enabled further statistical fine tuning. The importance of evaluating the first-order process data before executing statistical effect analyses is thus underlined. © 2012 American Medical Directors Association, Inc...|$|E

Treatment of envenomation involves the prevention of further nematocyst release and relieving local and systemic symptoms. Many anecdotal treatments are available but species-specific first aid response is essential for effective treatment. However, species identification is difficult in most cases. There is evidence that oral analgesics, seawater, baking soda slurry and 42 – 45 °C hot water are effective against nematocyst inhibition and giving pain relief. The application of topical vinegar for 30 s is effective on stings of specific species. Treatments, which produce osmotic or pressure changes can exacerbate the initial sting and aggravate symptoms, common among many anecdotal treatments.

40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{feasibility}} of a protocol for intra-fractional adjustment of the patient position, during radiation therapy treatment in the pelvic region, a two-fold study is carried out. The protocol involves an objective quantitative measurement of the error in positioning starting from the comparison of a portal image with a reference image. The {{first part of the}} study applies the protocol to determine the efficacy of adjustment using subjective determination of the positioning errors by a clinician by measuring the residual errors after adjustment. A group of 13 patients was followed extensively throughout their treatment, analyzing 240 fields. In the second part the measurement itself determines the extent of readjustment of the position. Throughout the procedure elapsed time is measured to determine the extra time involved in using this procedure. For this part a group of 21 patients was followed yielding statistics on 218 fields. Using this computer <b>aided</b> <b>protocol</b> it is shown that systematic as well as random errors can be reduced to standard deviations of the order of 1 mm. The price to pay however is additional treatment time up to 58 % of the treatment time without the protocol. Time analysis shows that the largest part of the added time is spent on the readjustment of the patients' position adding a mean of 37 % of time to the treatment of one field. This is {{despite the fact that the}} readjustment was performed using a remote couch controller. Finally a statistical analysis shows that it is possible to select patients benefiting from the use of such a protocol after a limited number of fractions. © 1995.

Immigrant children have some peculiarities related to their previous living conditions, {{although there are no}} significant differences between immigrant and native children’ diseases. Methods: in 3. 5 years we evaluated every adoptee that reached our university centre, by using GLNBI (Gruppo di Lavoro Nazionale del Bambino Immigrato) diagnostic – <b>aiding</b> <b>protocol,</b> in order to assess infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, immunization status, intestinal parasitosis or other pathologies; this protocol is actually applied only in research centres. Results: we evaluated 358 international adoptees from 4 different Zones of the world; average age at first visit was approximately 5 years. Health certifications concerning vaccination history records were considered “valid” in 59. 2 % (212 / 358), 49. 5 % (105 / 212) of which had a complete panel of immunization. QuantiFERON®_TB Gold In-Tube (QTF) test resulted negative in 94. 0 % cases (313 / 333) and positive in 6. 0 % (20 / 333). HIV, HCV and Syphilis tests resulted in 0. 3 % positive test for each serology (1 / 358). Cysticercosis’ serology was positive in 8. 9 % (32 / 358) using immunoenzymatic assay (not confirmed by immunoblotting) and Toxocariasis in 13. 1 % (47 / 358). Parasitological investigation of faeces were found positive on 42. 7 % (153 / 358) children, throat swabs in 11. 5 % (41 / 358) children. There were 82. 4 % (295 / 358) abnormal blood count, 41. 9 % (150 / 358) low ferritin, 89. 9 % (322 / 358) endocrine abnormalities and 20. 4 % (73 / 358) various pathologies evaluated by specialists. Conclusions: pathologies affecting our study group are the same affecting other categories of immigrant children, because they often share similar living conditions as orphanage or crowded residencies, low and poor intake of appropriate nutrients for growing ages, leading to malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia and intestinal parasitosis.

40|$|Abstract—Radio-frequency (RF) based {{recharging}} of sensor nodes is {{a promising}} {{way to reduce}} maintenance and extend the operational life of wireless sensor networks. However RF attenuation causes the network nodes with largest distance from the access point (master node) to dictate the rate of recharging which imposes unnecessary breaks {{in the operation of}} nodes closer to the master.

To solve this problem we have designed location <b>aided</b> MAC <b>protocol</b> which supports recharging such that all nodes deplete their batteries at approximately the same time so that recharging pulse comes on time for all the nodes. To achieve that we have partitioned network nodes into circular zones around the master and assigned implicit priorities among the zones.

We have built probabilistic performance model to evaluate the impact of the recharging process on data communication of different zones by varying traffic load and network size. I...|$|R
