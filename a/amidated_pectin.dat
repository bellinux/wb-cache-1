40|$|Thickening and gelling {{properties}} of commercial <b>amidated</b> <b>pectins</b> {{depend on the}} degree of amidation and methyl-esterification, but also the distribution of these groups is of great importance. Methods have been developed during the last few years to determine the distribution of methyl esters over the pectic backbone. We applied the strategies developed for the analysis of high methyl-esterified pectins for studying the distribution of amide groups in <b>amidated</b> <b>pectins.</b> Low methyl-esterified <b>amidated</b> (LMA) <b>pectins</b> were digested before and after removal of methyl esters by an endo-polygalacturonase to determine the degree of blockiness of the substituents. The nature of the substituents (amide groups compared to methyl esters) did not modify the behavior of the enzyme. Oligomers released were separated by using high-performance anion exchange chromatography and pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) at pH 5. Fractions collected after on-line desalting were identified by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Oligomers were found to elute from the column as a function of their total charge. For the same overall charge and size, oligomers with methyl esters eluted before oligomers with amide groups.

The low-methoxyl (LM) pectin gels were characterized {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 + by oscillatory measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The appearance of the gel microstructure varied with the pH, the gel structure being sparse and aggregated at pH 3 but dense and somewhat entangled at pH 7. During gel formation of pectins G and C 30 at pH 3 there was a rapid increase in G' initially followed by a small increase with time. At pH 7 G' increased very rapidly at first but then remained constant. The presence of sucrose influenced neither the kinetic behavior nor the microstructure of the gels but strongly increased the storage modulus. Pectins G and C 30 showed large variations in G' at pH values 3, 4, 5, and 7 in the presence of sucrose, and the maximum in G' in the samples occurred at different pH values.

40|$|The use {{of calcium}} {{phosphate}} cements (CPC) is restricted by {{their lack of}} macroporosity and poor drug release properties. To overcome these two limitations, incorporating degradable polymer microparticles into CPC is an attractive option, as polymer microparticles could help to control drug release and induce macroporosity after degradation. Although few authors have yet tested synthetic polymers, the potentiality of polysaccharides’ assuming this role has never been explored. Low-methoxy <b>amidated</b> <b>pectins</b> (LMAP) constitute valuable candidates because of their biocompatibility and ionic and pH sensitivity. In this study, the potentiality of a LMAP {{with a degree of}} esterification (DE) of 30 and a degree of amidation (DA) of 19 was explored. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the influence of LMAP microspheres within the composite on the cement properties, drug release ability and final macroporosity after microspheres degradation. Three LMAP incorporation ratios, 2 %, 4 % and 6 % w/w were tested, and ibuprofen was chosen as the model drug. In comparison with the CPC reference, the resulting composites presented reduced setting times and lowered the mechanical properties, which remained acceptable for an implantation in moderate-stress-bearing locations. Sustained release of ibuprofen was obtained on at least 45 days, and release rates were found to be controlled by the LMAP ratio, which modulated drug diffusion. After 4 months of degradation study, the resulting CPC appeared macroporous, with a maximum macroporosity of nearly 30 % for the highest LMAP incorporation ratio, and interconnectivity between pores could be observed. In conclusion, LMAP appear as interesting candidates to generate macroporous bone cements with tailored release properties and macroporosity by adjusting the pectin content within the composites...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{formation}} of spherical pectin pellets by investigating the effect of additive concentration in the granulation liquid on the shape and size of the products as well as by identifying an optimal additive concentration. Methods. High-methoxylated, low-methoxylated, and <b>amidated</b> low-methoxylated <b>pectin</b> types were evaluated in combination with different concentrations of methanol, ethanol, citric acid, lactic acid, and calcium chloride. Pellets were prepared in a power-consumption-controlled twin-screw extruder, then spheronized and dried. The moisture content of the extrudate was determined, and the final products were characterized by image analysis and sieving analysis. A cloud point test was employed for the identification of an optimal additive concentration. Results. The concentration of additive in the granulation liquid affected the moisture content of the extrudate and the shape, size, and mechanical stability of the pectin pellets. Improvements in the pellet characteristics are dependent on the pectin type employed. The 2 low-methoxylated pectins were more sensitive to concentration changes than was the high-methoxylated type. Above a certain threshold concentration, the quality of the pellets are improved. This additive concentration differs according to type of pectin and type of additive. Conclusion.

In contrast, LMP gels by forming ionic linkages via calcium bridges between two carboxyl groups from two different chains in close proximity, known as the ‘egg-box’ model. Pectin gels exhibit Newtonian behaviour at low shear rates and shear-thinning behaviour when the shear rate is increased. An overview of pectin from its origin to its physicochemical properties is presented in this review...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} liposomal formulations that can adsorb to the human dental enamel. The overall aim of this pharmaceutical approach is to physically protect the teeth against detrimental processes, such as tooth wear, acidic challenges and dental caries. Adsorption experiments of different liposomal formulations to hydroxyapatite (HA), a model substance for the dental hard tissue, and the human dental enamel were performed. To find which liposomal formulations are promising for the adsorption to teeth, formulation factors important for the interaction were initially mapped {{by the use of}} experimental design and multivariate analysis (Paper I). The type of surface charge became the most significant factor for the adsorption process. Positively charged liposomes adsorbed better than the negatively charged liposomes to HA in phosphate buffer, pH 6. 8 - 7. However, the adsorption of positively charged liposomes to HA in a salivary environment was interfered as they were found to aggregate with components of saliva (Paper II). To overcome problems related to the positively charged liposomes, the surface of the liposomes was modified with the polymer pectin. Three types of pectin were investigated for the surface coating of liposomes: LM-, HM- and <b>amidated</b> <b>pectin</b> (Paper III). Pectin coating of positively charged liposomes was successfully prepared, and a reproducible method was established. Pectin coated liposomes did not seem to interact with salivary components (Paper IV), and were therefore promising for use in the oral cavity. Pectin coated liposomes adsorbed to HA in saliva, and liposomes coated with LMand HM-pectin were selected for further investigation with the dental enamel (Paper IV). Both uncoated negatively charged liposomes and pectin coated liposomes adsorbed onto enamel specimens in a salivary environment (Paper IV), indicating their potential use in the protection of the teeth. The adsorption was examined by exposing a flow on the enamel surfaces for certain time intervals. Pectin coated liposomes seemed to retain better than uncoated negatively charged liposomes at longer time intervals. It was hypothesized that pectin may help to prolong the adhesion of liposomes on the tooth surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{undertaken}} on the binding of Mn 2 + ions to two alginate samples of different mannuronate:guluronate ratios (M:G), {{a sample of}} low-ester <b>amidated</b> <b>pectin</b> and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The binding of Ca 2 + ions has also been included for the latter for comparison. The binding curves showed an initial steep rise at low additions of Mn 2 + or Ca 2 + indicating {{that all of the}} ions were bound to the polymer chains with none remaining in solution. At higher additions, the binding curves showed a plateau region and the maximum amount bound, θ, was found to be 0. 2, 0. 2, 0. 25, and 0. 33 mol M 2 +/mol COO- for high M:G alginate, low M:G alginate, pectin, and PAA, respectively. The binding curves for Mn 2 + and Ca 2 + with PAA were superimposable. In all cases, θ was less than the stoichiometric equivalent and also less than predicted by Manning counterion condensation theory. The linear charge density, ξ, for the polymers is 1. 49, 1. 55, 1. 62, and 2. 85, and it was found that at maximum binding the effective linear charge density, ξeffective, decreased to a value close to 1 in each case and not 0. 5 as predicted from Manning's two-variable theory. The mobility of the PAA chains has been followed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy using nitroxide spin labels covalently attached to the polymer, and the gelation of the pectin and alginate samples has been monitored using small deformation oscillatory experiments. For PAA at maximum binding, it was noted that there was a loss of chain mobility and precipitation. For pectin and alginate, gelation occurred and the stoichiometric ratio for maximum binding corresponded to the stoichiometric ratio for the maximum in G‘. Precipitation and gelation are attributed to the formation of polymer−metal complexes involving one or two carboxylate groups resulting in charge reversal or charge annihilation...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comSummary Cryoprotectant mixtures were added to frozen/thawed (F/T) mashed potatoes {{in the form of}} <b>amidated</b> low-methoxyl (ALM) <b>pectin</b> and xanthan gum (XG), kappa-carrageenan (κ-C) and XG and sodium caseinate (SC) and XG, and the effect of frozen storage was examined. F/T mashed potatoes without added biopolymers had higher storage modulus G′ after freezing and frozen storage, associated with sponge formation due to amylose retrogradation. Oscillatory measurements indicated weakening of the structure of mashed potatoes without biopolymers and with added κ-C/XG and SC/XG mixtures at the end of storage due to ice recrystallisation, whereas the structure of samples with added ALM/XG mixtures was reinforced by increasing time in storage. Mashed potatoes with added mixtures exhibited water-holding capacity for 1 year. Samples with added κ-C/XG mixtures were more structured, although when both κ-C/XG and SC/XG mixtures were included in mashed potato, very acceptable sensory quality was maintained in usual frozen storage conditions. © 2009 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

40|$|International audienceThree polyuronates: <b>amidated</b> low {{methoxyl}} <b>pectin</b> (ALMP), low methoxyl pectin (LMP) and {{polygalacturonic acid}} (PGA) {{were used to}} encapsulate rutin in pellets, and they were characterized by different techniques (macroscopic properties, Calcium and rutin release). The ability of the three polyuronates to bind calcium ions and the viscoelastic properties of gels were performed to relate {{the properties of the}} pellets to the gel structures. The pellets size, the water content, the water uptake, the release of calcium and rutin varied depending on the polyuronate used. The pellets size of ALMP were smaller than LMP and PGA with a lower water content, but this matrix was more sensitive to the Water uptake, which favored the diffusion of calcium and rutin in a simulated intestinal fluid (Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7. 4). This {{can be explained by the}} structure of ALMP network inducing the most flexible gel with the lowest viscoelastic moduli and a low affinity for calcium due to the presence of methoxy and amide groups that disrupts randomly the polygalacturonate units in the pectin chain and requires less calcium to form the gel. For the LMP and PGA, the gel properties were stronger than ALMP resulting in a better resistance to water uptake, thus inducing a lower diffusion of calcium and a lower rutin release. Finally, the rutin release was related to the structure and the properties of the network formed before drying due to the nature of polyuronate used during the manufacturing process of pellets...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocolloids {{and protein}} {{were added to}} fresh (F) and frozen/thawed (F/T) mashed {{potatoes}} {{in the form of}} mixtures of: (1) <b>amidated</b> low-methoxyl (ALM) <b>pectin</b> and xanthan gum (XG); (2) kappa-carrageenan (k-C) and XG; and (3) sodium caseinate (SC) and XG. F and F/T mashed potatoes without added biopolymers and with XG at 1. 5 g/kg were also analyzed. Flow curves fit the power law and Casson models well ¿ and preferentially the first of these. The Cox¿Merz rule was not applicable to the steady and dynamic shear data on all of the mashed potatoes. In the F products, the departure of mashed potatoes¿biopolymer mixtures from the Cox¿Merz rule was XG concentrationdependent. It was concluded that most of the F mashed potatoes followed the linear modified Cox¿Merz rule, with h*(w) and ha(¿) well superimposed. However, after processing, the linearity ¿ or otherwise of the relationship between viscosities ¿ was more dependent on the type of biopolymer mixture. Also, {{in the case of the}} F/T mashed potatoes without added biopolymers and with added ALM/XG binary mixtures, the relationships may be considered linear. Conversely, in the case of F/T mashed potatoes with added XG alone and mixed with k-C and SC, small amplitude dynamic properties cannot be used directly to predict changes in texture perceived in the mouth given that the relationship between these properties and steady shear measurements is nonlinear. The effects of addition of either XG alone or binary mixtures to F and F/T mashed potatoes were very dependent on the magnitude of the strain deformation applied to the system (i. e., low strain in oscillatory shear and high strain in steady shear.
