25|$|In many countries, {{it is not}} {{feasible}} for banks to lend at fixed rates for very long terms; in these cases, the only feasible type of mortgage for banks to offer may be adjustable rate mortgages (barring some form of government intervention). For example, the mortgage industry of the United Kingdom has traditionally been dominated by building societies. Since funds raised by UK building societies {{must be at least}} 50% deposits, lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce potential interest rate risks between what they charging in mortgage interest <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> paying in interest for deposits and other funding sources.|$|E
25|$|If {{the goal}} of shorter-term therapy is for {{patients}} {{to understand that they}} are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E

500|$|Composers Morten Sørlie, Tor Linløkken, and Bjørn Arve Lagim {{created the}} soundtrack and music of Anarchy Online. [...] Using a system they call [...] "Sample-based Interactive Music", the game mixes {{numerous}} music samples to create dynamic music. [...] By starting, stopping, fading, and layering samples based {{on where the}} player is, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing, the game creates a continuous stream of background music.

500|$|Sue Walsh {{observed}} in 2007 that critics have rigidly categorised Just So Stories as [...] "Children's Literature", and have in consequence given it scant literary attention. In her view, if critics mention {{the book at}} all, they talk {{about what kind of}} reading is good for children <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> capable of understanding. The stories are discussed, she argues, by critics such as Elliott Gose [...] "in terms of ideas about the child’s pleasure (conceived of in sensual terms divorced of intellectual understanding) in the oral aspects of the text which are said to prompt an ‘active Participation’ which seems largely to be understood in terms of the ‘oral savouring’ of repetition".|$|E

500|$|The [...] "cerulean speech", where Miranda {{draws the}} {{connection}} between the designer fashion in Runways pages and Andy's cerulean sweater, criticizing Andy's snobbishness about fashion and explaining the trickle-down effect, had its origins in a scene cut from earlier drafts that Streep had asked to have restored. It slowly grew from a few lines where the editor disparaged her assistant's fashion sense to a speech about [...] "why she thought fashion was important ... She is so aware that she is affecting billions of people, and what they pick off the floor <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> putting on their bodies in the morning."

500|$|... "Illuminati" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Madonna for her thirteenth studio album Rebel Heart (2015). It was written by Madonna Ciccone, Toby Gad, Maureen McDonald, Larry Griffin Jr., Mike Dean, Kanye West, Ernest Brown and Jacques Webster. The song was produced by Madonna, West, Dean and Symbolyc One, with co-production by Charlie Heat and additional production by Travis Scott. The song's demo was leaked to the internet in December 2014, with twelve other tracks from the album. Its final version was released on December 20, 2014, with five other tracks on iTunes store as [...] "an early Christmas gift" [...] to avoid further leaks. The song's demo version features dance synths and acoustic guitars; after showing the song to West, he felt connected to the song and changed it to a darker sound. The song was conceived after Madonna was {{accused of being a}} member of the Illuminati; she wanted to write a song about who they really are <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|E

Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I {{think part of the}} fun is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child.

500|$|Mount Rainier {{is located}} {{in an area that}} itself is part of the eastern rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire. This {{includes}} mountains and calderas like Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak in California, Crater Lake, Three Sisters, and Mount Hood in Oregon, [...] Mount Saint Helens, Mount Adams, Glacier Peak, and Mount Baker in Washington, and Mount Cayley, Garibaldi, Silverthrone, and Mount Meager in British Columbia. [...] All of the above are dormant, but alive, and scientists {{on both sides of the}} border gather research of the past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> capable of in the future, including Mount Rainier. Of these, only two have erupted since the beginning of the twentieth century: Lassen in 1915 and St. Helens in 1980 and 2004. [...] However, past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of sub-plinian eruptions [...] or higher: Crater Lake's last eruption as Mount Mazama was large enough to cause its cone to implode, and Mt. Rainier's closest neighbor, Mount [...] St. Helens, had a huge chunk of the side of the mountain blow up in a phreatic explosion caused by a mix of gas and water. Where St. Helens was once perfectly symmetrical there is now, thirty five years later, a huge crater at the top of one face. Statistics place the likelihood of a major eruption in this range at 2-3 per century.|$|E

2500|$|A theory {{based in}} self-efficacy, Self Regulation is [...] "A theory of {{motivation}} {{based on the}} setting of goals and the receipt of accurate feedback that is monitored to enhance the likelihood of goal attainment" [...] It is presumed that people consciously set goals for themselves that guide and direct their behavior toward the attainment of these goals. These people also engage in self-monitoring or self-evaluation. Self-evaluation can be helped along if feedback is given {{when a person is}} working on their goals because it can align how a person feels about how they are doing to achieve a goal <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> actually doing to achieve their goals.
