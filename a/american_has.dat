50|$|Altogether, genetic {{studies suggest}} that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA {{analysis}} led in 2006 by Penn State geneticist Mark D.

25|$|In 2006, the immigration-reduction {{advocacy}} {{think tank}} the Center for Immigration Studies released a poll {{that found that}} 68% of Americans think U.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are too low.

In 2004, 55% of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased. The less contact a native-born <b>American</b> <b>has</b> with immigrants, the more likely one would have a negative view of immigrants.|$|E
25|$|The {{legal and}} {{official}} designation {{of who is}} Native <b>American</b> <b>has</b> aroused controversy by demographers, tribal nations, and government officials for many decades. Federally recognized tribes and state recognized tribes set their own membership requirements; tribal enrollment may require residency on a reservation, documented lineal descent from recognized records, such as the Dawes Rolls, and other criteria. Some tribes have adopted the use of blood quantum, requiring members {{to have a certain}} percentage. The federal government requires individuals to certify documented blood quantum of ancestry for certain federal programs, such as education benefits, available to members of recognized tribes. But Census takers accept any respondent's identification. Genetic scientists estimated that more than 15 million other Americans, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans (specifically those of Mexican heritage), may have up to one quarter of American Indian ancestry.|$|E
