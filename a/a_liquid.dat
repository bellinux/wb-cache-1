5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> or are melted into <b>a</b> <b>liquid,</b> they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{boundary}} layer flow and heat transfer from a plate {{moving in a}} quiescent non-Newtonian power law fluid medium is solved numerically to obtain results showing the effects of power-law index and Reynolds number on friction and heat transfer coefficients.

Further in the case of <b>a</b> power-law <b>liquid,</b> <b>an</b> increase in the velocity of the plate also produces a reduction in drag and an increase in heat transfer. Compared to <b>a</b> Newtonian <b>liquid,</b> the friction coefficient decreases by 57 % for <b>a</b> non-Newtonian <b>liquid</b> of power-law index, n = 0. 568 at Re= 2000.

5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal may flow like <b>a</b> <b>liquid,</b> but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are {{many different types of}} liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).|$|E
