5|$|Galvis {{struggled}} off {{the field}} after his injury in 2012, noting that he only emerged from the covers of his bed to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for takeout food, namely Chinese food, pizza, and cheesesteaks. Since then, he has started a daily therapeutic routine aimed at preventing future injuries, to which he is apparently susceptible after his first back injury. His hobbies include relaxing at the beach and playing basketball. Galvis married his wife, Anna, in 2013, and {{is the father of}} two girls named Anastasia and Nicole.|$|E
5|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come by in the morning and Stuart would <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in his stocking feet– as he'd been up all night. I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E

5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E
25|$|Example: We visit every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some {{people are more likely to}} <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> (e.g. an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|E

25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and waited patiently for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|E

On the scene were the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Guard, the Boston and Watertown Police departments, and the Massachusetts State Police. The show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks.|$|E

25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E

Elizabeth Taylor, one of the hotel's best known guests, would stay with her numerous husbands in the bungalows, and spent six of her eight honeymoons there. Her father owned an art gallery {{on the ground floor}} of the hotel. The Polo Lounge became associated with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and the Rat Pack, where they held heavy drinking bouts.
