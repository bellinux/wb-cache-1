5000|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{compendium}} is {{to provide information about}} Chlamydophila psittaci to all those concerned with the control of the disease, which had 66 reported human cases between 2005 and 2009. It includes standardized procedures to control <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> in birds, which causes the disease in humans.|$|E
50|$|In birds, Chlamydia psittaci {{infection}} {{is referred to}} as <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> (AC). Infected birds shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges, which can remain infectious for several months. Many strains remain quiescent in birds until activated under stress. Birds are excellent, highly mobile vectors for the distribution of chlamydial infection because they feed on, and have access to, the detritus of infected animals of all sorts.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife rehabilitators {{should be}} careful to not misdiagnose M. gallisepticum {{infection}} with other diseases with similar clinical signs, such as <b>avian</b> influenza, <b>chlamydiosis,</b> Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, head trauma, and avian pox virus. M. gallisepticum can be treated with antibiotics such as tylosin, tetracycline, or oral enrofloxacin with ophthalmic gentamicin. These are given through food, water or injections. Especially tylosin gives good results in the feed. However, treated birds must be kept in captivity and isolation {{for a long time}} period because birds may become asymptomatic carriers. At this point, {{it is very difficult to}} verify if previously infected birds are still infected with M. gallisepticum. Treatment and release is not wise for disease control in wild populations.|$|R
40|$|Captive {{breeding}} and restoration programs involve managed movements of animals between captive and free-living populations. Conservationists {{are concerned that}} novel diseases or genetic conditions may be transferred by these movements, endangering both captive-released and remnant wild populations. Captive breeding programs have been established by the governments of several countries in the Middle East {{with the objective of}} restoring populations of houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). Many of these organizations have integrated veterinary departments into their captive-breeding programs. Biomedical research has been developed to maximize the health of captive birds, monitor the diseases present in both captive and free-living populations, and minimize the potential threat of disease transfer. Diseases such as Newcastle disease, <b>avian</b> pox, <b>chlamydiosis,</b> and intestinal parasites pose significant threats to captive {{breeding and}} restoration programs for houbara bustards in the Arabian peninsula, and measures are being taken to address this problem in the region...|$|R
40|$|The diet of top predators {{can provide}} useful {{information}} on phenology and abundance of their prey. The cosmopolitan and specialist Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) {{is an ideal}} model to assess whether food changes {{have occurred in the}} long-term. In this contribution, we reviewed all available literature on Peregrine Falcon diet in Italy which contained 11 detailed datasets useful for our review, and also included analysis of pellets, collected at three breeding sites of Sicily during 2014 and 2015. These data allowed us to shed light on the Peregrine Falcon’s diet over the last forty years (1978 - 2015). We calculated the numerical and biomass percentage of the resident and not-resident prey proportions, as well as the trophic diversity of diet in each site using the Simpson diversity index. To describe the Peregrine Falcon food niche and investigate whether year, habitat and latitude effects existed in its diet, we used a 2 nd-degree factorial ANOVA. Over 1, 550 preys, 110 bird species accounted for 98. 58 % of frequency and 99. 79 % of biomass. Modelling showed a year effect, with the quota and biomass of resident prey species increasing across the forty years of the study period, in a way complementary to the decrease of the quota and biomass of not-resident prey species. Conversely, habitat and latitude predicted significantly trophic diversity that was larger in rural than urban habitats, and at northern than southern latitudes. The strong numerical and biomass decrease of not-resident preys in the trophic niche of Peregrine Falcon in Italy could be related to the negative population trends of both migratory and summer-breeder farmland species. Actually the bulk of prey of the Peregrine Falcon in Italy is formed by a restricted group of resident Corvidae and Columbidae, which have remarkably increased in the last years. This could trigger more dependence on resident prey in the long term, making the Peregrine Falcons more vulnerable to control programs or eradication of specific prey populations or exposing them locally to high risk of infections (<b>chlamydiosis,</b> <b>avian</b> trichomiasis) transferred by feral species...|$|R
50|$|Chlamydia psittaci is {{a lethal}} {{intracellular}} bacterial species that may cause endemic <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis,</b> epizootic outbreaks in mammals, and respiratory psittacosis in humans.

40|$|Psittacosis, {{also known}} as parrot fever and ornithosis, is a {{bacterial}} infection of humans that can cause severe pneumonia and other serious health problems. It is caused by Chlamydophila psittaci, formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci. From 2005 through 2009, 66 human cases of psittacosis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Nationally Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). In general, these cases occur after exposure to infected pet birds, usually cockatiels, parakeets, parrots, and macaws. In birds, C. psittaci infection {{is referred to as}} <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis.</b> Infected birds shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges, and humans become infected from exposure to these materials.

40|$|<b>Avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> is a {{zoonotic}} disease of birds {{caused by the}} intracellular bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci. This disease is called psittacosis in humans. It may be called either <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> or psittacosis in psittacine birds; the term <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> is generally used in other avian species. Infections are particularly common among psittacine birds and pigeons, but most or all species of birds are probably susceptible. Some birds carry this organism asymptomatically. Others become mildly to severely ill, either immediately or {{after they have been}} stressed. Significant economic losses may be seen in turkeys and ducks, and high mortality can occur in clinically affected psittacines. Humans are readily infected by C. psittaci. In 1929, exposure to imported pet psittacines caused a pandemic in the U. S. and Europe. Since that time, improved screening and control of avian infections have decreased the incidence of human disease. However, C. psittaci is difficult to eliminate entirely; sporadic cases and outbreaks continue to occur. Unusual sources of outbreaks have also been reported.

40|$|Psittacosis (also {{known as}} parrot fever or ornithosis) is a {{bacterial}} infection of humans {{that can result}} in severe pneumonia and death. It is caused by infection with an organism newly renamed as Chlamydophila psittaci. 1 Formerly, the organism was called Chlamydia psittaci. The disease in birds {{has been referred to}} as <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis.</b> National guidelines on this disease are updated annually (most recently in 2002) by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) in its “Compendium of measures to control Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly Chlamydia psittaci) infection among humans (psittacosis) and pet birds, 2002. ” 2 The compendium provides a practical summary of modes of transmission, clinical signs, case definitions, and methods of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment for humans and pet birds. Its purpose is to provide standardized procedures for controlling <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> in birds to protect humans.

40|$|<b>Avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> is an {{infectious}} disease of birds caused by gram-negative bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci. However, this disease can occure among other mammals including humans. Chlamydiosis often presents as an inapparent infection, especially in older birds. During stressful conditions (deficient diet, transportation, great population density in small spaces, etc.) and comorbidity, however, the birds usually begin to either present with the clinical signs of chlamydiosis, or secrete many causative agents to the environment. Depending on the serotype of the causative agent, {{and the type}} and age of the host, the disease usually causes systemic disorders, and is often fatal. The affected birds present with lethargy, fever, typical yellow-green discharge from the eyes and nose, diarrhea, anorexia and the weight lost. Bearing capacity is reduced. Autopsy findings show hepatomegaly with necrotic foci, splenomegaly and fibrinous inflammation of the pericardium, peritoneum and air sacs.

40|$|In birds, <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> {{results from}} {{infection}} by Chlamydophila psittaci (order Chlamydiales, family Chlamydiaceae). Psittacosis {{is the human}} disease caused by infection with Chlamydophila psittaci. This organism, previously known as Chlamydia psittaci, is a Gram negative, coccoid, obligate intracellular bacterium. There are at least six avian serotypes. Geographic Distribution <b>Avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> can be found worldwide. C. psittaci is particularly common in psittacine birds in tropical and subtropical regions. This disease {{is present in the}} United States. In a 1982 survey, C. psittaci was isolated from 20 – 50 % of necropsied pet birds in California and Florida. Transmission Among birds, C. psittaci is transmitted frequently by inhalation of infectious dust and occasionally by ingestion. Fomites can also spread chlamydiosis, and biting insects, mites, and lice may be important in mechanical transmission. Birds can be asymptomatic carriers; carriers shed C. psittaci intermittently, particularly when stressed. One form of the organism, the elementary body, can survive in dried feces for months. Humans usually become infected after inhaling contaminated dust from feathers or bird droppings. Direct contact with infected birds and bites can also spread the disease. Person–to–person transmission is rare but can occur by aerosol or venereal spread. Disinfection C. psittaci is susceptible to quaternary ammonium compounds, chlorophenols, iodophore disinfectants, formaldehyde, 80 % isopropyl alcohol or a 1 : 100 dilution of household bleach...|$|E

40|$|The obligate {{intracellular}} Gram-negative bacterium Chlamydia psittaci often causes <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> and {{influenza-like symptoms}} in humans. However, the commercial subunit C. psittaci vaccine could only provide a partial protection against <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> due to poor cellular immune response. In our previous study, a recombinant herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) -delivered vaccine against C. psittaci and Marek’s disease based on human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (rHVT-CMV-pmpD) {{was developed and}} provided an effective protection against C. psittaci disease with less lesions and reduced chlamydial loads. In this study, we developed another recombinant HVT vaccine expressing the N-terminal fragment of PmpD (PmpD-N) based on human elongation factor- 1 alpha (EF- 1 α) promoter (rHVT-EF-pmpD) by modifying the HVT genome within a bacterial artificial chromosome. The related characterization of rHVT-EF-pmpD was evaluated in vitro in comparison with that of rHVT-CMV-pmpD. The expression of PmpD-N was determined by western blot. Under immunofluorescence microscopy, PmpD-N protein of both two recombinant viruses was located in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface. Growth kinetics of rHVT-EF-pmpD was {{comparable to that of}} rHVT-CMV-pmpD, and the growth rate of rHVT-EF-pmpD was apparently higher than that of rHVT-CMV-pmpD on 48, 72, and 120 [*]h postinfection. Macrophages activated by rHVT-EF-pmpD could produce more nitric oxide and IL- 6 than that activated by rHVT-CMV-pmpD. In this study, a recombinant HVT vaccine expressing PmpD-N based on EF- 1 α promoter was constructed successfully, and a further research in vivo was needed to analyze the vaccine efficacy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} from 2003 to 2008 we {{conducted}} a research on <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina on {{a great number of}} domestic and wild birds from different localities. Diagnostic material from the wild birds was provided by the hunting societies during the hunting season while material from the domestic poultry was taken indiscriminately. Chicken samples are taken from the facilities for intensive production, namely parent flocks. Turkey samples are taken from the individual households keeping and breeding turkey on extensive basis (half – open type of breeding). Pigeon samples are provided from the central parts of Sarajevo where the pigeons live in a close contact with people. Also, pigeon samples are provided from around the town's bakery and a farm for intensive poultry breeding because the pigeons are considered a potential source of infection for other birds, primarily domestic ones, and also for the people. We also took samples of the breeding pheasants from a pheasant farm in Orašje, which is oriented toward breeding and releasing pheasants into their natural habitat, but also breeding for the needs of hunting industry. Samples from the wild/hunting birds (ducks and wild pheasants) were provided in the proximity of watercourses as their residence, and where the hunting is of a greater extent. To obtain valid diagnostic results we have used multiple diagnostic methods and tests: bacteriological examination to exclude cross reactions, IIF (indirect immunofluorescence) to confirm antibodies in the blood serum, ELISA (immunoesay) and EIA (quick immunoessay) to detect antigen, and conventional PCR and rRT – PCR to detect antigen as sensitive and sophisticated diagnostics methods.

40|$|Feral pigeons (Columba livia, Gmelin 1789) {{are among}} the most {{abundant}} vertebrates in the urban environment of almost every city in the world. Close contacts to humans bear the risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens and parasites. The most important of these zoopathogens is the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci, the agent of <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> and human psittacosis/ornithosis. Many human infections reported in the medical literature were attributed to brief and transient contacts to feral pigeons in the urban environment. The aim of the present thesis is to investigate the prevalence of C.  psittaci in the feral pigeon population of Basel, to identify possible routes of transmission in the city and to propose measures for the prevention of zoonotic C.  psittaci transmissions. In a preliminary study, 47 faecal samples were collected from nest boxes in a feral pigeon loft in Basel, Switzerland. In addition 34 samples were collected from the feather dust film on the water surface of public fountains, where feral pigeons regularly bathe.

40|$|The {{zoonotic}} chlamydiae with reservoirs in mammals are Chlamydophila abortus, Chlamydophila felis, {{and possibly}} Chlamydophila pneumoniae. These organisms {{are members of}} the family Chlamydiaceae, an unusual group of obligate intracellular bacteria. The members of this family are considered to be Gram negative, due to their relationships with other Gram negative bacteria, but are difficult to stain with the Gram stain. They have metabolic and structural differences from most bacteria, including a dependence on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) from the host. They cycle through two forms: a metabolically inert, infective elementary body and a metabolically active reticulate body found only inside cells. Until recently, the Chlamydiaceae contained only a few species: Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia pecorum. However, this family has been reorganized, based on analyses of ribosomal RNA. A new genus, Chlamydophila, was established, some species were renamed, and some strains of C. psittaci and C. trachomatis were assigned to new species. Both Chlamydia spp. and Chlamydophila spp. cause the disease chlamydiosis. Some of the organisms that cause chlamydiosis are zoonotic: Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly Chlamydia psittaci, avian strains) is found in birds and causes psittacosis (<b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis).</b> It is responsible for most cases of zoonotic chlamydiosis in humans.

The Compendium {{committee}} and consultants believe these updates and revisions will aid public health officials, physicians, veterinarians, and the pet bird industry in controlling this disease in birds and in people. The 2006 Compendium provides clearer guidance to veterinary clinicians on selecting diagnostic tests, and a discussion of persistent IFA titers. Wording on sentinel surveillance was added, mentioning that it may have value in high risk settings or to mitigate future liability. Protocols for sentinel surveillance must be individualized and established with advice of an avian veterinarian. To help control this disease and protect public health, the Compendium committee and consultants encourage you to distribute this to health officials, veterinarians, and the pet bird industry in your state and actively promote the document as a standard.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} antibodies to Chlamydophila psittaci 364 serum samples were collected from veterinarians, biologists, animal scientists, veterinary students, animal keepers and others employees in 20 zoos, and from veterinary practitioners in 10 Brazilian states. Subjects ranged from 15 to 64 years of age, with 268 (74 %) males and 96 (26 %) females. Chlamydial antibodies were determined by the complement fixation test (CFT) and specific anti-C. psittaci IgG antibodies were determined by the microimmunoflurescence (MIF) test. Complement fixation test showed 23. 9 % (87 / 364) and MIF test showed 4. 7 % (17 / 364) positive serum samples. Titres ranged from 16 to 256 in both assays, demonstrating evidence of recent or current infection. Although chlamydial antibodies were detected in workers of seventeen zoos, MIF test only detected specific C. psittaci antibodies in seven of them. Previous psittacosis infection was suspected in eight workers of two zoos, five of whom reported having pneumonia, while employed at the zoos.

It {{has been suggested that}} wild bird species play an important role as reservoirs for this disease. During a comparative health status survey in common (Falco tinnunculus) and lesser (Falco naumanni) kestrel populations in Spain, acute gammapathies were detected. We investigated whether gammapathies were associated with Chlamydiaceae infections. We recorded the prevalence of different Chlamydiaceae species in nestlings of both kestrel species in three different study areas. Chlamydophila psittaci serovar I (or Chlamydophila abortus), an ovine pathogen causing late-term abortions, was isolated from all the nestlings of both kestrel species in one of the three studied areas, a location with extensive ovine livestock enzootic of this atypical bacteria and where gammapathies were recorded. Serovar and genetic cluster analysis of the kestrel isolates from this area showed serovars A and C and the genetic cluster 1 and were different than those isolated from the other two areas. The serovar I in this area was also isolated from sheep abortions, sheep faeces, sheep stable dust, nest dust of both kestrel species, carrion beetles (Silphidae) and Orthoptera. This fact was not observed in other areas. In addition, we found kestrels to be infected by Chlamydia suis and Chlamydia muridarum, the first time these have been detected in birds. Our study evidences a pathogen transmission from ruminants to birds, highlighting th...|$|E
40|$|P>To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} antibodies to Chlamydophila psittaci 364 serum samples were collected from veterinarians, biologists, animal scientists, veterinary students, animal keepers and others employees in 20 zoos, and from veterinary practitioners in 10 Brazilian states. Subjects ranged from 15 to 64 years of age, with 268 (74 %) males and 96 (26 %) females. Chlamydial antibodies were determined by the complement fixation test (CFT) and specific anti-C. psittaci IgG antibodies were determined by the microimmunoflurescence (MIF) test. Complement fixation test showed 23. 9 % (87 / 364) and MIF test showed 4. 7 % (17 / 364) positive serum samples. Titres ranged from 16 to 256 in both assays, demonstrating evidence of recent or current infection. Although chlamydial antibodies were detected in workers of seventeen zoos, MIF test only detected specific C. psittaci antibodies in seven of them. Previous psittacosis infection was suspected in eight workers of two zoos, five of whom reported having pneumonia, while employed at the zoos. However, diagnosis was not established {{in any of these}} cases in the past. Results indicated the occurrence of infection and previous contact of Brazilian zoo workers with C. psittaci, as well as the zoonotic potential of psittacosis in this risk population. Other studies are necessary to {{evaluate the}} risk factors of infection in this population. This seroepidemiological survey confirmed the need to adopt preventive measures to control <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> and protect the health of zoo workers in the country.

40|$|Wild {{birds are}} {{considered}} as a reservoir for <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> posing a potential infectious threat to domestic poultry and humans. Analysis of 894 cloacal or fecal swabs from free-living birds in Poland revealed an overall Chlamydiaceae prevalence of 14. 8 % (n = 132) with the highest prevalence noted in Anatidae (19. 7 %) and Corvidae (13. 4 %). Further testing conducted with species-specific real-time PCR showed that 65 samples (49. 2 %) were positive for C. psittaci whereas only one was positive for C. avium. To classify the non-identified chlamydial agents and to genotype the C. psittaci and C. avium-positive samples, specimens were subjected to ompA-PCR and sequencing (n = 83). The ompA-based NJ dendrogram revealed that only 23 out of 83 sequences were assigned to C. psittaci, in particular to four clades representing the previously described C. psittaci genotypes B, C, Mat 116 and 1 V. Whereas the 59 remaining sequences were assigned to two new clades named G 1 and G 2, each one including sequences recently obtained from chlamydiae detected in Swedish wetland birds. G 1 (18 samples from Anatidae and Rallidae) grouped closely together with genotype 1 V and in relative proximity to several C. abortus isolates, and G 2 (41 samples from Anatidae and Corvidae) grouped closely to C. psittaci strains of the classical ABE cluster, Matt 116 and M 56. Finally, deep molecular analysis of four representative isolates of genotypes 1 V, G 1 and G 2 based on 16 S rRNA, IGS and partial 23 S rRNA sequences as well as MLST clearly classify these isolates within the C. abortus species. Consequently, we propose {{an expansion of the}} C. abortus species to include not only the classical isolates of mammalian origin, but also avian isolates so far referred to as atypical C. psittaci or C. psittaci/C. abortus intermediates...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydophila psittaci {{is found}} worldwide, but is {{particularly}} common among psittacine birds in tropical and subtropical regions. While investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that {{was associated with}} <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis</b> in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. The novel adenovirus (tentatively named Psittacine adenovirus HKU 1) was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A in the Atadenovirus genus. Sequencing showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU 1 genome consists of 31, 735 nucleotides. Comparative genome analysis showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU 1 genome contains 23 open reading frames (ORFs) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes, and six additional ORFs at the 3 ' end of the genome. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH 1, LH 2 and LH 3, which distinguishes it from other viruses in the Atadenovirus genus. Notably, fiber- 2 protein, which is present in Aviadenovirus but not Atadenovirus, is also present in Psittacine adenovirus HKU 1. Psittacine adenovirus HKU 1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50. 3 - 54. 0 % for the DNA polymerase, 64. 6 - 70. 7 % for the penton protein, and 66. 1 - 74. 0 % for the hexon protein with other Atadenovirus. The C. psittaci bacterial load {{was positively correlated with}} adenovirus viral load in the lung. Immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots, confirming active viral replication. No other viruses were found. This is the first documentation of an adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis. Viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. The role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals...|$|E
40|$|Background: Human {{psittacosis}} is {{a highly}} under diagnosed zoonotic disease, commonly linked to psittacine birds. Psittacosis in birds, also known as <b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis,</b> is endemic in poultry, but the risk for people living close to poultry farms is unknown. Therefore, our study aimed to explore the temporal and spatial patterns of human psittacosis infections and identify possible associations with poultry farming in the Netherlands. Methods: We analysed data on 700 human cases of psittacosis notified between 01 - 01 - 2000 and 01 - 09 - 2015. First, we studied the temporal behaviour of psittacosis notifications by applying wavelet analysis. Then, to identify possible spatial patterns, we applied spatial cluster analysis. Finally, we investigated the possible spatial association between psittacosis notifications and data on the Dutch poultry sector at municipality level using a multivariable model. Results: We found a large spatial cluster that covered a highly poultry-dense area but additional clusters were found in areas that had a low poultry density. There were marked geographical differences in the awareness of psittacosis and the amount {{and the type of}} laboratory diagnostics used for psittacosis, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the correlation between the large cluster and poultry density. The multivariable model showed that the presence of chicken processing plants and slaughter duck farms in a municipality was associated with a higher rate of human psittacosis notifications. The significance of the associations was influenced by the inclusion or exclusion of farm density in the model. Conclusions: Our temporal and spatial analyses showed weak associations between poultry-related variables and psittacosis notifications. Because of the low number of psittacosis notifications available for analysis, the power of our analysis was relative low. Because of the exploratory nature of this research, the associations found cannot be interpreted as evidence for airborne transmission of psittacosis from poultry to the general population. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the prevalence of C. psittaci in Dutch poultry. Also, efforts to promote PCR-based testing for C. psittaci and genotyping for source tracing are important to reduce the diagnostic deficit, and to provide better estimates of the human psittacosis burden, and the possible role of poultry...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydiaceae are {{a family}} of obligate {{intracellular}} Gram-negative bacteria causing disease in man and animals. C. abortus is a major abortigenic agent in ruminants, causing ovine enzootic abortion (OEA). C. psittaci causes respiratory disease (<b>avian</b> <b>chlamydiosis)</b> in birds and psittacosis or parrot-fever in man. In Chapter I, an overview is given of the epidemiology, prevention, treatment and zoonotic risk of Chlamydiaceae infections in Chinese livestock. Differences in risk-factors, such as bio-security measures, and use of diagnostic tests and veterinary practices applied in China are compared to the West. In Chapter II, we examined the occurrence of C. abortus in Belgian ruminants by serology and molecular diagnosis. Sampling herds at n ≥ 10 revealed a seropositive herd status in 14. 3 % (6 / 42), 50 % (1 / 2) and 11. 6 % (11 / 95) of sheep, goat and cattle herds, respectively. Seroprevalence in one goat herd was 52. 9 % (9 / 17), but prevalence in positive sheep and cattle herds was generally limited to only 1 or 2 seropositive animals on 10 to 20 tested animals per herd. Molecular diagnosis on rectal swabs sampled at 3 cattle farms tested all negative for Chlamydiaceae DNA. In Chapter III, part A, we examined the pathogenicity of the well characterized C. psittaci genotype B (CP 3) and D (92 / 1293) strains in experimentally (aerosol) infected SPF chickens. Both strains caused conjunctivitis, rhinitis and dyspnoea. Pharyngeal and cloacal C. psittaci excretion was observed in all infected animals, indicative for systemic dissemination as proven by immunofluorescence staining of frozen tissue sections. Histopathological lesions were present in all infected chickens. However, differences in pathology were observed as genotype D was more virulent than genotype B, creating mortality and more severe clinical signs and lesions. In Chapter III, part B, sera of 30 Belgian and 10 Northern French chicken farms were tested by a C. psittaci MOMP-based ELISA. Ninety-six percent, 93 % and 90 % of the Belgian broilers, broiler breeders and layers were seropositive. Ninety-one percent of the French broilers were seropositive. In addition, tissues of 5 Belgian and 5 French broiler farms were examined at slaughter. All French farms ware culture positive while C. psittaci was cultured from the lungs of 80 % of examined Belgian farms. Chlamydia psittaci infections are apparently emerging in chickens raised in Belgium and Northern France. We could proof Hill-Evans postulates for chicken-derived C. psittaci genotype B and D strains. In Chapter III, part C, we focused on the histopathological lesions caused in experimentally infected SPF chickens. SPF chickens were experimentally infected with C. psittaci strain 10 / 423 (genotype B), 10 / 525 (genotype B) or 10 / 298 (genotype D), which were all isolated from Belgian or French broilers with pneumonia. All strains induced conjunctivitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis, airosacculitis, splenitis, hepatitis, nephritis and enteritis. Inflammation of the ovaries was only observed in genotype D infected chickens. Overall, the genotype D strain caused more severe histopathological lesions and a high mortality rate (54. 5 %) early upon infection. In addition, severity of lesions increased more rapidly in genotype D as compared to genotype B infected birds, which suggests faster replication in internal organ...|$|E
