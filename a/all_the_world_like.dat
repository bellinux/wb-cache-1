500|$|Florida {{used both}} {{the run and}} the pass effectively, as Bethea [...] "looked for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> the famous Red Grange" [...] {{according}} to Associated Press (AP) staff writer Benton E.

500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while {{not a lot}} of people bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band.

It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> a Pixies song.|$|E
500|$|In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is {{introduced}} {{as the third}} and youngest child of wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister, the former Hand of the King, and Joanna Lannister, who dies giving birth to him. Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime {{is one of the}} Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly ("for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> a gargoyle"), malformed dwarf with different colored eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them. While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, he is treated as a [...] "second class noble" [...] because of his stature. Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because they blame him for her death. While Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, he nevertheless feels a sense of duty to his son, raising him in the Lannister fold and extending Tyrion a share of the family wealth. In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love. Lev Grossman of Time wrote in 2011: ...|$|E
