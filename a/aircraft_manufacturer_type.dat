40|$|Ditching is an {{aircraft}} emergency condition that ends with planned {{impact of the}} aircraft on water. The high forward velocity in fixed-wing aircraft ditching affects the aircraft dynamics and its structural response due to complex hydrodynamic effects. Therefore, analysis of ditching impact is particularly relevant to satisfy the airworthiness regulations for modern aircraft. Numerical methods for simulating ditching {{take advantage of the}} computational capacity allowing industry to deal with complex models representing the physical phenomena which play a role in ditching. The work performed within this field by means of explicit Finite Element (FE) analysis coupled with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented. The paper focuses on the analysis of forces acting on the aircraft during ditching: hydrodynamic forces (overpressure and suction forces on the fuselage) and aerodynamic forces. Hydrodynamic loads are the most important forces acting on aircraft during the impact phase because they may affect the airplane’s structural integrity. The numerical models proposed take into account all these aspects to provide a suitable design tool for <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Two <b>types</b> of <b>aircraft</b> configurations are presented: a military configuration according to the Airbus Military CN 235 aircraft and a civil transport aircraft based on a generic standard body transport aircraft model by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) ...|$|R

40|$|Capacity {{decisions}} {{are among the}} most important operations decisions for companies. One of the potential outcomes of bad decisions is a resulting overcapacity. Although some textbooks treat overcapacity as an issue for individual companies, there are indications that it may be an industry wide issue. This paper describes the global regional aircraft industry, comparing the demand and available production capacity. A small number of companies is active in this industry and a larger number of companies are starting or planning to start production. Under these conditions, the probability of overcapacity is high. The analysis shows that a number of structural factors exist that cause individual regional jet manufacturers to make capacity decisions that are not beneficial for the industry as a whole. Overall, in this type of industry, once the decision has been made to offer a new <b>aircraft</b> <b>type,</b> <b>manufacturers</b> do not have many options to prevent overcapacity situations...|$|R
