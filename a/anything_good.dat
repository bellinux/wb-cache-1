500|$|Albini used unusual {{recording}} techniques. For Kim Deal's backing vocals in [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] and her lead vocals on [...] "Gigantic", Albini {{moved the}} studio equipment and recorded {{in a studio}} bathroom to achieve real, rather than studio, echo; according to John Murphy, Deal's husband at the time, [...] "Albini didn't like the studio sound." [...] Albini later said that the record could have been completed in a week, but [...] "we ended up trying more experimental stuff basically to kill time and see if <b>anything</b> <b>good</b> materialized." [...] An example was [...] "Something Against You", where Albini filtered Black Francis' voice through a guitar amp for [...] "a totally ragged, vicious texture." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, {{an all-out}} attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later {{they played a}} longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship. Understanding Janowski's style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski {{unleashed}} his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss). This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses). Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, [...] "Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he thinks. I am afraid I will not do <b>anything</b> <b>good</b> in this match." ...|$|E
500|$|Rick Kogan, {{television}} critic {{with the}} Chicago Tribune, called the show [...] "wholly original" [...] and {{an example of}} how good television entertainment can be. He praised the ensemble cast and interesting characters, and said the show would be renewed [...] "if there's any justice in TV". Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with. In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become as rare as quality itself. [...] " [...] Steven Cole Smith with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said of the evaluation period during Homicides second season: [...] "If you don't watch it, you may lose your right to complain that there's never <b>anything</b> <b>good</b> on TV." [...] He called it [...] "a gritty, atmospheric police series" [...] and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but the consequences of it.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} {{minutes of the}} drama, {{reactions}} on Twitter were mixed. Nicole Golden from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 stars out of 5.0. She found that [...] "overall, the concept worked since music really has always played {{a big part in}} the show. Some songs were more appropriate and/or better performed than others, though." [...] She also wrote the concept worked in part because it was new but noted [...] "the format would probably not have the same effect if used in future episodes." [...] Even though Boston Heralds critic Mark Perigard was not a fan of the concept, saying [...] "the Grey's Anatomy event proved how tricky it is for an established show, especially a drama, to pull off a musical episode," [...] he did like several actors's performances. He wrote: [...] "Chandra Wilson and Chyler Leigh (whom I never have <b>anything</b> <b>good</b> to say about) delivered some impressive vocal work. Eric Dane did some of his best acting of his career last night as an anxious father-to-be terrified he would lose his best friend."

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{taught in}} the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that all the favors that the wicked do for the righteous are in fact evil for the righteous. For in [...] God told Laban, [...] "Take heed to {{yourself}} that you speak not to Jacob either good or evil." [...] Rabbi Johanan observed that one can understand why God would direct Laban not to speak evil to Jacob, but asked why God would direct him not to say <b>anything</b> <b>good.</b> From here Rabbi Johanan inferred that even if Laban had tried to speak good to Jacob, it would have resulted in bad for Jacob.–b1.

When the two met, Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?" [...] He also asked for his stolen teraphim back. Knowing nothing about Rachel's theft, Jacob told Laban that whoever stole them should die and stood aside to let him search. When Laban reached Rachel's tent, she hid the teraphim by sitting on them and stating she could not get up because she was menstruating. Jacob and Laban then parted from {{each other with a}} pact to preserve the peace between them. Laban returned to his home and Jacob continued on his way.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the retreat}} to France, Durutte led his troops in a clash at Freyburg on 21 October. He fought at the Battle of Hanau on 30 and 31 October under Marshal Auguste Marmont's command. In 1814 {{he was given}} command of the {{fortress}} of Metz which resisted a blockade {{until the end of}} the war. At one point, Napoleon heard a rumor that Metz had fallen. He asked an aide-de-camp who commanded the garrison. When told it was Durutte, he replied, [...] "I have never done <b>anything</b> <b>good</b> for that man. Metz is still ours." [...] (Napoleon was becoming convinced that generals on whom he had showered favors were not performing well, while those who had yet to prove themselves could be counted on.) Upon the return of King Louis XVIII, Durutte recognized the new sovereign and was given command of the 3rd Division and made a Chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis on 27 June. He was made a Grand Officer of the Légion d'Honneur on 23 August and received a gold sword from the mayor of Metz.|$|E

[...] The website for Jews for Judaism claims that [...] "Since a Nazarene is a resident of the city of Nazareth and this city did not exist during the time period of the Jewish Bible, it is impossible to find this quotation in the Hebrew Scriptures. It was fabricated." [...] However, one common suggestion is that the New Testament verse is based on a passage relating to Nazirites, either because this was a misunderstanding common at the time, or through deliberate re-reading of the term by the early Christians. Another suggestion is [...] "that Matthew was playing on the similarity of the Hebrew word nezer (translated 'Branch' or 'shoot' in [...] and [...] ) with the Greek nazoraios, here translated 'Nazarene.'" [...] Christians also suggest that by using an indirect quotation and the plural term prophets, [...] "Matthew was only saying that by living in Nazareth, Jesus was fulfilling the many Old Testament prophecies that He would be despised and rejected."
