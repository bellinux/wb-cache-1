According to Stefan Dušan's charter to Arhiljevica dated 10 August 1354, sevastokrator Dejan, whom he called his brother ("брат царства ми севастократор Дејан"), possessed a large province east of Skopska Crna Gora. It included the old župe (counties) of Žegligovo and Preševo (modern Kumanovo region with Sredorek, Kozjačija and the larger part of Pčinja). The granted villages included: village Podlešane with hamlets, village Arhiljevica at the church with hamlets, village Izvor, village Ruginci (Ruǵince), selište (arable land) Mokra Poljana (Mokro Polje), village Maistorije, selište Maistorije Krupnici, selište Prusci (Rusce), selište Vrdun, selište Prvevo, selište Deikovo (Dejlovce), selište Vrače (Vračevce), selište Sedlar, selište Mekša <b>and</b> <b>village</b> Glaže (Glažnja). A total of 9 villages, 9 selište and a few hamlets. Based on the charter, Arhiljevica was situated where the granted villages of Podlešane, Izvor and Rućinci lay, on the slopes of Jezer (Kumanovska Crna Gora). The fact that Dejan built Arhiljevica rather than renovated it is evidence of his economic strength. Apart from Dejan's granted villages, Dušan also granted, on his behalf as a gift, the church <b>and</b> <b>village</b> of Gospoždino Polje (lost), village Koznica Kričanovska (Gorna- and Dolna Koznitsa) <b>and</b> <b>village</b> Strojkovo (lost), situated in the Velbužd region.|$|E
