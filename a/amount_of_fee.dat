60|$|The {{matter of}} fees is important, {{far beyond the}} mere {{question}} of bread and butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to both lawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a general rule never take your whole fee in advance, nor {{any more than a}} small retainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a common mortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was still in prospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack interest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the performance. Settle the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> and take a note in advance. Then you will feel that you are working for something, and you are sure to do your work faithfully and well. Never sell a fee note--at least not before the consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence and dishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail.|$|E

50|$|De Leon {{introduced}} AB 1405, a {{bill that}} it very similar to SB 535. It was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2010, because the Governor stated that “funds {{have yet to be}} realized by AB 32.” SB 535 was introduced by Senator De Leon on February 17, 2011. After the bill’s introduction, an analysis that addressed some concerns was posted on April 29, 2011. Initially, opponents of the bill were concerned with the fact that “a regulatory fee must have a nexus between fee payers, the fee amount and the revenue use.” SB 535 does not meet this standard “because the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> revenue is arbitrary (10% of the total amount raised), the purposes in SB 535 are unrelated to harm caused by the payers, and there is no demonstrated connection between the proposed recipients and harm caused by the payers of the revenues.” Other opponents noted {{that it was impossible to}} know how much money was necessary to meet the requirements of AB 32 of reducing emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2020. If SB 535 was passed, it might be detracting from the original goals of AB 32. After three Committee readings, the bill was passed on to the Assembly on June 2, 2011. After three Assembly readings and amendments, it was passed on to the California Senate. The Senate floor voted on the bill on August 31, 2012. The bill passed with 25 people voting “yes,” 14 voting “no,” and 1 person abstaining. On September 30, 2012 Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill and passed it into law.|$|E

40|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> {{income earned}} by the banking sector {{suggests}} that the significance of payment services has been understated or overlooked. This paper attempts to develop {{a clearer picture of}} the importance of payment services to the industry by delineating the payments area broadly and by analyzing data disclosed in bank holding company annual reports on sources of noninterest income. We find that payment services bring in from one-third to two-fifths of the combined operating revenue of the twenty-five largest bank holding companies. This contribution to revenue is considerably larger than commonly appreciated and indicates that the production and distribution of payment services is one of the core activities of commercial banks. The greater-than-expected importance of payment services has several implications for the identification and measurement of the banking sector’s output and for theories of the fundamental nature of commercial banking...|$|E

In effort to improve the program 2 ̆ 7 s performance, recently the government introduced new concept for the distribution of raskin. By this new concept, the distribution of raskin would be through rural kiosks, not through village-level government network as used to be. Before institutionalized as an alternative for the conventional one, the new concept was tested in some pilot projects located in several provinces, including in West Java Province. Based on the field work in this province, this study concluded that the new concept could improve the program 2 ̆ 7 s performances, especially with regard to quantity and price correctness. It was also found that villagers and local government apparatuses were in support for its implementation. However, it is necessary for the government to monitor and evaluate its implementation on a regular base and to develop a system of governance at village level to assure its good performance.

40|$|Road {{infrastructure}} has {{a remarkable}} {{economic and social}} impact on society. This is why road financing has always drawn the attention of policymakers, especially when resources available for government spending become scarce. Nations exhibit differing approaches to dealing with road transportation financing. In the United States, {{the current system of}} road funding has been called into question because some regard it as insufficient to meet the amounts now required for road expenditures. By contrast, in most European countries, road charges are very high, but these revenues are not allocated for the funding of roads. This paper analyzes the balance between charging for the use of and expenditure on the road sector in the United States and compares the American policy with those of several European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Switzerland). To that end, a methodology is defined to calculate the annual <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> charges levied on light and heavy vehicles in the selected countries in order to compare those charges with annual road expenditures. The results show that road charges in America are noticeably lower than those paid in Europe. Additionally, the research concludes that in Europe, road-generated revenues exceed road expenditures in all the countries studied, so road charges actually subsidize other policies. By contrast, in the United States, the public sector subsidizes the road system {{in order to maintain the}} current level of expenditure...|$|E

Many researchers have made an attempt {{to examine the effects of}} rising fee on students'enrollment behavior. However, there is no systematic analysis of the causes of fee increase, and the causal relations between the fee rising and the expansion of higher education. This paper will focus on the following four points: (1) the history of university fees, (2) the present situation of tuition fees, (3) the mechanism responsible for the fee rising, (4) the relation between the rising of fees and the higher education expansion. The findings of this article are as follows: (1) The transformation of fee system is not from free-fee one to high-fee one directly, but through several transitive phases in which various fee policies were experimented by the central government. (2) The present standard of tuition fee is very high. Fee average is up to 5000 yuan every year. And the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> collected by different institutions varies greatly according to university and department's prestige. (3) Each institution of higher education played an important role in the process of fee rising. The central government changed the fee policies, which gave each institution an arbitrary power to decide its fee level and how to spend it partly. (4) Consequently, the fee rising in public universities gave an incentive to every institution and directly promoted the expansion of the higher education...|$|E
