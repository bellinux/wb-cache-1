5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats {{the other three}} suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E

[...] In October 2006, when asked, [...] "Would you continue state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges?", she answered: [...] "Yes. I would like to see Alaska's infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later. The window is now - while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist."

And that causes us to look at our infrastructure,” said Jackson. “A lot of big projects <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> again, and it kind of suggests a Moses era without Moses," [...] he added. Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate transportation needs, New York governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography of Moses written today might be called At Least He Got It Built: [...] "That's what we need today.

2500|$|In the {{standard}} Set game, the dealer lays out {{cards on the}} table until either twelve are laid down or someone sees a set and calls [...] "Set!". The player who called [...] "Set" [...] takes the cards in the set, and the dealer continues to deal out cards until twelve <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> A player who sees a set among the twelve cards calls [...] "Set" [...] and takes the three cards, and the dealer lays three more {{cards on the table}}. (To call out [...] "set" [...] and not pick one up quickly enough results in a penalty.) It is possible that there is no set among the twelve cards; in this case, the dealer deals out three more cards to make fifteen dealt cards, or eighteen or more, as necessary. This process of dealing by threes and finding sets continues until the deck is exhausted and there are no more sets on the table. At this point, whoever has collected the most sets wins.|$|E
