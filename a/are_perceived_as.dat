5|$|In Dark Matters, a 2007 {{exhibition}} at the James Harris Gallery in Seattle, Washington, Johnson is said to mimic Édouard Manet's Olympia in a work called White Girls and Sam Gilliam and Richard Tuttle in his skyspace backdrops that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> sweeping perfection.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] <b>is</b> sometimes <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> both sweet and salty. It <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated sodium-ion receptor.|$|R
25|$|In addition, male {{speakers}} who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> gay exhibited greater breathiness and hyperarticulation of stressed syllables {{than male}} speakers who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> heterosexual.

50|$|Life circumstances, though posing no {{immediate}} physical danger, could <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a threat. Anything {{that could change}} the continuing of the person’s life as they are currently experiencing it could <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a threat.|$|R
5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{facets of}} Minnesota culture that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the area's early history in fact {{originated}} after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration {{for which the}} state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, {{the first half of}} the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, and to some degree, lawlessness.|$|E
5|$|Since forces <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> pushes or pulls, {{this can}} provide an {{intuitive}} understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|Sign-oriented {{analyses}} {{present an}} aspectual contrast, {{in which the}} approach {{is based on the}} boundaries of predication within a time-field.

50|$|Low {{culture can}} be formulaic, {{employing}} trope conventions, stock characters and character archetypes {{in a manner}} that can <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> more simplistic, crude, emotive, unbalanced, or blunt compared to high culture's implementations - which may <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> more subtle, balanced, or refined and open for interpretations.|$|R
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E
25|$|When {{workplace}} processes <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> fair, {{the benefits}} to an organization can be high. In such environments, employees {{are more likely to}} comply with policies even if their personal outcome is less than optimal. When workplace policies <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> unfair, risks for retaliation and related behaviors such as sabotage and workplace violence can increase.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the Gestalt {{principle}} of good continuation (see: principles of grouping), sound that changes smoothly or remain constant are often {{produced by the}} same source. Sound with the same frequency, even when interrupted by other noise, <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> continuous. Highly variable sound that <b>is</b> interrupted <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> separate.|$|R

50|$|The second {{experiment}} {{tested the}} watercolor effect versus good continuation. In good continuation, the smooth continuation areas {{tend to be}} grouped together. With different variations of a square-wave pattern and basic contours with fringes, the good continuation of the stimuli was studied. It was determined that the uniform watercolor illusion is seen in only closed space. The third experiment studied the watercolor illusion stimulus against the idea of closure and surroundness. According to the closure principle, piece creating a closed figure are grouped together. When one region encompasses another region completely, the surrounding region <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> ground, and the feature that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> figure according to the surroundness principle. When the four purple rectangles were surrounded by a larger rectangle, the large rectangle <b>was</b> rarely <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> figure while the four rectangles were seen as figures. When orange contours bordered {{the inside of the}} large rectangle, but outside the four smaller rectangles, the larger rectangle <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> figure while the small rectangles <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> holes. This showed that the closure and surroundness were weaker than the watercolor illusion.|$|R

50|$|People {{are usually}} more careful than outside work {{in how they}} behave around their colleagues, as many actions {{intended}} to be in jest can <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> inappropriate or even harassment in the work environment.

50|$|The {{conclusion}} of the study illustrates that thicker fabrics, such as Melton, showed higher ∆f than thinner ones. Thinner fabrics, such as tropical wool, which are resistant to shearing showed the lowest values for loudness and the highest for ∆L. Most wool <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> loud but tropical wool, however, <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> clear and pleasant.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{assessing}} {{the impacts of}} information communication technologies (ICTs) on tourism businesses, this study adopted a case study blueprint, with a questionnaire survey being used to collect data from selected tourism businesses. The respondents rated ICT impacts on tourism on a 5 - point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The {{results show that the}} impacts on hotels <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> ranging from 4. 07 (improved company image) to 4. 92 (increased market share), whereas the impacts on bed and breakfast establishments <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> ranging from 3. 88 (improved company image) to 4. 86 (speeded up service). The impacts on travel agents <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> ranging from 4. 48 (improved service quality) to 4. 94 (improved service quality), whereas the impacts on tour guides <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> ranging from 4. 58 (improved company image) to 4. 81 (heightened customer satisfaction levels). The impacts on backpackers <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> ranging from 3. 78 (improved company image) to 4. 75 (increased market share). Since ICT <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to impact relatively little on company image improvement, tourism businesses should use such technology to improve company image. The uniqueness of this article lies in it revealing the impacts of ICT on tourism business from an African country perspective...|$|R
