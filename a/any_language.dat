5|$|The Egyptian {{language}} is a northern Afro-Asiatic language {{closely related to the}} Berber and Semitic languages. It has the second longest known history of <b>any</b> <b>language</b> (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.|$|E

5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to <b>any</b> <b>language</b> in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible in practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning the use of <b>any</b> <b>language</b> other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling {{for the elimination of}} the indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl testimony and documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam had {{the widest}} release of any Indian film {{up to that}} time, and patrons often queued all day for tickets. Released on 5 August 1960, it broke box office records in India and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, a {{distinction}} it held for 15 years. By some accounts, Mughal-e-Azam was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, adjusted for inflation. The accolades awarded to the film include one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards at the 8th Filmfare Awards. Mughal-e-Azam was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured, and the first in <b>any</b> <b>language</b> {{to be given a}} theatrical re-release. The colour version, released in November 2004, was a commercial success.|$|E

5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn <b>any</b> <b>language,</b> they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and {{its status as a}} superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than <b>any</b> <b>language</b> has ever been.|$|E
