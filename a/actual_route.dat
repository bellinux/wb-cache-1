25|$|The route was {{originally}} intended to replace the old A6, which it does along the northern section starting with the Preston Bypass. However, a much closer approximation to the overall <b>actual</b> <b>route</b> of the M6 (heading north from its southern terminus) is provided by following the A45, A34, A50, A49, then the A6. South of Preston, the A6 route is instead supplemented by the M61 as far as Manchester, with the M60 acting as a bypass around the city. South of Manchester, there is no true motorway replacement for the old road. The M1 acts as a bypass for long-distance traffic in the south, from the Kegworth junction near Nottingham, to Luton and St. Albans near London; but, {{it is not an}} alternative for local traffic as the routes diverge by more than 15miles while passing through Northamptonshire. Across the Pennines, the old road remains the main local through-route, and long-distance fast traffic between Derby and Manchester must instead take either the A50 and M6, or M1 and M62.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Current {{methods of}} {{assessing}} routes taken during active transport rely on subjective recall of trip length and barriers encountered enroute or {{the utilization of}} objective measures Geographic Information Systems [GIS]) that may not represent actual travel patterns. This study examined the utility of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to measure <b>actual</b> <b>routes</b> taken compared with GIS-estimated travel distance and barriers encountered. Methods: Comparisons between GPS and GIS routes were performed for 59 of 75 children who wore a GPS during the journey to school on a single occasion. Home and school addresses were reported by parents and geocoded in GIS. Children were provided with a GPS and were instructed to travel their normal route {{to and from school}}. Data were collected between March and November 2005 and exported to the GIS to determine travel distance, number of busy streets crossed, and the ratio of busy streets to the total streets traveled on. Data analysis was performed in August 2006. Results: No differences were observed between GPS- easured journeys to and from school on anyof the examined variables. No differences were observed between GIS and GPS measures of travel distance (p 0. 05). GIS-estimated travel routes crossed a significantly (p 0. 05) higher number of busy streets (GIS: 1. 680. 12 vs GPS: 1. 190. 11) and traveled on a higher ratio of busy streets to total streets traveled on (GIS: 0. 460. 03 vs GPS: 0. 350. 04) (p 0. 05) compared with GPS-measured <b>actual</b> travel <b>routes.</b> Conclusions: Geographic Information Systems provides estimates of travel distance similar to GPS measured actual travel distances. Travel routes estimated by GIS are not representative of <b>actual</b> <b>routes</b> measured by GPS, which indicates that GIS may not provide an accurate estimate of barriers encountered.

40|$|Rolling {{resistance}} and tread wear of tires do particularly influence the maintenance costs of commercial vehicles. Although tire labeling is established in Europe, it is meanwhile well-known that, {{due to the}} respective test procedures, these labels do not hold in realistic application scenarios in the field. This circumstance arises from the development phase of tires, where the respective performance properties are mainly evaluated in tire/wheel standalone scenarios in which {{the wide range of}} usage variability of commercial vehicles cannot be considered adequately. Within this article we address a method to predict indicators for rolling {{resistance and}} tread wear of tires in realistic application scenarios considering application-based factors of influence like specific customers, operation circumstances, regional dependencies, fleet specific characteristics etc. Moreover, the prescribed methodology may also be transferred to the prediction of fuel consumption and pollutant emission. The basic framework of the overall procedure is based on a geo-referenced description of the world. This framework is realized in the software tool VMC® (Virtual Measurement Campaign) which allows a systematic analysis of the usage variability of commercial vehicles in the sense mentioned above. The basic idea for predicting rolling resistance and tread wear of tires is the decomposition of <b>actual</b> <b>routes</b> into a suitable set of load cases depending on curvature radius, longitudinal slope and velocity. The respective tire energy losses are computed for all load cases - by means of a simulation model of the vehicle equipped with a CDTire/ 3 D tire model - and are finally stored in a result catalogue. In order to predict the tire energy loss for a realistic application scenario one partitions <b>actual</b> <b>routes</b> into the predefined load cases and superposes the total energy loss from the result catalogue...|$|R
