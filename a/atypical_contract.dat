40|$|This paper {{studies the}} gender gap in {{re-employment}} probabilities of young Italian people aged 15 - 34 by using the 1985 - 2004 WHIP data. We estimate the hazard rates {{of the young people}} by contract type, i. e. permanent and <b>atypical</b> <b>contract.</b> Then, we decompose the overall gender gap and, within gender, across some of the most relevant sources of the Italian labour market segmentation. We isolate the components due to gender differences in individual characteristics and/or productivity and to remunerations of similar characteristics and/or discrimination. We find that young women are penalized in terms of re-employment perspectives with permanent contracts, especially those living in the South of Italy...|$|E

We find that this 20 year period decades were characterized {{by an increase in}} youth employment, especially since the mid- 1990 s. Nonetheless, the employment opportunities offered to disadvantaged workers were primarily atypical and therefore did not imply a stable and permanent increase in the bulk of youth employment. In addition, although the increase in re-employment probabilities by <b>atypical</b> <b>contract</b> would be largely explainable by flexibility policies, the evolution of re-employment probabilities by permanent and fixed-term contracts would be a consequence of competing causes, including a selection of higher productive workers...|$|E

40|$|To combat unemployment, in the 1980 s most European {{countries}} {{began to}} de-regulate labour markets. In 1984, <b>atypical</b> <b>contracts</b> {{were introduced in}} Italy and Spain. Although the Italian and Spanish economies are widely comparable, and the labour market reforms introduced in the mid- 1980 s appear similar, the consequences of these reforms have been very different. The unprecedented growth of temporary contracts {{in the last ten}} years in Spain has given rise to an extensive theoretical and empirical literature. In Italy, however, the utilisation of <b>atypical</b> <b>contracts</b> has remained limited and much less investigated. This paper has two goals. First it analyses the characteristics of fixed-term contracts in Italy and Spain. Then it investigates the causes that made the Italian and Spanish experience with these contracts so different...|$|R

40|$|The Treu Law {{introduced}} temporary {{contracts and}} extended {{the applicability of}} fixed-term contracts {{in order to increase}} the flexibility of the labour market and to reduce unemployment. The paper inquires whether the reform has affected the duration dependence related to the out-flow from non-employment, how previous <b>atypical</b> <b>contract</b> experiences affect the probability of finding a stable job and if the probability of flowing toward a permanent contract is higher moving from a non-working state rather than from an atypical job. Applying a Mixed Proportional Hazard (MPH) model with competing risk to a sub-sample drawn from the WHIP dataset, I estimate the hazard rate for the state transitions. My main findings predict an increase in negative duration dependence for non-working state out-flow, meaning an amplification of the short-term unemployed - long-term unemployed duality. It is a consequence of the larger use of atypical contracts, that would provide a screening instrument for the hiring choices of firms. Previous atypical job experiences play a negative effect on the probability of moving toward a stable job if the origin state is a non-working condition, while they have a positive role in the transition toward an atypical job. Besides, there is no evidences that the probability of finding a permanent contract is higher for workers who move from an <b>atypical</b> <b>contract</b> rather from a non-working state. Finally, a human capital accumulation effect is found to explain the transition toward a stable job. Policy recommendations include promotion of longer contracts, implementation of training programs and services to facilitate job-search. ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} old and new social risks in Korean social policy, in {{relation}} to the National Pension Scheme (NPS). It provides a comprehensive overview of the Korean pension structure and the emergence of new social risk groups. Based on the Korean Labour and Income Panel Study undertaken over eleven years and using bivariate and multivariate analysis, this thesis examines the effectiveness of the NPS and its reforms in protecting new social risk groups. The analytical framework of this thesis is based on the New Social Risk theory. Its limitation in explaining developing welfare states like Korea is also highlighted. Over the past two decades, the NPS has undergone dramatic financial cuts as its coverage expands rapidly. Given Korea’s aging population, the reliance on such public schemes will further increase, which will have a profound impact particularly, on those with low income. Societal and economic changes in the Korean society, as a result of de-industrialisation, have given rise to new social risks groups that differ from those that predominate in the post-war welfare era. These new groups are vulnerable because they cannot afford to contribute to their pension even during their working life with the likelihood that they will have little or no benefit from the NPS when they retire. They tend to be the <b>atypical</b> <b>contract</b> holders and workers of small-scale enterprises without unions. Contrary to expectation, women with care responsibility and young workers are less vulnerable...|$|E
40|$|The leasing housing {{contract}} {{intended for}} family dwelling purposes was enforced in Colombia {{for nearly a}} decade, being quite useful for developing the country economy, in particular {{for the purchase of}} home. Despite the usefulness when executing it, several conflicts have arisen, reason why it is mandatory to build a legal regulation harmonized with its philosophy, such as “Creating new long and medium-term home financing mechanisms in Colombia”. All the foregoing in order to give a wide development to the postulate set forth in article 51 of the Political Constitution of 1991 that ensures the right to access to a decent housing. Since the legal regulation of housing leasing intended to family dwelling has been scarce and keeping in mind its atypical nature, it is required to identify what are the liabilities that arise to the contracting parties, in particular to the lessee, taking into account that between him and the good given in leasing there is a tenure relation. The leasing housing contract intended for family dwelling purposes besides of being an <b>atypical</b> <b>contract</b> is also a finance nature contract for which reason the entities authorized to enter into such type of transactions impose to the lessee several clauses that might be unrelated to the holder quality of the lessee; and thus, {{could turn out to be}} abusive in the light of the Political Constitution, the law and the doctrine regarding to the protection to the consumer. In conformity with the above mentioned reality, both the legislator and the Constitutional Court have set forth the guidelines to implement the mechanisms that seek for the protection of the lessee, bearing in mind that the subject matter of the housing leasing contract intended to family dwelling falls on a human right. Therefore, it is helpful to identify which are the liabilities of the lessee that are not related to his quality as holder in order to be able to assess them and conclude that they are in conflict with the protection policies provided to the lessee...|$|E
40|$|In {{last two}} decades, {{countries}} characterized by {{high levels of}} employment protection legislation (EPL) have introduced flexibility policies, {{in order to reduce}} elevated and persistent unemployment rates. European policy makers implemented reforms "at the margin", allowing for reduced protection only for some new contractual forms (called <b>atypical</b> <b>contracts),</b> characterized by lower firing costs. In Italy the first reform "at the margin" was implemented with the introduction of the Treu Law (L. 196 / 97), which introduced temporary contracts and made fixed-term contracts more widely allowed, {{in order to make the}} labour market more dynamic and to decrease the unemployment rate. To best of my knowledge, my thesis represents the first attempt to evaluate the effects of the Treu Reform on the Italian labour market. It is constituted by three chapters. The first of them consists in a survey in which I present a summary of framework approaches to analyse these policies and the more important implication of them for the labour market. Theoretical studies predict and the empirical studies show that the reforms affected various dimensions of the labour markets. In general, flexibility policies seem to fail their main aims. Effects were unclear with respect to unemployment rate, they were substantially negative on career development, and an increased duality arose in terms of wage and probability of leaving unemployment. The second and third chapters consist of two empirical frameworks that analyse some effects of the larger use of <b>atypical</b> <b>contracts</b> on various dimensions of the labour market. Both papers use micro-data for young individuals drawn from WHIP (Work Histories Italian Panel, Laboratorio R. Revelli) dataset.

As a general conclusion the authors argue that the labor market in Germany has always been segmented, but the dividing line between the primary segment of the employment system – the core – and the secondary segment – the margin – has been redefined over time.|$|R

By contrast, we find no evidence of a productivity effect of regulations concerning temporary contracts, which suggests that partial reforms, facilitating the use of fixed-term and <b>atypical</b> <b>contracts,</b> are unlikely to have an important impact on efficiency and technological change and cannot therefore be a substitute for comprehensive reforms whereby dismissal restrictions for open-ended contracts are also weakened.

Similar results have been found for Italy (Gagliarducci 2005).

To test this chain of reasoning, I identify the strategy of pharmaceutical firms in Germany, Italy, and the UK. Contrary to the expectations of the literature, I find that the firms in each economy pursue the same strategy variety. Seeking to understand how deviant firms can compete despite comparative institutional disadvantages, I analyse the importance of diverse labour-market institutions for the provision of particular skill types which, in turn, are needed for these strategies.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the applicability of}} the theory of equalizing differences (Rosen, 1986) in a market in which temporary and permanent workers co-exist. The assumption of perfect competition in the labour market is directly questioned and a model is developed in which the labour market is described as a duopsony and the relation between wage and non-monetary job characteristics is studied for workers with different contract lengths. The empirical analysis, based on several waves of the UK Labour Force Data, confirms several of the hypotheses suggested by the model and emphasizes how in the short run workers who have experienced a change in their employer can expect a career trajectory in line with the theory on compensating differentials. In particular, while the wage dynamic related to workers shifting from a temporary contract to another temporary position cannot be exactly predicted, shifts from temporary to permanent contracts tend to be linked to a reduction in wages and a simultaneous increase in travel-to-work distance. Nonetheless, when unobserved characteristics are accounted for in the selection process into temporary contracts, these results lose significance and only a positive relation between wage and commuting time persists, irrespective of the type of <b>contract.</b> <b>Atypical</b> <b>contracts,</b> oligopsony, compensating differentials, commuting time...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the world of work show, in {{comparison}} with the past, a larger use of outsourcing, a higher staff turnover and new <b>atypical</b> <b>contracts</b> (Koukoulaki, 2010). This introduces new issues in H&S management. In the past, the concept of job was mainly related to a specific and well-defined set of tasks. Nowadays, instead, it is increasingly linked to a variability of activities and work typologies carried out in collaboration, by personnel of different enterprises. Often, people involved in the activities work {{on the basis of a}} plurality of formal and informal agreements. Universities represent an example of this scenario, being workplaces characterized by high variability of activities involving a multiplicity of different subjects. Universities, hence, can be considered as a point of reference for defining prototypal models of H&S management, capable to cope with the change of the world of work. In this paper, the authors illustrate the approach developed and adopted by the University of Udine (Italy) to facilitate H&S management. The approach is based on the concept of "profile of activities" and the use of an ICT-based management tool. The tool, named GESSICA, allows us to monitor and manage the high variability of activities, thanks to effective and fluent procedures. The paper illustrates the approach and the tool as well as the results obtained after two years of testing. In the work, the authors highlight the aspects that can be assumed as reference point for implementing H&S management systems in other sectors characterized by high variability of activities and a multiplicity of types of employment contracts. © Copyright 2016, AIDIC Servizi S. r. l...|$|R

However, this case law increases instability in the status of civil servants, while ignoring their specific characteristics and validating a reduction in the level of national legal protection of public sector employment.

40|$|Employment in {{the call}} centre {{sector in the}} Netherlands, similar to the trend in other European countries, is {{expanding}} greatly. In 2001, Datamonitor (2002) estimated that 1, 266 call centres were operating in the Netherlands. This number {{is expected to have}} risen to roughly 2, 000 in 2006. An estimated 188, 000 people work in this sector at the moment, representing 2. 5 % of the entire working population in the Netherlands. This represents the highest percentage in Europe with the exception of Ireland. The call centre workforce is employed by in-house and subcontractor call centres. In-house call centres are part of the firm for which they handle customer contacts, whereas subcontractor call centres, which provide customer contact services for other firms or institutions. The call centre sector features a large number of employees working in so-called <b>atypical</b> employment <b>contracts,</b> in particular ‘agents’ who handle the actual customer contacts (De Grip, Hoevenberg & Willems, 1997). Agents are often hired into temporary appointments, part-time contracts, irregular shifts, stand-by contracts, et cetera. The use of such <b>atypical</b> <b>contracts</b> is closely related to the great need for flexibility in the deployment of staff (Kalleberg, 2000). Such workforce flexibility is necessary in order to negotiate peaks and valleys in call volumes. In addition, many call centres prioritize on cost reduction, and this approach constrains investment in personnel. Call centres are therefore often classified as ‘electronic sweatshops’ offering only ‘dead-end jobs’ (Taylor, et al., 2002; Deery & Kinnie, 2004). The labour market for call centre agents could thus be characterised as a ‘secondary labour market’ of insecure, poorly paid jobs without any career opportunities (see e. g. Dekker, De Grip & Heijke, 2002). However, the call centre sector is heterogeneous with respect to employment conditions. For example, agents who work in in-house call centres have better employment conditions than their counterparts in subcontractor call centres. The Dutch industrial relations system offers one explanation for this difference. Agents working in in-house call centres have protections defined by the collective labour agreement (CLA) of the firm the call centre agents work in. In contrast, the subcontractor call centres did not have any comparable protections or their own CLA until 2003. The establishment of a CLA that covers agents employed in Dutch subcontractor call centres in 2003 is a unique phenomenon in the European call centre market (Roland, 2000 b). The difference in working conditions between in-house and subcontractor call centres raises the following research question addressed in this paper: To what extent is the labour market for call centre agents a dual labour market, with a secondary segment in the subcontractor call centres, and a primary segment {{in the form of a}} ‘professional labour market’ in the in-house call centres?To answer this question, we analyze survey data collected from a national survey of call centre managers in the Netherlands. Moreover, we investigate whether the aforementioned need for workforce flexibility may provide an explanation for the labour market segmentation in the call centre sector and if this segmentation is embedded in Dutch industrial relations. We begin with a brief overview of labour market segmentation theory. Next, we describe the dataset, and provide some brief background about the Dutch call centre sector and its workforce. Then, we investigate the differences between employment conditions in in-house and subcontractor call centres, to determine whether there is a segmented labour markets. Finally, we assess the influence of industrial relations in the call centre sector, and determine whether these reflect the labour market segmentation. education, training and the labour market;...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{it could}} be shown that {{employees}} can minimize the significant impact of individual determinants and endogenous causalities on employment careers (Blossfeld 1986; Hillmert et al. 2004) {{by taking advantage of}} good opportunity structures and framework conditions. Therefore firm characteristics and region-specific factors as well as economic conditions {{play an important role in}} career mobility patterns. This finding gains further significance particularly in light of the following three developments: First, in recent years, market volatility due to processes of economic globalization and transnationalization has been leading to ever shortening economic cycles. Second and related to this, human resource policy has changed particularly through an increased use of <b>atypical</b> employment <b>contracts.</b> Third, several political initiatives, such as the European initiative for regional development and the promotion of metropolitan regions as well as the German initiative to shift decision-making powers from the central government to local and regional units, have increased the significance of regional structures for growth and employment (Blien et al. 2001). Future research on employment careers will need to examine both structural and cyclical effects in more detail.|$|R
40|$|In many countries, Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) {{establishes}} different {{regulations for}} certain groups {{of workers who}} face more disadvantages {{in the labor market}} (young workers, women, unskilled workers, etc.) with the aim of improving their employability. Well known examples are the introduction of <b>atypical</b> employment <b>contracts</b> (e. g., temporary and determined duration contracts) which ease firing restrictions for some, but not all, workers. This paper discusses the effects of EPL varying among workers of different skills on the level and composition of unemployment, job flows, productivity and welfare. By using an extension of Mortensen Pissarides' (1994) search model where heterogeneous workers compete for the same jobs, we are able to identify several key channels through which changing firing costs for some groups of workers affects hiring and firing of all workers and, hence, may have a different impact on aggregate labor market variables than reducing firing costs across the board. Some analytical and simulation results also show that these effects of differentiated firing costs by workers' skills may be different depending upon the initial state of the labor market. firing costs, matching, unemployment...|$|R
