5|$|In 1896, Hugh Fulton {{organized}} 142 {{specific and}} varietal names into eighteen species groups containing {{a total of}} 64 species. When Henry Augustus Pilsbry's 1900 monograph Manual of Conchology appeared, {{the number of species}} in the genus Amphidromus had increased to 81, and these were placed in nineteen groups. Pilsbry's study has remained the only illustrated monograph of the genus, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered indispensable for any serious study of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is an {{extremely}} rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> mined.|$|E

5|$|Shimer, {{affiliated}} with the University of Chicago since 1896, adopted the Hutchins plan (including University of Chicago syllabi, comprehensive examinations and several university instructors) in 1950. When Hutchins left the university in 1951 and it abandoned the Hutchins Plan, Shimer continued to use it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> reflected in the college's curriculum.|$|E
5|$|The Art of Cookery was the {{dominant}} reference for home cooks {{in much of}} the English-speaking world {{in the second half of}} the 18th century and the early 19th century, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used as a reference for food research and historical reconstruction. The book was updated significantly both during her life and after her death.|$|E
5|$|The pre-release of the 2014 album 5. The Gray Chapter also {{witnessed}} {{a major change}} in the band’s logo and branding strategy. A new nonagram drew the public’s attention towards the band, announcing {{the beginning of a new}} era. The black and red color scheme and the minimalist, elegant design received public appreciation <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used today.|$|E
25|$|A great box hedge {{was planted}} at Rowallan castle garden, {{possibly}} around 1687, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a magnificent sight circa 1817; by 1847 however <b>it</b> <b>was</b> much decayed.|$|R

5|$|The tree {{had been}} {{traditionally}} celebrated {{as a symbol}} of the Holy Trinity, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a venue for religious ceremonies. The first reference in extant records was in 1685, when a cartographer wrote that it was known as the Tree of the Trinity. It is also recorded that in 1746, the bishop of Solsona granted indulgences to those who prayed at the site.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the {{bay bolete}} was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended {{from a common}} ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European {{studies have demonstrated that}} the mushroom can bioaccumulate some trace metals from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account {{of the myth}}, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> well known today.|$|E
50|$|Although the Commonwealth {{took control}} of Queensland's naval forces in 1901, the Naval Offices was not {{transferred}} to Commonwealth ownership until 1911. The state Department of Public Works <b>was</b> <b>still</b> maintaining the building in 1910 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in Queensland ownership in June 1911.|$|R
50|$|After the war, in 1919, {{the company}} {{presented}} the Brennabor Typ P, a car targeted {{at the upper}} middle classes, and volume production began in 1921. In 1924 Brennabor was employing approximately 6,000 people. During the mid-1920s Brennabor became Germany’s largest car producer, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in second place, behind Opel, in 1927/28.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the invasion, the {{manpower}} of the Soviet military force that had been mobilized <b>was</b> 5.3–5.5 million, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> increasing as the Soviet reserve force of 14 million, with at least basic military training, continued to mobilize. The Red Army <b>was</b> dispersed and <b>still</b> preparing when the invasion commenced. Their units were often separated and lacked adequate transportation.|$|R
5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Gym Hall {{was erected}} in 1904 {{and is a}} {{cruciform}} clapboard building. The {{two sides of the}} entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, larger social gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking. In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{began to}} take on civil as well as ecclesiastical duties {{following}} the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries and the Tudor Poor Law Acts of 1601. The ecclesiastical parish of Navenby was originally placed in the Longoboby Rural Deanery, but {{was transferred to the}} Graffoe Rural Deanery in 1968, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> part of the Diocese of Lincoln. Navenby officially became a civil parish in the 19th century and {{became a member of the}} Lincoln Poor Law Union in 1834. The parish was also part of the Lincoln Rural Sanitary District. The Navenby civil parish boundaries were adjusted in 1931, to include the civil parish of nearby Skinnand.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E

50|$|However, {{there were}} further {{complications}} to be solved. If the Ziegler-Natta catalyst was poisoned or damaged then the chain stopped growing. Also, Ziegler-Natta monomers have to <b>be</b> small, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> impossible {{to control the}} molecular mass of the polymer chains. Again new catalysts, the metallocenes, were developed to tackle these problems. Due to their structure they have less premature chain termination and branching.|$|R
