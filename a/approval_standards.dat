In this study, we proposed the <b>approval</b> <b>standards</b> of an occupational cancer due to asbestos through intensive review on the Helsinki Criteria, post-Helsinki studies, job exposure matrix (JEM) based on the analysis of domestic reports and recognized occupational lung cancer cases in Korea. The main contents of proposed <b>approval</b> <b>standards</b> are as follows; In recognizing an asbestos-induced lung cancer, diagnosis {{of asbestos}}is should be based on CT. In addition, initial findings of asbestosis on CT should be considered. High Exposure industries and occupations to asbestos should be also taken into account in Korea An expert’s determination is warranted in case of a worker who has been concurrently exposed to other carcinogens, even if the asbestos exposure duration is less than 10 years. Determination of a larynx cancer due to asbestos exposure has the same <b>approval</b> <b>standards</b> with an asbestos-induced lung cancer. However, for an ovarian cancer, an expert’s judgment is necessary even if asbestosis, pleural plaque or pleural thickening and high concentration asbestos exposure are confirmed. Cigarette smoking status or the extent should not affect determination of an occupational cancer caused by asbestos as smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect in causing a lung cancer and they are involved in carcinogenesis in a complicated manner...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the water uptake by PV-modules during {{weathering}} {{tests of the}} type <b>approval</b> <b>standard</b> IEC 61215 was simulated and compared with the water ingress under ambient outdoor conditions. For this purpose, the base materials, one encapsulant (EVA) and one back sheet (TPT), were analyzed regarding their water vapor permeability. The micro climate a PV-module sees at its surface was monitored during accelerated IEC tests and at outdoor test sites located in four different climatic regions. These measured values were used for FEM based simulations of the water ingress into PV-modules. The results show the speed {{and the amount of}} water uptake under IEC-test conditions as damp heat, humidity freeze and thermal cycling tests compared with the water ingress under the different climates. It can be stated that the IEC-damp-heat test provokes almost two times higher water concentrations in the encapsulant between cell and glass than outdoor weathering can adjust over 20 years. The humidity freeze test shows a similar behavior and even the thermal cycling test results in a slightly water uptake in the back sheet...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{testing in}} the United States is {{currently}} biased toward the minimization of "Type I" error, that is, toward minimizing the chance of approving drugs that are unsafe or ineffective.

Such Type II errors can result {{in the loss of}} significant benefits to society when the sale of drugs that are safe and effective is prohibited.

40|$|The banking {{sector in}} Albania {{is among the}} most {{developed}} sectors of the Albanian economy and one of the few, whose development can be compared to that of other countries of the world. With the recent financial crisis of 2008 the world economy suffered a heavy blow, especially with regard to the global financial systems. Albania, although with no immediate consequences of this crisis by being less exposed to the international financial markets, has started to show problems in its development rates. One of the main problems of the Albanian economy, especially in recent years, is the high rate of non-performing loans in the Albanian economy. Following 2008 this indicator has seen a large increase making today Albania a country with the highest non-performing loans rate in region. The article is aimed at providing a detailed analysis on the problems encountered in Albania regarding private borrowing as well as at making a comparison with other countries in the region. This goal will be achieved by analyzing the banks' lending activity through a questionnaire addressed to the second-tier banks operating in Albania. This questionnaire shall help to make an assessment of monetary and economic development of the country, following the collection of certain data on some key issues of the lending process, such as loan <b>approval</b> <b>standards,</b> terms of lending to businesses and individuals, trends in demand for loans, et...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of diabetes {{is growing in}} many countries. Prescription oral medications {{have been developed to}} treat the disease since the 1950 s. More recently, a group of diabetes drugs, known as the glitazones, have been developed and introduced on to North American and European markets since the late 1990 s. When first introduced, the glitazones were widely regarded as 'innovative' pharmaceuticals and have remained on the American and EU markets, among others, throughout the 2000 s. Yet, enormous uncertainties about their therapeutic value have remained since they came on the market a decade ago. This paper investigates how socio-political systems of drug development and regulation generate such pharmaceutical uncertainty consequent upon the limited informational value that diabetes drug trials provide about the health risks and benefits of such medications when used in clinical practice. Drawing on documentary research and fieldwork interviews, the first in-depth analysis of regulation of 'innovative' pharmaceuticals in both the US and supranational EU is presented. It is argued that these pharmaceutical uncertainties can be explained by reference to four key factors: regulatory paradigms using surrogate markers for drug efficacy; drug <b>approval</b> <b>standards</b> in policy and legislation; ideological expectations of innovation within regulatory agencies; and pharmaceutical industry shaping of drug evaluation.
