5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on Stroma, which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred <b>additional</b> <b>expenses</b> for their parents.|$|E
5|$|Commander Matsumura Junzō {{arrived in}} London on 21 July and gave Reed the {{specifications}} for the ships. Reed responded on 3 September with an offer, excluding armament, that exceeded {{the amount allocated}} in the budget. Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart {{for a trip to}} Russia and the matter had to be concluded before his departure. Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and did not include the armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the <b>additional</b> <b>expenses</b> had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.|$|E

500|$|The five-song soundtrack {{album and}} {{background}} score of Siva were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with Veturi Sundararama Murthy writing {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Anando Brahma", [...] "Enniyallo", and [...] "Kiss Me Hello". Sirivennela Sitaramasastri wrote the lyrics for the remaining two songs: [...] "Botany" [...] and [...] "Sarasalu". S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, K. S. Chithra, and Mano were the singers. Due to a strike in Madras, Ilaiyaraaja and Varma completed the background score in Mumbai. The producers suggested Varma to use stock tunes instead for the score. Nagarjuna noticed this {{and asked them to}} provide what Varma asked for, and offered to pay the <b>additional</b> <b>expenses</b> incurred if any. For an action scene, Ilaiyaraaja used moving string music; when Varma asked why, he answered: [...] "They have come here to study and they are fighting. So I just felt sad for them".|$|E

2500|$|The Duke of Somerset, the First Lord of the Admiralty, opposed Palmerston's {{inclination}} to reinforce Milne.

2500|$|A {{protectionistic}} {{measure for}} improving the GLONASS user segment was proposed by Vladimir Evtushenkov main shareholder of JFSC Sistema. In a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Evtushenkov called for an import ban on all the GPS-capable devices unless these devices support Glonass as well. Evtushenkov claimed that Russian authorities had already started negotiations with major vendors like Nokia, Siemens and Motorola. [...] Vladimir Putin agreed that [...] "It is good that our partners understand our need to protect our national interests and promote our product". According to Russian experts, {{it was possible that}} mobile devices like smartphones would be effectively banned as well.

2500|$|The {{original}} financing plan, {{of using}} the revenues from radio receiver sales to pay station costs, proved to be insufficient {{for a number of}} reasons. <b>Additional</b> <b>expenses</b> included the requirement to pay royalties to musical composers, plus the fact that, unlike the amateur Westinghouse Company staff performers, professional acts started to expect to be paid in something more tangible than publicity. On the revenue side, Westinghouse found that it didn't have the near-monopoly for selling vacuum-tube receivers that it expected it had gotten through the purchase of the commercial rights to the Armstrong regenerative patent. Armstrong had previously sold [...] "amateur and experimental" [...] rights to around 17 small firms, which also began selling receivers to the general public. Westinghouse sued on the grounds that this went beyond their rights, but lost, which resulted in the formation of a series of major competitors, including Crosley and Zenith.|$|E

[...] He continues by stressing the need for a good tenor were he to come to Naples and, in a separate letter to be forwarded by Florimo, tells Principe di Ruffano, then the superintendent of the royal theatres, that he doubts that Barbaja would even agree to the fee already offered to him by La Scala, a total of 2,400 ducati, when he would want 3,000 ducati from Naples for all the <b>additional</b> <b>expenses</b> which he would incur. In a post script, Bellini adds an indignant objection to what he has heard about the proposed casting of Capuleti in Naples. It is clear that he regards Barbaja as an enemy.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond this point, costs {{may vary}} widely. It is {{technically}} possible {{to reach the}} summit with minimal <b>additional</b> <b>expenses,</b> and there are [...] "budget" [...] travel agencies which offer logistical support for such trips. However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of David Sharp). Many climbers hire [...] "full service" [...] guide companies, which provide {{a wide spectrum of}} services, including acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, fixed ropes, medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000–80,000 per person. Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas, clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under , or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them.

2500|$|As {{early as}} July, Sutcliffe {{was one of}} ten players named who would tour Australia {{in the winter of}} 1924–25 under the {{leadership}} of Arthur Gilligan. [...] The fee for this tour was £400 plus bonuses awarded on merit and <b>additional</b> <b>expenses</b> allowed of £1 10s per week on the sea voyages and £2 per week in Australia. [...] Hobbs, however, declined the invitation because he was reluctant to leave his family and his sports goods business for several months. [...] But, after approaches were made to entice him onto a short private tour of South Africa, with his wife also invited, it became apparent that Hobbs might be willing to go to Australia if his wife could accompany him. [...] This was duly arranged, although Hobbs typically insisted on going as an [...] "extra team member" [...] so that none of those already selected would lose their place. [...] The importance of this to Sutcliffe was that his partnership with Hobbs could continue at the very highest level of cricket where the presence of Hobbs was ultimately the key factor in Sutcliffe's major success on the tour, which established him as a world-class player.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary role}} {{foreseen}} for the RNZN was fisheries protection, particularly following {{the introduction of}} a [...] Exclusive Economic Zone by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; this was thought to require a minimum of six vessels to effectively police. Peace campaigners claimed that the purchase of the Anzacs was a politically motivated decision made under pressure from Australia, which was trying to support its shipbuilding industry, and stated that the Fourth Labour Government was undermining its commitment to reduce the nation's deficit by spending so much on high-tech warships (although figures of $NZ20 billion for purchase and 20 years of operation was misquoted as an upfront lump sum). There were also concerns that by possessing modern warships, New Zealand would be [...] "dragged" [...] back into ANZUS. One proposal suggested to avoid this was that the New Zealand Anzacs be fitted with inferior engines that would reduce the vessels' top speed and make it impossible to operate with United States Navy fleets. However, these changes would have incurred major <b>additional</b> <b>expenses.</b> A recurring alternate proposal was the purchase of the British Castle-class patrol vessel design. Two months after tenders for the project closed, the managing director of Svendborg Skibsværft began to campaign for the construction of the Danish IS-86 patrol vessel (later designated the Thetis-class frigate) for the RNZN. In response to these proposals, the government indicated that it was committing to purchasing Australian ships, and that interoperability with the RAN (which the alternate ship designs were incapable of) was a major element in the decision.|$|E

During his four months' land service in Corsica, he had lost all his ship furniture, owing to the movements of a camp. Upon this he wrote to the Secretary at War, briefly stating what his services on shore had been, and saying, he trusted it was not asking an improper thing to request that the same allowance might be made to him which would be made to a land officer of his rank, which, situated as he was, would be that of a brigadier-general: if this could not be accorded, he hoped that his <b>additional</b> <b>expenses</b> would be paid him.
