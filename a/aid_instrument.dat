40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of foreign aid}} has been studied from various perspectives. The current aid system has come {{under a lot of}} criticism and the relevance of aid giving in eradicating extreme poverty has been widely questioned. Even though aid has been found to have a strong, positive impact on growth, there is a concern about other possible effects. Among them is the concern about its impact on aid receiving country government’s fiscal discipline. However the research done to date does not properly take into consideration that there exists a variety of <b>aid</b> <b>instruments,</b> which might have different impact. This thesis addresses the question, whether foreign aid has an impact on fiscal discipline of the aid receiving country’s government, and whether different <b>aid</b> <b>instruments</b> differ in this respect. It is first shown theoretically that the traditional forms of aid, which are managed outside the government budget, distort incentives to maintain fiscal discipline, whereas supporting directly government budgets strengthens the budget process and so results in greater fiscal discipline. The empirical part further tests the hypothesis. Fiscal discipline in terms of debt sustainability under the two aid systems is assessed for 11 Sub-Saharan African countries. Data has been collected from various publicly available sources. The debt sustainability computations indicate greater fiscal discipline in the sample countries since they receive budget support...|$|R

The Instrument for Stability was designed as a more flexible instrument that also opens up opportunities for LRRD but it is mainly security driven and has failed to convince practitioners of its LRRD value. The analysis of the actual implementation of the European LRRD concept in different partner countries and crisis situations shows that, despite some progress made in recent years, the funding gap in the grey area between relief and development still exists and the coordination and enhancement of LRRD activities is far from being institutionalised.

40|$|The {{recipient}} {{states for}} Mediterranean aid are the middle-income Arab {{countries of the}} Mediterranean littoral. Due to the region's importance for Europe there is a comprehensive EU strategy for the region and this has shaped Mediterranean aid policy more than the EU's generic aid policy reforms, although these have also had an impact. The EU's approach to developing these countries is to instigate liberal economic reform and integrate them economically with Europe. This {{takes the form of}} a regional free trade area and bilateral integration with the EU's single market. Mediterranean aid from 2001 to 2007 has been targeted at supporting and enabling reform in key sectors. A crude form of allocative (rewards-based) conditionality has been applied. Assistance is thus more focused and coherent with EU policy than before. The Country Strategy Paper format and the organisational reforms of the aid programme facilitated this, but the political importance given to the Mediterranean area is the major reason. In any case, the broader reform and development strategy is not a success, as there is little sign that partial integration with Europe will enable economic development.

The gold standard of treatment for hearing loss is amplification of hearing thresholds {{by means of a}} hearing <b>aid</b> <b>instrument.</b> A hearing aid is an electronic device equipped with a topology of only three major components of aggregate cost. The gold standard of hearing aid fittings is face-to-face appointments in hearing aid centers, clinics, or hospitals.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 113 - 121). International {{recognition of}} the health problems being faced by developing countries have resulted in significant increases in external development assistance for health since the late 1980 s. However, it has been established that this aid has not been effective due to poor coordination, harmonization and alignment. As part of the aid development architecture, donors and recipient countries have defined approaches, modalities and methods of working aimed at improving harmonization, alignment and management of aid for results. One such approach is the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) which involves ensuring that "all significant funding for the sector supports a single sector policy and expenditure programme, under government leadership, adopting common approaches across the sector, and progressing towards relying on government procedures to disburse and account for all funds. " (Foster et ai, 2000 a, p. 6). In Zambia, the health SWAp has been in existence since 1993. The adoption of the health SWAp was necessitated {{by a desire to}} optimize the use of domestic and externally mobilised financial and in-kind development assistance through the integration of all vertical programmes into a sectoral framework that would meet common national goals and objectives. This was after it was realised that the health system was inefficient in its provision of health services due to the existence of fragmented, multiple donor-assisted projects which the Ministry of Health could not effectively coordinate and manage. This paper explores the contribution of the health SWAp to the provision of effective health care in Zambia since its inception in 1993. The study considered the SWAp as both an <b>aid</b> <b>instrument</b> and as a process and the evaluation is made by looking at both the individual elements of a SWAp and the SWAp mechanism as a whole. The study assesses the contribution of the SWAp to fostering working relationships, accountability for finances and progress, efficient allocation and use of resources, financial sustainability and promotion of geographical equity of access to health care resources. The study was exploratory and a retrospective approach was used to track and associate changes before the introduction of the health SWAp and after the SWAp implementation period 1993 - 2005. In order to take account of certain contextual factors in the broad health reform continuum, a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques were used. This includes 21 in-depth key informant interviews, a Focus Group Discussion (FGD), non-participant observation at 4 different SWAp coordination meetings and a comprehensive document review. Study participants were senior members of the Health Sector AdviSOry Committee that were drawn from 6 provinces (including the capital city Lusaka).

The development record is mixed and no robust association between the volume of aid and development performance has been discovered. The limits of cross-country regressions have become clear: they do not throw much light on the reality of aid. But the novel mix of qualitative and quantitative methods fashioned by independent evaluators constitutes a serviceable approach to the assessment of aid effectiveness both at project level and at country level. In particular, a new brand of country assistance evaluations (CAEs) has demonstrated that success at project level matters even if it does not automatically translate into success at country level?the ?micro-macro paradox?. Evaluations confirm that well-managed <b>aid,</b> using <b>instruments</b> that are tailored to specific country contexts, works.
