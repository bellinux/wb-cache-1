40|$|Abstract There {{has been}} a recent trend in genetic studies of wild populations where {{researchers}} have changed their sampling schemes from sampling pre-defined populations to sampling individuals uniformly <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> This {{reflects the fact that}} many species under study are contin-uously distributed rather than clumped into obvious ‘‘populations’’. Once individual samples are collected, many landscape genetic studies use clustering algorithms and multilocus genetic data to group samples into sub-populations. After clusters are derived, landscape features that may be acting as barriers are examined and described. In theory, if populations were evenly sampled, this course of action should reliably identify population structure. However, genetic gradients and irregularly collected sam-ples may impact the composition and location of clusters. We built genetic models where individual genotypes were either randomly distributed <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> or contained gradients created by neighbor mating for multiple genera-tions. We investigated the influence of six different sampling protocols on population clustering using program STRUCTURE, the most commonly used model-based clustering method for multilocus genotype data. For mod-els where individuals (and their alleles) were randomly distributed <b>across</b> a <b>landscape,</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b> correctly predicted that only one population was being sampled. However, when gradients created by neighbor mating existed, STRUCTURE detected multiple, but different numbers of clusters, depending on sampling protocols. We recommend testing for fine scale autocorrelation patterns prior to sample clustering, as the scale of the autocorrelation appears to influence the results. Further, we recommend that researchers pay attention to the impacts that sampling may have on subsequent population and landscape genetic results...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{maximize}} specific {{ecosystem services}} (ES) {{such as food}} production, people alter <b>landscape</b> <b>structure,</b> i. e., the types of ecosystems present, their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use activities and changes to <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single land-use types in response to changes in <b>landscape</b> <b>structure.</b> Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding {{of the effects of}} <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region...|$|R

Our knowledge about how such intra-annual variation affects the biological control of pests is still scarce. In this study, we surveyed predator carabid and spider assemblages and estimated biological control potential using experimentally added aphids in 21 winter wheat fields from mid-March until harvest. We investigated whether <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> differentially affected predator activity density, species richness and species composition across months, as well as how the relationship between biological control potential and <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> changed over time.

We analyzed data using linear regression and information-theoretic modeling. During the dry winter (2000 – 2001), Dunlin were attracted to regions with more wetland habitat and their abundances at sites increased with greater area of shorebird habitat within both the site and the surrounding landscape. In contrast, Dunlin abundances at sites were related to availability of habitat at only a local scale during the wet winter (1999 – 2000). Regional habitat availability was of little importance in predicting Killdeer distributions, and Killdeer site use appeared unrelated to habitat distributions at both landscape and local scales.

40|$|This {{theoretically}} focused thesis {{investigates the}} use of soft classification techniques for identifying and quantifying <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> in a real landscape (the forest-savannah intergrade in the Beni savannahs, Bolivia). Two soft classification approaches are used in this study: a Semantic Import Model and a Fuzzy Clustering Model. <b>Landscape</b> <b>structures</b> usually are measured using hard classifications and quantified with landscape metrics. However previous research has highlighted problems with the interpretation and reliability of the resulting metric values. Soft classification techniques are more suitable than hard classification techniques for describing landscapes because they can model the internal inconsistencies and vague boundary transitions (ecotones) between patches of landcover that are common in semi-natural landscapes. The `uncertainty' associated with a landcover classification, ignored in hard classifications, was found to contain information about spatial structures such as ecotones. In this work the uncertainty was quantified through {{the use of}} a-cuts and landscape metrics. The results show that the soft classifications provide an additional level of information to approaches using hard classifications. The uncertainty was used to map the structure of ecotones which allows: the spatial distribution of ecotones between combinations of landcovers to be visualised; change in <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> to be quantified specific to the chosen combination of landcovers. This provides a more detailed and informative analysis of <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> and change, especially relevant in semi-natural landscapes characterised by extensive ecotones. In combination with landscape metrics, such mapping techniques improve the ability of landscape ecologists to quantify uncertain <b>landscape</b> <b>structure.</b> Further research is required to establish the ecological relevance of the <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> derived from uncertainty information...|$|R

40|$|New {{spatial and}} {{functional}} rearrangement {{of the territory}} represented by the changed structure of the plots (change of the <b>landscape</b> <b>structure)</b> {{is one of the}} main and most visible results of a comprehensive landscape adaptation. Projects of comprehensive landscape adaptation are designed to accommodate for production and landscape value of the territory. <b>Landscape</b> <b>structure</b> belongs to the most important components of landscape character. The <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> was evaluated in three levels: historical structure (2 nd military mapping), present-day structure (results of mapping survey in the frame of a comprehensive landscape adaptation) and the new <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> (results of the proposed plan of the functional rearrangement of the territory) based on the cadastral territory of Veľké Vozokany in Nitra region (near Zlaté Moravce), South-Western Slovakia. The changes in the landscape are identified by the rearrangement of the arable land, forests, vineyards, gardens, fruit gardens/plantations, permanent grassland, water surfaces, and other areas. In this contribution, we made an attempt to describe the role of the comprehensive landscape adaptations in the process of designing landscape changes which do significantly contribute to modification of the landscape character...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how local habitat type and <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> affects the biomass, species richness and functional diversity of ground beetles sampled from a 1000 ha UK arable farm. At a local scale habitat type was either crop (winter wheat and oilseed rape) {{or one of}} five field margin habitats. Surrounding each of these sampling areas, <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> was defined using remote sensed data from Specim AISA Eagle (400 – 970 nm) and Hawk (970 – 2450 nm) hyperspectral sensors. Ground beetles were divided into predatory and phytophagous trophic levels. Local habitat type only affected phytophagous ground beetle biomass, which was lowest within crops. Total biomass of predatory beetles was negatively correlated, and species richness positively correlated, with landscape habitat diversity. Only the functional diversity of predatory ground beetles responded to <b>landscape</b> <b>structure,</b> showing positive correlations with the proportion of Tussock Grass field margins. Predatory ground beetles show a greater dependence on <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> than phytophagous species, a response that is attributed to their high mobility needed for movement between dynamically variable food resources...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} theme of {{historical}} <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> {{which are the}} preserved relics of human activity. The structures participate in shaping the cultural, historical as well as ecological and aesthetical value. Literary section summarizes the basic knowledge of historical <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> with the attention to importance and possibility of their protection. The main output of this thesis is proposal of typology and procedure for evaluation of historical <b>landscape</b> <b>structures.</b> They were divided into seven basic types according {{to the purpose of}} their formation. Their evaluation is based on determining of result value which is derived from a seven parameters [...] time of formation, the degree of preservation and utilization, visual impact of <b>structure,</b> influence on <b>landscape</b> composition and character and uniqueness of historical structure in a regional scale. The methodology was tested on two model areas - Svojanov and Hlásnice, in which historical <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> were identified, described and evaluated through the recording sheet. Considering achieved results, the methodical procedure seems to be used for determining of cultural and historical values in landscape and for creating of landscape plan...|$|R
