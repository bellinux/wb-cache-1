By means of spatial statistics methodologies, this piece of research work tries to assess which spatial factors determine the location, scale and shape of local distributions.

This signal is characterized by an abrupt increase in the proportion of juvenile skeletons and is interpreted as the signature of a major demographic shift in human history, known as the Neolithic Demographic Transition (NDT).

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the age of a {{population}} of Biomphalaria occidentalis on a pound of Riachuelo river basin, wich {{is one of the}} three most important Middle Paraná river affluents in Corrientes province. Samples were drawn from three stations, were spatial and temporal numerical variations of the snail, as well as its relation with different environmental parameters, mainly temperature, rainfall, pH and conductivity, were analyzed. Snail abundance is given in number of individuals/hour. The differences between the three sampling stations, estimated by nonparametric tests, was nonsignificant. A relative scale to the greatest shell diameter was employed to build the <b>age</b> <b>pyramids.</b> Temporal fluctuations of snail abundance correlated negatively with the highest monthly accumulated temperatures (P < 0. 05). Although different floristic compositions were observed at the three stations, no significant numerical variations were detected in B. occidentalis spatial distribution. Reproductive activity took place between March-April and November with overlapping cohort system. During summer (December-Febuary) mortality increased along with temperature and reproductive activity was not evident...|$|R

40|$|The article explores and {{evaluates the}} quality of life, safety, and {{security}} of elderly people in Tehran City in Iran. In that, different dimensions of material and social well-being, and abuse of people of the age 65 and above, are assessed. Besides the human rights, the dignity, and the gradual decline of the elderly’s social security are reflected. The research also aims to study the elder age-groups {{in order to find}} out how these people gradually lose their physical and mental reliance, and as a result, how their dependence on others and various services enhances. The method of research mainly being empirical, it is preceded by theoretical and literature review. Five hundred elderly people were randomly selected for the study. Findings suggest that the <b>aging</b> <b>pyramid</b> shrinks and narrows at the age of 65 or even before in the present study. Research reached the conclusion that the young elderly with new needs and expectations are highly different from those of their pervious generations...|$|R

40|$|This paper derives {{original}} {{series of}} average {{years of schooling}} in the United States 1870 - 1930, which {{take into account the}} impact of mass migrations on the US educational level. We reconstruct the foreign-born US population by age and by country of origin, while combining data on the flow of migrants by country and the <b>age</b> <b>pyramids</b> of migrants by country. Then we use original data on educational attainment in the nineteenth century presented in Morrisson and Murtin (2008) in order to estimate the educational level of US immigrants by age and by country. As a result, our series are consistent with the first national estimates of average schooling in 1940. We show that mass migrations have had a significant but modest impact on the US average educational attainment. However, the educational gap between US natives and immigrants was large and increased with the second immigration wave, a phenomenon that most likely fostered the implementation of restrictive immigration rules in the 1920 s. economic history, migrations, education, economic development research...|$|R

40|$|This annex {{presents}} some complementary {{historical information}} on the world demographic transition and facts that have marked the history of education {{in a handful of}} countries. Then we present underlying assumptions used in the building of the data as well as complementary {{information on the}} data- first observations, assumed enrolment in 1820, first observed enrolment and so on. Then we explicit the corrections made to Mitchell’s data on schooling enrolment and present the implicit enrolment rate series in Primary schools since 1820. Observed data are in circles while simulated data (extrapolated or interpolated) are in dots, which makes transparent the relative weight of observed and simulated data. 1 Historical Background 1. 1 The world demographic transition The modifications of <b>age</b> <b>pyramids</b> over time are exhaustively described by Chesnais (1992), and we refer to his work in the following. The two phases of the demographic transition are generally consisting in the decline in mortality followed by that in fertility.

40|$|AbstractAgeing is {{a global}} {{phenomenon}} {{that in the last}} decades has led to a significant inversion of the <b>ageing</b> <b>pyramid</b> in the developed societies. This fact has been introducing deep changes in societies leading to increase attention towards seniors’ concerns and needs and has leverage the appearance of multiple gerontechnologies. In this context television as an enabler technology is a promising option for the elderly, enabling to serve this population segment through features such as distance help, support of services that promote social interaction or provision of medical information. Despite the important investments that have been done by the State for the dissemination of such services, the existent technical solutions are mostly web-based, implying a “pull-oriented” activity rather than the “push-oriented” informative dynamic that most seniors are familiarized. In this paper we discuss the key set of features of an iTV application, aiming to enrich the television experience with interleaved informative content personalized to the user's profile. Also a special attention is given to {{the state of the art}} in the field of gerontechnologies enabled by interactive television systems in order to identify the gaps in features related with public and social services information spreading...|$|R
