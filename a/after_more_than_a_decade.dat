25|$|The North Shore Line {{was formed}} in 1916, when {{industrialist}} Samuel Insull acquired the Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railway Company. During the Roaring Twenties the railroad underwent a period of expansion and modernization until the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought an end to Insull's electric utility empire. Despite subsequent financial woes, the North Shore Line survived the Great Depression and experienced record levels of passenger ridership during World War II. This change in fortunes {{would prove to be}} temporary however, and during the post-war era the railroad found itself faced with stiff competition from both the proliferation of the automobile and the modernization of commuter service on competitor railroads. <b>After</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> of declines in both passenger ridership and profit, the company petitioned to end rail service in 1958, but faced several years of legal opposition from an organization of regular commuters. Despite efforts to save the railroad, the company was ultimately granted permission to end all rail service. The final trains reached their destinations {{in the early morning hours}} of January 22, 1963, and the North Shore Line became the final interurban railroad to undergo complete abandonment.|$|E
