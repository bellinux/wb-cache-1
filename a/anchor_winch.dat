5000|$|New {{problems}} which were as yet unknown to shipping companies arose {{with the advent}} of the LASH system and similar barge carriers. Aboard the carrier ship, the lighter is simply a large cargo container, but in the seaport and on the inland waterways it becomes a vessel. As a vessel, they are subject to requirements for equipment regulations like <b>anchors,</b> <b>winches,</b> coupling had to be provided so-called [...] "head barges" [...] which could not be transported on the carrier ships. Also, serving waterways which freeze over in winter required a high capital expenditure.|$|R

50|$|The Short S.25 Sunderland {{was a large}} four-engined {{flying boat}} {{developed}} for military use. The design of the S.25 shared {{much in common with}} the civil-orientated S.23, principally differing in its use of a deeper hull profile. As with the S.23, the interior of the Sunderland's fuselage contained two individual decks; the lower deck contained a total of six bunks, along with a galley outfitted with a twin kerosene pressure stove, a yacht-style porcelain flush toilet, an <b>anchoring</b> <b>winch,</b> and a small machine shop for performing inflight repairs. The crew was originally intended to total seven members; this was subsequently increased for later versions of the Sunderland to around 11 crew members and sometimes greater, dependent upon the specific mission being undertaken.|$|R

50|$|Portable {{beaching}} gear could be attached by ground crew {{so that the}} aircraft could be pulled up on land. The gear consisted {{of a pair of}} two-wheeled struts that could be attached to either side of the fuselage, below the wing, with a two- or four-wheel trolley and towbar attached under the rear of the hull. A standard stocked anchor was stowed in the forward compartment alongside the <b>anchor</b> <b>winch.</b> Depending on the operating area, a number of different kinds of anchor could be carried to cope with different anchorages. Another means of direction control on the water was by application of the rudder and aileron flight controls. The ailerons would cause asymmetric lift from the airflow and, ultimately, drop a float into the water to cause drag on that wing. The pilots could vary engine power to control the direction and speed of the aircraft on the water. In adverse combinations of tide, wind, and destination, this could be very difficult.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{ships of}} both LCS classes were {{delivered}} before the designs were mature so that improvements {{could be built}} into future ships. Many improvements to the Freedom class came from the problems experienced by [...] on its first deployment including power outages, corroded equipment, a faulty air compressor. To prevent water being taken into the anchor windlass room, the <b>anchor</b> <b>winch,</b> hydraulic unit, and mooring capstan were replaced with a single electric chain winch on the main deck, and the existing towing chain was replaced with a lighter chain. Corrosion resistance was also improved by the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection system being modified by adding protections to the water jet inlet tunnel. Starting with LCS-3, the stern transom was lengthened and buoyancy tanks {{were added to the}} stern to increase weight service and enhance stability. A significantly less complex gas turbine electric start system will be added on LCS-5 to reduce costs and lower ship weight.|$|E

5000|$|Typhoon Gay {{is known}} to have passed {{directly}} over the Platong Living Quarters and then over the Seacrest. Both reported the calm during the eye of the storm. The Seacrest {{is known to}} have capsized after the eye passed over the ship and the weather abruptly turned severe again. At that time, the Seacrest was attached to one of its bow anchors and {{at least one of the}} other anchors in its eight anchor drilling mode anchor pattern. One of the survivors testified in his deposition that moments before the capsize, he had seen the ship's chief engineer at one of the ship's other anchor winches. The <b>anchor</b> <b>winch</b> was not working,so the chief engineer was trying unsuccessfully to cut through the anchor cable with a fire axe in an apparent attempt to free the ship from the anchor so that it could navigate and steam up the bow anchor cable thereby avoiding wind and waves on its beam. Caught by at least two anchors,the ship was left taking the predominant wind and the waves on its beam. The ship oscillated broadside to the predominant wind, and, during a series of high waves, coupled with gusty typhoon-strength wind, suddenly, but predictably, capsized to port.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, most countries' MBT models {{also had}} {{corresponding}} ARV variants. Many ARVs are also {{equipped with a}} bulldozer blade {{that can be used}} as an <b>anchor</b> when <b>winching</b> or as a stabiliser when lifting, a pump to transfer fuel to another vehicle, and more. Some can even carry a spare engine for field replacement, such as the German Leopard 1 ARV.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 the SLT56 was {{modified}} {{due to the}} experiences while deployed with the UN in Somalia.

40|$|The use {{of linear}} {{machines}} (LMs) is increasing {{in research and}} industry fields. All kinds of LMs are studied: synchronous, induction, flux switching. Research is leading to overcome the known drawbacks of all these machines. Anyway the use of innovative direct-drive solutions are under study to obtain more efficient energy conversion, such as for marine field. As alternative to classical systems, linear force {{can be used to}} obtain a more efficient plant. Hydraulic drives used on board ship to empower rudders, stabilizing fins, <b>anchor</b> <b>winches,</b> etc., are often characterized by low efficiencies, heavy maintenance, frequent oil leaks and large weight and size.

5000|$|In February 1965 Halibut entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard {{for a major}} overhaul, and on 15 August was redesignated as {{an attack}} {{submarine}} and given the hull classification symbol SSN-587. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 6 September for the West Coast, arriving at Keyport, Washington, on 20 September. On 5 October she departed Keyport for Pearl Harbor and, after an eight-day stop over at Mare Island, California, arrived 21 October. Halibut then began ASW operations in the area, continuing until August 1968 when she transferred to Mare Island for overhaul and installation of: side thrusters; hangar section sea lock; <b>anchoring</b> <b>winches</b> with fore and aft mushroom anchors; saturation diving (mixed gas) habitat; long and short range side-look sonar; video and photographic equipment; mainframe computer; induction tapping and recording equipment; port and starboard, fore and aft seabed skids ("sneakers"); towed underwater search vehicle ("fish") and winch; and other specialized oceanographic equipment.

50|$|The {{calls to}} {{transport}} troops had come at short notice, and feeding {{the soldiers had}} put a significant dent in Westralias supplies, with the sailors spending most of December on short rations. After sailing to Cairns for replenishment (most of the commissaries in Darwin had been drained to supply Australian and Dutch forces securing the Dutch East Indies against a pending Japanese invasion), the sailors had to work all day to disembark the troops, and when the planned evening departure was cancelled because the ship's floatplane could not be reembarked, shore leave was not granted. At midnight, the change of watch did not occur, as the sailors meant to start work did not report for duty. At around 01:50, the deck officer noticed around 100 sailors gathered near the <b>anchor</b> <b>winches,</b> blocking them from use. After the sailors disobeyed orders to disperse, Westralias captain ordered the bridge machine guns trained on the men, then took the ship to Action Stations and noted who did not report for duty. The ship's master-at-arms was ordered to arrest those refusing to report for duty; 104 men were {{arrested and charged with}} mutiny (the largest number in RAN history), with the ringleaders confined in cells, and the rest agreeing to resume duties. Westralia arrived in Darwin on 30 December, then was ordered to Sydney so an inquiry into the incident could be held: the records relating to the legal proceedings and punishments have been lost.|$|R

In current practice both the <b>winch</b> and the <b>anchor</b> are mounted at the distance from the axis of tower equal to 2 times H (where H - the distance above ground level on which an anchor or cable are fixed to the tower).

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to improvise a shelter, the storm chasers and school {{refugees}} take cover in a storm drain at a construction site, but debris from the tornado damages one of the storm grates, compromising the shelter. In {{an attempt to}} save lives, Pete hands over his research hard drives to Gary, then sacrifices himself by leaving the shelter to move Titus down to the storm grate, where {{a combination of the}} vehicle's weight, ground <b>anchors,</b> and <b>winch</b> cable are used to anchor the storm grate to the concrete face. Titus's equipment proves unable to anchor the vehicle to the ground, and the tornado picks up the vehicle. From the camera turret aboard Titus, Pete observes the funnel of the tornado as the vehicle is lifted above the clouds, before then crashing back down to the ground, apparently killing him. Shortly thereafter, the EF5 tornado dissipates.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the tragedy}} was keenly felt in Cornwall, its {{national}} impact, given the heavy loss of life, was relatively small, {{perhaps because it}} occurred during the post World Cup euphoria when public attention and headlines were directed elsewhere.
