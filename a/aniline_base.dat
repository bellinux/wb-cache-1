Chapter 1 describes some of the recent advances made in metal-free asymmetric catalysis and sets the work involved within this thesis into context. Chapter 2 describes the investigation of the a-effect and the modulation of face-face ji-jt interactions as a platform for {{the development of}} a novel family of catalyst for the aminocatalysed Diels-Alder reaction. After initial investigation on the effect of different counter anions and alternative electron withdrawing groups within achiral catalysts, the a-effect and the face-face ji-jt interactions design concepts were combined within the structure of a series of arenes based on the 8 -aryl menthamine scaffold. Experiments performed utilising (L) -cinnamaldehyde and cyclopentadiene provided clear indications that the ji-stacking interaction incorporated within the architecture of the catalyst cloud drive the geometric control of the Diels-Alder adducts, showing a 54 % ee (25) utilising the naphthyl group as the aryl unit and a 30 % ee (2 R) with the 4 -TVyV-dimethyl <b>aniline</b> <b>based</b> catalyst.

Moreover, alternative electronic interactions were examined to improve the nucleophilicity of 4 aminopyrimidines. Preparation of a novel set of catalysts for the enantioselective acylation of alcohols was also attempted. Chapter 4 describes an investigation into the organocatalysed Baylis-Hillman reaction. Starting from previous work reported in literature, an initial analysis of solvent conditions showed that the presence of small amounts of water in organic solvents significantly improves the reactivity for the reaction catalysed by (5) -proline and imidazole to give up to a 80 %.

The existence of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the orthohydoxybenzaldimines was evident from the chemical shift values of the hydroxyl proton in the ¹H-NMR spectra of the Schiff base ligands. The hydroxyl proton resonates at high frequency and thus absorbed far downfield at 13. 46 - 11. 83 ppm, reflecting the presence of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl proton and the imine nitrogen. In the p-substituted aniline analogues of the Schiff base, a plot of the chemical shift values of the hydroxyl proton against the Hammett's substituent parameters gave a linear correlation between the electronegativities of the substituents and the chemical shift values. The nitro group with the highest electronegativity caused the least deshielding of the hydroxyl proton and thus absorbed upfield compared to the less electronegative substituents such as the CH 3 and OCH 3 analogues. Likewise, in the solid state infrared spectra of the ligands, the hydroxyl stretching band of the ortho-hydroxyl Schiff base ligands was observed as a very broad band and at much lower frequency, 3100 - 2100 cm⁻¹, indicating the existence of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In the same vein, ¹H- and ¹³C-NMR spectral data for the Schiff base ligands indicated that the prepared compounds exist in the enol form in aprotic solvent, chloroform. The methine proton appeared as singlet and there was no carbonyl signal in the ¹³C-NMR spectra of the Schiff base ligands. This was supported by the infrared data having no vibrational band attributable to the carbonyl stretching of the keto-form of the Schiff base ligands in solid state. However, the UV/Visible study of the Schiff base ligands in protic solvent, methanol, suggested the existence of some of the Schiff base ligands in keto-enol form. A band at greater than 400 nm was observed in the UV/Visible spectra of the ligands and this has been attributed to the presence of the keto form of orthohydroxyl Schiff base ligands in solution. A plot of the molar absorptivity (ε) of the band at greater than 400 nm against Hammett substituent parameters revealed that the intensity of the bands increased with the electronegativity of the substituents. The Cu(II) complexes of salicylaldehyde, o-vanillin and a few p-vanillin based Schiff base ligands are reported in this work. It was observed that introduction of Cu(II) ions into the ligand system resulted in the hydrolysis of the imine band in few cases. All the isolated complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, conductivity measurement, infrared and UV/Visible spectral data. The structures of three of the Cu(II) complexes were further confirmed by X-ray single crystal diffraction. The Schiff base ligands either coordinated as neutral base through the imine nitrogen or via the imine nitrogen and the phenolic oxygen atoms. In addition, the benzimidazole-based and ovan- 2 -pico analogues equally coordinated through the imidazole N- 3 nitrogen and the azine nitrogen respectively; thus acted as tridentate. In general, the synthesized Cu(II) complexes fell into seven categories viz: [Cu(LH) Cl(H₂O) ]Cl; [Cu(LH) ₂Cl₂]. xH₂O; [CuL₂]; [Cu₂L₂]; [Cu(LH) Cl(H₂O) ]Cl; and [MLCl]. The Cu(II) complexes of the form, M(LH) ₂Cl₂. xH₂O were either 1 : 1 or non-electrolyte in methanol and DMF. The third category, CuL₂, was however, non-electrolyte existing as neutral four coordinate Cu(II) complexes. X-ray single crystal structure of Cu(II) complexes derived from the ammonia-based Schiff bases revealed a square planar geometry for the complexes and this agreed with the planar geometry that has been reported for Cu(II) complexes of N-arylsalicylaldimines of the type studied in this work. The complexes, [Cu₂L₂], resulted from the ortho-hydroxyaniline analogues and were polymeric with the Schiff base ligands coordinating to the Cu(II) ions as tridentate dibasic via the imine nitrogen, phenolic oxygen and the aminophenolic oxygen atoms. Cu(II) complexes prepared from ovan- 2 -ampy and ovan- 2 -pico Schiff bases were of the forms [Cu(LH) Cl(H₂O) ]Cl and [CuLCl] respectively. The X-ray crystal structure of [Cu(ovan- 2 - pico) Cl] revealed a four-coordinate square planar geometry for the complex. In the same vein, the o-phenylenediamine complexes were of the form [Cu(L) (H₂O) ], with the X-ray crystal structure of [Cu(bis-ovanphen) (H₂O) ] revealing a square pyramidal geometry. The Schiff base ligands and the isolated Cu(II) complexes have been evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against three bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC® 8739 ™*, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus ATCC® 6538 ™* and Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizeni ATCC® 6633 ™*) and one fungal strain, Candida albicans ATCC® 2091 ™*, using agar disc diffusion and broth dilution techniques. It was observed that the presence of the methoxyl group at the ortho-position of the aldehyde moiety of the Schiff base ligands enhanced the activity of the ligand tremendously and thus the o-vanillin analogues showed the highest potency against the tested organisms. In addition, the hydroxyaniline analogues were equally the most promising of all the substituted <b>aniline</b> <b>based</b> Schiff bases. The o-vanillin analogues of the aminopyridines and aminomethylpyridines also exhibited significant activity against the tested organisms. All the 2 -aminobenzimidazole series were active against the tested organisms. It should be noted that E. coli was the least susceptible of all the microorganisms while the highest potency was exhibited against the fungus of choice, Candida albicans. Lastly, chelation of the Schiff base ligands with Cu(II) ions did not have significant influence on the activity of the free ligands...|$|R

AN- 22 {{was found}} to constitutively synthesize CatB (cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase) and CatC (muconolactone isomerase) in its cells growing on non-aromatic substrates, {{in addition to the}} previously reported CatA (catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase). The bacterium maintained the specific activity of the three enzymes at an almost equal level during cultivation on succinate. CatB and CatC were purified to homogeneity and characterized. CatB was a monomer with a molecular mass of 44  kDa. The enzyme was activated by Mn 2 +, Co 2 + and Mg 2 +. Native CatC was a homo-octamer with a molecular mass of 100  kDa. The enzyme was stable between pH  7. 0 and 10. 5 and was resistant to heating up to 90  °C. Genes coding for CatA, CatB and CatC were cloned and named catA, catB and catC respectively. The catABC genes were transcribed as one operon. The deduced amino acid sequences of CatA, CatB and CatC showed high identities with those from other Gram-positive micro-organisms. A regulator gene such as catR encoding a regulatory protein was not observed around the cat gene cluster of Rhodococcus sp. AN- 22, but a possible relic of catR was found in the upstream region of catA. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and primer extension analyses showed that the transcriptional start site of the cat gene cluster was located 891  bp upstream of the catA initiation codon in the AN- 22 strain growing on both <b>aniline</b> and succinate. <b>Based</b> on these data, we concluded that the bacterium constitutively transcribed the catABC genes and translated its mRNA into CatA, CatB and CatC...|$|R

Single crystal diffractogram shows diamine (6) is more rigid than diamine (3). Polyimides (4 a- 4 e) and (7 a- 7 e) were prepared from five commercially dianhydride (a-e) with (3) and (4), respectively. The {{effect of the}} position of trifluoromethyl (ortho or meta to amine) on properties of the resulting polyimides was discussed. Among the two series polyimides, Polyimides (7) exhibit higher Tg, dimensional stability, transmittance, and hydrophbility, while polyimides (4) display better organo-solubility, lower refractive index and dielectric constant. Part II： Dicyclopentadiene(DCPD) phenol-based benzoxazine (DCPD-Bz) was prepared from the Manich condensation of DCPD-phenol, formaldehyde, and <b>aniline.</b> Copolymers <b>based</b> on DCPD-Bz and dicyanate ester of bisphenol A (BADCY) were prepared. The miscibility, microstructure, and the thermal and dielectric properties of the reactive blends of DCPD-Bz and BADCY were studied. DSC and IR were applied to monitor the curing reactions of the reactive blends. Four reactions were observed in the curing reactions: the first is the cyclotrimerization of cyanate ester, producing the triazine structure; the second is the coreaction between the triazine structure and benzoxazine, forming alkyl isocyanurate and diphenyl ether linkages; the third is the ring-opening of benzoxazine; and the fourth is the coreaction between isocyanurate and phenol, forming carbamate linkage. The coreaction decomposes the polycyanurate structures and brings parts of the polycyanurate structures into the polybenzoxazine matrix. Thus, a miscible blend can be achieved, as judged by the single composition-dependent Tg in the dynamic mechanical and thermal mechanical analyses. The experimental data also show that the dimensional stability, moisture absorption and dielectric properties are enhanced via the reactive blends. 摘要	II ABSTRACT	III 第一部分:	 1 第一章:緒論與研究動機	 2 1. 1 緒論:	 2 1. 2 研究動機:	 3 第二章:文獻回顧與實驗設計	 4 2. 1. 分子設計 1 - 27 :	 4 2. 2 芳香族親核性取代反應 28 - 34 :	 11 2. 3 本實驗室先前研究 35 - 37 :	 15 2. 4 取代基團位置 38 - 43 :	 16 第三章:單體合成與分析鑑定	 19 3. 1 實驗藥品與溶劑	 19 3. 2 儀器設備:	 20 3. 3 單體合成與鑑定	 21 3. 3. 1 單體(2) 合成與鑑定	 21 3. 3. 2 單體(3) 之合成與鑑定	 29 3. 3. 4 聚合物(4) 系列之合成、薄膜製備與鑑定	 37 3. 3. 5 單體(5) 之合成與鑑定	 40 3. 3. 6 單體(6) 之合成與鑑定	 48 3. 3. 7 聚合物(7) 系列之合成、薄膜製備與鑑定	 56 第四章 性質分析與結果討論	 59 4. 1 硝基單體(2) 、(5) 合成	 59 4. 2 二胺單體(3) 、(6) 合成	 60 4. 3 高分子(4) 、(7) 合成	 61 4. 4 熱性質分析	 62 4. 5 機械強度測試	 70 4. 6 光學性質及介電常數	 72 4. 7 接觸角與吸水率	 79 4. 8 有機溶解度測試	 83 第五章:結論與未來展望	 88 結論:	 88 未來展望:	 88 第二部分:	 90 第六章:緒論與研究動機	 91 6. 1 緒論:	 91 6. 2 研究動機:	 92 第七章:文獻回顧	 93 7. 1 DCPD簡介 48 - 49 :	 93 7. 2 Benzoxazine樹酯簡介 50 - 53 :	 94 7. 3 DCPD-Phenol 54 - 55 :	 95 7. 4 氰酸酯簡介 56 - 61 :	 96 7. 5 氰酸酯共聚物 62 - 76 :	 97 7. 6 氰酸酯與Benzoxazine樹酯 73 - 76 :	 101 第八章:預聚物合成與分析鑑定	 107 8. 1 實驗藥品與溶劑	 107 8. 2 儀器設備:	 107 8. 3 單體合成與鑑定	 108 8. 3. 1 DCPD-novolac (1) 合成與鑑定	 108 8. 3. 2 DCPD-BZ (2) 合成與鑑定	 111 第九章: 性質分析與結果討論	 115 9. 1 DCPD-novolac (1) 合成	 115 9. 2 DCPD-BZ(2) 合成	 116 9. 3 DSC放熱峰探討	 119 9. 5 FT-IR共聚反應機制探討	 121 9. 6 共聚熱性質	 131 9. 7 共聚吸水性與接觸角分析	 135 9. 8 共聚介電性質	 139 第十章: 結論	 141 結論:	 141 參考文獻	 142 附錄	 146 Monomer (2) SCXRD Data	 146 Monomer (3) SCXRD Data	 158 Monomer (5) SCXRD Data	 170 Monomer (6) SCXRD Data	 18...|$|R

In all compounds at least one primary linear intermolecular N+-H?O(carboxyl) hydrogen-bonding interaction is present which, together with secondary hydrogen bonding results in the formation of mostly two-dimensional network structures, exceptions being with compounds 4 and 5 (one-dimensional) and compound 6 (three-dimensional). In only two cases (compounds 1 and 4), are weak cation-anion or cation-cation p-p interactions found while weak aromatic C-H?O interactions are insignificant. The study shows that all compounds fit the previously formulated classification scheme for primary and secondary interactive modes for proton-transfer compounds of 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid but there are some unusual variants.
