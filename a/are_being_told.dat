500|$|While the {{majority}} of the critics gave [...] "Lord Snow" [...] a positive review, many suggested that it suffered from having to introduce many new characters and locations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 80% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.75 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] "'Lord Snow' is an intriguing and heavy transitional episode with standout performances from Bean and Gillen, though it would be better served with more focus on character change and development." [...] Myles McNutt wrote at Cultural Learnings that it was [...] "perhaps the most narratively uninteresting episode of the first six," [...] although he highlighted that it was [...] "hardly a bad episode of television, filled as it is with satisfying sequences that capture many themes key to the series," [...] and added that many issues introduced in this episode had a payoff in future installments. Entertainment Weekly James Hibberd also thought that it was his least favorite episode of the first six, due to too much character development. However, Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, liked the [...] "more rambling quality of 'Lord Snow,' and while admitting it is heavy on exposition he felt it worked [...] "because the stories <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>told</b> with such passion." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that [...] "Lord Snow" [...] was [...] "dense and filled with tons of exposition and backstory, {{which may or may not}} have interested those new to this story - but I found myself hanging on every precious word." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote a positive review of the episode for HitFix, saying [...] "Arya's fencing lesson is a wonderful scene, carried by the joy of Maisie Williams' performance and the playful, Inigo Montoya-ish quality of her new teacher Syrio, but it's also such a small, simple thing that you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to be the note that an episode of dramatic television goes out on" [...] and continued [...] "I liked the looser, more rambling quality of [...] "Lord Snow," [...] an episode largely about transitions, fish out of water, and old ghosts.|$|E

This [...] "expansion" [...] of the evidence -- if I may use the term -- has been embellished by the different expositors with different details, a comparison of which would afford a certain cynical amusement to the historian of critical scholarship.|$|E

They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity.

A confidential memo to justices from Court Clerk E. Robert Seaver, dated May 3, 1971, warned ominously that [...] "further trouble [...] is expected tomorrow morning". The memo laid out the security measures that executive-branch employees were using, including leaving the office early [...] "to avoid a heavy rush-hour traffic and further trouble with the demonstrators". The memo also said: [...] "The key executives in the executive branch <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>told</b> that if they want to avoid possible delays they should be in their offices by 6 a.m." [...] Next to that sentence is a hand-drawn line, leading to a note at the bottom, apparently written by Marshall himself which read: [...] "Not germane to law clerk Sargentich!!!" ...|$|E

His major focus has been ending the funding of homeopathy by the National Health Service (NHS), which the GTS considers a costly waste of public money on demonstrably ineffective products; he lectured about this at QED 2015 in Manchester. In June 2015, the Daily Mirror reported that Marshall had investigated the curious case of Freeman's, a NHS-supplying pharmacy that, amongst other products, sold [...] "homeopathic owl", apparently meant for people with sleeping problems or who [...] "pick up the characteristics of [...] ". Marshall commented that [...] "Around £3-5 million is spent each year [...] and it's completely worthless.

2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of Wallace's fondness for the colour pink. Shortly after being elected, while {{referring}} to Mary Mitchell O'Connor in Dáil Éireann, he said [...] "Miss Piggy has toned it down a bit today". He accepted full responsibility and later apologised, saying [...] "It was my fault. I passed the reference because of her handbag. I'm completely out of order. I don't have a leg to stand on [...] Clearly it was in bad taste." [...] He called Mitchell O'Connor to apologise and said he would write a letter of apology to her as well. In reference to his fondness for pink, Wallace dyed his hair that colour to raise awareness of cancer in February 2015. Since being elected to the Dáil {{together for the first time}} in 2011, Wallace and Dublin North TD Clare Daly have become friends and political allies, and have worked together on many campaigns, including opposition to austerity and revelations of various alleged Garda malpractices, including harassment, cancellation of penalty points in questionable circumstances and involvement of officers in the drug trade. In July 2014 they were both arrested at Shannon Airport while trying to inspect a military aircraft. Wallace said, [...] "All we wanted to do was confirm whether we <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>told</b> the truth." [...] Wallace was fined €2,000 for being in an airside area without permission, and chose not to pay. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison in default, and in December 2015 was arrested for non-payment of the fine.|$|E
