500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Shawn Michaels against Rick Martel centred around Martel's {{attempts}} to steal Michaels' valet Sensational Sherri. During one of Michaels' matches televised on August 9, 1992, Martel came to ringside <b>and</b> <b>winked</b> at Sherri, who returned the gesture. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, Sherri {{came to the}} ring during one of Martel's matches <b>and</b> <b>winked</b> at him. Both Michaels and Martel were [...] "heel" [...] wrestlers who bragged about their good looks, and Sherri had them agree not to hit {{each other in the}} face during their SummerSlam match.|$|E

40|$|A recent taxonomic {{revision}} of Procellariiformes by Penhallurick <b>and</b> <b>Wink</b> (2004) based on cytochrome b sequence data contains analytical and conceptual flaws that compromise {{the validity of}} the taxonomic recommendations. We identify two major shortcomings in the work. First, we question the practice of basing taxonomic recommendations on tree clades that receive no statistical support, and also highlight inconsistences in the tree-searching methods used. Second, we question Penhallurick <b>and</b> <b>Winkâ€™s</b> claim to be following the multidimensional biological species concept, because they have put forward taxonomic proposals that violate this species concept (as well as the phylogenetic species concept). We discuss these analytical and conceptual shortcomings and make recommendations against the taxonomic rearrangements proposed by Penhallurick <b>and</b> <b>Wink.</b> Frank E. Rheindt and Jeremy J.
