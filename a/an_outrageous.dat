Perigard criticized the storyline as [...] "just vile", and Ira Madison III called {{the representation of the}} character [...] "horrifying and offensive".|$|E

500|$|The group's {{first two}} albums, Pretties for You (1969) and Easy Action (1970), {{appeared}} on Frank Zappa's Straight Records label, {{and failed to}} find an audience. [...] The band relocated to Detroit and found itself {{in the midst of}} a music scene populated with the hard-driving rock of the MC5, the stage-diving Iggy Pop with the Stooges, and the theatricality of George Clinton's Parliament and Funkadelic. [...] The Alice Cooper band incorporated these influences into a tight hard-rock sound coupled with <b>an</b> <b>outrageous</b> live show.|$|E

But {{despite its}} querulous melodrama and crazed Freudian pedantries, it has a human purpose the {{previous}} film lacked, and its sheer deranged brilliance is magnificent. ... Love him or loathe him – and I've done both in my time – Gaspar Noé {{is one of the}} very few directors who is actually trying to do something new with the medium, battling at the boundaries of the possible.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] and highly criticized the {{characterization}} of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him {{out to be a}} jerk because the series has not worked at showing that he truly [...] "isn’t a complete asshole". Adams noted that Michael [...] "could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could fire them for winning the basketball game. But that would be <b>an</b> <b>outrageous</b> abuse of legitimate power, which isn’t funny." [...] Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the [...] "episode’s original cut ran too long to air, and it’s obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode".|$|E
500|$|The Western {{was by far}} the {{predominant}} B genre in both the 1930s and, to a lesser degree, the 1940s. Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that [...] "the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [...] Mix, [...] Maynard, and [...] Jones, the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy, the RKO George O'Brien series, the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers ... achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story." [...] At {{the far end of the}} industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out oaters starring Harry Carey, then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted [...] "northwest action thrillers". One low-budget oater of the era, made totally outside the studio system, profited from <b>an</b> <b>outrageous</b> concept: a Western with an all-midget cast, The Terror of Tiny Town (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.|$|E
500|$|Selick and {{his team}} of animators began {{production}} in July 1991 in San Francisco, California with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming. Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, [...] "When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's <b>an</b> <b>outrageous</b> Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned." [...] Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist, Ed Ivory.|$|E

500|$|Booth {{made his}} stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855, in the {{supporting}} {{role of the}} Earl of Richmond in Richard III at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre. The audience jeered at the inexperienced actor when he missed some of his lines. He also began acting at Baltimore's Holliday Street Theater, owned by John T. Ford, where the Booths had performed frequently. In 1857, Booth joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he played for a full season. At his request, he was billed as [...] "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison {{with other members of}} his famous thespian family. Jim Bishop wrote that Booth [...] "developed into <b>an</b> <b>outrageous</b> scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him." [...] In February 1858, he played in Lucrezia Borgia at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright and stumbled over his line. Instead of introducing himself by saying, [...] "Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo", he stammered, [...] "Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet—Pedolfio Pat—Pantuchio Ped—dammit! Who am I?", causing the audience to roar with laughter.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} May 1943 the {{division}} came to Montenegro {{to the area of}} Niksic in order {{to take part in the}} fifth enemy offensive in conjunction with the Italian troops.

[...] It has been established from the investigations entered upon that 121 persons, mostly women, and including 30 persons aged 60–92 years and 29 children of ages ranging from 6 months to 14 years, were executed on this occasion in the horrible manner narrated above. The villages [...] were burnt down and razed to the ground. [...] For all of these most serious War Crimes those responsible besides the actual culprits--the members of the SS Division Prinz Eugen--are all superior and all subordinate commanders as the persons issuing and transmitting the orders for murder and devastation. Among others the following war criminals are known: SS Gruppenfuehrer and Lieutenant General of the Waffen-SS Phleps; Divisional Commander, Major General of the Waffen-SS Karl von Oberkamp; Commander of the 13th Regiment, later Divisional Commander, Major General Gerhard Schmidhuber...|$|E
500|$|Vincent {{was portrayed}} by Phillip Jeanmarie from December 26, 2006– July 18, 2008; Valerie Davis was played by Daphnée Duplaix from December 16, 2004– May 28, 2008 and {{temporarily}} by Siena Goines from January 30, 2007– April 3, 2007. The character received mixed reactions from the show's cast and television critics. Jeanmarie described Vincent as representing {{the way in}} which Passions [...] "pushed the boundaries and limits of what other soap operas didn't dare to do." [...] On the other hand, Tracey Ross said the storyline of Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and she could only complete the delivery scenes after the show's acting coach Maria O'Brien convinced her of [...] "the comedic possibilities." [...] Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential felt that Jeanmarie deserved an Emmy for making Vincent's outlandish situations believable. Josh Robertson of Complex called Duplaix, who had been a Playboy Playmate, {{one of the most successful}} soap actresses for her performances as Valerie in 34 episodes of Passions, along with her portrayal of Rachel Gannon in 95 episodes of One Life to Live. Herndon L. Davis of Windy City Times criticized the show's representation of Vincent's sexual relationship with Chad as [...] "a down-low storyline which involved an African-American man but eventually turned it into <b>an</b> <b>outrageous</b> intersex serial killer storyline." ...|$|E
