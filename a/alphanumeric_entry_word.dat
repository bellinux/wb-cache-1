In Korean en-cyclopedia, an <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> is frequently omitted in a sentence. If the QA system uses a sentence without an <b>entry</b> <b>word,</b> it cannot provide a right answer.

The re-sult shows that combined approach gives a 20 % increase over our baseline. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of a new political dispensation in South Africa, bilingual dictionaries have become a necessary part of daily life. The main function of a bilingual dictionary is to provide one or more equivalents in the target language for the <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> in the source language. Not all bilingual dictionaries realize this objective satisfactorily, Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa bilingual dictionaries included. Some bilingual dictionaries in Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa provide one equivalent instead of all equivalents associated with the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> of the source language, especially if Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa is the target language. Not providing all equivalents renders a bilingual dictionary inadequate, because users do not always find what they look for. By focusing on kinship terms in some English-Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa bilingual dictionaries, this article discusses examples of inadequate treatment. The article further advocates the inclusion of all possible equivalents under such <b>entry</b> <b>words...</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{pointed out}} in Nielsen 1994, law {{dictionaries}} can serve various functions. The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the legal texts they read (a communicative function) or to acquire knowledge about legal matters independent of any text (a cognitive function) - such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may also serve a variety of functions. First, they may have <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> in one language and definitions in another language - these dictionaries give help to understand legal texts, usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system. Second, bilingual law dictionaries with <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> in one language and equivalents in another language provide help to translate legal texts, into or from a foreign language, and sometimes also to produce legal texts, usually in a foreign language.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} a user interface model for providing universal access to mobile computing devices. The model uses a continuous speech understanding engine {{to provide access}} to a virtual keyboard and mouse through speech input. This research has been targeted towards users with permanent motor disabilities. However, these results also apply to able-bodied users with temporary, taskinduced motor disabilities, such as users performing <b>alphanumeric</b> data <b>entry</b> through a cellular phone keypad. The proposed solution might complement (or even replace) miniaturized keyboards and other physical keyboard alternatives, such as stylus-type "soft " keyboards. Since it only requires a microphone (and perhaps a speaker for feedback) which are already included in many mobile devices, it may allow such devices to shrink considerably in size, as alphanumeric input is no longer bound to a physical area. The paper describes the underlying architecture employed by the system. It presents empirical results addressing the effectiveness of this interface over alternative input methods for <b>alphanumeric</b> data <b>entry.</b> Finally, it discusses implications and future directions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examined four touchscreen {{methods for}} entering a destination into a route guidance system. Three of the interfaces were character entry-based, including 1) a method using {{a sequence of}} two buttons for each <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>entry</b> (referred to as doublepress), 2) a Qwerty-style keypad layout, and 3) a Phone-based keypad where letters were entered using their corresponding number key. The fourth interface provided an alphabetic list through which a user scrolled to select a city or street name. Sixteen subjects used each of the interfaces to enter destinations in a laboratory experiment while "parked " and while driving a simulator. The entry methods were evaluated based on entry time, driving performance, errors, preferences, and perceived difficulty. Overall, address entry times were shortest for the phonepad (43 seconds) and Qwerty (45 seconds) methods, followed by the scrolling list (56 seconds) and doublepress (75 seconds) methods. Entry time was significantly affected by driver age, with older drivers taking about 20 percent more time.

In the course of this work quite a lot of grammatically relevant information rendered by the cca. 60 thousand <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> of the source dictionary was registered, e. g. how many stems the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> consists of; whether it has an affix and where it is; what style it represents, what etymological explanation it is given, and mainly: what important morphological and (with verbs) syntactic characteristics it has, which part of speech i...|$|R
50|$|The reverse word {{dictionary}} is {{a dictionary}} where the <b>word</b> <b>entries</b> {{in the dictionary}} are not alphabetized {{in the same manner}} as a traditional dictionary. For example, A Reverse Dictionary of the Spanish Language and Walker's Rhyming Dictionary are reverse dictionaries, the organization of which is based upon sorting each <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> upon its last letter and the subsequent letters proceeding toward the beginning of that word. Consequently, in these reverse dictionaries all words that have the same suffix appear in order in the dictionary. Such a reverse dictionary would be useful for linguists and poets who might be looking for words ending with a particular suffix, or by an anthropologist or forensics specialist examining a damaged text (e.g. a stone inscription, or a burned document) that had only the final portion of a particular word preserved. Reverse dictionaries of this type have been published for most major alphabetical languages (see numerous examples listed below). By way of contrast, in a standard dictionary words are organized such that words with the same prefix appear in order, since the sorting order is starting with the first letter of the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> and subsequent letters proceeding toward the end of that word.|$|R

40|$|We have {{recently}} presented {{an approach to}} combine optical lip motion analysis and acoustic voice analysis {{in order to identify}} the people speaking. Due to the independence of the different data sources, a higher reliability of the results in comparison with simple optical lip reading was observed. From this proposal, a system prototype has emerged. This improved setup demonstrated here has shown promising results, with a false recognition rate of 0 per cent for both surnames and <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> on a sample of 101 persons. Rejection rates of 8 per cent and 14 per cent respectively have been observed. For performing the recognition, the person to be identified has to speak a single word, which can either be specific of the person (e. g. surname), or be one identical <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> for all persons. Meanwhile, a field test at the entrance of our Institute has been started, which will last for a few months. In this paper, we demonstrate first results of this field test.
