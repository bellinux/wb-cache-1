5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|E

[...] The band's first review appeared in the NME, accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, [...] "Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos." [...] Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London {{in search of the}} Sex Pistols. After chatting with McLaren at SEX, they saw the band <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of late February gigs.

500|$|At age 12, Divine and {{his parents}} moved to Lutherville, a Baltimore suburb, where he {{attended}} Towson High School, graduating in 1963. Bullied because of his weight and perceived effeminacy, he later reminisced that he [...] "wasn't rough and tough" [...] but instead [...] "loved painting and I always loved flowers and things." [...] Due to this horticultural interest, at 15 he took a part-time job at a local florist's shop. Several years later, he went on a diet that enabled him to drop in weight from , giving him {{a new sense of}} confidence. When he was 17, his parents sent him to a psychiatrist, where he first realized his sexual attraction to men as well as women, something then taboo in conventional American society. He helped out at his parents' day care business, for instance dressing up as Santa Claus to entertain the children at Christmas time. In 1963, he began attending the Marinella Beauty School, where he learned hair styling and, after completing his studies, gained employment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of local salons, specializing in the creation of beehives and other upswept hairstyles. Milstead eventually gave up his job and for a while was financially supported by his parents, who catered to his expensive taste in clothes and cars.

500|$|Kristen Stewart {{was on the}} set of Adventureland when Hardwicke {{visited her}} for an {{informal}} screen test that [...] "captivated" [...] the director. Hardwicke had trouble finding an actor otherworldly enough to play vampire Edward Cullen. Then she got a call about a guy in London. [...] "I looked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> pictures and was like, ‘I’m not sure,’?" [...] Hardwicke says. [...] "He had been fired from his last job, he was unemployed, he was in debt." [...] Pattinson flew to Los Angeles on his own dime to read with Stewart. Shiloh Fernandez, Jackson Rathbone, Ben Barnes, and Robert Pattinson were the final four up for the role of Edward. Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen, but after an audition at her home with Stewart, he was selected. Hardwicke said, [...] "Kristen was like, ‘It’s got to be Rob!’ She felt connected to him from the first moment. That electricity, or love at first sight, or whatever it is." [...] Hardwicke gave him the part, but he had to make a promise. [...] "You’ve got to realize that Kristen is 17 years old," [...] Hardwicke told him, [...] "She’s underage. You’ve got to focus, dude, or you’re going to be arrested. I made him swear on a stack of Bibles." [...] Pattinson was unfamiliar with the novel series prior to his screen test but read the books later on. Meyer allowed him to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view. Fan reaction to Pattinson's casting as Edward was initially negative; Rachelle Lefèvre remarked that [...] "very woman had their own Edward [...] they had to let go of before they could open up to , which they did." [...] Meyer was [...] "excited" [...] and [...] "ecstatic" [...] in response to the casting of the two main characters. She had expressed interest in having Emily Browning and Henry Cavill cast as Bella and Edward, respectively, prior to pre-production.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{his last}} major {{technical}} innovations was a dual-chassis Formula One car, the Lotus 88 in [...] For ground effect of that era to function most efficiently, the aerodynamic surfaces needed to be precisely located and {{this led to the}} chassis being very stiffly sprung. However, this was very punishing to the driver, resulting in driver fatigue. To get around this, Chapman introduced a car with two chassis. One chassis (where the driver would sit) was softly sprung. The other chassis (where the skirts and such were located) was stiffly sprung. Although the car passed scrutineering <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of races, other teams protested, and it was never allowed to race. The car was never developed further.|$|E

2500|$|The {{creative}} and song-writing force throughout Spacemen 3's history were Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. They {{met at the}} (now defunct) Rugby Art College on Clifton Road, [...] Rugby, Warwickshire [...] in Autumn 1982, both aged 16, and became close friends. [...] Pierce was in a band called Indian Scalp, but he left them {{near the end of}} 1982 in order to collaborate with Kember. The two guitarists recruited drummer Tim Morris, who played with a couple of other bands and had a rehearsal space at his parental home which they used. Shortly afterwards they were joined by an acquaintance, Pete Bain, on bass. Morris and Bain had previously played together in a band called Noise on Independent Street. Pierce handled lead vocal duties. Now a 4-piece, the band originally adopted the name The Spacemen. Their first live performances occurred around winter 1982/83, playing at a party and then <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of gigs they managed to get at a local bar; at the latter their set included a 20-minute version of the one-chord song [...] "O.D.

2500|$|In December 1997, Cohen's {{book was}} {{reviewed}} by Professor Charles W. Ingrao of Purdue University's History Department in Nationalities Papers. Ingrao described {{the book as}} a [...] "well-written, heavily footnoted narration" [...] which [...] "details {{the degree to which}} the Serbs of what is today Rump-Yugoslavia collaborated with the Nazis, both before and immediately after the April 1941 German invasion". He noted that, [...] "It is difficult to refute his contention that it was the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Jews of multiethnic Bosnia and the Krajina that provided the backbone to the anti-fascist war effort at a time when both the Četniks and Nedić regimes of Serbia were pursuing their own agenda of an ethnically pure Greater Serbia". Ingrao observed that while scholars were already familiar with a great deal of the material included in the book, Cohen's exposé on the Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society founded by Slobodan Milošević was new evidence about an organisation that was used to convince the international community of the common bond between Serbs and Jews. Ingrao concluded that, while Cohen overplayed the evidence <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of points in the book, he was impressed by both its factual accuracy and balanced judgements.|$|E

2500|$|Count 1 of {{the charges}} was {{conspiracy}} to commit child abduction, false imprisonment, and extortion. Janet Arvizo claimed {{she and her family}} had been held captive at Neverland as well as <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hotels when traveling with Jackson. She expressed her mistrust of [...] "the Germans," [...] Dieter Weisner and Ron Konitzer. She testified that they pretended to want to protect her, telling her the rebuttal video [...] "would appease the killers," [...] but that [...] "Michael, Ronald, Dieter, Frank, and Vinnie...ended up being the killers." [...] At one point, Janet testified that she'd known what questions she'd be asked in the rebuttal video, that Frank [...] "went over" [...] them with her on the phone beforehand and told her to praise Michael. [...] On another day of her testimony, she claimed [...] "the Germans" [...] had scripted every word of the video, even the hand-holding, laughing, and the outtakes when they appear to think the camera isn't on, and the Germans had [...] "worked with [...] daily, numerous times" [...] to learn it all. House manager Jesus Salas testified that the accuser's mother was at no time held at Neverland against her will and that she had never complained of her children being taken advantage of at Neverland. Other staff testified that the idea that the family were prisoners of Neverland was ludicrous, that there was no fence surrounding the property and that the guards did not carry weapons. [...] During their alleged captivity, the Arvizos took shopping trips into town, billing $3,312.05 worth of purchases to Michael Jackson. They also met with their lawyer and visited a Federal building during this time, making phone calls to various people, though never the police. [...] Janet testified that she was dropping hints [...] "in code" [...] about her kidnapping during the calls, and explained that she never openly asked anyone for help because of the death threats Jackson's co-conspirators allegedly made toward her parents. Janet and Star claimed that Jackson was preventing them from knowing times or dates. When Mesereau pointed out that there were clocks visible [...] "almost everywhere" [...] in Neverland, including a giant [...] "flower clock" [...] on a prominent hill, Star admitted that he was surrounded by clocks but claimed that they had the wrong times. Janet's claims included that she was restricted to [...] "one meal per day," [...] and that Jackson's associates had threatened to make her children [...] "disappear" [...] via hot-air balloon. The Arvizos [...] "escaped" [...] Neverland three times (in Rolls-Royces and limos) but were [...] "convinced" [...] to return each time. When the prosecution presented a complicated chart of phone calls between Jackson's [...] "unindicted co-conspirators" [...] trying to show that they were scheming about the Arvizos' captivity, they accidentally proved that Jackson was not even at Neverland for several of the days during the 2 1/2-week time frame given for the alleged molestation and may have been in Miami the day the molestation and conspiracy were alleged to have started.|$|E
