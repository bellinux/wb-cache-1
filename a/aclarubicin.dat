50|$|The {{first is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as random collection and screening of material, but in fact the collection is often far from random in that biological (often botanical) knowledge is used about which families show promise, based on a number of factors, including past screening. This approach is {{based on the fact that}} only a small part of earth’s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity. It is also based on the fact that organisms living in a species-rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive, mechanisms which might usefully be exploited in the development of drugs that can cure diseases affecting humans. A collection of plant, animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process. One example of a successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumour agents by the National Cancer Institute, started in the 1960s. Paclitaxel was identified from Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Paclitaxel showed anti-tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism (stabilization of microtubules) and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung, breast and ovarian cancer, as well as for Kaposi's sarcoma. Early in the 21st century, Cabazitaxel (made by Sanofi, a French firm), another relative of taxol has been shown effective against prostate cancer, also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells (such as cancer cells). Other examples are: 1. Camptotheca (Camptothecin · Topotecan · Irinotecan · Rubitecan · Belotecan); 2. Podophyllum (Etoposide · Teniposide); 3a. Anthracyclines (<b>Aclarubicin</b> · Daunorubicin · Doxorubicin · Epirubicin · Idarubicin · Amrubicin · Pirarubicin · Valrubicin · Zorubicin); 3b. Anthracenediones (Mitoxantrone · Pixantrone).|$|E

We therefore conducted a side-by-side in vivo and in vitro trial of this agent in metastatic breast-cancer {{patients and their}} biopsied tumor specimens, respectively. <b>Aclarubicin</b> (100 mg/m 2) was given by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks to 22 patients with objectively measurable metastatic breast cancer, 15 of whom had not previously received doxorubicin. The dose-limiting toxicity consisted primarily of leukopenia and severe nausea and vomiting. No objective response was observed in the 19 evaluable patients. After disease progression, 10 of the 15 doxorubicin-naive patients were treated with doxorubicin; 6 patients achieved a partial response, including 4 who responded to doxorubicin alone and 2 who responded to doxorubicin in combination with thiotepa and vinblastine. Tumor specimens were obtained from 14 of the 22 patients {{prior to the start}} of therapy and were tested for in vitro sensitivity to <b>aclarubicin</b> and doxorubicin using a soft agar colony-forming assay. Adequate colony growth occurred in 9 of 14 cultured tumor specimens. All 9 specimens, including 3 obtained from doxorubicin-naive patients, demonstrated in vitro resistance to <b>aclarubicin.</b> In all, 1 of 3 specimens taken from doxorubicin-naive patients demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to doxorubicin, whereas 6 tumor specimens obtained from patients who had undergone prior doxorubicin therapy demonstrated in vitro resistance. The patient whose tumor demonstrated in vitro doxorubicin sensitivity responded to a doxorubicin regimen after failing <b>aclarubicin</b> treatment; in vitro doxorubicin resistance correlated with clinical resistance in all cases. We conclude that <b>aclarubicin</b> is inactive in metastatic breast cancer at the dose and schedule used.

The influence of two concentrations of drugs (10 and 20 μM) and nitroxides (0. 1 and 1 mM) {{as well as their}} combinations (a drug and a nitroxide) on membrane fluidity was investigated. The plasma membranes of cardiomyocytes were labelled with a hydrophobic fluorescence probe 12 -AS and membrane fluidity was estimated {{on the basis of the}} fluorescence anisotropy of the probe. We found that <b>aclarubicin</b> and doxorubicin induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in membrane fluidity, whereas the nitroxides (PL and PD) caused its increase. Preincubation of cardiomyocytes with Pirolin entirely protected plasma membranes of these cells against damage caused by DOX. In the same conditions no protective effect of Pirolid was observed. What is more, Pirolid in combination with DOX caused fluidisation of the plasma membranes of cardiomyocytes.

In the present study we have characterized a second class of proteasome-modulating agents (anthracycline derivatives) for their ability to induce rAAV transduction. The anthracycline derivatives doxorubicin and <b>aclarubicin</b> were chosen for analysis because they {{have been shown to}} interact with the proteasome through a mechanism distinct from that of tripeptidyl aldehydes. Our studies demonstrated that doxorubicin and <b>aclarubicin</b> also significantly augmented rAAV transduction in airway cell lines, polarized human airway epithelia, and mouse lungs. Both tripeptidyl aldehyde and anthracycline proteasome-modulating agents similarly augmented nuclear accumulation of rAAV in A 549 and IB 3 airway cell lines. However, these two cell types demonstrated cell specificity in the ability of N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucine (LLnL) or doxorubicin to augment rAAV transduction. Interestingly, the combined administration of LLnL and doxorubicin resulted in substantially increased transduction (> 2, 000 -fold) following apical infection of human polarized epithelia with either rAAV- 2 or rAAV- 5.

40|$|Abstract Background While many common {{chemotherapeutic}} {{drugs and}} other inducers of DNA-damage result in both NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA-binding, we have previously observed that, {{depending on the}} precise stimulus, there is great diversity of the function of NF-κB. In particular, we found that treatment of U- 2 OS osteosarcoma cells with the anthracycine daunorubicin or with ultraviolet (UV-C) light resulted in a form of NF-κB that repressed rather than induced NF-κB reporter plasmids and the expression of specific anti-apoptotic genes. Anthracyclines such as daunorubicin can induce DNA-damage though inhibiting topoisomerase II, intercalating with DNA and undergoing redox cycling to produce oxygen free radicals. In this study we have investigated other anthracyclines, doxorubicin and <b>aclarubicin,</b> {{as well as the}} anthracenedione mitoxantrone together with the topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF- 193, which all possess differing characteristics, to determine which of these features is specifically required to induce both NF-κB DNA-binding and transcriptional repression in U- 2 OS cells. Results The use of mitoxantrone, which does not undergo redox cycling, and the reducing agent epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) demonstrated that oxygen free radical production is not required for induction of NF-κB DNA-binding and transcriptional repression by these agents and UV-C. In addition, the use of <b>aclarubicin,</b> which does not directly inhibit topoisomerase II and ICRF- 193, which inhibits topoisomerase II but does not intercalate into DNA, demonstrated that topoisomerase II inhibition is not sufficient to induce the repressor form of NF-κB. Conclusion Induction of NF-κB DNA-binding and transcriptional repression by topoisomerase II inhibitors was found to correlate with an ability to intercalate into DNA. Although data from our and other laboratories indicates that topoisomerase II inhibition and oxygen free radicals do regulate NF-κB, they are not required for the particular ability of NF-κB to repress rather than activate transcription. Together with our previous data, these results demonstrate that the nature of the NF-κB response is context dependent. In a clinical setting such effects could profoundly influence the response to chemotherapy and suggest that new methods of analyzing NF-κB function could have both diagnostic and prognostic value. </p...|$|E

40|$|Trans-ß-nitrostyrene was {{recently}} {{shown to be}} a promising lead for the development of new cytostatic drugs. While its strong pro-apoptotic properties seems to be very promising, till now its high reactivity prevents a clinical application. To improve the therapeutic coefficient under preservation of the biologically active nitrovinylic side chain, nitrovinyluracil (NVU) -derivatives were synthesized. In the present study, the cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and genotoxic properties of NVU and 3 of its derivatives, allyl-NVU (A-NVU), benzyl-NVU (B-NVU), and benzhydryl-NVU (BH-NVU) were examined to assess their utilization as new anti-tumor drugs. A flowcytometric Annexin V-FITC assay and an apoptosis microarray with L- 5178 -Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma cells revealed a fast pro-apoptotic effect of NVU, A-NVU, and B-NVU at a concentration of 15 µM. BH-NVU, however, seemed to be too toxic to selectively induce apoptosis. By using the alkaline and neutral versions of the comet assay and a YH 2 AX-immunfluorescence assay with A 549 lung epithelial cells, we demonstrated a profound clastogenic potential of the NVU-derivatives, comprising induction of DNA-double strand breaks (DSB). Clastogenicity increased in the order NVU < A-NVU < B-NVU < BH-NVU. This order most likely is the consequence of differences in cellular uptake, because biologic activity corresponded to hydrophobicity of the different NVU-derivatives, as determined by calculation of the log KOW values. As shown by the inability of the NVU-derivatives to induce DNA-damage in an acellular comet assay, the clastogenic effect was not of direct nature and it was significantly reduced by S 9 -mix. Interestingly, the NVU-derivatives preferentially mediated DNA-damage in proliferating cells. While nearly no DNA-damage was detected in resting human white blood cells, there was significant genotoxicity in phytohemagglutinine-stimulated blood. Together, these findings led us to the assumption that an inhibition of topoisomerase II (TopoII) might be involved in clastogenicity of NVU-derivatives. This hypothesis was further supported by experiments with <b>aclarubicin</b> (a topoisomerase inhibitor, which prevents formation of the TopoII-DNA complex), as induction of DSB by the NVU-derivatives was significantly reduced by parallel <b>aclarubicin</b> treatment. In conclusion, NVU-derivatives are promising candidates for tumor treatment, due to their presumably TopoII-based pro-apoptotic potential and their preference for proliferating cells. However, their high reactivity necessitates further structural modifications...|$|E

40|$|Plasmodium falciparum has {{developed}} resistance to most anti-malarials; therefore, {{an investigation of}} potential targets should be performed. DNA helicases are enzymes that catalyse the unwinding of double-stranded DNA to provide single-stranded templates for DNA replication, repair and recombination. In this study, a DNA helicase (PfDH A) was purified from a crude extract of Plasmodium falciparum. DNA helicase activity was measured by assaying unwinding activity. The apparent molecular weight of PfDH A as determined by SDS-PAGE was 90 kDa. PfDH A moved unidirectionally in the 3 ' -to- 5 ' direction along the bound strand and preferred a fork-like substrate structure and could not unwind blunt-ended duplex DNA.

40|$|Aclacinomycin (<b>Aclarubicin)</b> is a {{trisaccharide}} anthracycline anticancer drug active {{against a}} wide variety of solid tumors and haematological malignancies. We have evaluated its antimigrative and antiinvasive properties in a Boyden chamber with or without Matrigel and in wound repair assays. Aclacinomycin was demonstrated to inhibit HT- 1080 cell migration and invasion while being more potent than the classical anthracycline doxorubicin. This decrease occurred in a dose-dependent manner and without affecting cell proliferation. Importantly, the antiinvasive effect was not associated to a modification in the production of the matrix-degrading enzymes MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 but rather to changes in cytoskeletal and focal contact formation. Indeed, the drug reduces cell polarity, impairs the actin-mediated membrane ruffling at the leading edge and decreases beta 1 integrin expression and activation. Dramatic alterations in the distribution of vinculin and in the expression and phosphorylation state of both FAK and Src kinases were also detected. As a conclusion, these data suggest a novel application for this chemotherapeutic agent due to its ability to reduce tumor cell invasion. Combination of aclacinomycin with MMP inhibitors could have therapeutic potential in preventing tumor metastasis...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{is a major}} obstacle to successful chemotherapy of primary liver cancer, which is associated with high expression of the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene product P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a multidrug efflux transporter. The most effective single agents in treatment of primary liver carcinoma belong to the anthracycline family, yet several anthracyclines {{are known to be}} substrates for Pgp. In the present study, we compared four anthracyclines with respect to cell growth inhibition, intracellular accumulation and cellular efflux using the HB 8065 /R human hepatoma cell line which is rich in Pgp, and the Pgp-poor parental line HB 8065 /S. The anthracyclines were also administered in conjunction with the Pgp-modifying agents verapamil and SDZ PSC 833 to assess modulation of resistance. The HB 8065 /R cells were sensitive to <b>aclarubicin</b> (ACL) and highly resistant to epirubicin (EPI), doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DNR). SDZ PSC 833 enhanced accumulation, decreased efflux and increased cytotoxicity of EPI, DOX and DNR in the HB 8065 /R cells, but none of these effects was seen with ACL. In conclusion, ACL is apparently not transported by Pgp and retains its activity in a multidrug-resistant human hepatoma cell line; such properties can be exploited for clinical purposes...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{cell line}} (SBC- 3 /ADM) of human small cell lung cancer, which is 30 -fold more {{resistant}} to adriamycin than the parent cell line (SBC- 3), the activity {{of a variety of}} anticancer agents was analyzed by soft agar clonogenic assay to search for a means of circumventing drug resistance. The SBC- 3 /ADM cells were markedly resistant to some anthracycline antibiotics in comparison with the SBC- 3 cells: 28 -fold for daunomycin, 26 -fold for 4 '-epiadriamycin, 18 -fold for THP-adriamycin, and 8. 4 -fold for <b>aclarubicin.</b> However, the cells were as sensitive to mitoxantrone, one of the anthraquinone derivatives, as the parent cells. The cells were resistant to structurally or pharmacodynamically unrelated compounds such as vincristine, mitomycin C, and an active form of ifosfamide, whereas they were susceptible to cisplatin to some extent. The in vitro radiosensitivity of both cell lines was also evaluated, and they were found to be equally sensitive to X-ray. These results suggest that mitoxantrone and cisplatin may exert sufficient activity for small cell lung cancer which has acquired resistance to adriamycin, and that consolidative chest irradiation may be clinically useful after combination chemotherapy including adriamycin. </p...|$|E
40|$|The ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter A 1 (ABCA 1) is a membrane transporter {{that directly}} contributes to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis by mediating the cellular efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I. Therefore, {{identification of a}} novel upregulator of ABCA 1 would be beneficial for atherosclerosis prevention and/or therapy because of its pivotal role in cholesterol homeostasis and HDL metabolism. In this study, a high-throughput assay method for ABCA 1 upregulators was developed and used for screening a synthetic and natural compound library. The cell-based high-throughput screen is conducted in a 96 -well format using the human hepatoma HepG 2 cells stably transfected with ABCA 1 promoter-luciferase construct and calibrated with reference ABCA 1 upregulators (oxysterols, 9 -cis-retinoic acid, thiazolidinediones, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, verapamil, fenofibrate, and oncostatin M). Among 2600 com-pounds, 4 microbial compounds (pyrromycin, <b>aclarubicin,</b> daidzein, and pratensein) were picked up as hits by the high-throughput screening assay, and those compounds were further identified as upregulators of ABCA 1 expression by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis.

40|$|SummaryDoxorubicin is an {{anthracycline}} DNA intercalator that {{is among}} the most commonly used anticancer drugs [1]. Doxorubicin causes DNA double-strand breaks in rapidly dividing cells, although whether it also affects general chromatin properties is unknown. Here, we use a metabolic labeling strategy to directly measure nucleosome turnover [2] to examine the effect of doxorubicin on chromatin dynamics in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines derived from genetically defined mice. We find that doxorubicin enhances nucleosome turnover around gene promoters and that turnover correlates with gene expression level. Consistent with a direct action of doxorubicin, enhancement of nucleosome turnover around promoters gradually increases with time of exposure to the drug. Interestingly, enhancement occurs both in wild-type cells and in cells lacking either the p 53 tumor suppressor gene or the master regulator of the DNA damage response, ATM, suggesting that doxorubicin action on nucleosome dynamics is independent of the DNA damage checkpoint. In addition, another anthracycline drug, <b>aclarubicin,</b> shows similar effects on enhancing nucleosome turnover around promoters. Our results suggest that anthracycline intercalation promotes nucleosome turnover around promoters by its effect on DNA topology, with possible implications for mechanisms of cell killing during cancer chemotherapy...|$|E
