5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance <b>and</b> <b>participate</b> more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is a rally racing {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Codemasters. It was originally released for iOS mobile devices in June 2013, and then ported to Android devices and OS X and Windows personal computers (PCs) in 2014.

Players can drive cars <b>and</b> <b>participate</b> in point-to-point rally events, competing against times recorded by computer drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like tarmac and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can be sustained from collisions.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields <b>and</b> <b>participate</b> in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E

5|$|Ilić {{recruited}} the Serbian youths Vaso Čubrilović and Cvjetko Popović {{shortly after}} Easter (Orthodox Easter {{as given by}} Dedijer: 19 April 1914), for the assassination, {{as evidenced by the}} testimony of Ilić, Čubrilović, and Popović at the Sarajevo trial. Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same time}} (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo <b>and</b> <b>participate</b> in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, city {{officials}} made a push to get residents to respond <b>and</b> <b>participate</b> in the enumeration, citing calculations by city officials {{that as many as}} 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms <b>and</b> <b>participate</b> {{in virtually every}} process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E
