5|$|Initially unplanned, The Missing Link was {{developed}} by Human Revolutions core staff, including producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, writer Mary DeMarle, and composer Michael McCann. The story {{was designed as a}} standalone experience, partially due to the technical and aesthetic improvements the team had made. <b>A</b> <b>boss</b> battle was designed to allow for multiple solutions, in contrast to the limited action-based approaches of the main game's boss fights. Reception was generally positive: despite some mixed opinions on the story, praise was given to the improved visuals and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Monsters {{will talk}} to the player during the battle, and the game will tell the players what the monster's {{feelings}} and actions are. Enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them: should players choose non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, whereas they become difficult if players choose violent options. The game relies {{on a number of}} metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story.

5|$|Players control Conan the Barbarian from a third-person {{perspective}} {{while attempting}} to advance through the series of levels that subdivide the game. The gameplay {{is the same for}} each level: Conan moves from area to area, fighting groups of enemies until he reaches the end. At the end of certain levels, the barbarian has to fight a more powerful opponent called <b>a</b> <b>boss.</b> Defeating <b>a</b> <b>boss</b> involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an interactive button-pressing sequence that players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as knocking down obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of platforming sequences in which Conan climbs walls and jumps from ledge to ledge. Players can save their progress by using special stones that are placed throughout the game.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>A</b> carpal <b>boss</b> is <b>a</b> {{potentially}} painful bony mass in {{the region}} of the second or third carpometacarpal joint. The combination of clinical examination and radiography is usually sufficient for the diagnosis. Purpose: To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the quadrangular joint can assist the diagnosis of persistent pain near <b>a</b> carpal <b>boss.</b> Material and Methods: Fifty-seven patients with <b>a</b> carpal <b>boss</b> were retrospectively reviewed using MRI and conventional radiographs and compared to an asymptomatic control group. Results: MRI demonstrated a variable morphology and a variety of bone and soft tissue abnormalities associated with carpal boss. Bone marrow edema around the quadrangular joint shows a significant correlation (Fisher's exact test: P< 0. 001) and a positive correlation (Pearson's test r = 0. 632, significant at the 0. 01 level [two-tailed]) with <b>a</b> painful carpal <b>boss.</b> Conclusion: MRI offers detailed examination of bone and soft tissue abnormalities associated with <b>a</b> carpal <b>boss.</b> Local bone marrow edema strongly correlates with <b>a</b> painful carpal <b>boss...</b>|$|R

5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, <b>a</b> <b>Boss</b> level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with <b>a</b> <b>boss</b> enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E
