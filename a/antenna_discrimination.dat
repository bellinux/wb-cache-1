Efficient spectrum-orbit utilization can be achieved with frequency-reuse techniques - orthogonal polarization, earth-station <b>antenna</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and satellite <b>antenna</b> <b>discrimination</b> - provided that service-area geography is considered.

Of the three techniques, satellite <b>antenna</b> <b>discrimination</b> is the most sensitive to these factors. According to the BSS (broadcasting-satellite service) antenna reference pattern, the maximum discrimination possible is the on-axis gain, which can be as high as 49 dB for a beamwidth of 0. 6 degrees, or as low as 32 dB for a 3. 5 -degree beamwidth. Unlike the Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS), the BSS will normally have beams that cover no more than one or two time zones...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{planners}} {{of military}} and commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) systems for the 1980 ’s are considering {{the use of the}} Extremely High Frequency (EHF) band, especially those allocations from 17 - to- 45 GHz 1. The wide bandwidths available at EHF can be used for higher capacity systems to meet projected future service requirements and for spread spectrum modulation techniques for interference rejection and/or multiple access purposes. Evolution into these higher frequencies also offers the opportunity to develop systems and signalling structures which are functionally common across multiple user communities. Such techniques provide interoperability possibilities while allowing more efficient use of space assets and minimizing the number of unique terminal developments. Due to user-platform space and prime power limitations as well as to terminal production, installation, and maintenance costs for large user populations, it is also important that EHF system configurations accommodate small, low-power terminals. One such approach involves departing from traditional SATCOM designs by incorporating increased satellite sophistication for reduced terminal size and complexity requirements. The associated spacecraft would employ advanced technologies such as uplink <b>antenna</b> <b>discrimination.,</b> on-board signal processing, and downlink beamhopping. This paper presents some system configuration options for providing EHF service to mobile terminals and indicates implementation possibilities for the major spaccraft payload subsystems, with emphasis on some configuration options for the on-board signal processing unit...|$|E

30|$|Let us assume {{there are}} five {{available}} frequencies represented by numbers, which are opportunistically available to the CR operation. Since the PU and the CR networks share the same radio frequency band, the frequencies temporarily used by PUs cannot be utilized by the CR users {{if they are in}} the interference range, and therefore, those channels are blocked for corresponding CR link indicated by the corresponding blocked channels list. For the CR link, B channels { 1, 2 } cannot be used due to the possible interference with the service area of the PU base station a, for the CR link C channels { 3, 4 } are blocked, for the CR link F channels { 1, 2, 4, 5 } are blocked, etc. The conflict edges represent the potential interference between the CR links with two edge weights per edge indicating co-channel and adjacent channel interference potential. In Fig. 2, the edge between the CR link A and CR link B has weights of 1 for co-channel and 0.1 for the adjacent channel, indicating very high interference potential between those links, and therefore, those links cannot use the same channel. The edge between the CR link C and CR link D has a conflict weight of 0.6 / 0.05 indicating a medium interference potential and the edge between CR link B and CR link F has a weight of 0.2 / 0 indicating a low co-channel interference and no adjacent channel interference. This indicates the possibility for sharing the channel. The existence of the conflict graph edges and the corresponding weights depends on the propagation channel characteristics and the <b>antenna</b> <b>discrimination</b> between the CR link pairs analyzed. For example, between the CR link A and CR link E, there is no edge because the terrain obstacle prevents possible interference path and corresponding links can use the same channel without danger of the mutual harmful interference. Practical implementation of constructing conflict graph and determining its weights is elaborated in Section 7.2.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} polarization characteristics of specular and dense multipath components (SMC and DMC) in a large industrial hall based on frequency-domain channel sounding experiments at 1. 3 GHz with 22 -MHz bandwidth. Twenty-nine positions were measured under line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed LOS (OLOS) scenarios. The RiMAX maximum-likelihood estimator is used to extract the full-polarimetric SMC and DMC from the measurement data by {{taking into account the}} polarimetric radiating patterns of the dual-polarized <b>antennas.</b> Cross-polar <b>discrimination</b> (XPD) and copolar ratio (CPR) values are presented from the measured and de-embedded channels, as well as the polarimetric delay and angular spread distributions. Strong de-embedded SMC depolarization is obtained for the horizontal polarization in OLOS scenarios. Additionally, DMC depolarization is observed to be weaker than previously reported for indoor environments but constant across LOS/OLOS, polarization, and distance. The results also show that the copolar (cross-polar) DMC power to total channel power ratio is equal to 15 % (40 %) for LOS and 40 % (60 %) for OLOS and that this ratio does not correlate significantly with transmitter-receiver distance. Finally, the validity of the room electromagnetics theory was confirmed for transmitter-receiver distances larger than 15 m with no significant difference between polarized subchannels...|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is the {{analysis}} of the interactions between antennas and channels where electromagnetic fields play a central role. Our goal has been to devise a general framework to enable a clear separation of the properties of the propagation channel from the influence of the antennas {{at the same time as}} it provides a common ground for a joint characterization of their properties. For this we have taken help of two tools: 1) a solution to Maxwell's equations, i. e., a spherical vector wave (svw) multi-modal expansion of the electromagnetic field and 2) the scattering matrix representation of an antenna that provides a full description of all its properties as a transmitting, receiving or scattering device. These tools offer a natural characterization of the polarizational, directional, and spatial properties of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems. In this thesis we first show that under some assumptions the propagation channel and the antenna are equivalent. The equivalence is in the sense that the impact of the channel cross-polarization ratio (XPR) and the <b>antenna</b> effective cross-polarization <b>discrimination</b> (XPD) on the mean effective gain (MEG) of an antenna are symmetrical. We also find bounds on the MEG in a wireless channel. Then we provide closed form expressions for the covariance of the field multi-modes as a function of the Power Angle Spectrum (PAS) and the channel XPR. A new interpretation of the MEG of antennas in terms of field multi-modes is also provided where the maximum MEG is obtained by conjugate mode matching between the antennas and the channel. We also show the (intuitive) result that the optimum decorrelation of the antenna signals is obtained by the excitation of orthogonal spherical vector wave modes. The cross-correlation coefficient between signals at two antenna branches (ports) in the presence of spatially selective interference and additive white gaussian noise is also investigated showing that spatial interference can also be readily modeled in terms of the svw mode expansion. We further devise a correlation model for co- and cross-polarized field components and introduce the concept of mode-to-mode channel mapping, the M-matrix, between the receive and transmit antenna modes. The M-matrix maps the modes excited by the transmitting antenna to the modes exciting the receive antennas and vice versa. The covariance statistics of this M-matrix are expressed as a function of the double-directional power-angular spectrum (PAS) of co- and cross-polarized components of the electromagnetic field. We finally derive physical limitations on the interactions of antennas exciting TM or TE modes (but not both) and wireless propagation channels. Rather than maximizing antenna gain in a single direction we obtain physical limitations on the antenna gain pattern, which is directly translated to more condensed parameters, i. e. the instantaneous effective gain Gi and the mean effective gain Ge if instantaneous realizations or correlation statistics of the expansion coefficients of the electromagnetic field are known, respectively. The obtained limitations are on the maximum of Gi/Q and Ge/Q, which establish a trade-off between link gain and the antenna quality factor Q...|$|R
