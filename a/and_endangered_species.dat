5|$|A {{large portion}} of the field surveys and {{research}} conducted with regards to threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> in Michigan is undertaken by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) program. The MNFI program was originally developed in 1980 as part of the state natural heritage programs conceptualized by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), through which it received its first funding. The MNFI program severed relations with TNC in 2000, and became a program of the Michigan State University Extension Services.|$|E

5|$|The valley {{also has}} {{a wide variety of}} small mammals with larger species {{including}} Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and deer (Cervidae). The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species,</b> the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River refuge {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the refuge include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests common to Western Oregon. The refuge was established as an urban refuge to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of migratory birds, threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species,</b> fish and other resident wildlife. The refuge is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 other animal species.|$|E
5|$|Plant life is {{extremely}} diverse and ranges from sun-loving species {{to those that}} grow in dense shade. Tree cover dominates the publicly owned acreage, and is a significant component on privately owned lands. Oak-hickory is the predominant timber type, however, many other commercially important timber species also occupy significant acreages. More than 500 wildlife species {{can be found in}} the Forest, including 48 mammals, 237 birds, 52 reptiles, 57 amphibians, and 109 species of fish. There are seven federally listed threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> that inhabit the Forest, as well as 33 species which are considered regionally sensitive, and 114 Forest-listed species.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the Creek Turnpike, from US-75 in Jenks to US-64/US-169 in Tulsa, was first {{authorized}} in 1987, with construction beginning in 1989. The turnpike's construction was controversial; homeowners along {{the route of the}} highway formed a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes to fight the highway in both the courtroom and the media. The highway was also challenged on environmental grounds, with impacts upon wetlands <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> being the chief concerns. Nevertheless, the highway opened to traffic in three sections, starting from the easternmost, {{over the course of the}} first half of 1992.|$|E

5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species,</b> the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|The {{region is}} {{home to one of}} the largest populations of {{endangered}} Indian elephant and Bengal Tiger in India. Elephant populations are found in eight fragmented sites in South India; in northern Karnataka, along the Western Ghats, in Bhadra–Malnad, in Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats, in Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore, in Anamalai–Parambikulam, in Periyar–Srivilliputhur and Agasthyamalai The region {{is home to}} one-third of the tiger population {{and more than half of}} the elephant population of India. There are 14 Project Tiger reserves and 11 Project Elephant reserves in the region. Other threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> found in the region include grizzled giant squirrel, grey slender loris, sloth bear, nilgiri tahr, nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, and Indian leopard.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species),</b> northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas {{as suggested by the}} substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, gardens became {{focused on}} the plant conservation. The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was {{established}} by the IUCN, and the World Conservation Union in 1987 {{with the aim of}} coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world. It maintains a database of rare <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold ex situ conservation collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as: seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in tissue culture (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, including those that are of special horticultural, historical or scientific interest (such as those held by the NCCPG in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation. Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. The Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis, Missouri coordinates the conservation of native North American species.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species,</b> but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is divided}} into two {{distinctive}} geographic regions: the dry eastern side which includes majority of the urban area {{of the city and the}} western region which borders the Nilgiris, Anaimalai and Munnar ranges. Palghat Gap, a mountain pass which connects the neighbouring state of Kerala to Tamil Nadu, lies to the west of the city. Because of its location in the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats, it is rich in fauna and flora. The Coimbatore urban wetlands harbours around 116 species of birds, of which 66 are resident, 17 are migratory and 33 are local migrants. The spot-billed pelican, painted stork, openbill stork, ibis, spot-billed duck, teal and black-winged stilt visit the Coimbatore wetlands on their migration. Apart from the species common to the plains, various threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> such as Indian elephants, wild boars, leopards, Bengal tigers, gaurs, Nilgiri tahr, sloth bear and black-headed oriole are found in the region.|$|E
