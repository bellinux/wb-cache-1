The Court found that on the <b>affidavit</b> <b>evidence</b> produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
500|$|Counsel for the {{appellant}} {{argued that}} this was not a case of a decision reviewable on ordinary administrative law grounds, but rather a case where the exercise of the power depended [...] "upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact". However, the House of Lords disagreed with the argument. It held that the nature and process of the decision conferred upon immigration officers was inconsistent with the requirements for the establishment of any precedent facts. This was because the immigration officer had to consider a [...] "complex of statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines and other documentary evidence whose genuineness is doubtful, statements which cannot be verified, misunderstandings as to what was said, practices and attitudes in a foreign state which have to be estimated. There is room for appreciation, even for discretion." [...] On the other hand, the court was not well placed to determine which of several conflicting statements made by the appellant were true, or to decide if other factors were material to the immigration officer's decision. The court had to determine the case based on <b>affidavit</b> <b>evidence</b> and, though cross-examination on such evidence was permissible, this did not usually occur in practice. As the case did not fall into the precedent fact category, the court was unable to judicially review the decision.|$|E

50|$|In American jurisprudence, {{under the}} rules for hearsay, {{admission}} of an unsupported <b>affidavit</b> as <b>evidence</b> is unusual (especially if the affiant is not available for cross-examination) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar.

5000|$|The {{rationale}} {{for a party}} admission exception to hearsay exclusion can be mostly easily understood by reference to the {{rationale for}} the hearsay rule itself. <b>Affidavit</b> <b>evidence</b> consisting of out-of-court statements, is not subject to Cross-examination. <b>Affidavit</b> <b>evidence</b> is thought to detract from the truth-finding mission of a trial. The accuracy or credibility of affidavits lack the transparency that cross-examination exacts, but—at least in civil cases—a party may be cross-examined or give an explanation or denial of its admission. In criminal cases, however, [...] "modern psychological interrogation techniques can cause innocent suspects" [...] to falsely admit to crimes. Therefore, depending on the context, party admissions may advance, rather than detract from, the truth-finding mission.|$|E

50|$|In civil litigations in the United States, {{there are}} many stages of {{verification}} of the cases from motion to dismiss, motion for summary judgment, to trial.

When the case moves to the motion for summary judgement, the court will gather facts through a discovery process. The plaintiff submits alleged facts.

40|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, the British {{military}} conducted {{hundreds of}} minor war crimes trials in the Far East in which hundreds of Japanese war criminals were tried and punished. There were mixed opinions about these trials. The few scholars who studied some of them held view that generally the trials were fair trials. However, some Japanese war criminals hold the view that they were victors' trials, in which only ordinary soldiers used as pawns for the crimes of senior officers. Some of the victims held the view that the British war crimes authorities were inefficient, the war crimes courts were lenient and the sentences were heavy if the victims were Whites and light if they happened to be Asians. This research evaluated the above opinions and the fairness of four important trials - the Gozawa Sadaichi and Nine Others, the Penang Kempetai, the Double Tenth and the Singapore Chinese Massacre Trials. The result shows that some of the views were not true or only valid in certain aspects. The Gozawa Sadaichi and Nine Others Trial was a fair trial but with the main criticism that the accused were convicted on <b>affidavit</b> <b>evidence</b> and those who gave the affidavits were not available in the court for the Defence's cross-examination. The Penang Kempetai Trial and the Double Tenth Trial could be models of fair trials. The Singapore Chinese Massacre Trial while satisfying most of the criteria of a fair trial, suffer from some unfairness in relation to the death sentences given to Lieutenant-General Kawamura Saburo and Colonel Oishi Masayuki. On the whole, the research has highlighted the quality of justice rendered in these trials. The research also highlights some of the legal issues involved in the Japanese atrocities and British minor war crimes trial...|$|E
40|$|This Article explores a {{constantly}} recurring procedural question: When is fact-finding improved by a live hearing or trial, and when {{would it be}} better {{to rely on a}} written record? Unfortunately, when judges, lawyers, and rulemakers consider this issue, they are led astray by the widely shared—but false—assumption that a judge can best determine issues of credibility by viewing the demeanor of witnesses while they are testifying. In fact, a large body of scientific evidence indicates that judges {{are more likely to be}} deceived by lying or mistaken witnesses when observing live testimony than if the judges were to review a paper transcript. Witness presence, in other words, may often harm, rather than improve, the accuracy of credibility assessments. The fact that legal actors value hearings for mistaken reasons does not mean that hearings have no value, but it does raise the concern that live procedure will be employed when it is unneeded or even counterproductive, especially given the lack of available guidance on this question. In this Article, I attempt to remedy this problem by suggesting some guiding principles that lawyers, courts, and rulemakers could rely on when choosing between live and paper-based fact-finding. Live hearings and trials will often, but not always, do more harm than good. In addition to the fact that demeanor cues generally impair credibility judgments, there are a number of cognitive biases that may arise from having one’s first impressions of a witness be visual and auditory impressions. These include a persistent human tendency to trust or distrust witnesses based on their physical attractiveness, their social status, their race, or other features that may make them similar to, or different than, the fact-finder. On the flip side, live factfinding may help a judge make sense of confusing evidence. In addition, in-court hearings may feel fairer to participants than paper-based decisions, due in large part to the desire to have expressive input in decisions that affect their well-being. And occasionally, a live hearing or trial may be preferable for reasons of cost or practicality. A better understanding of the costs and benefits of live fact-finding could have profound implications for the design of our civil justice system. Our current approach relies on predominantly paper-based, pretrial fact-finding, followed in rare cases by a live trial process. Unfortunately, this system uses paper-based procedures at a point when live hearings may often be cheaper and more reliable, then shifts to live examination when its benefits will have evaporated and its costs are likely to be prohibitive. A preferable system would allow for more live hearings early in a case. Even when there is no direct credibility conflict, live proof at this stage may increase the legitimacy of rulings, may lower litigation costs, and will often be more reliable than the paper-based alternative of <b>affidavit</b> <b>evidence.</b> By contrast, rulemakers should be more willing to authorize—and judges should be more willing to use—paper trials at the final fact-finding stage of a dispute. At this late stage, live procedure is expensive and unreliable, and as a result litigants use it so rarely that it provides them with few opportunities for self-expression. In short, we should reverse our present approach to civil case fact-finding by holding more live pretrial hearings and more paper trials...|$|E
