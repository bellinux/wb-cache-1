5|$|Under Boyd's {{captaincy}} Birmingham {{reached the}} semifinals of the 1950–51 FA Cup, {{when they were}} defeated by the powerful Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen only after a replay. They twice came close to winning promotion, missing out by three points in the 1950–51 season and then on goal average the following year. Boyd's performances were rewarded with selection for England B against Netherlands B, a match played {{in front of a}} crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, but this, and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954, was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came to full international honours.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E
25|$|Gleeson {{grew up in}} Warrnambool, Victoria as {{a member}} of a sports-mad family, with four older {{siblings}} who were all good in their chosen sports of football, basketball and swimming. As a child, Gleeson would sneak <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to the Melbourne Tigers bench to get a better look at legendary coach Lindsay Gaze and his players during Warrnambool's annual Seaside Basketball tournament every Australia Day weekend. Gleeson was keen on basketball in his youth and w{{as a member of}} Warrnambool's under 14 team which finished third at the Australian championships. In 1985, he graduated from Warrnambool's Emmanuel College.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{being the}} hero of the {{previous}} postseason, Foulke struggled to keep his job <b>as</b> <b>closer</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> battled knee injuries throughout 2005. His ERA ballooned to over 5.00 and he eventually lost the role of closer to Mike Timlin.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase {{has since}} {{been used by the}} anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba for the title of a song on their album Anarchy. The song is about Bob Dylan and {{includes}} the lyrics: [...] "Give the anarchist a cigarette/ 'Cause that's <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> ever going to get/ Bobby just hasn't earned it yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but <b>he's</b> all right, <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> wax. <b>He</b> says he {{was sure}} no one but {{ourselves}} could have done it, for nobody else could have thought of such things or made them either." ...|$|R
500|$|David Gahr {{took the}} {{gatefold}} photos of Morrison {{surrounded by his}} musicians with {{their wives and children}} at a party for Planet's son, Peter, born from a previous relationship. Morrison dismissed these photos as [...] "rubbish". However, Johnny Rogan commented that the front cover looks far worse; it included a [...] "hilarious" [...] image of Morrison in a full-length kaftan. Morrison complained about the stereotypical front cover as well: [...] "people think you're a hippie because of the long hair and beard. ... I'd bought the kaftan in Woodstock, and that's what people were wearing." [...] Mills agrees that [...] "Van Morrison was never a hippie, but this was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Kazin, Bryan's biographer, {{notes the}} many handicaps he faced in his 1896 campaign: [...] "A severe {{economic}} downturn that occurred with Democrats in power, a party deserted by its men of wealth and national prominence, the vehement opposition of most prominent publishers and academics and ministers, and hostility from the nation's largest employers". [...] According to Kazin, [...] "what is remarkable is not that Bryan lost but that he came <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did to winning." [...] Williams believes that Bryan did {{better than any other}} Democrat would have, and comments, [...] "The nominee of a divided and discredited party, he had come remarkably close to winning." [...] Bryan's own explanation was brief: [...] "I have borne the sins of Grover Cleveland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manga artist Yoichiro Ono {{comments}} {{that although he}} has kept his drawing style <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to boys' manga, the story's is aimed at an adult audience and resulted in {{the first volume of}} the manga being [...] "a lot more serious than it ended up being... and more mature".|$|E
5000|$|Tom Henke {{established}} himself <b>as</b> an elite <b>closer,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> led the American League in saves with 34.|$|R
6000|$|... "Melema? no, indeed," [...] {{answered}} Ser Ceccone. [...] "He is <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> a nut. <b>He</b> never brags. That's why he's employed everywhere. They say he's {{getting rich}} with doing {{all sorts of}} underhand work." ...|$|R
50|$|Chris Parnell {{replaced}} Ty Burrell as {{the voice}} of Mr. Peabody from the 2014 film Mr. Peabody & Sherman. He auditioned for the role {{about a year and a}} half before the series' premiere. Trying to replicate Bill Scott's voice from the original cartoons <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>he</b> prepared by watching the 1960s show, and ended up doing his own interpretation of the character.|$|R
2500|$|After a few {{games for}} Hampshire and the {{first-class}} Combined Services team in 1954, Sainsbury {{was a big}} success in his first full season in 1955, taking 102 wickets and scoring 586 runs. He was picked for the MCC [...] "A" [...] tour to Pakistan in 1955-56 and played {{in two of the}} four representative matches. But in an era when England's spin bowling options included Tony Lock, Fred Titmus, Ray Illingworth and Derek Underwood, this was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came to Test cricket.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995–96, Messier came <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{had since}} 1991–92 to {{breaking}} the 100-point plateau when, {{at the age}} of 35, he recorded a 99-point season. In 1996–97, former Oilers teammate Wayne Gretzky joined the Rangers, while Messier retained the captaincy and had a respectable 84-point regular season. The two led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers in five games, as the Rangers could not match the size and strength of Eric Lindros and his [...] "Legion of Doom" [...] linemates. Messier left the club {{at the conclusion of the}} season (see below), ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky being together again on the same team after just one season. It would also turn out to be both players' final playoff appearances.|$|E
60|$|On {{the four}} {{sides of the}} city the trumpeter blew his blast, {{and the last time}} Peronnik, who had ridden up <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> might, {{answered}} him.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw down}} {{his hat and}} then came {{to sit on the}} corner of the table in his {{favorite}} attitude and <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to Elsa <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dared. The eyes of the paralytic had faintly lit up at his approach.|$|R
5000|$|After the Reavers are introduced, {{the screen}} goes to near black before cutting to commercials. Whedon {{wanted to give}} the {{audience}} time to [...] "breathe" [...] before being hit with commercials, but a true black would automatically cue the ads. Instead, he went with a color that was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to black <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go without causing this.|$|R
60|$|And {{even when}} {{convinced}} that no nasty man was present, {{and that it}} was papa, not Louey, whom he was grappling, <b>he</b> still nestled <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible, while <b>he</b> was only pacified in recurring frights by listening to a story. Never good at story-telling, the only one that, for the nonce, his father could put together was that of Joseph, and this elicited various personal comparisons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lieutenant, go tell Colonel Ward {{to work up}} <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can get cover, and not {{to waste}} much {{ammunition}} in unnecessary firing. You may leave your horse." ...|$|E
60|$|He crept <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{could to}} the deer. Fortunately the breeze was blowing {{up the hill}} toward him, so the animals could not scent him readily. When he had gotten as near as he thought possible, he took careful aim and blazed away twice in quick succession.|$|E
60|$|Old Jolyon {{had little}} Holly on his knee; {{she had taken}} {{possession}} of his watch; Jolly, very red in the face, was trying {{to show that he}} could stand on his head. The dog Balthasar, <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> might be to the tea-table, had fixed his eyes on the cake.|$|E
5000|$|Meiseis portly catcher and {{clean-up}} hitter. He is Kazuyas {{best friend}} and is always paired with him. Initially, he is vehemently against Tatsuya joining the baseball team but eventually warms to him and becomes <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was to Kazuya. He occasionally expresses his jealousy of his friends greater talent and ability to attract Minami and other girls. Played by: Shinsuke Hiratsuka ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Cuthbert, here," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to the young knight, who was sorrowfully kneeling by his bedside, [...] "is as a son to me. The relationship by blood is but slight, but by affection it is <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> were mine own. I have, as your majesty knows, no male heirs, and my daughter is but young, and will now be a royal ward. I beseech your majesty to bestow her in marriage, when the time comes, upon Sir Cuthbert. They {{have known each other}} as children, and the union will bring happiness, methinks, to both, as well as strength and protection to her; and further, if it might be, I would fain that you should bestow upon him my title and dignity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hulkling was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} a female character. According to Tom Brevoort, [...] "Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as a man. I suspect this was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> Allan felt <b>he</b> could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic. But as we got underway... he started to have second thoughts and approached me about maintaining Hulkling and Wiccan as two involved male characters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come back, dear. Don't go so near,' he pleaded, {{following}} <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> might. She {{heard the}} pain and appeal in his voice. It thrilled her, and she went a little nearer. What was death to her but one of her symbols, the death of which the sagas talk--something grand, and sweeping, and dark.|$|E
60|$|Crayford {{tapped the}} {{saucepan}} of bones impatiently. John Want lowered {{himself to the}} floor--grumbling all the way--by a rope attached to the rafters at his bed head. Instead of approaching his superior officer and his saucepan, he hobbled, shivering, to the fire-place, and held his chin <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> possibly could over the fire. Crayford looked after him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} know Haskett. He's <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is brutal. Once {{we got up}} a list to give Captain Pepperill a {{birthday}} present, but Haskett, although he was first mate, only gave twenty-five cents,--no more than Cooley, the cook, chipped in. In his eyes a ten-dollar gold piece is a big lot of money." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{came out}} on deck slowly. It was now a matter of {{conscience}} to shave the land <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible--for now <b>he</b> must go overboard whenever the ship was put in stays. Must! There could be no going back for him. After a moment I walked over to leeward and my heart flew into my mouth at the nearness of the land on the bow. Under any other circumstances I would not have held on a minute longer. The second mate had followed me anxiously.|$|R
60|$|But a {{white man}} was not an Indian. The former might have stolen the range and valley and mountain, even the desert, but his {{possessions}} would ever remain mysteries. Gale had scarcely faced the great gray ponderous wall of cliff before the old strange interest in the Yaqui seized him again. It recalled the tie that existed between them, a tie almost <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> blood. Then <b>he</b> was eager and curious {{to see how the}} Indian would conquer those seemingly insurmountable steps of stone.|$|R
6000|$|This thought {{broke her}} down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling down her cheeks. Then quite {{a group of}} boys and girls--playmates of Tom's and Joe's--came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so {{the last time they}} saw him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added {{something}} like [...] "and I was a-standing just so--just as I am now, and as if you was him--I was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> that--and <b>he</b> smiled, just this way--and then something seemed to go all over me, like--awful, you know--and I never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!" ...|$|R
60|$|The reddleman, stung with {{suspicion}} of wrong to Thomasin, was aroused to strategy in a moment. He instantly left {{the bush and}} crept forward {{on his hands and}} knees. When he had got <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> might safely venture without discovery he found that, owing to a cross-wind, the conversation of the trysting pair could not be overheard.|$|E
60|$|Waverley was now left {{to his own}} meditations, for his {{attendant}} {{with the}} battle-axe spoke very little English. They were traversing a thick, and, as it seemed, an endless wood of pines, and consequently the path was altogether indiscernible in the murky darkness which surrounded them. The Highlander, however, seemed to trace it by instinct, without the hesitation of a moment, and Edward followed his footsteps <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|E
6000|$|Philammon, who {{was among}} the leaders, had recoiled too--he hardly knew why--at that stern apparition. His next {{instinct}} was to press forward <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dared.... And these were Roman soldiers!--the conquerors of the world!--the men whose name had thrilled him from his childhood with vague awe and admiration, dimly heard of {{up there in the}} lonely Laura.... Roman soldiers! And here he was face to face with them at last! ...|$|E
5|$|The Shelleys {{moved to}} Windsor {{in the summer}} of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his {{workload}} permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed his visits after their return, but <b>he</b> was no longer <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to them <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|R
60|$|The {{contention}} {{was pretty}} sharp for a time, but the obstinacy of the Englishman prevailed. The hunter gave in, {{and at once}} lay down straight out with {{his face to the}} cliff, and <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to it <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could squeeze. Lewis immediately lay down outside of him, and, throwing one arm over his Lecroix's broad chest gave him a half-jocular hug that a bear might have enjoyed, and told him to go to sleep. In doing this he dislodged a stone from the outer wall, which went clattering down into the dark gulf.|$|R
60|$|As I {{spoke the}} words I saw old Billali, who {{not being a}} man of war was keeping <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to us <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, go flat onto his venerable face, and {{reflected}} {{that he must have}} got a thrown spear through him. Casting a hurried glance at him to see if he were done for or only wounded, {{out of the corner of}} my eye I caught sight of something diaphanous which gleamed in the moonlight and reminded me of I knew not what at the moment.|$|R
