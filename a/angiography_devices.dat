40|$|Background: Nosocomial {{fungal infections}} could arise from {{independent}} exposure to airborne spores of filamentous fungi existing {{in the hospital}} environment [...] Objectives: The present study aimed to determine the mycoflora of indoor and outdoor environments of five major hospitals in Khorramabad, Iran.. Materials and Methods: Sampling of air was done from indoor and outdoor environments of wards, surroundings and green space of hospitals by settle plate method. To obtain the sample from surfaces, pre-moistened swabs with cotton-tipped sticks were applied on different surfaces (floor, the walls, windows, beds, trolleys, laryngoscope and <b>angiography</b> <b>devices).</b> Culture plates of air and surfaces on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and Malt Extract Agar (MEA) were incubated in the dark at 28 ºC and examined daily for fungal colonies {{for two to three}} weeks. Fungal isolates were identified by a combination of their macroscopic and microscopic criteria after purification on isolation culture media [...] Results: A total of 707 fungal colonies including, Penicillium (29. 14 %), Cladosporium (24. 04 %), Aspergillus (20. 65 %), Fusarium (9. 05 %), Alternaria (3. 96 %), Rhodotorula (1. 69 %), Cryptococcus neoformans (0. 7 %) and other fungi (10. 77 %) were isolated. All the examined high-risk parts of the hospitals were found to be contaminated by various fungi.. Conclusions: Aspergillus was the most prominent genus in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and surgery, Cladosporium in Critical Care Unit (CCU), emergency and thalassemia, and Penicillium in orthopedic, emergency and neonatal sections. Among pathogenic yeasts, C. neoformans was isolated from ICU, surgery and orthopedic sections. The dimorphic fungal pathogen, Sporothrix schenckii, was reported from CCU. The isolated fungi specially the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium are potential threats for immunocompromised patients in the hospitals...|$|E

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) {{is a less}} invasive procedure compared to traditional open surgery. It usually involves laparoscopic devices and remote control manipulation instruments comprising an endoscope for indirect observation of the surgical field. Interventional radiology (IVR) {{is one of the}} MIS methodologies. The IVR procedures include diagnosis such as angiograms, and treatment. The IVR procedures use small tubes called catheters, which are inserted through the body cavity or blood vessel to the treatment area. The IVR procedures lead to the risk of X-ray exposure to surgeon since the procedures is using the digital subtraction <b>angiography</b> <b>device</b> to get clear image of the patient blood vessel. Therefore, we have developed a foolproof tele-operated system to guide the catheter. Hence, the reliability in IVR procedure is crucial. The system is based on a mechatronic design methodology characterized by a principle solution specified in CONSENS® (CONceptual desig n Specification technique for the ENgineering of complex Systems). This principle solution serves as a basis for the first analysis and verification on the system level. Further, the proposed concept of control system can also be re-used in the other foolproof guidance systems...|$|R

Since these observations seem to not be merely sporadic, radiologists and cardiologists as well as vascular surgeons {{should be aware of}} their possible occurrence in order to avoid these complications and to provide promptly an adequate treatment...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Recent {{progress}} in digital subtraction <b>angiography</b> (DSA) <b>devices</b> {{makes it possible}} to perform rotational angiography with high resolution and high sensitivity. We tried intravenous (IV) 3 D DSA in patients who had undergone MR angiography (MRA) suggestive of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. IV 3 D DSA can be used as an alternative method for imaging unruptured intracranial aneurysms suggested on MRA. Cerebral angiography is an essential technique in the diag-nostic imaging and preoperative evaluation of cerebral an-eurysm; however, it is invasive and carries a certain risk of complications. 1 Intravenous (IV) digital subtraction angiog-raphy (DSA) has been used in some patients for the less inva-sive examination of cerebral, abdominal, and peripheral arter-ies. 2, 3 With the recent {{progress in}} DSA devices, it is possible to perform rotational angiographywith high resolution and high sensitivity. 4, 5 We performed IV 3 D DSA for the diagnosis of unruptured intracranial aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating, fatal syndrome. The {{economic}} {{burden on}} the health care system is rising. Optimal treatment implementation can prevent patient´s death. No registry data from Germany has yet been published. The aim of the registry was to evaluate potential differences in patient characteristics and health care provision in University Hospital (UH), Hospitals with facilities for interventional cardiology (IC), or Hospitals with general medicine departments (GM). This is a prospective, multicentre pilot-registry of HF patients hospitalized in Berlin from April 2009 and July 2010 with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40 %. The follow up is currently in progress. The TOP 40 registry documented significant differences in patient characteristics and in the diagnostic and therapeutic management at university and non-university hospitals. Patients in UH an IC were younger and more mobile. The multimorbidity of patients hospitalized in GM was higher. Beta Blocker were more often prescribed in UH and IC than in GM independent of age or existing comorbidities. Coronary <b>angiography</b> and <b>Device</b> therapy were more often performed in UH and IC than GM. UH seem to initiate device-therapies earlier and more often during routine care. On the other hand IC planned significantly more CRTs than UH and GM...|$|R
40|$|Background Flow {{diverter}} (FD) malapposition {{is associated}} with stroke-related complications. We document the use of self-expanding nitinol stents to remove/reduce the ledge of a FD deployed for aneurysm treatment. Methods We identified five patients who were treated with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) {{in conjunction with a}} Neuroform EZ stent for inadequate wall apposition of the ends of the FD at our institution between May 2014 and July 2015. Among other parameters, angiographic results, cone-beam computed tomography assessment of wall apposition and patient clinical outcome were evaluated. Results Incomplete device end apposition was seen in three cases, and precarious positioning of the distal end of the PED over the aneurysm neck was seen in two cases. In all five cases, successful treatment with good wall apposition and proper pinning of the PED distal edge was achieved using an additional Neuroform EZ stent. Appropriate aneurysm neck coverage and flow stagnation was seen in all cases. The combination of high radial outward force and open-cell design permits the Neuroform EZ stent to jail the malappositioned edges of the FD while maintaining good vessel-wall apposition itself and prevent migration of the PED. Short-term follow-up <b>angiography</b> showed <b>device</b> patency and complete aneurysm obliteration in all cases. Conclusions Preliminary results of this small case series suggest that the Neuroform EZ stent allows for effective treatment of FD malapposition in selected patients amenable for this endovascular approach. Long-term and larger cohort studies are needed to validate these results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess the {{incidence}} of cerebral ischemia in nonselected patients undergoing neuroprotected carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) without preceding multiple-vessel diagnostic <b>angiography.</b> BackgroundProtection <b>devices</b> to prevent distal embolization during CAS are presently under clinical investigation. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visualizes recent ischemia {{of the brain and}} may aid in assessing the efficacy of protection devices. MethodsElective CAS was performed in 42 consecutive patients (15 female, 27 male; mean age, 67 ± 9 years) using six different types of cerebral protection systems. All patients underwent MRI of the brain before and after a total of 44 interventions. ResultsPlacement and retrieval of the devices and stent deployment was achieved in all procedures. New ischemic foci were seen on postinterventional MRI in 10 cases (22. 7 %). One patient had sustained a major stroke, whereas no adverse neurological sequelae were associated with the other nine procedures. In the latter, one to three foci (maximum area 43. 0 mm 2) were detected in cerebral regions subtended by the ipsilateral carotid artery in eight cases and by the contralateral carotid artery in one case. In the stroke patient, 12 ischemic foci (maximum area 84. 5 mm 2) were exclusively located in the contralateral hemisphere. Follow-up MRI at 4. 1 months (median, n = 7) identified residuals of cerebral ischemia only in this patient. ConclusionsNeuroprotected CAS is associated in about 25 % of cases with predominantly silent cerebral ischemia. Our findings suggest manipulation of endoluminal equipment in the supraaortic vessels to be a major risk factor for cerebral embolism during neuroprotected CAS...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES:: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} adverse events recorded during critical care and mortality in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia. DESIGN:: Prospective, observational, registry-based study. SETTING:: Twenty-two hospitals in Europe and the United States. PATIENTS:: Between October 2004 and October 2008, 765 patients were included. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Arrhythmias (7 %- 14 %), pneumonia (48 %), metabolic and electrolyte disorders (5 %- 37 %), and seizures (24 %) were common adverse events in the critical care period in cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia, whereas sepsis (4 %) and bleeding (6 %) were less frequent. Sustained hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 8 mmol/L for > 4 hrs; odds ratio 2. 3, 95 % confidence interval 1. 6 - 3. 6, p <. 001) and seizures treated with anticonvulsants (odds ratio 4. 8, 95 % confidence interval 2. 9 - 8. 1, p <. 001) were associated with increased mortality in a multivariate model. An increased frequency of bleeding and sepsis occurred after invasive procedures (coronary <b>angiography,</b> intravascular <b>devices</b> for cooling, intra-aortic balloon pump), but bleeding and sepsis were not associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 1. 0, 95 % confidence interval 0. 46 - 2. 2, p =. 91, and odds ratio 0. 30, 95 % confidence interval 0. 12 - 0. 79, p =. 01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:: Adverse events were common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Sustained hyperglycemia and seizures treated with anticonvulsants were associated with increased mortality. Bleeding and infection were more common after invasive procedures, but these adverse events were not associated with increased mortality in our study...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{physiologic}} significance of coronary artery lesions with an integrated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography coronary <b>angiography</b> (CTCA) <b>device.</b> BackgroundMyocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with SPECT is of value for assessing the physiologic significance of coronary lesions. Computed tomography coronary angiography is a new technique to noninvasively detect coronary stenosis, with high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) but lower specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). The experimental SPECT/CTCA hybrid imaging device (Infinia gamma camera and LightSpeed 16 CT, General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) enables concurrent assessment of coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion. MethodsFifty-six patients with angina pectoris underwent single-session SPECT-MPI and CTCA with the hybrid <b>device</b> and coronary <b>angiography</b> (CA) within 4 weeks. The ability of fused SPECT/CTCA images to diagnose physiologically significant lesions showing > 50 % stenosis and reversible perfusion defects in the same territory was determined and compared with CTCA stand-alone. ResultsOf a total of 224 coronary segments in 56 patients, 12 patients and 54 segments (23 %) were excluded from further analysis of CTCA. Overall, 170 coronary segments were evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CTCA were 96 %, 63 %, 31 %, and 99 %, respectively, as compared with 96 %, 95 %, 77 %, and 99 %, respectively, for SPECT/CTCA. ConclusionsHybrid SPECT/CTCA imaging results in improved specificity and PPV to detect hemodynamically significant coronary lesions in patients with chest pain. Single-photon emission computed tomography/CTCA might play a potentially important role in the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease and introduce an objective decision-making tool for assessing the need for interventions in each occluded vessel...|$|R
40|$|Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} (OHCA) {{is a common}} lethal health problem. Despite {{significant}} advances in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} cardiovascular disease, OHCA continues to be a major challenge with unacceptably high mortality and morbidity. Although most research into OHCA has focused on improving rates of return of circulation, many patients die in the post resuscitative period from a unique set of physiological insults, collectively termed the post cardiac arrest syndrome. Over the last decade several clinical trials have highlighted the importance of post-resuscitative care in optimizing survival and neurological recovery. Recently, there have been significant advances in management including recommendations related to regional systems of care, application of therapeutic hypothermia and the utilization of investigative procedures including emergent coronary <b>angiography,</b> cardiac support <b>devices</b> and other tools which provide prognostic information. Despite these advances there has been poor uptake of post-resuscitative care guidelines with significant differences in clinical outcomes between regions and institutions.

The Journal of {{ophthalmic}} photography, 17 (2), 1995, 54 - 60 authorWe modified a Zeiss Model- 211 photo slitlamp {{by adding}} a fluorescein fundus photography barrier filter and compared its clinical usefulness for performing iris fluorescein angiography (FA) with two standard FA-capable photo slit-lamps, Zeiss 40 -SL and Kowa SC- 1200. We evaluated flash intensity, light transmission, filter transmission characteristics, density range on film in response to fluorescence, flash recharge time, and clinical applicability. We obtained the following results from Model- 211, the 40 -SL, and the SC- 1200, respectively: maximum flash exposure, 500, 000, 96, 000, and 26, 000 lux; light transmission from an objective lens through the camera, 350, 120, and 66 lux; minimum useful density of fluorescence, 0. 9 x 10 7, 0. 4 x 10 - 6, and 0. 8 x 10 - 6 g/ml; and flash recharge time, 2. 0, 6. 0, and 1. 0 seconds. The filter permeability rates of the three devices were similar. Small iris vessels were seen more clearly with the modified Zeiss Model- 211 than {{with the other two}} systems, although the exposure with each magnification must be varied because of the changing light transmission with each magnification. We conclude that our system is clinically useful and superior to othercommercial units for imaging of small blood vessels. Fluorescein angiography (FA) of the anterior segment is widely used to evaluate disease progression and treatment efficacy [1 - 5]. This technique requires a filter designed for use in a photo slit-lamp and a high-intensity light source to replace the beamsplitter intended for stereoscopic viewing. The new light source must also allow rapid serial <b>angiography.</b> Since <b>devices</b> meeting these conditions are more expensive than conventional photo slit-lamps, their widespread use is limited. In the present study, we modified an existing photo slit-lamp (Model- 211, Zeiss Jena, Oberkochen, Germany) {{by adding a}} fluorescein fundus photography barrier filter. We report herein the angiographic results from this low-cost modification compared with other commercially available FA-capable photo slit-lamps...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{assessed}} {{the advantages and}} shortcomings of methods for hemostasis in patients who had received angiography after femoral arterial puncture using manual, compression device, {{or a combination of}} manual compression and a compression device. In addition, the success rates, complications, etc, were analyzed. [Subjects and Methods] One hundred and eighty patients who had undergone angiography after femoral arterial puncture were divided into three groups according to the method of hemostasis. For group A, immediately after <b>angiography,</b> an Angio-Seal <b>device</b> was placed in the puncture area and compressed using a compression device. For group B, after angiography, the puncture area was compressed with the hands directly. For group C, the punc-ture area was compressed using a compression device for approximately 10 min, and the puncture area was then compressed with the hands. In each group, the following correlations were analyzed: the time to hemostasis after angiography and gender, the time to hemostasis of each generation and the hemoglobin value, and platelet value and the time to hemostasis. [Results] The results showed a similar time to hemostasis regardless of gender or genera-tion. The correlation between the hemoglobin value, platelet value, and the time to hemostasis were not significant. Group A showed the shortest mean time to hemostasis of the three groups (20. 37 ± 8. 23 min). No complications caused by the hemostasis method were detected in group B. Group A showed the highest incidence of complica-tions caused by hemostasis. [Conclusion] Overall, hemostasis performed mutually is safe and effective for patients according to their condition...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND PDA device closure is an {{important}} nonsurgical method of treatment. Device size estimation depends upon the accurate assessment of the morphology {{and size of the}} PDA. Although, angiography is the gold standard for estimation {{of the size of the}} PDA, 2 D echo and colour Doppler are comparable noninvasive alternatives. Put together, the three modalities are useful in fairly accurate estimation of the PDA size and prevention of complications like device embolisation or incomplete ductal closure. The purpose of this study is to compare PDA measurements made by 2 D echo and colour Doppler with those made by angiography in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. MATERIALS AND METHODS 15 cases of PDA referred to Osmania General Hospital between August 2013 and August 2016 were included in the study. All the cases were assessed with 2 D echo, colour Doppler and <b>angiography</b> and underwent <b>device</b> closure. PDA size estimated by 2 D echo colour Doppler and angiography were compared and statistically analysed. RESULTS The patient ages ranged from 5 yrs. to 32 yrs. with a mean age of 14 ± 8. 5 yrs. There were 10 females and 5 males. As regards the type of PDA, all of them belonged to the A type based on Krichenko’s classification. The mean diameter of pulmonary end measured 6. 1 ± 2. 56 mm by 2 D echo, 5. 03 ± 1. 9 mm by colour Doppler, 5. 32 ± 2. 17 mm by angiography. The mean diameter of aortic end measured 9. 4 ± 2. 3 mm by 2 D echo, 8. 1 ± 2. 19 mm by colour Doppler, 8. 4 ± 2. 29 mm by angiography. Both 2 D echo and colour Doppler measurements correlated significantly with angiographic measurements at both pulmonary and aortic ends. The Pearson correlation coefficient for 2 D echo and colour Doppler are 0. 927 and 0. 977 respectively at the pulmonary end indicating that CDE correlates marginally better than 2 D echo with angiographic measurements at the pulmonary end. However, a larger sample size is needed to prove this. At the aortic end (ampulla), the Pearson correlation coefficient for 2 D echo and colour Doppler are 0. 896 and 0. 969 respectively indicating that CDE correlates with angiography better than 2 D echo. CONCLUSION The M:F ratio in the present study. The commonest type of the ductus in the present study is the type A based on Krichenko’s 1 classification. Both 2 D echo and colour Doppler correlated significantly with angiographic estimation of PDA size, but colour Doppler correlated slightly better than 2 D echo. A larger sample size is needed to prove the same. Measurement of the aortic end of the ductus with colour Doppler when compared to pulmonary end correlated more significantly with angiography than 2 D echo...|$|R
