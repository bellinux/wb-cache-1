50|$|In {{the western}} style of raku firing, the <b>aluminium</b> <b>container</b> {{acts as a}} {{reduction}} chamber, which is a container that allows the carbon dioxide to pass through a small hole. A reduction atmosphere is created by closing the container. A reduction atmosphere induces a reaction between oxygen and the clay minerals, which affects the color. It also affects the metal elements of the glaze. Reduction is a decrease in oxidation number. Closing the can reduces the oxygen content after the combustible materials such as sawdust catch fire and forces the reaction to pull oxygen from the glazes and the clay minerals. For example, luster gets its color from deprivation of oxygen. The reduction agent is a substance from which electrons are being taken by another substance. The reaction uses oxygen from the atmosphere within the reduction tube, and, to continue, it receives {{the rest of the}} oxygen from the glazes. This leaves ions and iridescent luster behind. This creates a metallic effect. Pieces with no glaze have nowhere to get the oxygen from, so they take it from clay minerals. This atmosphere will turn clay black, making a matte color.|$|E

40|$|Oleoresin of pine (Pinus merkusii) is a Non Wood Forest Products {{commodity}} from West Sumatra. This oleoresin {{was obtained}} by tapping pine trees with square system followed by light burning to stimulate more oleoresin exudate to bleed. This research was carried out to assess the effect of storage time and kind of plastic laminated container for pine resin collected from the field with square tapped method, on rosin recovery rate and its physico­chemical properties. Prior to distillation, the pine oleoresin was kept in two kinds of containers, i. e. plastic laminated steel and plastic laminated aluminium. The distillation of pine oleoresin kept in plastic laminated container produced about 58 ­ 63 % of rosin and 20 ­ 26 % of turpentine oil, respectively. Meanwhile, the distillation products of pine oleoresin previously kept in plastic laminated aluminium amounted to 56 ­ 63 % of rosin recovery and 22 ­ 27 % of turpentine. Analysis of variance of the experimental results indicated that container and storage time caused significant effect on ash content of rosin.

40|$|Elevated {{aluminium}} {{levels in}} fruit juice, particularly in apple juice, were {{measured by the}} official food control authorities. The cause was the incorrect storage of juice in <b>aluminium</b> <b>containers</b> that were not coated with varnish. As aluminium is dissolved by acid-containing and salt-containing food, the metal was able to migrate to the juice. In the case of short-term dietary intake, aluminium is scarcely harmful at all. In the case of elevated, long-term intake, aluminium can, however, lead to brittle bones, anaemia and brain damage in humans. In animal studies it was shown that low doses of the substance can already impair reproduction and the developing nervous system. Hence the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has established for the lifelong intake of aluminium a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 milligram (mg) per kilogram body weight. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken a health assessment of aluminium uptake from apple juice. It also took into account other possible dietary sources of aluminium intake by consumers. The substance may be contained as a food additive for instance in confectionery, may migrate to food from food-contact articles like cooking utensils or aluminium foil or may be contained naturally in food (fruit, vegetables, cereals, soya, meat). Hence, {{in the opinion of}} BfR, at most 50 % of the TWI value should be exhausted by fruit juice including apple juice. Because of the expected migration of aluminium to food, BfR recommends that this metal should not in principle be used in contact with acid-containing and salt-containing food and beverages.

40|$|The fully {{automated}} in-situ measuring system SIOUX (Stratospheric Observation Unit for nitrogen oXides) {{has been developed}} and established under flight conditions. SIOUX is a two channel measuring device designed for the high-altitude research aircraft M 55 -Geophysica to record reactive nitrogen oxides in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Channel A detects nitric oxide (NO) and channel B the total reactive nitrogen (NO_y), which is reduced to NO {{on the surface of}} a heated gold-converter in conjunction with carbon monoxide (CO) as reducing agent. The technique used for the measurement of NO is chemiluminescence. The detection limit of channel A is 6 pmol/mol and of channel B 10 pmol/mol for an integration time of 1 s. The main components of SIOUX are the sample inlet, the detector incorporating the reaction chambers, photomultipliers and ozone generators, the converter, a pumping system, a calibration/operation gas system and the data recording unit. Except for the sample inlet all components are housed in a pressurised <b>aluminium</b> <b>container.</b> This has a length of 1. 1 m, a diameter of 0. 6 m and a total mass of 250 kg; the maximum power consumption of SIOUX is 1300 W. For aeronautical compliance four test procedures were required to guarantee the flight compatibility of the mechanics and electronics of the device: shock/vibration/EMC(ElectroMagneticCompatibility) /pressure test. In October 2001 SIOUX was implemented for the first time aboard the M 55 -Geophysica during a test campaign in Russia. There, the measuring system was monitored under flight conditions and its operation was established for stratospheric conditions. Mixing ratios for NO and NO_y were registered up to an altitude of 20 km. In July 2002 SIOUX was used aboard the M 55 -Geophysica for validation the ENVISAT instrument MIPAS-E in Italy. A comparison was made for the first time between MIPAS-E measurements of nitric acid (HNO_ 3) and SIOUX measurements of NO_y-NO_x (#approx#HNO_ 3 in the altitude range 17 - 20 km).

40|$|Americium {{is a minor}} {{actinide}} making {{an important component of}} high level nuclear waste. A considerable number of studies have been performed or are ongoing to determine cross sections for neutron-induced reactions on 241 Am. Recently, two measurements of the neutron-induced capture reaction on 241 Am were performed at the n_TOF facility of CERN. One of these measurements used the C 6 D 6 detectors, the other used the BaF 2 calorimeter. In both cases, a sample from IRMM was used that had been prepared at ITU [1]. This sample consisted of 241 AmO 2 which was dispersed in a matrix of Al 2 O 3. The material was pressed into a disk, calcined and enclosed in an <b>aluminium</b> <b>container.</b> It contained about 40 mg of 241 Am. The samples had been prepared for measurements of the 241 Am(n, 2 n) 240 Am reaction cross section [2]. Further details about the sample and these measurements may be found in [1, 2]. During the measurements at CERN it was noted that several high energy gamma-rays were emitted by the sample. This presented the question as to the exact energies and origin of these gamma-rays. For this purpose the sample was returned to IRMM and gamma-ray spectroscopy with a high purity germanium (HPGe) detector was performed. The energy and origin of most gamma-rays was determined in this way. Here we report about these measurements paying attention only to gamma-rays that are not known from the decay of 241 Am [3] and to the gamma-ray energy range from 844 keV to 13 MeV. There are two mechanisms leading to gamma-ray emission. First there is the natural activity of 241 Am and the three known actinide impurities: 237 Np (0. 021), 233 - 236, 238 U (0. 000094) and 239, 240 Pu (0. 0017; fractions by weight). Of these 241 Am dominates the spectrum, even after applying absorbers to completely stop the 59 keV transition. From the main impurity, 237 Np, no gammas are found but there are those of its daughter, 233 Pa. For the other actinide impurities and their descendants no gamma-rays were found in the measurement. The second source of gamma-rays are alpha-induced reactions. For energies below the maximum alpha energy of 5. 485 MeV, Q-values, thresholds and main characteristic gamma-rays are given in table 1 for the likely candidate reactions. Reactions conclusively identified are 27 Al(alpha,alpha’gamma) 27 Al, and 27 Al(alpha,p) 30 Si and these explain nearly everything besides the 241 Am and 233 Pa gammas already discussed. There is a clear indication for the 27 Al(alpha,n) 30 P reaction, but for the 27 Al(alpha,gamma) 31 P reaction the evidence is not conclusive due to an overlap with gammas from 30 Si. No evidence was found for alpha-induced reactions on the isotopes of oxygen. The measurements are described in the section Experiment. A table with gamma-ray energies and figures with the gamma-ray spectra are given in the section Results. The origin of these gammas is indicated there as well. Only three gamma-rays remain unattributed. A spectrum taken at CERN with a germanium detector showing many additional lines cannot be confirmed. Most likely this was taken under very poor background conditions. JRC. DG. D. 5 -Nuclear physic...|$|E

Även fjällen har fått extrema regn men då främst under längre tid, en vecka upp till 30 dagar. This {{study shows}} that, in general, extreme {{precipitation}} {{has increased from}} 1900 until the 1930 s and then reduced until the 1970 s, before increasing until the present day. There is moreextreme precipitation now than in the 1930 s. In particular an accumulation of extreme precipitation in Götaland (the southern part ofSweden) has been seen during the 2000 s. It has been noted that the greatest precipitation inSweden usually occurs in July or August {{but there are some}} exceptions for different parts of thecountry and different seasons. We need to be careful about extrapolating the last 40 years increase into the future in the beliefthat the increase will continue. This report says nothing about the future, and those interested inextreme precipitation in a future climate should study the results of climate models thatcalculate future scenarios. Areas affected by the worst downpours during one day are mainly the southern coast ofNorrland, Svealand, eastern Götaland and Skåne. Western Götaland, in particular centralHalland, is often affected by large precipitation volumes but does not usually receive thehighest amounts. The mountains have also had extreme rainfall but usually during a longerperiod of time – from a week up to 30 days. This report describes extreme precipitation lasting from 1 to 30 days during 112 years, between 1900 and 2011. Only digital data has been used to compile the information in this report. Alarge proportion of precipitation data before 1961 is unfortunately only available in paperformat and could not be used in this study. Prior to 1961, there were only about 60 digital stations, but since 1961 there have been about 700 operational stations. A digitalisation project is being carried out at SMHI to transfer datafrom paper logs to digital form {{so that it can be}} processed by computer programs. This is alarge project that will take many years to complete. Sixty stations with a time series of at least 100 years between 1900 and 2011 have beenselected to describe how extreme precipitation has varied over 112 years. These stations arefairly evenly distributed throughout the country. Calculating recurrence times required stationswith at least 25 years of data during the period 1961 – 2011, which means that over 670 stationshave been used. All precipitation measurements are associated with errors due to for example aerodynamicproblems and evaporation, which often leads to an underestimation of the precipitation volume. This study has focused on extreme precipitation which often falls in the form of large raindrops. The underestimation is assumed to be less than an average of 5 – 10 %. There has been a gradual improvement in the quality of the precipitation measurements due tothe introduction of wind shields around the rain gauges up until 1935 and a switch from zinccontainers to seamless <b>aluminium</b> <b>containers</b> (without the risk of leakage) up until the start ofthe 1960 s. After that, precipitation has been measured in the same way until 1996 when around 100 of the 750 stations were changed to a new type of automatic gauge with a different type ofwind shield. This report makes no attempt at homogenising the data, and uses the observedvalues directly. There is however a discussion on different error sources. Variations in extreme precipitation during the 112 -year period of study have been described inthis report for Sweden as a whole but also for different seasons and for different parts of thecountry: Northern Norrland, southern Norrland, Svealand and Götaland. The most extremecases have been analysed using maps with a short descriptive text. Recurrence times ofprecipitation volumes with different durations are calculated and presented on a map...|$|R
