Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed the violence of the explosion in his own body.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob {{is often}} seen hanging around with his best friend Patrick, who lives on the same street as him. SpongeBob's {{unlimited}} optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> happier than they actually are; for instance, he believes that Squidward enjoys his company {{in spite of the}} fact that he clearly loathes him. SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is in a boat. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Houphouët {{was called}} by his tribe to assume the responsibilities of village chief. Preferring to pursue his medical career, he relinquished the office to his younger brother Augustin. Wishing to live closer to his village, he obtained a transfer to Dimbokro on 3 February 1934 and then to Toumodi on 28 June 1936. While Houphouët had displayed professional qualities, his attitude had chafed those <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> a result, in September 1938, his clinical director demanded that he choose between {{his job as a}} doctor and his involvement in local politics. The choice was quickly made for him: his brother died in 1939, and Houphouët became chef de canton (an office created by the colonial administration to collect taxes). Due to this, Houphouët ended his medical career the next year.|$|E

With Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass, the band formed <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> The Jimi Hendrix Experience became major stars in the UK, with three top ten hits in early 1967. it was followed later that year by the psychedelic album Are You Experienced?, which became a major hit in the US after Hendrix's triumphant return at the Monterey Pop Festival and {{made him one of}} the major figures of late 60s rock.|$|E

While traveling {{in this part}} of Sweden, Höckert used the scenery <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> inspiration for his paintings, including Gustav Vasa och Tomt Margit, which is now displayed at Utmelandsmonumentet in Mora, Dalarna. Other paintings set in Dalarna include: Kulla med psalmbok (1859–60), Höskörd vid Siljan, Rättvikskulla vid spiseln (1862), and Gudmors besök (1865).|$|E
25|$|As Joey {{tentatively}} {{enters the}} stage space, he is {{met with a}} spontaneous ovation sparked by the immediacy of the live moment, in turn aided {{by the fact that}} Kohler and Jones never stray from the game that dictates they treat him as a live horse. This playful notion helps Joey’s creators invite the audience to believe in his aliveness, and the audience succumbs, not only for his lifelike movement, but also for the way he is activated by those <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> both creators and performers, Jones and Kohler soothe Joey’s “nervousness,” and a planned moment when Joey “notices” the audience elicits a generous laugh. Joey shies, nervously clops his hooves, and nickers gently to demonstrate alarm. He sniffs Kohler’s jacket pocket, as he “knows” there is a snack in there. Later, when Jones crosses the stage to demonstrate a feature, he is careful not to walk behind Joey, lest he is kicked. The audience must believe he will not be kicked – only a spiteful puppeteer could activate such a trick – but Jones’s conviction that he should respect the animal’s space foregrounds the moment’s liveness and heightens the audience’s engagement. Finally, a jockey is introduced, and Joey patiently holds still while he is mounted. Joey accepts the rider’s weight without complaint, comfortably parades around the stage, and swiftly exits before the effect is mundane. For the entire time that Joey inhabits the stage, the audience is noticeably spellbound.|$|E

25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the death of}} Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a small brown stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he charged forward, but {{neither he nor his}} horse were hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol on his cheek, and white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, then he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking off in the distance. Curly’s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning bolt on his cheek and the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior’s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior's prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except for when he was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.|$|E

It was written by Steve Young, directed by Bob Anderson, and features a cameo by Jon Lovitz as Jay Sherman from The Critic. In the episode, [...] "Hurricane Barbara" [...] viciously strikes Springfield but, by pure chance, the house of Ned Flanders {{is the only one}} destroyed.

Hutton said that the pair was the most hostile that he faced during his career. Alan Davidson, a bowling all rounder who supported Lindwall and Miller for New South Wales and Australia, said that [...] "Ray Lindwall was the best bowler I ever saw of any type; his control was just perfect. At the other end you had Miller, who was unpredictable...It really was a perfect team." [...] He was an acrobatic slips fielder, who would take freakish catches with nonchalant ease, often immediately returning to his discussion with those <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> if nothing was unusual.|$|E
500|$|Moustache's {{greatest}} {{achievement is}} said to have taken place at Austerlitz. [...] De Fivas states that Moustache went into battle with the cuirassiers and was present when the regimental standard bearer was surrounded by Austrian soldiers. [...] The standard bearer apparently killed three Austrians before he was himself cut down, wrapping the flag <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he fell to prevent its capture. [...] It is at this point that de Fivas alleges that Moustache confronted the five or six remaining Austrians and was about to be bayoneted when the group was hit by a blast of artillery grapeshot. [...] Moustache, wounded in the leg, is reputed to have torn the flag off the body of the standard bearer and returned it to the French camp.|$|E
500|$|The Turks adopted al-Battal {{following}} the Danishmendid conquest of Malatya in 1102, {{and he became}} prominent as a Turkish national hero, {{as a symbol of}} the revived frontier spirit of the jihad of early Muslim times, and of the Turkish conquest of Asia Minor. His stories (Battalname) were reworked throughout the Seljuk and Ottoman periods, and he became the subject of a considerable body of folk tales. Thus, according to the 14th-century geographer Abu'l-Fida, based on the 13th-century work of Ibn Sa'id, the river Dalaman çayı, which formed the boundary between the lands of the Seljuk Turks and the Empire of Nicaea, was known as the [...] "River of Battal". A cult developed <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a saintly figure ("sayyid"), especially among the Alevi and Bektashi sects, and his supposed tomb at Seyitgazi became a major centre of pilgrimage until the early 20th century, drawing pilgrims from as far as Central Asia.|$|E

He was also the highest money-earning horse and only the fourth two-year-old to be named World Champion. During his first year of racing, he started 26times, won22 and placed (came in second) in another three. Most two-year-old Quarter Horses race on average under five times in their first year of racing, and the average for all ages is just over five starts per year. Many people criticized Merrick for {{starting}} Easy Jet so often. Merrick said, however, [...] "You had to run him about once every ten days or he'd have got so high you couldn't hardly stand to be <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> long as we were going to run him, we figured we might as well make it count for something." [...] Despite all of the starts, Easy Jet had enough energy to be difficult to handle; in this respect, he was considered high-spirited rather than mean.|$|E
500|$|On Saturday 16 November, the Imperial Family were {{confined}} in the palace, {{surrounded by a}} cavalry regiment. Pedro II continued reading scientific magazines and appeared calm throughout the day. At 3 p.m, Major Frederico Solón Sampaio Ribeiro informed the Imperial Family that the Republic had been proclaimed and that they must leave the country for exile within 24hours. The [...] "republicans had no courage to meet the Emperor, whom they secretly admired, face to face" [...] and therefore sent low-ranking officers to communicate with him. Solón, when complimenting the Emperor, called him first [...] "Your Excellency", then [...] "Your Highness" [...] and lastly [...] "Your Majesty". Although clearly deposed, the Emperor was still much respected by those <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> illustrated by the parley between him and Solón. The notice of banishment caused the women to weep, while the men struggled to remain calm—with the exception of Pedro II, who remained impassive. The monarch resolved to travel {{the afternoon of the}} following day and sent a written message to the Provisional Government stating that he agreed to leave the country.|$|E
500|$|Life Begins was {{inspired}} by Bullen's re-evaluation {{of the lives of}} people <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> they approached 40 years old. During a conversation with a friend he realised that three women he knew had had failed marriages {{by the time they reached}} 40. The series was designed as a vehicle for actress Sarah Lancashire, who had signed an exclusive [...] "golden handcuffs" [...] deal with ITV. Two months after the series was announced, Lancashire left Life Begins, feeling unable to commit to a potentially long-running series. ITV replaced Lancashire with Caroline Quentin. Life Begins concerns Maggie Mee, who believes she is in a loving relationship with her husband Phil (Alexander Armstrong). When Phil announces on a family holiday that he is leaving her, she realises that she must begin her life again. Bullen wrote the series with John Forte. The first series was broadcast in 2004. As with Cold Feet, he integrated events from his own life into the storylines; Maggie's father suffers from Alzheimer's disease as does one of Bullen's own relatives. He researched Maggie's travel agency job by spending a week at a travel agents' in Bristol.|$|E

500|$|While at Libourne Saint-Seurin, Valbuena's play {{went through}} an upgrade. In {{his first season}} at the club, he {{struggled}} for meaningful minutes under coach André Menot, playing in 20 league matches and scoring two goals. Menot was fired mid-season {{and was replaced by}} Didier Tholot. The club ultimately finished the season in 13th place in the league. In the next season, manager Tholot took immediate notice of Valbuena. Tholot described Valbuena as [...] "the architect of the team" [...] and sought to build the team <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Valbuena's playing time improved dramatically. He played in 31 league matches and scored nine goals, all of which came in victories. Valbuena earned rave reviews for his performances, but still suffered criticism on occasion due to [...] "wanting to do everything" [...] as stated by Tholot. On 12 August 2005, he scored his first goal of the season in a 2–0 win over Moulins. Two weeks later, Valbuena scored a double in a 3–1 victory away to Cherbourg. One low-point during the season came on 9 September 2005 in Libourne's 2–1 defeat to Gazélec Ajaccio when Valbuena received his first-ever red card. The loss was the team's first of the season and Valbuena was suspended for three matches. Valbuena returned to the team on 7 October in a 1–0 loss to Bayonne.|$|E
500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E
500|$|... "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was generally, {{though not}} universally, well {{received}} among critics.

He complimented Robert Carlock for [...] " [...] in on the narcissistic worldview" [...] of the Dennis character as it [...] "cranked those qualities up to appropriately absurd 30 Rock proportions." [...] In addition, Sepinwall wrote that all of the elements featured in the episode [...] "all came together". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was similarly laudatory, writing that it was [...] "one of the most explosively hysterical and imaginative half hours of TV this season, and one of this show's best episodes ever". Time contributor James Poniewozik was favorable to the episode, observing that it was [...] "asily the funniest 30 Rock in months, and probably the whole season." [...] Poniewozik said it [...] "nailed it, from the too-many-good-jokes... to the sweet heart at the center of each character." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Adam West's cameo, but noted that Tracy's plot [...] "felt awfully shticky and sitcommy to me." [...] He opined that [...] "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was [...] "pretty great" [...] for Jane Krakowski's Jenna, and in conclusion, Rabin said [...] "I had initially pegged this episode as good but not great and essentially minor {{in the grand scheme of}} things but while writing this post I came to realize just how much of it I loved. 30 Rock is pretty great even when it's not that great." [...] Rick Porter, a contributor for Zap2it, said he [...] "loved" [...] the episode, writing that it made [...] "perfect sense" [...] for Kenneth to see everyone <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> muppets, and noted that Liz's commercial was a [...] "strong ending" [...] to the episode.|$|E
