500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent {{in such a way that}} it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
60|$|The King {{continued}} to stare <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were a human curiosity.|$|E
60|$|Ann {{was still}} looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{undergone}} a change into something new and strange.|$|E
60|$|Smike looked vacantly <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{unable to}} {{comprehend}} his meaning.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her soul {{were lost in}} her music, with unseeing eyes.|$|R
60|$|COKESON. [Looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to {{encourage}} <b>him</b> {{to complete the}} sentence] A leetle more, sir.|$|R
60|$|Eugene Wrayburn {{looked on}} <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> found him {{beginning}} to be rather an entertaining study.|$|E
60|$|The Captain looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were half}} {{inclined}} to unburden his {{mind of a}} capital joke.|$|E
60|$|Gride looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were petrified with astonishment, {{but did not}} speak; perhaps {{lacking the}} power.|$|E
60|$|Rosa looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she would}} have liked him to be the {{recipient}} of a thousand dedications.|$|R
60|$|The yeoman {{still stood}} {{in a sort of}} trance, gazing <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> unable to tear himself away.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{fell back}} {{a step or}} two, and looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in doubt whether she had heard aright.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were noble. Her {{love for him}} was so generous that it beautified him.|$|E
60|$|The old {{man looked}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{curious to know}} what he meant, but scorned to prolong the conversation.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} quite still, hearing, but washed all wan {{and without}} feeling. She waited, looking <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were some curious, not-understandable creature.|$|E
60|$|She was silent, {{and looked}} wonderingly, a little fearfully, <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> vague, {{disturbing}} thoughts were entering {{the fringe of}} her mind.|$|R
60|$|ANN. [looking quickly <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{this were}} a new light] Surely you are not so absurd as to be jealous of Tavy.|$|R
60|$|While Charlie Brooke was speaking, {{the poor}} invalid was {{breathing}} hard and gazing <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to make quite {{sure it was}} all true.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayn't I {{come down}} with you?" [...] added Sam, looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to make the}} most of every moment of that presence.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Pickett looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{disappointed}} her. [...] "I {{had always}} heard you spoken of {{as a man}} with common sense, Mr. Snyder." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bender looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{cut some}} {{irrelevant}} caper. [...] "Then if they don't sell their ancestors {{where in the}} world are all the ancestors bought?" ...|$|E
60|$|The old fellow's eyes twinkled, {{while the}} other men ceased talking, and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> anticipating {{something}} good in reply to my question.|$|R
60|$|The senator's son faced Link Merwell and Job Haskers, {{and both}} stared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they were looking}} at a ghost, and backed away.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{want you}} to steal over where Mr. Gobbler is strutting,' said she, 'and {{suddenly}} spring out <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you intended to catch him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DEARTH (the {{only one}} who is undaunted). A second chance! (She is looking at her husband. They all look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been a leader once.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothin'." [...] After a pause, {{in which}} he walked all round Uncle Ben's large figure, gazing up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were a monument, he added, [...] "Huntin' blackberrieth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course it's me; who did {{you think}} it was?" [...] replied Johnny Chuck rather crossly, for Peter was staring <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had never seen him before.|$|E
6000|$|Ginger stared <b>at</b> <b>’im</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> ’e couldn’t believe ’is eyes. [...] "Playing?" [...] he ses, feeling ’is face {{very gently}} with {{the tips of}} his fingers.|$|R
60|$|He {{surprised}} {{them out}} of their self possession at last. Both started, and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they could not believe the evidence of their ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{suppose you}} cared for my objections, {{so long as}} I amused you." [...] She {{suddenly}} glanced <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> terrified <b>at</b> her own words.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{appeared}} {{to him in}} a totally new light. He stared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were some strange creature hitherto unknown to the human race. Mike shuffled uneasily beneath the scrutiny.|$|E
60|$|The old man now looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{no longer}} saw him, and Bartley went out, balked of his purpose in part, {{and in that}} degree so much the more embittered.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, the {{military}} preacher abandoned his leafy screen, and stalking forward, stood unexpectedly before the old cavalier, who stared <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had thought his expressions had actually raised a devil.|$|E
6000|$|Then, <b>as</b> Percy looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to {{be certain}} {{he was in his}} senses, 'I don't expect others to see it; it is only one expression.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! what!' cried Alice and Geraldine both together; while Wilmet looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she wished}} {{to put him in}} mind of the {{presence}} of a stranger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cassandra {{never doubted}} for a moment. But we--" [...] she glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to {{ascertain}} his position, [...] "we {{see each other}} only now and then--" ...|$|R
