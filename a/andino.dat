5|$|In Puerto Rico {{there were}} many minor slave revolts in which the slaves clashed with the {{military}} establishment. In July 1821, Marcos Xiorro, a bozal slave, planned and organized a conspiracy against the slave masters and the colonial government of Puerto Rico. According to his plot, {{which was to be}} carried out on July 27, during the festival celebrations for Santiago (St. James), several slaves were to escape from various plantations in Bayamón, which included the haciendas of Angus McBean, C. Kortnight, Miguel <b>Andino</b> and Fernando Fernández. They were then to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve cutlasses and swords which were hidden in those fields. Xiorro, together with a slave from the McBean plantation named Mario and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves of Bayamón and Toa Baja and capture the city of Bayamón. They would then burn the city and kill those who were not black. After this, they would all unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of Río Piedras, Guaynabo and Palo Seco. With this critical mass of slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would then invade the capital city of San Juan, where they would declare Xiorro as their king. Unfortunately for the slave conspirators, the plot was divulged by a fellow slave to the authorities.|$|E

Vicente Mejía Colindres, however, resisted pressure from his own party to manipulate the results to favor the Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras, PLH) candidate, Angel Zúñiga Huete. As a result, the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras, PNH) candidate, Tiburcio Carías <b>Andino,</b> won the election by a margin of some 20,000 votes. On November 16, 1932, Carías assumed office, beginning what was to be the longest period of continuous rule by an individual in Honduran history.|$|E

Reed discovers Teresa's real name is Magdalena Rojas, and she runs the cartel.

25|$|The October 1923 Honduran presidential {{elections}} and the subsequent political and military conflicts provided the first real tests of these new treaty arrangements. Under heavy pressure from Washington, López Gutiérrez allowed an unusually open campaign and election. The long-fragmented conservatives had reunited {{in the form of}} the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras, PNH), which ran as its candidate General Tiburcio Carías <b>Andino,</b> the governor of the department of Cortés. However, the liberal PLH was unable to unite around a single candidate and split into two groups, one supporting former president Policarpo Bonilla, the other advancing the candidacy of Juan Angel Arias. As a result, no candidate secured a majority. Carías received the greatest number of votes, with Bonilla second, and Arias a distant third. By the terms of the Honduran constitution, this stalemate left the final choice of president up to the legislature, but that body was unable to obtain a quorum and reach a decision.|$|E
40|$|La presencia de osos <b>andinos</b> (Tremarctos ornatus) en Argentina ha sido muy discutida {{debido a}} la ausencia de evidencia confirmativa. Muchos expertos en el oso dudan {{actualmente}} de su presencia en el país. No obstante, la Selva Tucumano-Boliviana o de Yungas es un ecosistema típico donde se puede encontrar esta especie; particularmente en el área estudiada, el hábitat parece ser de alta calidad para los osos. Entre los años 2001 y 2006, se recopilaron 23 casos de evidencia sobre la presencia de osos <b>andinos</b> en las provincias de Salta y Jujuy. Se registraron huellas, restos alimenticios y heces. Adicionalmente, se entrevistó a nativos, agricultores y cazadores para colectar otros datos sobre la especie. Se concluye que las selvas de Yungas del extremo noroeste de Argentina, deben ser consideradas un área con alta probabilidad de mantener una población residente de osos <b>andinos.</b> Aunque posiblemente esta sea una población aislada y pequeña, la presencia permanente de osos <b>andinos</b> en el noroeste de Argentina no debería ser puesta en duda. The presence of Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in Argentina has been disputed {{due to the}} absence of confirming evidence. Many Andean bear experts currently doubt on their presence in this country. Nevertheless, the Tucuman-Bolivian Forest or Yungas is a typical ecosystem where this species can be found, particularly in the studied area, in which the habitat appears to be of high quality for bears. Between 2001 and 2006, 23 cases of evidence on the presence of Andean bears in the provinces of Salta and Jujuy were recorded. Footprints, food remains and scats were found. In addition, natives, farmers, and hunters where interviewed to collect new data of this species. The conclusion is that the Yungas Forest of northwestern Argentina must be considered an area with high probability of maintaining a resident population of Andean bears. Although this is probably a small and perhaps isolated population, the permanent presence of Andean bears in northwestern Argentina might not longer be doubted...|$|R

Total mineral imports, which were mostly petroleum and derivatives, however, increased by about 34.8% to $3.1 billion compared with $2.3 billion in 2005. Total imports increased by about 21.5% to $14.7 billion compared with $12.1 billion in 2005 and generated a surplus of $2.6 billion compared with $5.3 billion in 2005. In 2006, the United States (34%), China (11%), Chile (7%), Canada (6%), and Japan (5%) were Peru’s leading mineral consumers. The United States, China, and Chile were the main importers of gold, copper, and molybdenum, respectively. Peru sold about 6% of its exports to {{other members of the}} Mercado Común <b>Andino</b> (ANCOM), whose members were Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela; about 3% was sold to the Mercado Común del Cono Sur (MERCOSUR) countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and associate members Bolivia and Chile; and 15% was sold to other Latin American countries. Peruvian mineral exports could increase if the negotiations between ANCOM and MERCOSUR lead to a South American free trade agreement and owing to the free trade agreement signed recently (2006) between the United States and Peru.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the neotectonic deformation {{and development of}} the Tromen massif, a Quaternary retroarc volcanic field located in the western section of the Malargüe fold and thrust belt in the Southern Central Andes. The linkages between neotectonic deformation in the intra-arc zone and the recent retroarc structures of the Tromen volcanic plateau are not clearly understood. These retroarc deformations affect the mid-section of the fold and thrust belt, leaving to the east a 200 km-wide deformed zone that can be considered inactive over the last 12 – 10 Ma. This out-of-sequence deformation west of the orogenic front area has not been previously addressed in detail. In this study, exhaustive mapping is used to describe and discriminate structures with a neotectonic component from those fossilized by Pleistocene strata. Two balanced cross-sections are constructed showing the distribution of the youngest deformations and their relation to pre-Miocene structures. An important means for evaluating this is the morphometric and morphological analyses that allowed identification of perturbations in the fluvial network associated with active structures. In a broader perspective, neotectonic activity in the fold and thrust belt is discussed and inferred to be caused by local mechanical weakening of the retroarc zone, due to injection of asthenospheric material evidenced by magnetotelluric surveys. Thus, deformation imposed by the oblique convergence between South American and Nazca plates, while to the south being limited to the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault system that runs through the arc zone, in the retroarc area is located at the site of magmatic emplacement, presumably in association with a thermally weakened-upper crust. This control exemplifies the relationship that exists between surficial processes, magmatic emplacement and upper asthenospheric dynamics in the Southern Central Andes. Fil: Sagripanti, Lucía.
