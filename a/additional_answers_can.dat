This email-based helpdesk guarantees a one-business-day turnaround {{in response to questions}} about climate and weather by making use of the academic resources and staff at the IRI to source simple, relevant <b>answers.</b> <b>Additional</b> information <b>can</b> be provided as a follow-up, in which case the IRI staff will often seek assistance from experts on/within the region in question. Humanitarian workers have posed questions about historical climate behaviour and possible long-term threats in their location, the availability of reliable information on sea level rise projections, whether to attribute extreme events to climate variability or climate change, and how to navigate between differing forecast signals for the same region. The ability to respond to these questions with simple answers has cultivated humanitarian interest in the effect of climate on their work, and increased willingness to adjust existing standard protocols and make decisions based on climate information.|$|R

40|$|One and {{the same}} fact in natural {{language}} can be expressed {{in many different ways}} by using different words and/or a different syntax. This phenomenon, commonly called paraphrasing, is the main reason why Natural Language Processing (NLP) is such a challenging task. This becomes especially obvious in Question Answering (QA) where the task is to automatically answer a question posed in natural language, usually in a text collection also consisting of natural language texts. It cannot be assumed that an answer sentence to a question uses the same words as the question and that these words are combined in the same way by using the same syntactic rules. In this thesis we describe methods that can help to address this problem. Firstly we explore how lexical resources, i. e. FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet can be used to recognize a wide range of syntactic realizations that an answer sentence to a given question can have. We find that our methods based on these resources work well for web-based Question Answering. However we identify two problems: 1) All three resources as of yet have significant coverage issues. 2) These resources are not suitable to identify answer sentences that show some form of indirect evidence. While the first problem hinders performance currently, it is not a theoretical problem that renders the approach unsuitable–it rather shows that more efforts have to be made to produce more complete resources. The second problem is more persistent. Many valid answer sentences–especially in small, journalistic corpora–do not provide direct evidence for a question, rather they strongly suggest an answer without logically implying it. Semantically motivated resources like FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet can not easily be employed to recognize such forms of indirect evidence. In order to investigate ways of dealing with indirect evidence, we used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to collect over 8, 000 manually identified answer sentences from the AQUAINT corpus to the over 1, 900 TREC questions from the 2002 to 2006 QA tracks. The pairs of answer sentences and their corresponding questions form the QASP corpus, which we released to the public in April 2008. In this dissertation, we use the QASP corpus to develop an approach to QA based on matching dependency relations between answer candidates and question constituents in the answer sentences. By acquiring knowledge about syntactic and semantic transformations from dependency relations in the QASP corpus, <b>additional</b> <b>answer</b> candidates <b>can</b> be identified that could not be linked to the question with our first approach...|$|R

40|$|When {{foraging}} for information, users face {{a tradeoff}} between the accuracy {{and value of}} the acquired information and the time spent collecting it, a problem which also surfaces when seeking answers to a question posed to a large community. We empirically study how people behave when facing these conflicting objectives using data from Yahoo Answers, a community driven question-and-answer site. We first study how users behave when trying to maximize the amount of acquired information while minimizing the waiting time. We find that users are willing to wait longer for an <b>additional</b> <b>answer</b> if they have received {{a small number of}} answers. We then assume that users make a sequence of decisions, deciding to wait for an <b>additional</b> <b>answer</b> as long as the quality of the current answer exceeds some threshold. The resulting probability distribution for the number of answers that a question gets is an inverse Gaussian, a fact that is validated by our data. ...|$|R

2500|$|The site {{does not}} have a system that filters the correct answers from the {{incorrect}} answers. At one time, the community could vote for the best answer among the posted answers; but that option was disabled in March 2014. For most of the life of Yahoo! Answers, once the [...] "best answer" [...] was chosen, {{there was no way to}} add more answers nor to improve or challenge the best answer chosen by the question asker; there is a display of thumbs down or thumbs up for each answer, but viewers cannot vote. In April 2014, this was changed to allow for <b>additional</b> <b>answers</b> after a best answer is chosen, but the best <b>answer</b> <b>can</b> never be changed. Also, while [...] "best answers" [...] can be briefly commented upon, the comment is not visible by default and is hence hardly read. (Even the user who posts the question isn't notified, before or after the best answer is picked, about a comment on the question or on the best answer.) If the best answer chosen is wrong or contains problematic information, the only chance to give a better (or correct) answer will be the next time the same question is asked. The older answer will likely get higher priority in search engines. Any new answer will most probably not be seen by any original questioner.|$|R
