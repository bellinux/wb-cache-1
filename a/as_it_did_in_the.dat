5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the district's mines, the Wells Fargo office was used as a {{residence}} by Alex and Mayme Colbath until the 1950s. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 11, 1971, and currently serves as an art gallery and a museum. The Rice Building burned down, and was rebuilt in 1991. The Cosmopolitan Restaurant was reconstructed to appear <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, and it served European cuisine until it was closed in 2010. There are many remnants of houses and other buildings, and there are also markers indicating where some buildings once stood, such as the Elk Horn Saloon. Some of the area has been preserved for its history.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry {{on the part of the}} two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E
5|$|Most of India's early talkies {{were shot}} in Bombay, which remains the leading {{production}} center, but sound filmmaking soon {{spread across the}} multilingual nation. Within {{just a few weeks}} of Alam Aras March 1931 premiere, the Calcutta-based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi Shirin Farhad and the Bengali Jamai Sasthi. The Hindustani Heer Ranjha was produced in Lahore, Punjab, the following year. In 1934, Sati Sulochana, the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in Kolhapur, Maharashtra; Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu. Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures. Since 1934, with the sole exception of 1952, India has been among the top three movie-producing countries in the world every single year.|$|E

25|$|According to Colwell, {{the quality}} and {{inclusiveness}} of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Zimbabwean cholera outbreak.

Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy {{may be able to}} afford them {{and there will be a}} greater toll on the country's poor. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.|$|E
25|$|Some {{observers}} {{predict that}} the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further {{to the point that}} it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, Ladino or Judeo-Arabic. The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to Middle High German, Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E

25|$|Feudalism {{never really}} {{developed}} in Norway or Sweden, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of Europe. However, {{the administration of}} government took on a very conservative feudal character. The Hanseatic League forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy. The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, {{to the degree that}} no real burgher class existed in Norway.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely to intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of a man whose wife began to wonder why he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E

25|$|Despite Holt's sentiments and his government's electoral {{success in}} 1966, the war became unpopular in Australia, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The {{movements}} to end Australia's involvement gathered strength after the Tet Offensive of early 1968 and compulsory national service (selected by ballot) became increasingly unpopular. In the 1969 elections, the government hung on despite a significant decline in popularity. Moratorium marches held across Australia in mid-1970 attracted large crowds- the Melbourne march of 100,000 {{being led by}} Labor MP Jim Cairns. As the Nixon administration proceeded with Vietnamization {{of the war and}} began the withdrawal of troops, so did the Australian Government. In November 1970 1st Australian Task Force was reduced to two battalions and in November 1971, 1ATF was withdrawn from Vietnam. The last military advisors of the AATTV were withdrawn by the Whitlam Labor Government in mid December 1972.|$|E
25|$|Except for the {{province}} of Skane, on the southernmost tip of Sweden which was under Danish control during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of Europe. Therefore, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. Slavery (also called thralldom) was not common in Sweden, and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity, the difficulty in obtaining slaves from the lands east of the Baltic Sea, and {{by the development of}} cities before the 16th century Indeed, both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus Erickson in 1335. Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some became laborers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of {{the province}} of Dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take down to the coast and trade the iron for fish they needed for food while the iron would be shipped abroad.|$|E
500|$|The {{traditional}} {{image of}} Byzantine Greek merchants as unenterprising benefactors of state aid {{is beginning to}} change for that of mobile, pro-active agents.

This was achieved through efficient use of credit and other monetary innovations. Merchants invested surplus funds in financial products called chreokoinonia (...) , the equivalent and perhaps ancestor of the later Italian commenda.|$|E

Although Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, [...] "I seriously never laughed as hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, sitting there in the editing room laughing." [...] During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive.
