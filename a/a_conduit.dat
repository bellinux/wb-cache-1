5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal intubation, usually simply {{referred}} to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or to serve as <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{landmark in}} Fleet Street {{during the late}} Middle Ages was <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> {{that was the main}} water supply for the area. When Anne Boleyn was crowned Queen following her marriage to Henry VIII in 1533, the conduit flowed wine instead of water. By the 16th century, Fleet Street, along with much of the City, was chronically overcrowded, and a Royal proclamation in 1580 banned any further building on the street. This had little effect, and construction continued, particularly timber. Prince Henry's Room over the Inner Temple gate dates from 1610 and is named after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I, who did not survive to succeed his father.|$|E

5|$|Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 {{his regime}} spent $120 million on Soviet, French, and Belgian {{weaponry}} and by early 1960 had doubled {{the size of}} Cuba's armed forces. Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques. In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> for public complaints. By 1970, {{a third of the}} population would be involved in the CDR, and this would come to rise to 80%.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{providing}} locomotion {{opportunities for}} winged animals and <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> for the dispersal of pollen grains, spores and seeds, the atmosphere {{can be considered}} to be a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial community may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. Aerobiology has been little studied, but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.|$|E

However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the Union of South Africa were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce's more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy cooperation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the two {{dimensional}} numerical topology optimization of <b>a</b> high conductive <b>conduit</b> material, distributed within a heat-generating material, is investigated {{with regards to}} the effect of orthotropic materials. Specifically, materials with orthotropic thermal conductivities (different primary and secondary principal thermal conductivities). Two cases are considered in this study, namely the optimal distribution of <b>an</b> isotropic <b>conduit</b> material within <b>an</b> orthotropic heat generating material; and the optimal distribution of <b>an</b> orthotropic <b>conduit</b> material within <b>an</b> isotropic heat-generating material. A finite volume method (FVM) code, coupled with the method of moving asymptotes (MMA); the solid isotropic with material penalization (SIMP) scheme; and the discrete adjoint method, was used to find the optimal distribution of the high conductive conduit material within the heat generating material. For the optimal distribution of <b>an</b> isotropic <b>conduit</b> material within <b>an</b> orthotropic heat-generating material is was found that a heat-generating material angle 10 6 h 0 6 60 is preferred, for a higher thermal performance, and a heat-generating material angle h 0 60 should be avoided. For the optimal distribution of <b>an</b> orthotropic <b>conduit</b> material within <b>an</b> isotropic heat-generating material is was found that <b>an</b> optimal <b>conduit</b> material angle exists giving the best thermal performance (lowest smax). It was found that the optimal conduit material angle remains the same for different conductivity ratios and different heat-generating material angles. It was also found that the optimal conduit material angle directly corresponds to the domain aspect ratio, h 1;opt ¼ tan 1 ð 2 H=LÞ, with a minimum improvement of 3 % and a maximum improvement of 50 % of the thermal performance when using <b>an</b> orthotropic <b>conduit</b> material over that of <b>an</b> isotropic <b>conduit</b> material. <b>A</b> 50 % improvement of the thermal performance effectively translates to either double the allowable heat generation or half the peak operating temperature of the isotropic heat-generating material.

5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in New Marais, Cole and {{his allies}} learn that energy magnate Joseph Bertrand III (Graham McTavish), an anti-Conduit demagogue, has seized control of the city.

Rescuing Wolfe, Cole learns that he has {{developed}} the Ray Field Inhibitor, a device capable of stripping Conduits of their powers. Before he can help Cole locate the energy cores needed to power the RFI, he is killed by the Militia, who also take Kuo captive. While working to free her, Cole and Zeke meet Roscoe Laroche, a Vietnam veteran who leads a resistance movement opposed to Bertrand, and Nix (Nika Futterman), a shadow-manipulating Conduit who has been waging war on the Militia. Using intelligence gathered by Zeke, Cole and Nix locate a secret lab where Kuo, revealed to be <b>a</b> <b>Conduit,</b> {{has been forced to}} transfer her ice-generating powers to an army of human mercenaries controlled by Bertrand. The two free her, but also end up releasing the mentally unstable mercenaries into the city.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon reopening his business, Johnson started {{publishing}} theological and political works by Priestley and other Dissenters.

He served as <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> for information between Dissenters {{across the country and}} supplied provincial publishers with religious publications, thereby enabling Dissenters to spread their beliefs easily. Johnson participated in efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the civil rights of Dissenters. In one six-year period of the 1770s, Johnson was responsible for publishing nearly one-third of the Unitarian works on the issue. He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790, when Dissenters introduced repeal bills in Parliament, and he published much of the pro-repeal literature written by Priestley and others.|$|E

5|$|Infamous Second Son is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can parkour-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is <b>a</b> <b>Conduit,</b> which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These materials can be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his fingertips) or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings). Using powers depletes a meter in the head-up display (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles. Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities.|$|E
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} <b>a</b> <b>conduit</b> by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve {{is included in the}} circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
