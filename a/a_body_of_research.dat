The most relevant of these patterns is the species-area curve which states that a larger geographic area will contain higher species diversity.

25|$|Though not {{the first}} {{methodology}} {{in the practice of}} individual verbal psychotherapy, Freud's psychoanalytic system came to dominate the field from early in the twentieth century, forming the basis for many later variants. While these systems have adopted different theories and techniques, all have followed Freud by attempting to achieve psychic and behavioral change through having patients talk about their difficulties. Psychoanalysis is not as influential as it once was in Europe and the United States, though {{in some parts of the}} world, notably Latin America, its influence in the later 20th century expanded substantially. Psychoanalysis also remains influential within many contemporary schools of psychotherapy and has led to innovative therapeutic work in schools and with families and groups. There is <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> findings which support the efficacy of psychodynamic therapies in treating a wide range of psychological disorders.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{that caught}} the public {{interest}} to a great extent, was Coren's work on left-handedness. With his co-researchers, Diane F. Halpern, Clare Porac, and Alan Searleman he studied the causes and consequences of left-handedness. Specifically his research led him to believe that left-handedness could be a marker for various psychological and physical problems. The media became interested in this work when findings began to emerge indicating that left-handedness was often associated with difficult or stressful births. Research showing that left-handers were much more susceptible to accident-related injuries because the constructed world and most machinery and tools are designed for the safety and convenience of right-handers evoked {{a great deal of}} interest and press coverage. However the work that caused the largest stir and the most controversy was a series of studies in collaboration with Diane F. Halpern which showed that left-handers have shorter life spans, often dying younger because of accidents or problems associated with a compromised immune system (possibly a long-term consequence of birth stress related trauma). Although originally the source of much controversy, with confirming data coming from a number of other laboratories, these conclusions have become well enough accepted to appear in basic psychological textbooks. The discovery of a possible genetic basis of left-handedness suggests that there may be two types of left-handers, natural left-handers and a separate group who arrive at their left-handedness because of birth stress and are more susceptible to immune system related problems.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} difference with Orthodoxy is that Conservative rabbis have produced <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{on the history}} of halakha which, in their view, concludes that rabbis in every age have always included ethical concerns as {{a major part of the}} halakhic process. They hold that rabbis in practice viewed both halakhah and aggadah as inter-related domains, and that one could not be used exclusively without the other. See Roth's [...] "The Halakhic Process", Louis Jacobs [...] "A Tree of Life", and Robert Gordis [...] "The Dynamics of Judaism: A Study in Jewish Law" [...] (stressed in introduction and chapters 8, 9).|$|E

The Huffington Post suggested that the videos were a form of procrastination, with most being watched while at work or ostensibly studying, while IU Bloomington commented [...] " [...] does more than simply entertain; it boosts viewers' energy and positive emotions and decreases negative feelings". BusinessInsider argues [...] "This falls in line with <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> regarding the effects that animals have on people." [...] A 2015 study by Jessica Gall Myrick found that people were {{more than twice as likely}} to post a picture or video of a cat to the internet than they were to post a selfie. Also, it was found that people who watch cat videos feel more energetic and positive after viewing online cat content.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated {{a cornucopia of}} data-based theory relevant to cognition.
