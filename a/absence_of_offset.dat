40|$|The {{importance}} of capital loss offset provisions {{in a world}} of risk is well documented in the tax literature. However, the potential deadweight losses owing to imperfect offset has not been fully explored. This paper develops a framework whereby that investigation can be carried out and utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the size of potential losses. Results show that when the government and private sector are equally efficient in handling market risk, welfare losses owing to the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>offset</b> provisions could be substantial. Under plausible assumptions about attitudes towards risk and time preference, and with a capital income tax rate of forty percent, over sixty cents per dollar of tax revenue raised would be dissipated. In contrast, full loss offset would reduce that loss to approximately fourteen cents. capital income taxation, uncertainty, deadweight loss, loss offset provisions...|$|E

We have developed a MOSLSI-compatible fabrication process for SETs based on pattern-dependent oxidation (PADOX) [2, 3]. Figure 1 shows the SET structure and the formation mechanisms. We exploit quantum size effect in a narrow Si wire and the band-gap reduction afforded by the huge stress accumulated during the oxidation. Figure 2 shows the drain current oscillation characteristics of a Si SET measured {{as a function of}} gate voltage Vgs. The special feature of Si SETs is that these electrical characteristics are very stable due to the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>offset</b> charges [4]. It has been believed that the greatest drawback of SETs is offset charge instability. However, as shown in Fig. 3, we have obtained a monotonic relationship between the first-electron-peak voltage Vfp and gate capacitance Cg measured for several SETs whose Cg shows an almost linear relation to the island size [5]. This implies that threshold voltages of SETs are controlled by SET sizes, which is indispensable in practical application of SETs.

40|$|Abstract — All {{existing}} {{training signal}} designs for channel estimation in OFDM systems assume no frequency offsets. In practice, frequency offset is unavoidable and seriously degrades {{the performance of}} OFDM systems. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} designing optimal training signals for SISO OFDM channel estimation in the presence <b>of</b> frequency <b>offsets.</b> First, we present optimal training signals for OFDM channel estimation in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> frequency <b>offset</b> which include all existing optimal training signals for SISO OFDM channel estimation as a subset. Then we derive the optimal training signals for SISO OFDM channel estimation which are the most robust to frequency <b>offsets.</b> In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> frequency <b>offsets,</b> channel estimation mean square error depends only on the ratio of training signal energy to noise variance.

Around the year 2000, the population began to generate “negative momentum”: {{a tendency to}} decline owing to shrinking cohorts of young people that was brought on by low fertility (birthrate) {{over the past three}} decades.

Governments in Europe are beginning to consider a range of policy options to address the negative implications of population decline and rapid aging (1, 2).

The target stars are distributed across the great circle of the celestial equator. Radial velocities were obtained via cross-correlation with IAU radial velocity standards.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} degree to which Canadian {{families}} are covered by private pension plans and document how their savings for retirement (made through contributions to tax-assisted retirement savings programs) have evolved over the last two decades. We find that two-parent families, lone-parent families and other individuals located in the bottom quintile of the earnings distribution are not better prepared for retirement than their counterparts were in the mid- 1980 s or the early 1990 s. On the other hand, those located in the top quintile are better prepared than their counterparts were in the mid- 1980 s or the early 1990 s. As a result, Canadian families' preparedness for retirement, which was fairly unequal in the mid- 1980 s, has become even more unequal over the last two decades. This finding has important implications for the future. Recent research has shown that the maturation of the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans (C/QPPs) has led to a substantial reduction in income inequality among the elderly between the early 1980 s and the mid- 1990 s.

40|$|Canadian {{apprenticeship}} {{policy has}} recently turned to direct subsidies for participants, including a federal tax incentive for employers. Some assumptions underlying the employer subsidy are: that apprenticeship training {{is a principal}} contributor to the skilled trades labour supply; that employers of apprentices typically incur high training cost and risks; {{and that in the}} <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>offsetting</b> incentives, these would deter their participation. These assumptions are tested, using an analysis of 2006 census data and a series of 33 employer interviews. The census data reveal that, in 74 â€œskilled tradesâ€ occupations (NOC-S group H), the proportion of the labour force reporting an apprenticeship credential is 37 %. When certificates granted to â€œtrade qualifiersâ€ are excluded from the total, registered apprenticeship certification is found to contribute roughly 25 % of the skilled trades labour supply. A closer examination of the census data reveals strong inter-occupational differences in the certification rate and in the ratio of certified to less-than-certified workers, suggesting a de facto hierarchy of trades occupations. The interviews reveal sharp variations in employers’ workplace training efforts, challenging the twin suppositions that employers of apprentices are uniformly high contributors to skill formation, and that high training-related costs risks generally deter their participation. Differences in training behaviour are attributed to high-skill versus low-skill business strategies that in turn reflect differing product markets and regulatory constraints. Whatever the level of their training effort, all of the participating employers are able to minimize the training-related risks that have been cited as the principal rationale for employer subsidies. The paper argues for a more nuanced approach to skills policy and research in Canada, with greater attention to the diversity of actors’ strategic interactions with the training system.

The two translational (shift) and single rotational (twist) in-plane modes of square millimetric transparent dies bridged to shape-matching receptor sites through a liquid meniscus were selectively excited by preset initial offsets. The entire self-alignment dynamics was simultaneously monitored over the three in-plane degrees of freedom by high-speed optical tracking of the alignment trajectories. The dynamics of the twist mode is shown to qualitatively follow the sequence of dynamic regimes also observed for the shift modes, consisting of initial transient wetting, acceleration toward, and underdamped harmonic oscillations around the equilibrium position. Systematic analysis of alignment trajectories for individually as well as simultaneously excited modes shows that, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> twist <b>offset,</b> the dynamics <b>of</b> the degenerate shift modes are mutually independent.

A 300 -kilometre-long central amagmatic zone, where mantle peridotites are emplaced directly in the ridge axis, lies between abundant, continuous volcanism in the west, and large, widely spaced volcanic centres in the east. These observations demonstrate that the extent of mantle melting is not a simple function of spreading rate: mantle temperatures at depth or mantle chemistry (or both) must vary significantly along-axis.

By processing the received baseband signal block by block, a generalized linear transform is used to remove the offset prior to data detection, thereby releasing the succeeding detection process from the threat <b>of</b> DC <b>offset.</b> Operating on transform output blocks, a generalized maximum-likelihood scheme is developed for noncoherent data detection without a priori knowledge of channel amplitude and phase. When all the signaling blocks are confined within the space expanded by the basis vectors obtained from the offset-removal transform matrix, the proposed detection scheme can exploit the advantage of performing data detection and estimation on channel amplitude and phase jointly in the maximum-likelihood sense. It is analytically shown that the block detection scheme provides the bit error performance asymptotically approaching that of the corresponding ideal coherent phase-shift-keyed (PSK) detection in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> DC <b>offset</b> when the block length is increased. An iterative detection scheme is also modified from the block detection scheme to simplify the realization complexity. Both block and iterative detection schemes are shown to outperform the conventional training-sequence-aided PSK detection scheme under the same transmission throughput efficiency.

To achieve this goal, the velocity is updated along the reflection wavepaths, rather than along both the reflection ellipses and transmission wavepaths as in conventional FWI. This method allows for reconstructing the low-wavenumber part of the background velocity model, even in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> long <b>offsets</b> and low-frequency component of the data. Moreover, in gradient-based iterative updates, instead of forming the data error conventionally, we propose to exploit the phase mismatch between the observed and the calculated data. The phase mismatch emphasizes a kinematic error and varies quasi-linearly with respect to the velocity error. The phase mismatch is computed (1) in the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain replacing the magnitudes of the calculated common shot gather by those of the observed one, and (2) in the temporal-spatial domain to form the difference between the transformed calculated common-shot gather and the observed one.

40|$|This paper studies {{an economy}} in which {{incomplete}} markets and strong complementarities interact to generate path dependent aggregate output fluctuations. An economy {{is said to}} be path dependent when the effect of a shock on the level of aggregate output is permanent in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> future <b>offsetting</b> shocks. Extending the model developed in Durlauf 11991 (a),(b)). we analyze the evolution of an economy which consists of a countable infinity of industries. The production functions of individual firms in each industry are nonconvex and are linked through localized technological complementarities. The productivity of each firm at t is determined by the production decisions of technologically similar industries at t- 1. No markets exist which allow firms and industries to exploit complementarities by coordinating production decisions. This market incompleteness produces several interesting effects on aggregate output behavior. First, multiple stochastic equilibria exist in aggregate activity. These equilibria are distinguished by differences in both the mean and the variance of output. Second, output movements are path dependent as aggregate productivity shocks indefinitely affect real activity by shifting the economy across equilibria. Third, when aggregate shocks are recurrent, the economy cycles between periods of boom and depression.

An {{analysis of the}} effect <b>of</b> appendage root <b>offsets</b> (distance between the mounting point and system center of mass) on the dynamics of constant length spinning appendages is carried out. The stability and response characteristics of the system configuration are investigated {{taking into account the}} role played by the non-linear axial shortening effect, when the system is undergoing a steady spin, spin-up or angular slew maneuvers. It is observed that due to the root offset, large static deflections of the beams may result during steady spin of the system. Stability of elastic oscillations around non-trivial steady state configuration is examined and it is seen that, the axial shortening effect increases the stiffness during rotation. A positive offset along the beam causes similar effects on the stiffness matrix increasing the natural frequencies of vibrations. On the other hand, angular acceleration has a destabilizing effect. This destabilizing effect vanishes in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>offsets</b> and is greater for larger offset. At some critical value of angular acceleration the frequency becomes zero for a given offset; beyond that the appendage buckles. Also the stability regions in the spin rate-spin acceleration plane are obtained. The axially moving beams may represent appendages in the process of deployment (retrieval) from (into) a spacecraft or a prismatic joint in a flexible manipulator. It is shown analytically that when the length L changes, the transverse vibrations vary, in general, as L$ sp{ 1 / 2 }$. Thus, the vibrations increase during extension and reduce during retraction. This is in sharp contrast to vibrations of tethered systems which vary as L$ sp{- 1 / 4 }$, hence, decrease during deployment and increase during retrieval. The vibratory displacements, in addition to depending on the length, also depend on the type of extension (or retraction). The dynamical behavior for various deployment (retrieval) schemes [...] uniform deployment rate, exponential extension, uniform variation of the square of the length and harmonic extension is studied. It is seen that uniform and exponential extension lead to larger vibratory displacements compared to the other two schemes. An optimal deployment scheme is devised. It is noted that the optimal scheme is far superior to the uniform or exponential scheme, but has only marginal advantage over harmonic extension or uniform variation of the square of the length. Harmonic extension is recommended, since in this scheme, the axial velocity changes reasonably slowly and is zero at the end of deployment...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and private sectors}} are increasingly considering "biodiversity offsets" as a strategy to compensate for their negative impacts on biodiversity, including impacts on great apes and their habitats in Africa. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> national <b>offset</b> policies in sub-Saharan Africa, offset design and implementation are guided by company internal standards, lending bank standards or international best practice principles. We examine four projects in Africa that are seeking to compensate for their negative impacts on great ape populations. Our assessment of these projects reveals that not all apply or implement best practices, {{and that there is}} little standardization in the methods used to measure losses and gains in species numbers. Even if they were to follow currently accepted best-practice principles, we find that these actions may still fail to contribute to conservation objectives over the long term. We advocate for an alternative approach in which biodiversity offset and compensation projects are designed and implemented as part <b>of</b> a National <b>Offset</b> Strategy that (1) takes into account the cumulative impacts of development in individual countries, (2) identifies priority offset sites, (3) promotes aggregated offsets, and (4) integrates biodiversity offset and compensation projects with national biodiversity conservation objectives. We also propose supplementary principles necessary for biodiversity offsets to contribute to great ape conservation in Africa. Caution should still be exercised, however, with regard to offsets until further field-based evidence of their effectiveness is available...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new method <b>of</b> carrier frequency <b>offset</b> estimation for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems. The method uses one or more pairs of adjacent subcarriers within an OFDM symbol. The pairs of subcarriers are modulated with equal amplitude and opposite polarity. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> frequency <b>offset,</b> the received subcarrier pairs also have equal amplitude and opposite polarity. Frequency offset disrupts this balance in a predictable way. This is {{used as the basis}} for the new frequency offset estimator. When the normalized frequency offset is less than half of the subcarrier frequency spacing, the new estimator is shown to be an approximately linear function <b>of</b> carrier frequency <b>offset.</b> The method is particularly applicable to the technique of Polynomial Cancellation Coding (PCC) in which the data to be transmitted is mapped onto subcarrier pairs rather than individual subcarriers. A number of different implementations are possible depending on whether the basic modulation technique is ordinary OFDM, or PCC-OFDM. For use with ordinary OFDM pilot subcarrier pairs must be inserted. If the pilot pair is contained in a symbol that also carries data, when the frequency offset is not close to zero, inter-carrier interference (ICI) from the other subcarriers can result a large variance of the estimator. For PCC-OFDM the estimation can be based on the subcarrier pairs which are carrying data. The variance in this case is much reduced, both because of the reduced ICI of PCC-OFDM and because the estimate can be based on the average over a number of pairs. Simulation results are presented for a number of cases. 1...|$|R
40|$|Common {{culture and}} common {{language}} facilitate trade between people. Minorities have incentives to become assimilated {{and to learn}} the majority language so {{that they have a}} larger pool of potential trading partners. The value of assimilation is larger to someone from a small minority than to one from a large minority group. When a society has a very large majority of individuals from one culture, individuals from minority groups will be assimilated more quickly. Assimilation is less likely when an immigrant's native culture and language is broadly represented in his new country. Also, when governments protect minority interests directly, incentives to be assimilated into the majority culture are reduced. Both factors may explain the recent rise in multiculturalism. Individuals do not properly internalize the social value of assimilation and ignore the benefits others receive when they learn the majority language and become assimilated. In a pluralistic society, a government policy that encourages diverse cultural immigration over concentrated immigration is likely to increase the welfare of the population. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> strong <b>offsetting</b> effects, policies which encourage multi- culturalism reduce the amount of trade and have adverse welfare consequences. Conversely, policies that subsidize assimilation and the acquisition of majority language skills can be socially beneficial. The theory is tested and confirmed by examining U. S. Census data, which reveals that the likelihood that an immigrant will learn English is inversely related to the proportion of the local population that speaks his or her native language. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{integrates}} existing structural geology {{data with}} new detailed geomorphic {{analyses of the}} fluvial network to characterize active and potentially seismogenic faults bordering the Lunigiana and Garfagnana basins in the northern Apennines of Italy. These two basins are NW–SE-oriented asymmetric grabens, bordered by several normal faults with a poorly known, but probable recent slip history. Several strong earthquakes (M 5. 0 – 6. 5) {{have occurred in the}} area in the last millennium, demonstrating {{that this is one of}} the most seismically active areas of the northern Apennines. However, the lack of reliable instrumental data for strong earthquakes, generally low deformation rates, and poor exposures of faulted Quaternary sediments render the characterization of active, seismogenic faults problematic. Here, we quantify the relationships between faults and watershed-scale geomorphology using 10 -m digital topography to extract channel and basin metrics, such as steepness, concavity, and stream length-gradient indices of modeled river longitudinal profiles. In particular, convex segments of longitudinal profiles (knickpoints) are investigated in the spatial context of suspected active faults. Several knickpoints arise locally from juxtaposed rock types of different erodibility; however, many others mapped along major normal faults have a clear tectonic origin. In fact, the height of the footwall knickpoints (the closest to the fault trace) varies along-strike the fault, increasing toward the fault center and tapering off toward the fault tips, mimicking the expected displacement profile of a fault. In these cases, we consider the knickpoint height as a proxy of the fault throw accumulated by the youngest fault activity, probably during the late Quaternary. The along-strike distribution of knickpoint heights helps in defining the likely segmentation pattern of the fault system. The identified active normal fault segments have lengths ranging from 9. 5 to 28. 5 km. The inferred late Quaternary throw rate ranges from 0. 3 to 0. 8 mm/a; however, the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> any <b>offset</b> datable material limits our ability to assign precise numeric ages and rates <b>of</b> <b>offset</b> to the faulting...|$|R
40|$|During the December 26 th, 2006 Bam earthquake, {{continuous}} ruptures with {{a consistent}} rightlateral strike-slip {{of a few}} centimeters occurred north of Bam. A 3 km long strand of ruptures coincides exactly with the trace of the geologic Bam fault. These ruptures were possibly caused by the tectonic slip on the source fault of the 2006 earthquake. The Bam scarp south of the Zehedan highway might have grown during the earthquake. The extension of {{the area around the}} scarp indicated by the scarp-parallel fissures may represent the coseismic stretch of the surface. South of the Bam scarp, there was no systematic surface effect. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> significant tectonic <b>offset</b> at the surface is concordant with the intermediate magnitude of Mw 6. 6 Only a small and deep portion of the Bam fault, or another adjacent blind fault plane was ruptured in 2006.

40|$|Young stellar bars in disk galaxies {{experience}} a vertical buckling instability which terminates their growth and thickens them, {{resulting in a}} characteristic peanut/boxy shape when viewed edge on. Using N-body simulations of galactic disks embedded in live halos, we have analyzed the bar structure throughout this instability {{and found that the}} outer (approximately) third of the bar dissolves completely while the inner part (within the vertical inner Lindblad resonance) becomes less oval. The bar acquires the frequently observed peanut/boxy-shaped isophotes. We also find that the bar buckling is responsible for a mass injection above the plane, which is subsequently trapped by specific 3 -D families of periodic orbits of particular shapes explaining the observed isophotes, in line with previous work. Using a 3 -D orbit analysis and surfaces of sections, we infer that the outer part of the bar is dissolved by a rapidly widening stochastic region around its corotation radius — a process related to the bar growth. This leads to a dramatic decrease in the bar size, decrease in the overall bar strength and a mild increase in its pattern speed, but is not expected to lead to a complete bar dissolution. The buckling instability appears primarily responsible for shortening the secular diffusion timescale to a dynamical one when building the boxy isophotes. The sufficiently long timescale of described evolution, ∼ 1 Gyr, can affect the observed bar fraction in local universe and at higher redshifts, both through reduced bar strength and the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> dust <b>offset</b> lanes in the bar...|$|R
