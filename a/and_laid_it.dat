500|$|.....I again {{reiterated the}} demand for the flag, adding [...] "that it was {{impossible}} for the nation to have two fathers; that they must either be the children of the Spaniards, or acknowledge their American father". After a silence of some time an old man rose, went to the door, took down the Spanish flag, brought it <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> at my feet; he then received the American flag, and elevated it on the staff which had lately borne the standard of his Catholic Majesty.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

2500|$|Bolesław took {{advantage}} of the emperor's pilgrimage. After the Emperor's visit in Gniezno, Poland started to develop into a sovereign state, in contrast with Bohemia, which remained a vassal state, incorporated in the Kingdom of Germany. Thietmar of Merseburg condemned Otto III for [...] "making a lord out of a tributary" [...] in reference to the relationship between the Emperor and Bolesław. Gallus Anonymus emphasized that Otto III declared Bolesław [...] "his brother and partner" [...] in the Holy Roman Empire, also calling Bolesław [...] "a friend and ally of the Roman people". The same chronicler mentioned that Otto III [...] "took the imperial diadem from his own head <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> upon the head of Bolesław in pledge of friendship" [...] in Gniezno. Bolesław also received [...] "one of the nails from the cross of our Lord with the lance of St. Maurice" [...] from the Emperor.|$|E
2500|$|Colin Williams, of Williams Brothers Asphalt Paving Co. of Ionia, Michigan {{provided}} the Club with a surety bond, a dump truck, a front-end loader and a bulldozer plus operators {{to run the}} equipment which was used to build the grade.

[...] Chuck Julian, Dave Jones, an equipment operator from Williams Brothers, Dick Grieves, {{and a group of}} Hmong refugees who volunteered their time, then spent the next three days with the Williams Brothers equipment restoring the site, including casting a new concrete sidewalk. [...] Williams Brothers sent a grader from Ionia to fine grade the site after they were done with the bulk cleanup, including loading debris into the dump truck and rails onto a flatbed and hauling all of it to Ionia.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the reading}} ( [...] , aliyah) {{continues}} with chapter [...] a Levite couple {{had a baby}} boy, and the woman hid him three months. When she could not longer hide him, she made an ark of bulrushes, daubed it with slime and pitch, put the boy inside, <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> in river. As his sister watched, Pharaoh's daughter came to bathe in the river, saw the ark, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. She opened it, saw the crying boy, and had compassion on him, recognizing {{that he was one}} of the Hebrew children. His sister asked Pharaoh's daughter whether she should call a nurse from the Hebrew women, and Pharaoh's daughter agreed. The girl called the child's mother, and Pharaoh's daughter hired her to nurse the child for her. When the child grew, his mother brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, who adopted him as her son, calling him Moses, because she drew him out of the water. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|Adamstown {{was first}} known as [...] "Davis' Warehouse" [...] because Dr. Meredith Davis, a leading Quaker county miller, built a {{warehouse}} about 1835 where Mountville Road, by then called Jefferson Road, crossed the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad ( [...] southwest of Frederick) to store flour from his Greenfield Mills. The first settler in Adamstown was Robert Palmer, an African American [...] "post and railer" [...] who also ran a general store around 1835. In 1840 when Adam Kohlenburg was appointed the first B railway agent, the community {{became known as}} [...] "Adamstown", after his given name. He {{was also the first}} postmaster and ran a general store located in the lot between his brick Italianate-style home and the railroad. Edward Hebb laid off lots {{on the north side of}} the railroad in the 1840s. Daniel Rhodes of Pennsylvania, the first white settler, was so impressed with the location, he bought a tract of land <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> off into 12 building lots on the south side of the railroad in 1856.|$|E
2500|$|Brighton's {{transformation}} from a declining fishing village to a fashionable seaside resort patronised by royalty, the nobility and daytrippers alike {{took place between}} the mid-18th century—when Dr Richard Russell published his theories on the apparent health benefits of sea-bathing and drinking seawater, and recommended Brighton as the ideal venue—and the mid-19th century, when the town was connected to London by railway line. [...] It became the largest town in Sussex {{at the start of}} the 19th century, and the population grew from about 7,000 in 1801 to 40,000 in 1831, including a doubling in the 1811–1821 period. [...] This put great pressure on the remaining land around the church: graves were already so closely spaced that maintenance was difficult to carry out. [...] A small extension to the east was made in 1818, and in 1824 the church bought a site north of Church Street and behind St Nicholas' Church <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> out as extra burial space. [...] This was full by 1841, and another extension was opened west of Church Hill (Dyke Road).|$|E
2500|$|The Talmud deduces two {{possible}} explanations, one attributed to Rab {{and one to}} Rabbi Samuel, for what Ham did to Noah to warrant the curse. According to Rab, Ham castrated Noah on the basis that, since Noah cursed Ham by his fourth son Canaan, Ham must have injured Noah {{with respect to a}} fourth son. Emasculating him thus deprived Noah of the possibility of a fourth son. According to Samuel, Ham sodomized Noah, a judgment that he based on analogy with another biblical incident in which the phrase [...] "and he saw" [...] is used: With regard to Ham and Noah, Genesis 9 reads, [...] " [...] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. [...] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness." [...] In [...] it reads, [...] "And when Shechem the son of Hamor saw her (Dinah), he took her and lay with her and defiled her." [...] According to this argument, similar abuse must have happened each time that the Bible uses the same language. The Talmud concludes that, in fact, [...] "both indignities were perpetrated." ...|$|E

2500|$|After graduation, Buchanan {{became a}} {{principal}} {{at a public}} high school, in the Houghton school in Detroit. In 1870, she moved to Chicago {{to pursue a career}} in journalism. Her reception by the Chicago editors was anything but favorable. Her youth and sex, they told her frankly, were against her. It was some time, therefore, before she received a position on any of the Chicago dailies. During the time when she was without regular work, she wrote continuously, sending her stories to the various papers. Her manuscripts, as a rule, were accepted but the acceptances brought her no staff position. The editors refused consistently to take a woman on their papers. The first story which she had accepted was an account of the reception at Sacred Heart Convent, where she boarded during her first years in Chicago. She took the story to the offices of the Chicago Times <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> on the desk of the managing editor. He picked it up, glanced at it and gave Sullivan US$5. A few days later, as she was walking down Madison Avenue, some one tapped her on the shoulder. It was the editor of the Times. “I am sorry, Miss Buchanan, that I did not read your article before I paid you. It was extremely well written and worth more than five dollars.” At that, he handed her a $10 bill. Margaret Buchanan was 20 {{years old at the time}} and bore a striking resemblance to Rosa Bonheur.|$|E
2500|$|The Winter {{festival is}} known {{primarily}} through Cicero's account, supplemented by later Roman authors. First, {{the house was}} ritually cleansed of all male persons and presences, even male animals and male portraiture. Then the magistrate's wife and her assistants made bowers of vine-leaves, and decorated the house's banqueting hall with [...] "all manner of growing and blooming plants" [...] except for myrtle, whose presence and naming were expressly forbidden. A banquet table was prepared, with a couch (pulvinar) for the goddess {{and the image of}} a snake. The Vestals brought Bona Dea's cult image from her temple <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> upon her couch, as an honoured guest. The goddess' meal was prepared: the entrails (exta) of a sow, sacrificed to her on behalf of the Roman people (pro populo Romano), and a libation of sacrificial wine. The festival continued through the night, a women-only banquet with female musicians, fun and games (ludere), and wine; the last was euphemistically referred to as [...] "milk", and its container as a [...] "honey jar". The rites sanctified the temporary removal of customary constraints imposed on Roman women of all classes by Roman tradition, and underlined the pure and lawful sexual potency of virgins and matrons in a context that excluded any reference to male persons or creatures, male lust or seduction,. According to Cicero, any man who caught even a glimpse of the rites could be punished by blinding. [...] Later Roman writers assume that apart from their different dates and locations, Bona Dea's December and May 1 festivals were essentially the same.|$|E
