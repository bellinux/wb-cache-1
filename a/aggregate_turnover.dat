40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated the importance of managing aggregate voluntary turnover. A {{number of studies have}} clearly demonstrated that increased turnover is associated with declining organizational effectiveness Glebbeek 2 ̆ 6 Bax 2004; Shaw et al. 2005. Scholars and managers, however, would be committing a serious ecological fallacy by assuming the conclusions derived from studies of individual turnover apply to <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> in the same way and/or with the same intensity Klein, et al. 1994; Rousseau 1985. Unfortunately, the literature examining the antecedents of <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> is sparse, relative to the volume of studies examining individual turnover, and is riddled with significant theoretical and methodological challenges. Thus while it is tempting to assume that the contextual and attitudinal drivers of individual turnover also drive <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover,</b> the scarcity and shortcomings of the research stream prohibit firm conclusions. This study seeks to provide scholars with a more rigorous theoretical framework for examining the antecedents of <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> as well as an inventory and solution to many of the methodological shortcomings of past research. The second {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to the strategic human resource management literature by including human resource (HR) systems as a primary antecedent of <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover.</b> As a collective phenomenon, drivers of <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> must theoretically exist and be measured at the same collective level Klein, et al. 1994; Rousseau 1985. Collective behavior is a function of, among other things, common experiences resulting from common policies and practices, such as HR management practices, used to control and direct the behavior of organizational members Levinson 1965; Morgeson 2 ̆ 6 Hofmann 1999. Thus the inclusion of HR systems allows for at least two theoretical contributions. First, previous models of the antecedents of <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> have rarely included the HR systems that likely have a strong homogenizing effect on the experiences, interactions, make-up, and thus turnover of the organizational unit members. This study will shed insight into an important driver of collective turnover. Second, this study will provide insights into the mediating linkages between HR systems and organizational outcomes. Strategic HR research emerged out of the desire to verify the link between how organizations manage their people and organizational effectiveness Delery 2 ̆ 6 Shaw 2001. While there is a great deal of evidence that HR practices are at least weakly related to firm performance, the intervening variables have not been adequately tested or explored (Becker 2 ̆ 6 Gerhart 1996; Wright 2 ̆ 6 Gardner 2003). This study will test the role of collective commitment in both explaining collective turnover and meditating the relationship between HR systems and turnover...|$|E

The estimated 12 -month survival probabilities for male workers are between 50 and 60 [*]%, {{and they are}} even higher for female workers (see also Table  4 in the appendix).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} access to nursing home care in selected regions of Australia, Canada and the United States, and to examine the common ways in which nursing homes are used. Firstly, a review of methodological considerations in measuring access to nursing home care is made. Secondly, patient turnover patterns are interpreted with a view to showing differences in nursing home use among the countries studied; <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> rates, length of stay and outcomes are compared. Thirdly, groups of patients who differ in demographic and morbidity characteristics and in their use of nursing homes are discussed. Finally a number of distributive implications of these results are raised and a framework is outlined for considering redistributive consequences of changes in the use of nursing homes. It is concluded that the rate of flow of patients through nursing homes is as important a determinant of access to nursing home care as the level of bed provision and that adoption of this dynamic view of access indicates considerable scope for redistributing use of resources within the nursing home systems of all three countries. nursing home care alternative care residents turnover...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of {{soil organic matter}} (OM) decomposition to increasing temperature is a critical aspect of ecosystem responses to global change. The impacts of climate warming on decomposition dynamics have not been resolved due to apparently contradictory results from field and lab experiments, most of which has focused on labile carbon with short turnover times. But the majority of total soil carbon stocks are comprised of organic carbon with turnover times of decades to centuries. Understanding the {{response of}} these carbon pools to climate change is essential for forecasting longer-term changes in soil carbon storage. Herein, we briefly synthesize information from recent {{studies that have been}} conducted using a wide variety of approaches. In our effort to understand research to-date, we derive a new conceptual model that explicitly identifies the processes controlling soil OM availability for decomposition and allows a more explicit description of the factors regulating OM decomposition under different circumstances. It explicitly defines resistance of soil OM to decomposition as being due either to its chemical conformation (quality) or its physico-chemical protection from decomposition. The former is embodied in the depolymerization process, the latter by adsorption/desorption and <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover.</b> We hypothesize a strong role for variation in temperature sensitivity as a function of reaction rates for both. We conclude that important advances in understanding the temperature response of the processes that control substrate availability, depolymerization, microbial efficiency, and enzyme production will be needed to predict the fate of soil carbon stocks in a warmer world...|$|E
40|$|Earth system models {{associate}} the ongoing global warming {{with increasing frequency}} and intensity of extreme events such as droughts and heat waves. The carbon balance of soils may {{be more sensitive to}} the impact of such extremes than to homogeneously distributed changes in soil temperature (T(s)) or soil water content (theta(s)). One parameter influenced by more pronounced drying/rewetting cycles or increases in T(s) is the wettability of soils. Results from laboratory and field studies showed that low theta(s), particularly in combination with high T(s) can increase soil water repellency (SWR). Recent studies have provided evidence that the stability of soil organic matter (SOM) against microbial decomposition is substantially enhanced in water repellent soils. This review hypothesizes that SWR is an important SOM stabilization mechanism that could become more important because of the increase in extreme events. We discuss wettability-induced changes in soil moisture distribution and in soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> as the main mechanisms explaining the reduced mineralization of SOM with increasing SWR. The creation of preferential flow paths and subsequent uneven penetration of rainwater may cause a long-term reduction of soil water availability, affecting both microorganisms and plants. We conclude that climate change-induced SWR may intensify the effects of climatic drought and thus affects ecosystem processes such as SOM decomposition and plant productivity, as well as changes in vegetation and microbial community structure. Future research on biosphere-climate interactions should consider the effects of increasing SWR on soil moisture and subsequently on both microbial activity and plant productivity, which ultimately determine the overall carbon balance...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} conservation tillage is an effective agricultural practice to increase carbon (C) sequestration in soils. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms underlying the responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) to tillage regimes, physical fractionation techniques were employed to evaluate the effect of long-term no-tillage (NT) on soil aggregation and SOC fractions. Results showed that NT increased the concentration of total SOC by 18. 1 % compared with conventional tillage (CT) under a long-term maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system in Northeast China. The proportion of soil large macroaggregates (> 2 000 μm) was higher in NT than that in CT, while small macroaggregates (250 – 2 000 μm) showed an opposite trend. Therefore, the total proportion of macroaggregates (> 2 000 and 250 – 2 000 μm) was not affected by tillage management. However, C concentrations of macroaggregates on a whole soil basis were higher under NT relative to CT, indicating that both the amount of aggregation and <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> affected C stabilization. Carbon concentrations of intra-aggregate particulate organic matter associated with microaggregates (iPOM m) and microaggregates occluded within macroaggregates (iPOM mM) in NT were 1. 6 and 1. 8 times greater than those in CT, respectively. Carbon proportions of iPOM m and iPOM mM in the total SOC increased from 5. 4 % and 6. 3 % in CT to 7. 2 % and 9. 7 % in NT, respectively. Furthermore, the difference in the microaggregate protected C (i. e., iPOM m and iPOM mM) between NT and CT could explain 45. 4 % of the difference in the whole SOC.

30|$|The {{cyclical}} behaviour of <b>aggregate</b> labour <b>turnover</b> in Germany gives a first {{impression of}} whether jobs {{have become more}} or less stable since the mid-nineties (Rothe 2009). Fig.  2 shows the overall trends in hiring and separation rates over the business cycle between 1996 and 2012.

Remarkably, both hiring and separation rates remain fairly low during the cyclical upturn following the Hartz reforms (instead of returning to higher levels) and in the recession years 2008 and 2009. Thus, there has been a reduction in worker turnover in Germany that started before the Hartz reforms and continued thereafter. If job stability had decreased significantly after the reform period, we would have expected to see a corresponding increase in the turnover rates. This first piece of evidence will be confirmed and complemented by analyses that account for job heterogeneity in our micro-level analysis.|$|R

Total P in bulk soil and macroaggregates (0. 25 - 2 mm and 2 - 8 mm) was partitioned into inorganic and organic P fractions (P, and P., respectively) after sequential extraction, using NaHCO, (Olsen), NaOH, HCl, and H 2 SO 4 (residual). Additionally, P binding was examined with 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Total P concentrations were 70 - 170 mg/kg in the loamy and 300 - 450 mg/kg in the clayey soil. The largest P fraction was the NaOH-soluble P (33 %- 55 % of total P concentration). The proportion of easily extractable P was higher in the loamy than in the clayey soil.

In the loamy soil, Pi and, in the clayey soil, both Pi and P., were higher in CC and F than in NS and PG. In the loamy soil, P concentrations in macroaggregates (> 2 mm) were higher than in bulk soil.

This study was undertaken {{to explore the}} influence of the combined application of different quality organic resources (ORs) with N fertilizers on the link between aggregate dynamics and soil organic C (SOC) and soil N. A mesocosm experiment was conducted in Embu, central Kenya where 4 Mg C ha? 1 of Tithonia diversifolia (high quality), Calliandra calothyrsus (intermediate quality) and Zea mays (maize; low quality) were applied to soil compared to a no-input control. Each treatment was fertilized with 120 kg N ha? 1 as urea [(NH 2) 2 CO] or not fertilized. The soils used in the mesocosms were obtained from a three-year old-field experiment in which the same treatments as in the mesocosm were applied annually. No crops were grown in both the mesocosms and the thee-year field experiment. Soil samples were collected at zero, two, five and eight months after installation of the mesocosms and separated into four aggregate size fractions by wet sieving. Macroaggregates were further fractionated to isolate the microaggregates-within-macroaggregates; all soils and fractions were analyzed for SOC and N. The addition of ORs increased soil aggregation and whole SOC and soil N compared to the control and sole N fertilizer treatments. There were no differences among different OR qualities for whole SOC or soil N, but maize alone resulted in greater mean weight diameter (MWD), macroaggregate SOC and N than sole added Calliandra. The addition of N fertilizer only influenced SOC and soil N dynamics in combination with maize where SOC, soil N and aggregation were lower with the addition of N fertilizer, indicating an increased decomposition and loss of SOC and soil N due to a faster <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> after addition of N fertilizer. In conclusion, compared to high quality ORs, low quality ORs result in greater aggregate stability and a short-term accumulation of macroaggregate SOC and N. However, the addition of N fertilizers negates these effects of low quality ORs. Peer-reviewe...|$|E

Three replicated treatments: (i) no dung control, (ii) Cu-amended dung (3. 2 g Cu m? 2), and (iii) unamended dung (i. e. no extra Cu in the animal feed, 1. 0 g Cu m? 2) were established. Total Cu concentrations were determined in the 0 ? 1, 1 ? 5, and 5 ? 10 cm depth layers 14, 28, 42, and 70 days after dung application. We also determined Cu, pH, and dissolved organic C (DOC) concentrations in the soil solution at 30 cm depth. Initially, Cu concentrations ranged between 24 and 26 mg kg? 1 at all depths in all plots and did not change in the control during 70 days at any depth. The recovery of the applied Cu in the remaining dung, soil, and leachate after 70 days was 5 %, 10 %, and 2 % for the Cu-dung treatment and 18 %, 8 %, and 2 % for the unamended dung treatment leaving > 70 % of the dung-derived Cu unaccounted for in both dung treatments.

40|$|AbstractSustaining soil {{productivity}} in agricultural systems presents a fundamental agroecological challenge: nutrient provisioning depends upon <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> and microbial decomposition {{of organic matter}} (SOM); yet to prevent soil depletion these processes must be balanced by those that restore nutrients and SOM (soil building processes). These nutrient provisioning and soil building processes are inherently in conflict; management practices that create spatial separation between them may enable each to occur effectively within a single growing season, thereby supporting high crop yield while avoiding soil depletion. Soil functional zone management (SFZM), an understudied but increasingly adopted strategy for annual row-crop production, may help meet this agroecological challenge by creating spatial heterogeneity in biophysical conditions between crop rows and inter-rows. However, the process-level effects of this spatial heterogeneity on nutrient provisioning and soil building processes have not been characterised. We assessed the magnitude and spatial distribution of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in model SFZM (ridge tillage) and conventional tillage (chisel plough) systems in four US states encompassing a major global agricultural production region. For soil building we measured bulk density, aggregation and permanganate oxidisable carbon (POXC); for nutrient provisioning we measured microbial decomposition activity, nutrient mineralisation and plant-available nitrogen. After two years, POXC increased under ridge tillage (0 – 20 cm depth) compared with chisel plough. Ridge tillage also enhanced nutrient provisioning processes in crop rows, increasing plant-available nitrogen in synchrony with maize peak nitrogen demand. Structural equation modelling revealed that improvement in soil building processes under ridge tillage caused rapid enhancement of nutrient provisioning processes in SOM-poor soils. Increases in crop row POXC stimulated microbial decomposition activity, which was associated with increased plant-available nitrogen during the phase of maize peak nitrogen demand. The decimetre-scale spatial heterogeneity created by ridge tillage enables reconciliation of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in row-crop agroecosystems. In doing so, ridge tillage promotes critical soil processes necessary for increasing the range of ecosystem services provided by intensive production systems. SFZM approaches may have particular value in regions with SOM-poor soils, which would benefit from rapid increases in surface organic carbon. Also, by concentrating and promoting nutrient provisioning processes around crop roots during crop peak nitrogen demand, ridge tillage may enhance nitrogen-use efficiency and reduce current fertiliser requirements...|$|E

The separation was based on macromorphological characteristics that reflect the dominant process of aggregate formation {{and the degree of}} degradation. We distinguished: two classes of biogenic macroaggregates (fresh casts and welded casts); one class of physicogenic macroaggregates (angular to subangular blocky macroaggregates); and an intermediate fraction (rounded to subrounded macroaggregates). The structural arrangement of mineral particles and organic matter and the quantitative contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) and microaggregates were studied in thin sections. Total organic C contents tended to be higher in biogenic than in physicogenic macroaggregates of the PP and OA soils, whereas the reverse was found for the CA soil. Comparison of the different macroaggregate types in thin sections revealed that the worm-made macroaggregates of the PP soil were considerably enriched in fine POM and microaggregates, in which large amounts of organic matter were intimately mixed with fine mineral material. By contrast, worm casts of the CA and OA soils were hardly enriched in POM and microaggregates. Our study demonstrated that earthworms can directly initiate the formation of microaggregates, which in turn affects the physical protection of SOM against microbial decay. Farming practices that stimulate earthworm activity may thus constitute an important aspect of sustainable agricultural management. However, the much smaller amounts of POM and microaggregates present in worm casts of CA and OA than PP indicate a different impact of earthworms on C stabilization depending on land use. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact management conditions that favour the beneficial effects of earthworms on soil microstructure and associated SOM dynamics. In this respect, the use of micromorphological techniques in addition to chemical and physical analyses was shown to be very valuabl...|$|E
40|$|Sustaining soil {{productivity}} in agricultural systems presents a fundamental agroecological challenge: nutrient provisioning depends upon <b>aggregate</b> <b>turnover</b> and microbial decomposition {{of organic matter}} (SOM); yet to prevent soil depletion these processes must be balanced by those that restore nutrients and SOM (soil building processes). These nutrient provisioning and soil building processes are inherently in conflict; management practices that create spatial separation between them may enable each to occur effectively within a single growing season, thereby supporting high crop yield while avoiding soil depletion. Soil functional zone management (SFZM), an understudied but increasingly adopted strategy for annual row-crop production, may help meet this agroecological challenge by creating spatial heterogeneity in biophysical conditions between crop rows and inter-rows. However, the process-level effects of this spatial heterogeneity on nutrient provisioning and soil building processes have not been characterised. We assessed the magnitude and spatial distribution of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in model SFZM (ridge tillage) and conventional tillage (chisel plough) systems in four US states encompassing a major global agricultural production region. For soil building we measured bulk density, aggregation and permanganate oxidisable carbon (POXC); for nutrient provisioning we measured microbial decomposition activity, nutrient mineralisation and plant-available nitrogen. After two years, POXC increased under ridge tillage (0 – 20 cm depth) compared with chisel plough. Ridge tillage also enhanced nutrient provisioning processes in crop rows, increasing plant-available nitrogen in synchrony with maize peak nitrogen demand. Structural equation modelling revealed that improvement in soil building processes under ridge tillage caused rapid enhancement of nutrient provisioning processes in SOM-poor soils. Increases in crop row POXC stimulated microbial decomposition activity, which was associated with increased plant-available nitrogen during the phase of maize peak nitrogen demand. The decimetre-scale spatial heterogeneity created by ridge tillage enables reconciliation of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in row-crop agroecosystems. In doing so, ridge tillage promotes critical soil processes necessary for increasing the range of ecosystem services provided by intensive production systems. SFZM approaches may have particular value in regions with SOM-poor soils, which would benefit from rapid increases in surface organic carbon. Also, by concentrating and promoting nutrient provisioning processes around crop roots during crop peak nitrogen demand, ridge tillage may enhance nitrogen-use efficiency and reduce current fertiliser requirements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Trans-activation {{response}} element (TAR) DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP- 43) is causally {{related to}} the neurodegenerative diseases frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis being the hallmark protein in the disease-characteristic neuropathological lesions and via genetic linkage. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC 6) is an established target of the RNA-binding protein TDP- 43. HDAC 6 is an unusual cytosolic deacetylase enzyme, central {{for a variety of}} pivotal cellular functions including <b>aggregating</b> protein <b>turnover,</b> microtubular dynamics and filopodia formation. All these functions are important in the context of neurodegenerative proteinopathies involving TDP- 43. We have previously shown in a human embryonic kidney cell line that TDP- 43 knockdown significantly impairs the removal of a toxic, aggregating polyQ ataxin- 3 fusion protein in an HDAC 6 -dependent manner. Here we investigated the influence of TDP- 43 and its target HDAC 6 on neurite outgrowth. Results Human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells with stably silenced TDP- 43 showed a significant reduction of neurite outgrowth induced by retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Re-transfection with TDP- 43 as well as HDAC 6 rescued retinoic acid-induced neurite outgrowth. In addition, we show that silencing of HDAC 6 alone is sufficient to reduce neurite outgrowth of in vitro differentiated SH-SY 5 Y cells. Conclusions TDP- 43 deficiency leads to impairment of neurite growth in an HDAC 6 -dependent manner, thereby contributing to neurodegenerative events in TDP- 43 diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{chemical}} nature of that fraction of already dissolved organic matter into soil solution, or extracted by mild extractants, which is truly readily available for microbial activity and, consequently, more sensitive than total soil organic matter to changes in management and/or environmental conditions. In particular, we deal with low molecular weight compounds such as monosaccharides, amino sugars and amino acids. Soil sampling strategy and extraction procedure, prior to analyses, are crucial to make comparable results among laboratories. Although soil management and climatic conditions may cause large variability, extractable organic C and N may indicate the amount of substrates available to microbial biomass. Hot water extractable carbohydrates {{are among the most}} sensitive indicators of various factors such as tillage, cropping system, soil inundation frequency, seasonality and wildfires. Moreover, hot water extracts mainly microbial carbohydrates, i. e. those more involved to bind soil <b>aggregates.</b> The <b>turnover</b> rate of free amino acids in soils is very high, ranging from 1 h to about 30 hours. This explains the usually very low amino acid-N extractable from soils. The pHvariable charge of amino acids favours their adsorption on soil colloids. Amino sugars concentration in soils (mainly glucosamine, galactosamine, mannosamine and muramic acid) is more useful indicators of microbial necromass than microbial living biomass since they tend to stabilize and accumulate in soil. Moreover, their use as specific biomarkers is questionable due the widespread presence among microorganisms and plants...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} different standard {{measures of}} legislative turnover. Two main concerns are discussed: (1) {{the very definition}} of turnover: incoming MPs versus first-term MPs; and (2) the level of analysis: the whole chamber versus political groups. To illustrate this discussion, turnover in the French lower chamber, the Assemblée Nationale, is studied. It is shown that the choice of a particular measure is not trivial since empirical results are affected by the definition adopted. If the distinction between incoming and first-term MPs does not greatly modify results, the choice of the level of analysis leads to contradictory results. It is shown that the very logic of electoral contests leads to renewal mostly among those who lost previous elections, while incumbent majorities that lose elections hardly experience renewal. As both these phenomena coexist for every single election, <b>aggregate</b> measures of <b>turnover</b> do not account for these contradictory tendencies and tend to concentrate on alternation rather than turnover...|$|R
