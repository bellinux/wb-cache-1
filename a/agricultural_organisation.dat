Unlike the Han and Tang, {{in which}} {{agriculture}} {{was dominated by}} self-sufficient farmers, or the pre-Warring States period and era of division (period between Han and Tang), which was dominated by aristocratic landowners, during the Song agriculture was dominated by non-aristocratic landowners.

IAOS soon became the powerhouse of co-operation, with 33 affiliated dairy cooperative societies and cooperative banks, introducing co-operation among Irish farmers by proving the benefits obtainable through more economical and efficient management. The following year he and Russell began publishing its journal The Irish Homestead to spread information on farming. Four years later there were 243 affiliated societies. Within a decade 800 societies were in existence, with a trade turnover of three million pounds sterling.|$|E

The report says that Nepal reached both the WFS target as well as MDG and is moving towards bringing down the number of undernourished people to less than 5% of the population. Bangladesh reached the MDG target with the National Food Policy frameworkwith only 16.5% of the population undernourished. In India, the malnourished comprise just over 15 percent of the population. While the number of malnourished people in neighborhood has shown a decline over the last 25 years, the number of under-nourished in Pakistan displays an upward trend.There were 28.7 million hungry in Pakistan in the 1990sa number that has steadily increased to 41.3 million in 2015 with 22% of the population malnourished.

He was {{influenced}} by the cooperative movement being driven by Sir Horace Plunkett, well described in the account of country life of the times by Elizabeth, Countess of Fingall, Seventy Years Young. [...] Sir Horace Plunkett, MP, and later Senator of the Irish Free State, third son of Lord Dunsany, was father of the Irish agricultural co-operative movement, and founded the Irish <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Organisation</b> Society (now the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society), which included several hundred creameries. Accordingly, Denis O'Donnell actively organised farmers in the early cooperative movement in County Kerry, and founded the Lee Strand Co-operative Creamery on April 20, 1920 in Church Street, Tralee, still a going concern in 2009 although it relocated to Ballymullen in 1992. He owned a pub at #2 Edward Street, Tralee, run by his sister Bride, until her emigration to Kimberly, South Africa. The pub was sold in 1938. He also owned shops in Rock Street and Castle Street in Tralee. He was the first to introduce the pasteurisation of milk, much against the prejudice of dairy farmers at the time, and also was the first to market ice-cream in Tralee.|$|E
6000|$|Addressing {{a recent}} meeting of its members, the Chairman of the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Organisation</b> Society, Mr. Leslie Scott, spoke thus:--"We have to cover the country" [...] (with {{co-operative}} societies), [...] "and {{we have got to}} get all the farmers in! If we can carry out any such scheme as this, which will rope in all the farmers of the country, what a magnificent position we shall be in! You will have your great trading organisation with its central wholesale society! You will have your organisation side with the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Organisation</b> Society at the centre.... You {{will be able to use}} that side for all the ancillary purposes connected with farming; and do a great deal in the way of expert assistance. And through your electing the Board of Governors of the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Organisation</b> Society, with the provincial branch Committees, you will have what is in effect a central Parliament in London.... You will be able to put before the country, both locally and here in London, the views of the farming community, and, those views will get from Government Departments an attention which the farming industry in the past has failed to get. You will command a power in the country." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Organisation</b> Society, the officially {{recognised}} {{agency for}} fostering the co-operative principle, has recently formed an Agricultural Wholesale Society {{with a large}} subscribed capital, {{for the purchase of}} all farming requirements, and the marketing of produce, to be at the disposal of all co-operated farmers, small holders, and allotment holders, whose societies are affiliated to the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Organisation.</b> Society. This is a step of infinite promise. The drawing together of these three classes of workers on the land is in itself a matter of great importance. One of the chief complaints of small holders in the past has been that large holders regard them askance. The same, perhaps, applies to the attitude of the small holder to the allotment holder. That is all bad. Men and women on the land should be one big family, with interests, and sympathies in common and a neighbourly feeling.|$|E

40|$|Reduction in the {{dependency}} {{on fossil fuels}} {{has been identified as}} one of the important areas for development of organic farming in Denmark (ICROFS, 2008). The increased public awareness on the need for actions against global warming has brought Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and the use of fossil fuels into focus in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>organisations</b> in general {{as well as in the}} organic <b>agricultural</b> <b>organisations.</b> Several scenarios for biogas production in organic agriculture could be imagined. The implementation of biogas production on organic farms and the effect of this implementation depend on the existing farming system, how the implementation is done and how this changes the farming system. Therefore the aim of this paper is to focus specifically on biogas production in organic agriculture, how biogas production might change crop rotation and the product outputs from organic agriculture, and how different scenarios for biogas production affect the energy balance, nitrogen balance and GHG-emissions of the farm. ...|$|R
