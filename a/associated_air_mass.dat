The filters were assayed for lead- 210 (210 Pb) by measuring the alpha particles of its in-grown daughter nuclide polonium- 210 (210 Po). The observed 210 Pb activity concentrations at Mount Zeppelin vary between < 4 and 1060 mBq m- 3, with an arithmetic mean of 130 mBq m- 3 and a median of 74 mBq m- 3. The lowest 210 Pb activity concentrations are found during summer and the highest are found in winter. This variation is caused by seasonal differences in the mixing conditions of the troposphere, the level of precipita-tion and the speed of atmospheric chemistry induced by solar radiation. The performed source area analysis, {{which is based on}} air mass back trajectories, indicated that in summer, 210 Pb {{can be used as a}} tracer for air masses coming into contact with land areas within the past 5 days.

The global volume-weighted average (vwa) concentrations were 134 ± 19 μgC L− 1 for WIOC and 15. 0 ± 1. 6 μgC L− 1 for EC, which {{fall within the}} range of values that have been found in the European background atmosphere. The WIOC concentration exhibited a temporal variation over the study period with a minimum in winter (vwa 88 ± 16 μgC L− 1) and a maximum in summer (vwa 477 ± 86 μgC L− 1). This trend was due to the higher dilution effect of winter rains and possibly to an increase of biogenic particulate carbon incorporation during the growing season. A different temporal variation was observed for the EC concentration with a minimum in summer (vwa 4. 2 ± 3. 3 μgC L− 1) and a maximum in spring (vwa 17. 5 ± 2. 2 μgC L− 1).

Various lines of evidence from the study point to diffuse, combustion-related sources being a major influence on ambient air concentrations. Higher PCDD/F concentrations were generally <b>associated</b> with <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> that had originated and moved over land, particularly during periods of low ambient temperature.

The two cyclones had extensive smoke plumes embedded in their <b>associated</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> creating {{an excellent opportunity}} to use satellite and aircraft observations to validate the performance of atmospheric transport models in the Arctic, which is a challenging model domain due to numerical and other complications. Here we compare transport simulations of carbon monoxide (CO) from the Lagrangian transport model FLEXPART, the Eulerian chemical transport model TOMCAT, and for numerical aspects the limited-area chemical transport model WRF-Chem. Retrievals of total column CO from the IASI passive infrared sensor onboard the MetOp-A satellite are used as a total column CO reference for the two simulations. Main aspect of the comparison is how realistic horizontal and vertical structures are represented in the model simulations. Analysis of CALIPSO lidar curtains and in situ aircraft measurements provide further independent reference points to assess how reliable the model simulations are and what the main limitations are. The horizontal structure of mid-latitude pollution plumes agrees well between the IASI total column CO and the model simulations. However, finer-scale structures are too quickly diffused in the Eulerian models. Aircraft {{data suggest that the}} satellite data are biased high, while TOMCAT and WRF-Chem are biased low. FLEXPART fits the aircraft data rather well, but due to added background concentrations the simulation is not independent from observations. The multi-data, multi-model approach allows separating the influences of meteorological fields, model realisation, and grid type on the plume structure. In addition to the very good agreement between simulated and observed total column CO fields, the results also highlight the difficulty to identify a data set that most realistically represents the actual state of the atmosphere...|$|R

Chemical apportionment was performed for various <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> origins and showed a strong impact of anthropogenic emissions in the Turkey and Central Europe sectors, with black carbon (BC) and non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO 4) concentrations being almost a factor of two higher than observed in the Eastern and Western Europe sectors. High levels of non-sea-salt calcium (nss-Ca) were <b>associated</b> with <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from Africa but also from Central Turkey. Evidence was found that BC calculation based on light absorbance during dust events was biased. A source-oriented model was applied for these compounds as well as for sulfur dioxide (SO 2), in order to examine the source-receptor relationships responsible for the observed levels in Crete. Among the results obtained from this model, the major contribution of Turkey and Central Europe was confirmed in terms of anthropogenic emissions. Comparisons with remote optical properties obtained from Satellite observations (SEAWIFS) north of Crete indicates that our ground based aerosol characterization was suitable for describing aerosol properties in the atmospheric column for most of the time during the campaign...|$|R
30|$|The spatial {{variability}} of the δ 18 O and δD compositions of rain {{is attributed to}} variations in amount of precipitation (PPT), altitude effect, and <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> originating from different sources. <b>Air</b> <b>masses</b> that enter the area passing the Mediterranean Sea result in higher d-excess. The cold and dry continental <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> originating from the European continent {{come in contact with}} the warm Mediterranean Sea water, resulting in rapid evaporation and large scale convergence. The low d-excess value is less than 16  ‰ and <b>associated</b> with <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> that cross over the North African continent and controlled by a local orographic effect. The change in isotopic composition of δ 18 O in PPT with altitude is − 0.15  ‰ per 100  m. A statistical model confirms that a slight decrease in annual average precipitation has occurred since 1988 and attributed to a minor change in climate. The current level of tritium in rain corresponds to the average level of tritium in the atmosphere. Rabba station recorded a twofold higher tritium concentration in 1995 than the other stations, which may be from leakage from a nuclear station in Israel. The chemistry of rainwater demonstrates a wide range of salinity (100 – 600  mg/l). The lowest solute concentrations are found at high elevations, and the highest solute concentrations are found in the eastern desert and the Jordan Rift valley. The salinity of rain is affected by desert dust, aerosols, amounts of PPT, and the direction of rain fronts. The aerosols and windblown soil are the most prevailing as the country is confined between three seas and the outcrop surficial geology is mainly sedimentary rocks.|$|R
40|$|Cloud/fog {{samples were}} {{collected}} during spring of 2007 in the highly polluted North China Plain {{in order to examine}} the impact of pollution and dust particles on cloud water chemistry. The volume weighted mean pH of cloud water was 3. 68. The cloud acidity was shown to be <b>associated</b> with <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> origins. Cloud water with its <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> trajectories originating from the southern part of China was more acidic than those from northern China. Anthropogenic source and dust had obvious impact on cloud water composition as indicated by the very high mean concentrations of SO 4 2 - (1331. 65 μeqL- 1), NO 3 - (772. 44 μeqL- 1), NH 4 + (1375. 92 μeqL- 1) and Ca 2 + (625. 81 μeqL- 1) in the observation periods. During sandstorm days, cloud pH values were relatively high, and the concentrations of all the ions in cloud water reached unusual high levels. Significant decreases in the mass concentrations of PM 2. 5 and PM 10 were observed during cloud events. The average scavenging ratio for PM 2. 5 and PM 10 was 52. 0 % and 55. 7 %, respectively. Among the soluble ions in fine particles, NO 3 -, K+ and NH 4 + tend to be more easily scavenged than Ca 2 + and Na+. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Deposition {{is one of}} the {{key terms}} of the mineral dust cycle. However, dust {{deposition}} remains poorly constrained in transport models simulating the atmospheric dust cycle. This is mainly due to the limited number of relevant deposition measurements. This paper aims to present an automatic collector (CARAGA), specially developed to sample the total (dry and wet) atmospheric deposition of insoluble dust in remote areas. The autonomy of the CARAGA can range from 25 days to almost 1 year depending on the programmed sampling frequency (from 1 day to 2 weeks respectively). This collector is used to sample atmospheric deposition of Saharan dust on the Frioul islands in the Gulf of Lions in the Western Mediterranean. To quantify the mineral dust mass in deposition samples, a weighing and ignition protocol is applied. Almost 2 years of continuous deposition measurements performed on a weekly sampling basis on Frioul Island are presented and discussed with <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> trajectories and satellite observations of dust. Insoluble mineral deposition measured on Frioul Island was 2. 45 g m − 2 for February to December 2011 and 3. 16 g m − 2 for January to October 2012. Nine major mineral deposition events, measured during periods with significant MODIS aerosol optical depths, were <b>associated</b> with <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> coming from the southern Mediterranean Basin and North Africa...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{evaporative}} cooling scheme {{was incorporated into}} a dynamic model to estimate orographic precipitation in mountainous regions. The orographic precipitation model {{is based on the}} transport of atmospheric moisture and the quantification of preciptable water across a 3 D representation of the terrain from the surface up to 250 hPa. Advective wind fields are computed independently and boundary conditions are extracted from radiosonde data. Precipitation rates are obtained through calibration of a spatially distributed precipitation efficiency parameter. The model was applied to the central Sierra Nevada. Results show a gain of the order of 20 % in threat-score coefficients designed to measure the forecast ability of the model. Accuracy gains are largest at high elevations and during intense storms <b>associated</b> with warm <b>air</b> <b>masses...</b>|$|R

I also investigate the capability of a synoptic weather typing scheme, the Spatial Synoptic Classification, to characterize and explain the behavior of ozone and fine particulate matter in the Kansas City area. 	Daily maximum ozone concentrations from nine active ozone monitoring stations and daily average particulate concentrations six active PM 2. 5 monitoring stations were compared to daily SSC weather type records from 2004 - 2010. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted on the ozone and PM 2. 5 data to analyze {{temporal and spatial}} behavior. A non-parametric recursive partitioning technique was {{used to create a}} conditional inference tree-based regression model to analyze the association between the different SSC weather types and the selected pollutants. 	The ANOVA results showed significant seasonal trends with both pollutants. In general, ozone concentrations are typically lower in the spring and autumn months and higher during the summer months. PM 2. 5 concentrations were not as dependent on the season, however, they did tend to be higher in the late summer months and lower in the autumn months. 	The results also showed significant differences for both pollutants in average concentration depending on location. The ozone concentrations generally tended to be higher in the areas that are located downwind of Kansas City and lowest at the station located {{in the middle of the}} urban area. Fine particulates also seemed to be highest in the downwind portion of the urban area and lowest in the region upwind of the city. 	The conditional inference tree showed that higher concentrations of both pollutants are <b>associated</b> with tropical <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> and lower concentrations are <b>associated</b> with polar <b>air</b> <b>masses...</b>|$|R
40|$|The University of Bern {{monitors}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and oxygen (O 2) at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch since the year 2000 {{by means of}} flasks sampling and since 2005 using a continuous in situ measurement system. This study investigates the transport of CO 2 and O 2 towards Jungfraujoch using backward Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM) simulations and utilizes CO 2 and O 2 signatures to classify <b>air</b> <b>masses.</b> By investigating the simulated transport patterns associated with distinct CO 2 concentrations {{it is possible to}} decipher different source and sink areas over Europe. The highest CO 2 concentrations, for example, were observed in winter during pollution episodes when air was transported from Northeastern Europe towards the Alps, or during south Foehn events with rapid uplift of polluted air from Northern Italy, as demonstrated in two case studies. To study the importance of air-sea exchange for variations in O 2 concentrations at Jungfraujoch the correlation between CO 2 and APO (Atmospheric Potential Oxygen) deviations from a seasonally varying background was analyzed. Anomalously high APO concentrations were clearly <b>associated</b> with <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> originating from the Atlantic Ocean, whereas low APO concentrations were found in <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> advected either from the east from the Eurasian continent in summer, or from the Eastern Mediterranean in winter. Those <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> with low APO in summer were also strongly depleted in CO 2 suggesting a combination of CO 2 uptake by vegetation and O 2 uptake by dry summer soils. Other subsets of points in the APO-CO 2 scatter plot investigated with respect to <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> origin included CO 2 and APO background values and points with regular APO but anomalous CO 2 concentrations. Background values were associated with free tropospheric <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> with little contact with the boundary layer during the last few days, while high or low CO 2 concentrations reflect the various levels of influence of anthropogenic emissions and the biosphere. The pronounced cycles of CO 2 and O 2 exchanges with the biosphere and the ocean cause clusters of points and lead to a seasonal pattern...|$|R
40|$|An {{observational}} dataset from a wintertime field {{campaign in}} the Inn Valley, Austria, is analysed in order to study mechanisms of air pollution transport in an Alpine valley. The results illustrate three types of mechanisms: transport by a density current, back-and-forth transport by valley winds, and transport by slope winds. The first type is <b>associated</b> with an <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> difference along the valley. Cooler air located in {{the lower part of}} the valley behaves like a density current and produces the advection of pollutants by upvalley winds. In the second type, strong horizontal gradients in pollution concentrations exist close to ground. Multiple wind reversals result in a back-and-forth transport of pollutants by weak valley winds. In the third type, upslope winds during daytime decrease low-level pollution concentrations and cause the formation of elevated pollution layers...|$|R
