5|$|The {{ratification}} {{of this law}} was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what they regarded as the weakening {{of the meaning of}} marriage. Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> adopting children. Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain. After its approval, the conservative People's Party challenged the law in the Constitutional Court.|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
40|$|In this article, I explore {{arguments}} {{commonly used}} to support the claim that lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men should not be parents. Thematic analysis of recent media representations of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting <b>and</b> six focus groups with university students highlighted the repeated use {{of a number of}} arguments to oppose lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting. I critically discuss the six most prevalent in this article. These are: (1) “The bible tells me that lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting is a sin”; (2) “Lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting is unnatural”; (3) “Lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents are selfish because they ignore ‘the best interests of the child’”; (4) “Children in lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> families lack appropriate role models”; (5) Children in lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> families grow up lesbian and gay; and (6) “Children in lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> families get bullied. ” I examine these themes in relation to other debates about lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> women’s rights, and highlight {{the ways in which they}} reinforce a heterosexual norm...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2007 by Hypatia, Inc. All rights reservedIn this essay, Riggs {{demonstrates}} how heterosexism shapes foster-care assessment practices in Australia. Through {{an examination of}} lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> foster-care applicants' assessment reports and {{with a focus on}} the heteronormative assumptions contained within them, Riggs demonstrates that foster-care public policy and research on lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting both promote the idea that lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents are always already "just like" heterosexual parents. To counter this idea of "sameness," Riggs proposes an approach to both assessing and researching lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents that privileges the specific experiences of lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men <b>and</b> resists the heterosexualization of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> families by focusing on some potentially radical differences shaping lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> lives.

5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, <b>and</b> <b>Gays</b> (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E

40|$|Laws that {{restrict}} {{access to}} reproductive technology {{and fail to}} adequately recognise parent-child relationships in lesbian/gay families detrimentally affect not only individual lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men interested in parenting, but the broader lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> community. On the one hand these laws, as they currently stand in much of Australia, are complicit in maintaining the closet, inarticulation and silence as defining features of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> lives. On the other hand, they contribute {{to the construction of}} all lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men as non-familial and anti-family. Representations of lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men along these lines have traditionally been central to the construction of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> identity in Australia, as revealed by a survey of queer-themed Australian works of literature and popular fiction. If improving the status of lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men in heteronormative societies depends on destabilising identity categories, practices that contribute to maintaining the integrity of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> identity should be targeted for change. Reforming laws on reproduction and parenting should then be a priority for lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men, even those who do not wish to have children. 24 page(s...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis, I explore the construction of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting in psychology (Part 1), in the media (Part 2), and in lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents' talk (Part 3). My research brings together a diverse range of influences and ideas from lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> psychology, feminist psychology, and constructionist and discursive research. I draw on varied data sources: the psychological and lesbian feminist literature on lesbian (<b>and</b> <b>gay)</b> parenting, television talk shows, documentaries and newspaper articles, and research interviews with lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents. These data are analysed within a feminist constructionist framework, using discourse analysis. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts. In Part 1. 1 present my analysis of the psychological and lesbian feminist literature on lesbian (<b>and</b> <b>gay)</b> parenting. In this part of the thesis, I treat the literature as data and explore what it reveals about the social construction of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting. First, I provide a historical overview of the literature on lesbians and parenting over the last one hundred years. Then, I focus in detail on how discourses of sameness and difference and discourses of science inform the construction of lesbian (<b>and</b> <b>gay)</b> parenting in the literature. In Part 2, I analyse media constructions of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting. First, I identify arguments against lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting in talk shows and in newspaper articles. Second, I focus specifically on talk show debates and analyse how these debates are constructed and identify the key themes informing pro-lesbian/gay parenting discourse on talk shows. In Part 3, I focus in detail on lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents' talk about two issues that significantly inform psychological and media debates about their fitness to parent: homophobic bullying and male role models. I explore how lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents engage with anti-lesbian/gay claims about homophobic bullying and male role models, {{and the ways in which}} they construct bullying and role models in the process of discursively managing their identity as 'bad' parents. In the final chapter, I discuss the contributions and implications of my research, and indicate some future developments for research on lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting <b>and</b> for lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> psychology...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2007 Reconstruction'Positive' {{representations}} of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents within the media continue to draw {{parallels between the}} experiences of heterosexual parents and those of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents. Such comparisons are typically aimed at 'proving' that lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents are acceptable parents. There is, however, most often a failure to examine how race mediates {{representations of}} the category 'parent', the result being that references to 'parents' typically refer to white parents. The category parent is thus built upon a series of exclusions, ones with which white lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents may unwittingly be complicit. Through an examination of both a radio interview with the Australian Prime Minister John Howard and newspaper reports focusing on lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents, I explore how white heterosexual parenting becomes the norm from which white lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents are at times excluded, but to which {{those of us who}} identify as such parents may at times aspire. Examining the race privilege of white lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents, <b>and</b> developing an ethical framework through which to claim rights, may be one way of engaging with the problematic representation of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents more broadly.

40|$|Although {{there are}} still a number of vocal anti-{{marriage}} critics (e. g.

In the remainder of this essay, I provide a summary of the books, and then outline some of the arguments they develop in support of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> marriage. These arguments are: domestic partnerships are an illegitimate alternative to marriage; lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> marriage will diminish social prejudice, provide access to rights currently denied to lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men, not encourage distinctions between good <b>and</b> bad <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> transform traditional gender roles; and fears about normalization are misplaced...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with sociological conceptualisations of lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> sexualities as reflexive forms of existence, and identifies core problems with these. Our sociological narratives about lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> reflexivity tend to be partial in two senses. First, they talk about and envision only very particular - and relatively exclusive – experience, and fail to adequately account for the significance of difference and power in shaping diverse lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> experiences. Second, {{they tend to be}} underpinned by overly affirmative and normative projects, and are often narratives about how lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> life should be. Our narratives about lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> reflexivity sometimes confuse analysis with prescription, and actualities with potentialities. Their partiality limits the analytical purchase they afford, and is an inadequate basis on which to analyse contemporary lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> identities <b>and</b> ways of living. The article proposes an approach to studying lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> living that is orientated more towards reflexive sociology than the sociology of reflexive sexualities.

It was not until the late twentieth century, with the growing tolerance and understanding in Europe and North America towards sexual orientation <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians, that bishops and other clergy have begun coming out. However, the controversial nature of the issue in many churches has meant that such revelations normally emerge as a result of public scandal.|$|E

This study {{posits that}} {{although}} the South African government has shown an unprecedented commitment to acknowledging and upholding {{the human rights of}} lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men, negative attitudes exist towards lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men in university communities. A survey of 880 heterosexual students (356 men and 524 women) in a university community was conducted using the Attitudes Towards Lesbian <b>and</b> <b>Gay</b> Male Scale (ATLG). The results indicate that heterosexual students have negative attitudes towards lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men, that religiosity has an influence on attitudes, that contact with lesbians or gay men reduces negative attitudes, and no differences exist between race groups with regards to attitudes towards lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men. Furthermore, South African students at the University of Johannesburg have different attitudes towards lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men compared to students at a university in the United States of America.
