500|$|Along {{with other}} Final Destination characters, Clear was {{conceived}} by series creator Jeffrey Reddick. Ali Larter, who {{starred in the}} 1999 film Varsity Blues, was cast as Clear Rivers. Larter stated that she was thrilled to [...] "be playing a more introverted, darker character than [...] was accustomed to at the time". She thought the script was special and turned down all other scripts where {{she would have been}} cast in roles such as a cheerleader or a victim. Larter liked the themes of both films and thought they were fascinating within their genre. According to her, the film shows {{how easy it is to}} turn on someone and to blame someone when you're scared and about trusting your intuitions <b>and</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|E

500|$|After the war, Longstreet and {{his family}} settled in New Orleans, a {{location}} popular {{with a number of}} former Confederate generals. He entered into a cotton brokerage partnership there and also became the president of the newly created and prominent insurance company. He actively sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was unsuccessful, and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from New Orleans around the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico south across the Rio Grande river and American-Mexican border to Monterrey, Mexico, (In 1870, he was named president of the newly organized New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad). He applied for a pardon from 17th President Andrew Johnson, endorsed by his old friend and Union Army General-in-Chief, [...] Ulysses S. Grant. Johnson refused, however, telling Longstreet in a meeting: [...] "There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty: Mr. Davis, General Lee, <b>and</b> <b>yourself.</b> You have given the Union cause too much trouble." [...] Regardless of such opposition the Radical Republican controlled United States Congress restored his rights of American citizenship in June 1868.|$|E
500|$|British polymath Thomas Young {{was one of}} {{the first}} to attempt {{decipherment}} of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, basing his own work on the investigations of Swedish diplomat Johan David Åkerblad. Young and Champollion first became aware of each other's work in 1814 when Champollion wrote to the Royal Society of which Young was the secretary, requesting better transcriptions of the Rosetta stone, to Young's irritation, arrogantly implying that he would be able to quickly decipher the script if he only had better copies. Young had at that time spent several months working unsuccessfully on the Rosetta text using Åkerblad's decipherments. In 1815, Young replied in the negative, arguing that the French transcriptions were equally good as the British ones, and added that [...] "I do not doubt that the collective efforts of savants, such as M. Akerblad <b>and</b> <b>yourself,</b> Monsieur, who have so much deepened the study of the Coptic language, might have already succeeded in giving a more perfect translation than my own, which is drawn almost entirely from a very laborious comparison of its different parts and with the Greek translation" [...] This was the first Champollion had heard of Young's research, and realizing that he also had a competitor in London was not to Champollion's liking.|$|E

2500|$|Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of {{supporting}} Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as {{a criticism of}} blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; {{at the end of}} the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros [...] Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: [...] "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there". [...] Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, [...] "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov <b>and</b> <b>yourself</b> started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, [...] "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".|$|E
