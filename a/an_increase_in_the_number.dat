30|$|We {{supposed}} that <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall thickness leads to <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall stiffness and, consequently, to <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> its elastance. When {{the heart rate}} increases, the ejection duration decreases more slowly than {{the duration of the}} filling phase. Consequently <b>the</b> volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atrium <b>increases,</b> leading to <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> veinous pressure: such a phenomenon can be viewed, in our model where atria are neglected, as <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricular elastance. <b>In</b> a similar way, <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end-systolic ventricular volume induces a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricular filling (more filled the ventricle is, more difficult to continue the filling is) and, consequently, induces <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atrium: this effect is described as <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elastance proportional to the volume which, as previously explained, should depend on the heart rate. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the ventricular volume and the veinous pressure was not studied and remains to validate. Such a dependency was important to be able to reproduce the proposed mechanism.|$|R
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912.

It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{successive}} championships, Liverpool's fortunes declined {{as their}} side aged. Some {{of the players}} had begun their careers before the war; goalkeeper Scott {{had been in the}} side since 1912. The club began the 1923–24 season aiming to win three league titles in a row, but finished in twelfth place. They achieved fourth place the following season, which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War. Changes to the offside rule in the 1925–26 season resulted in <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of goals scored during matches. Liverpool contributed to this, with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United, but could only manage a seventh-place finish.|$|E

The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E
