5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unit's soldiers.|$|E
50|$|Bullet {{diameter}} {{is measured}} either as <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch (usually in 1/100 or in 1/1000) or in millimetres. Cartridge case length {{can also be}} designated in inches or millimetres.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{chromosomal}} aneuploidy is <b>a</b> trisomy <b>of</b> chromosome 21 which manifests itself as Down syndrome. Current technological limitations typically allow only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual's genotype {{to be determined}} efficiently.|$|R
60|$|Wild Water Charley, a {{strapping}} young giant just <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch {{under six}} {{feet in height}} and carrying <b>a</b> clean weight <b>of</b> one hundred and ninety pounds, entered and shook hands.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} {{did not allow}} the U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John McCain and Barack Obama said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> percentage point.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

50|$|Typical values {{range from}} 2 percent for {{straight}} segments to 10 percent for sharp superelevated curves. It {{may also be}} expressed as <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch in rise over a one-foot run (e.g. 1/4 inch per foot).|$|R
5000|$|The Tropic of Capricorn goes {{directly}} through runway 09R/27L, at exactly 23° 26' 13.8" [...] S, 46° 28' 52.8" [...] W as of April 2016 (the exact latitude of the Tropics varies by <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arc-second every year).|$|R
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed {{on a variety of}} invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E

50|$|A {{recent study}} showed that for {{gravitropism}} to occur in shoots, only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inclination, instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong gravitational force, is necessary.

25|$|The {{development}} {{was built on}} landfill; the original marshland still surrounds it. The building foundations extend down to bedrock through 50,000 pilings, but the land surrounding Co-op's structures settles and sinks <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch each year, creating cracks in sidewalks and entrances to buildings.|$|R
25|$|Curtis's {{style is}} typified {{by the use}} of {{frequent}} and often incongruous cuts of film and music, often lasting only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second, in a technique similar to sampling.|$|E
25|$|Modern BLDC motors {{range in}} power from <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors {{up to about}} 100kW rating are used in {{electric}} vehicles. They also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft.|$|E
25|$|With {{conventional}} interlocking the red aspect only remains alight for <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second {{while the}} junction-indicator is proved locally.

50|$|Locker doors {{usually have}} door {{stiffeners}} fixed vertically {{to the inside}} of the door, in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> metal plate welded to the inner surface, and protruding outward <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch, thus adding to the robustness of the door and making it harder to force open.|$|R
50|$|The FPP also {{includes}} a Correlation Tracker (CT) which locks onto solar granulation to stabilize the SOT images to <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arcsecond. The spatial resolution of the SOT is <b>a</b> factor <b>of</b> 5 improvement over previous space-based solar telescopes (e.g., the MDI instrument on the SOHO).|$|R
60|$|Into {{this minute}} {{aperture}} I attempted to peer, {{but whether it}} was but <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch deep or passed completely through the door I could not tell--at least no light showed beyond it. I put my ear to it next and listened, but again my efforts brought negligible results.|$|R
25|$|The usual {{translation}} into English is the Red Army Faction; {{however, the}} founders wanted {{it not to}} reflect a splinter group but rather an embryonic militant unit that was embedded in or part of a wider communist workers' movement, i.e. <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whole.|$|E
25|$|Fractions are {{themselves}} singular or plural {{depending on the}} numerator (e.g. one eighth vs two eighths), and whatever they apply to can be singular or plural (e.g., {{three quarters of the}} apple(s)), depending on whether it refers to <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single item or many items.|$|E
25|$|Trace {{storage is}} an extra feature {{available}} on some analog scopes; they used direct-view storage CRTs. Storage allows the trace pattern that normally decays in <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second {{to remain on}} the screen for several minutes or longer. An electrical circuit can then be deliberately activated to store and erase the trace on the screen.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{temperament}} <b>of</b> rank two {{which is}} not linear has one generator which is <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> octave, called the period.

50|$|The radar array {{aboard the}} shuttle began <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> {{observations}} above volcanoes, glaciers and other sites {{designed to create}} 3-D images. These spaceborne radar images, produced regularly on a long-term basis, eventually could provide scientists with insight into movements of the Earth's surface as small as <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch.|$|R
50|$|In statistics, {{pictograms}} are {{charts in}} which icons represent numbers {{to make it}} more interesting and easier to understand. A key is often included to indicate what each icon represents.

25|$|In business, {{fractional}} ownership is a percentage share of an expensive asset. Shares are sold to individual owners. Typically, a company manages the asset {{on behalf of}} the owners, who pay monthly/annual fees for the management plus variable (e.g., per-hour, per-day) use fees. For rapidly depreciating assets, the management company may sell the asset and distribute the proceeds back to the owners, who can then claim a capital loss and optionally purchase <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new asset.|$|E
25|$|Lightning {{scattering}} {{has sometimes}} been observed on VHF and UHF over distances of about 500km. The hot lightning channel scatters radio-waves for <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second. The RF noise burst from the lightning makes the initial part of the open channel unusable and the ionization disappears quickly because of recombination at low altitude and high atmospheric pressure. Although the hot lightning channel is briefly observable with microwave radar, no practical use for this mode {{has been found in}} communications.|$|E
25|$|When rocks melt, they do {{so slowly}} and {{gradually}} because most rocks are made of several minerals, which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex. As a rock melts, for example, its volume changes. When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock. Under pressure within the earth, as little as <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source.|$|E
