25|$|In 1975, Miller fired John Sulka, the union's {{executive}} safety director. The {{cause of}} his termination was disagreement over how strongly the union should continue to pressure employers on safety. Miller felt miners were not giving his reforms <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> while Sulka wished to continue to move forward. Later that year, Chip Yablonski resigned as general counsel.|$|E

Engineer Patrick Naughton had become increasingly frustrated with the state of Sun's C++ and C application programming interfaces (APIs) and tools. While considering moving to NeXT, Naughton was offered <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on new technology, and thus the Stealth Project started.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Conklin and Wilkins shows growth and {{advances}} in reading levels among elementary students when using a guided reading approach. Working {{with the teacher}} in small groups gave students <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on specific skills, at their reading level. Students gained confidence when reading 'just right' texts. Since they were not struggling with the text {{they were able to}} develop vocabulary, reading comprehension skills and oral language skills. Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students. The results showed an increase in reading fluency and comprehension after using flexible grouping in guided reading.|$|E

25|$|Another {{test was}} electronic; {{they were asked}} to {{influence}} the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they got used to it. In fact, they were simply palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down {{on one end of the}} fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.|$|E
25|$|Voigt {{has made}} a number of {{recordings}} which include two solo compact discs. She is on the live recording of the Vienna State Opera's production of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde for Deutsche Grammophon (2003). In a 2001 interview with Associated Press, however, Voigt expressed that she was unlucky with recording because of unexpected cancellations and postponements. The opportunities of cooperation with high profile musicians could have made her a major prima donna more quickly. She had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in a televised production of Verdi's La forza del destino in 1997. However, the performance did not take place since Pavarotti had not learned the role of Alvaro and another opera was substituted. Later the same year, Voigt was cast to sing for a new recording of Tristan und Isolde under the direction of Sir Georg Solti. Before it proceeded, Solti suddenly died of a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} {{pioneering}} {{a program that}} has now {{become part of the}} World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.|$|E

25|$|By 1982, Peckinpah's {{health was}} poor. Producers Peter S. Davis and William N. Panzer were undaunted, as {{they felt that}} having Peckinpah's name {{attached}} to The Osterman Weekend (1983) would lend the suspense thriller an air of respectability. Peckinpah accepted the job but reportedly hated the convoluted screenplay based upon Robert Ludlum's novel, which he also disliked. Multiple actors in Hollywood auditioned for the film, intrigued by the opportunity. Many of those who signed on, including John Hurt, Burt Lancaster and Dennis Hopper, did so for less than their usual salaries for <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the legendary director. By the time shooting wrapped in January 1983 in Los Angeles, Peckinpah and the producers were hardly speaking. Nevertheless, Peckinpah brought the film in on time and on budget, delivering his director's cut to the producers. Davis and Panzer were unhappy with Peckinpah's version, which included an opening sequence of two characters making love. The producers changed the opening and also deleted other scenes they deemed unnecessary. The Osterman Weekend had some effective action sequences and some strong supporting performances, but Peckinpah's final film was critically panned. It grossed $6 million in the United States and did well in Europe and on the new home-video market.|$|E

Gainey began playing the character as such, and in season four Tom is shown kissing another man on the cheek. Lost producer Damon Lindelof commented that this revelation was [...] "not subtle, to say the least". Tom was received positively by critics, particularly in his first appearance.|$|E

500|$|With {{a script}} in hand, Mani Ratnam {{had an idea}} to either get a {{producer}} for his film or to narrate the script to a [...] "celebrated" [...] film-maker, {{so that he could}} get <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> along with them and get to know about the various aspects involved in film-making. He chose three directors—Balachander, Bharathiraja, and Mahendran. As the attempts to meet and convince all the three proved to be unsuccessful, he decided to look out for a producer. In the process, he along with P. C. Sreeram—who would collaborate with him in most of his future projects—met around 20 people; however, all the efforts turned out to be unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Keeler, who had been {{watching}} a lot of Frasier {{at the time and}} had been assigned to write a Sideshow Bob episode and {{he thought it would be}} a good idea to mix the two.

But how often do you get <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?"

William Asher later stated that Temperatures Rising gave him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a black actor. Fox was cast in Temperatures Rising after Elizabeth Montgomery spotted her in a commercial for Close-Up toothpaste. Asher had considered her for a part in The Paul Lynde Show.

Meyjes was in negotiations to direct the film, but after he declined, Grazer thought this project was <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Spike Lee, who had already learned of Gewirtz's script.

500|$|The film's B movie-esque title {{generated}} {{a lot of}} pre-release interest on the Internet. One journalist wrote that Snakes on a Plane is [...] "perhaps the most internet-hyped film of all time". Much of the initial publicity came from a blog entry made by screenwriter Josh Friedman, who had been offered <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the script. The casting of Samuel L. Jackson further increased anticipation. At one point, the film was given the title Pacific Air Flight 121, only to have it changed back to the working title at Samuel Jackson's request. In August 2005, Samuel Jackson told an interviewer, [...] "We're totally changing that back. That's the only reason I took the job: I read the title." [...] On March 2, 2006, the studio reverted the title to Snakes on a Plane. New Line hired two additional writers to smooth out the screenplay.|$|E

As many as 1,000 refugees arrived, attributed by German sources to a Jewish organization which was responsible for smuggling Jews into the country. The refugees did not experience persecution to the level that Jews were experiencing in German-controlled territories, because the Italians considered them to be of economic importance and [...] "representative of Italian interests abroad". However, the Italians did arrest approximately 150 Jewish refugees and transferred them {{to the town of}} Berat in Albania, where they were given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to earn money.

500|$|The episode [...] "Brother from Another Series" [...] {{introduces}} Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But {{how often do you}} get <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E
