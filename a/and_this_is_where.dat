5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford. It {{had been his}} wish, however, to be buried at the family's traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> he was finally buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may {{have been inspired by}} a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E

25|$|Willey Green {{is in part}} at {{the lowest}} point of the parish and was once prone to flooding.

In 1873–1875, the old courthouse was extended towards the river <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the Supreme Court of the Colony held its sessions from 1875 until 1939 when the first Supreme Court was built. Maxwell's original house became the Assembly House in 1954 after extensive renovations and reconstruction. The decision to build a new Town Hall was made in 1854; the building was completed in 1862.|$|E
25|$|Singapore River {{is where}} the {{colourful}} and romantic history {{of the river and}} the myths and legends can still conjure up memories of the lighters, bumboats, tongkangs with their painted eyes to see the danger ahead and sampans of yesteryear. This {{is where the}} Malayan princes once sailed <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the bullock carts plodded their way up and down each bank as the river found its way to the former rocky river mouth.

25|$|Cinemas {{themselves}} {{began to}} be established landmarks {{in the years immediately}} before World War I. Before this, German filmmakers would tour with their works, travelling from fairground to fairground. The earliest ongoing cinemas were set up in cafes and pubs by owners who saw a way of attracting more customers. The storefront cinema was called a Kientopp, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> films were viewed for the most part before World War I. The first standalone, dedicated cinema in Germany was opened in Mannheim in 1906, and by 1910, there were over 1000 cinemas operating in Germany. Henny Porten and Asta Nielsen (the latter originally from Denmark) were the first major film stars in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{more recent}} titles such as Still Waters <b>and</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Where</b> I Came In {{were among the}} first batch of re-releases.

25|$|A leg {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an {{anti-clockwise}} spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> it gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.|$|E
25|$|In a December 2015 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ahern said low pay workers had brought country {{to its knees}} because they got “cocky” and insisted on “second, third and even fourth homes”. The former Taoiseach said that the availability of cheap credit through Ireland's involvement in the eurozone created “a huge problem”. “Anyone could walk into any institution and seem to get any amount of money <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the cocky bit came in. “Unfortunately… Joe Soap and Mary Soap, who never had a lot, got the loans for the second house and leveraged the third house off the second house and the fourth on the third, and you know, what are you having yourself.” People, among them those who had previously regarded the former Taoiseach highly, took to social media and the airwaves to criticise Ahern for his remarks.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans {{commenced}} their advance at 0600 on 19 July. [...] Colonel Konemann led a German force comprising {{elements of}} the 153rd Infantry Reserve Regiment and two companies of the 52nd Infantry Reserve Regiment from the north into Delville Wood, attacking B Company of the 3rd South African Regiment. [...] The 2nd Regiment had been decimated the previous day and had left a large gap on the left flank of the 3rd Regiment <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> the German penetration was made. [...] With so few men left, the German assault could not be countered and the remaining members of the 3rd Regiment were taken prisoner.|$|R

His interest in photography was renewed {{and he was able}} to exchange a homemade battery for a camera owned by Isaac Norris, later the Secretary of the Franklin Institute. His work and ambitions in photography grew and he bought a better lens for five dollars from the “Buckeye Blacksmith” who ran an ambrotype gallery near Toby’s drug store, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> he <b>was</b> introduced to the ambrotype process.

500|$|The modern {{abbreviation}} [...] "KV" [...] {{stands for}} [...] "Kings' Valley", and the tombs are numbered {{according to their}} order of 'discovery', from KV1 (Rameses VII) to KV64 (discovered in 2012).

KV5 was only rediscovered in the 1990s after being dismissed as unimportant by previous investigators. The West Valley tombs often carry the prefix [...] "WV", but they follow the same numbering system. Some of the tombs are unoccupied, others remain unidentifiable as regards to their owners, and still others are merely pits used for storage.

500|$|Having {{spent the}} {{previous}} {{ten years in}} the various Army schools, Major Middleton requested a return to Camp Benning, {{where he and his}} wife still had friends. The request was approved and he was assigned as a battalion commander in the 29th Infantry Regiment there, the same unit in which he had enlisted nineteen years earlier at Fort Porter. [...] He was at Benning for only a year when he was told he would be assigned to the General Staff at the War Department in Washington D.C., but this changed when a new requirement for career officers was brought to his attention. Officers were now expected to have an assignment with a civilian component of the Army such as the National Guard, the Reserves, or the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). The last option appealed to Middleton the most, and he wanted to work at a school in the south. There was an opening at Louisiana State University (LSU), <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> Middleton soon headed.|$|E

It appeared that Gethin's Canada pace had not been carried over, as he was back behind Hulme and in 21st on the grid, 3.05 seconds behind Ickx on pole, although he was ahead of de Adamich. He raced strongly {{in the first half}} of the race, crucially getting ahead of the Brabhams of Jack Brabham and Rolf Stommelen, but both were able to pass him before too long. Tim Schenken and Clay Regazzoni, who was recovering from technical problems, also exposed his deficiencies in racecraft, leaving him 14th <b>and</b> last, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> he finished, 8 laps down on winner Emerson Fittipaldi in the Lotus.|$|R
