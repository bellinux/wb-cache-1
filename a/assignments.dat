5|$|Sutner {{defines a}} {{directed}} graph (a type of de Bruijn graph) {{in which each}} vertex represents a pair of <b>assignments</b> of states for the cells in a contiguous sequence of cells. The length of this sequence is chosen to be one less than the neighborhood size of the automaton. An edge in Sutner's graph represents a pair of sequences of cells that overlap {{in all but one}} cell, so that the union of the sequences is a full neighborhood in the cellular automaton. Each such edge is directed from the overlapping subsequence on the left to the subsequence on the right. Edges are only included in the graph when they represent compatible state <b>assignments</b> on the overlapping parts of their cell sequences, and when the automaton rule (applied to the neighborhood determined by the potential edge) would give the same results for both <b>assignments</b> of states. By performing a linear-time strong connectivity analysis of this graph, it is possible to determine which of its vertices belong to cycles. The transition rule is non-injective if and only if this graph contains a directed cycle in which at least one vertex has two differing state <b>assignments.</b>|$|E

40|$|An <b>assignment</b> {{situation}} {{can be considered}} as a two-sided market consisting of two disjoint sets of objects. A non-negative reward matrix describes the profit if an object of one group is assigned to an object of the other group. Assuming that each object is owned by a different agent, Shapley and Shubik (1972) introduced a class of <b>assignment</b> games arising from these <b>assignment</b> situations. This paper introduces <b>assignment</b> situations with multiple ownership. In these situations each object can be owned by several agents and each agent can participate in the ownership of more than one object. In this paper we study simple <b>assignment</b> games and relaxations that arise from <b>assignment</b> situations with multiple ownership. First, necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for balanced <b>assignment</b> situations with multiple ownership. An <b>assignment</b> situation with multiple ownership is balanced if for any choice of the reward matrix the corresponding simple <b>assignment</b> game is balanced. Second, balancedness results are obtained for relaxations of simple <b>assignment</b> games. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{interference}} {{constraints of}} genetic spectrum <b>assignment</b> model in cognitive radio networks are analyzed in this paper. An improved genetic spectrum <b>assignment</b> model is proposed. The population of genetic algorithm {{is divided into}} two sets, the feasible spectrum <b>assignment</b> strategies and the randomly updated spectrum <b>assignment</b> strategies. The penalty function is added to the utility function to achieve the spectrum <b>assignment</b> strategy that satisfies the interference constraints and has better fitness. The proposed method is applicable in both the genetic spectrum <b>assignment</b> model and the quantum genetic spectrum <b>assignment</b> mode. It can ensure the randomness of partial chromosomes in the population to some extent, and reduce the computational complexity caused by the constraints-free procedure after the update of population. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the conventional genetic spectrum <b>assignment</b> model and quantum genetic spectrum <b>assignment</b> mode...|$|R

5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (<b>assignments</b> of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (<b>assignments</b> of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E

5|$|McNair had {{difficulty}} implementing {{a training program}} for National Guard units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the Secretary of War disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside <b>assignments,</b> or non-combat overseas <b>assignments.</b> Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant.
