5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at <b>all.</b> <b>Just</b> as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E

Then, Potty wakes him up after he thought he is back in Encino, which is <b>all</b> <b>just</b> a dream. Patchy begins to eat a sandwich, which Potty brings to him, but he finds mayonnaise on it. He tries to give it to a vulture.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen {{is perhaps}} most closely {{associated}} outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are <b>all</b> <b>just</b> over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are {{a key component of}} the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In the Second (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic and sanguine).|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is <b>all</b> <b>just</b> memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
25|$|Robert Boyle (1627–1691) {{pioneered the}} {{scientific}} method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, {{the position of the}} Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, <b>all</b> <b>just</b> in case they proved to be relevant. This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier and John Dalton.|$|E

25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners with {{a needle}} graphic that moves {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED {{displays}} have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of the LEDs cyclically to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are <b>all</b> <b>just</b> display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy. For more on how strobe tuners work see the dedicated section.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism {{contains}} many different sub-cultures just {{like most other}} religions. The major aspects outlined above hold true {{for the majority of}} the Hindu population, but not <b>all.</b> <b>Just</b> as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the Prajapatis for example, hold water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times. This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.|$|E
25|$|A devil of the Gremory clan, one of {{the highest-ranking}} devil families, Rias {{initially}} saves Issei after he was attacked by a fallen angel, Raynare. Issei wakes up the next morning, thinking that the events that occurred were <b>all</b> <b>just</b> a dream, but then notices Rias naked in his room. Rias reveals to Issei her true identity as a devil and says {{that as a result}} of his death at the hands of Raynare, she has reincarnated him as a devil, becoming his new master in the process. Rias is the head of Kuoh Academy's Occult Research school club, where Issei, Rias, and the club members interact with various groups and organizations, some of which are run by devils who compete against them in sanctioned combat matches called Rating Games, where the characters have been assigned positions akin to chess pieces.|$|E

25|$|Jade visits her bed-ridden {{father in}} the Emerald City, and offers to use her {{abilities}} to help him walk again. Alan declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it {{could result in the}} deaths of everyone in the city. Eclipso attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick having to get Alan to safety. After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the starheart then defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster, and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams {{to attract the attention of}} the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, who he kills, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive, and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for <b>all.</b> <b>Just</b> as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. However, it is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker, who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart again.|$|E

500|$|Not all {{critics were}} positive. Chris Steffen of Rolling Stone {{magazine}} dismissed the album, noting that it [...] "mines {{much of the}} same territory as its predecessor, God Hates Us <b>All,</b> <b>just</b> without the memorable riffs." [...] Jamie Thomson of The Guardian described the album as [...] "wholly disappointing," [...] and thought the band sounded [...] "unwilling to ditch the nu-metal tendencies that have made much of their recent output so resistible." [...] KNAC.com contributor Peter Atkinson felt that the album [...] "demands OUTRAGE —more calculatingly so than any other album the band has done," [...] and that [...] "that, in a nutshell, is Christ Illusions glaring weakness." ...|$|E

[...] Urish and Bielen described Lennon's [...] "dream world" [...] without a heaven or hell as a call to [...] "make the best world we can here and now, since this is all this is or will be". In their opinion, [...] "because we are asked merely to imagine—to play a 'what if' game, Lennon can escape the harshest criticisms". Former Beatle Ringo Starr defended the song's lyrics during a 1981 interview with Barbara Walters, stating: [...] " [...] said 'imagine', that's <b>all.</b> <b>Just</b> imagine it." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} line-up, Hanneman, King and Araya {{contributed to the}} band's lyrics, and King and Hanneman wrote the music with additional arrangement from Lombardo, and sometimes Araya. It is unclear why Lombardo has never received any writing credits in Slayer's history. Araya formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which sometimes overshadowed the creative input of King. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music was a [...] "free-for-all": [...] "It's <b>all</b> <b>just</b> whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry – it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good, we use it; if not, we don't." ...|$|E
500|$|Rohrer {{noted in}} an {{interview}} his aversion to creating a [...] "ridiculous caricature of some post-apocalyptic man’s world, where we’ll <b>all</b> <b>just</b> robbing each other," [...] and instead called his game pre-apocalyptic in setting and style. In terms of aesthetics, Rohrer aimed for a [...] "very clean, no frills, no fluff, no filler kind of design" [...] that emphasized function {{in all of its}} objects. He has noted that some players have complained {{about not being able to}} decorate their houses non-functionally, but is unsympathetic, saying that the game is not FarmVille. The game was, however, influenced by Minecraft, which—while heavily tied to cosmetic decoration—involves similar themes of protecting one's creations from other players as in The Castle Doctrine.|$|E
