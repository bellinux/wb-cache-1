5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.|$|E
5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and the dressing rooms consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch, which {{made it more difficult}} for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking behind one of the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> small seated stand was erected.|$|E
5|$|The {{consciousness}} accelerated until in the 1840s {{two academic}} groups, the Oxford Society and the Cambridge Camden Society both pronounced {{that the only}} suitable style in which to design a church was Gothic. The critic John Ruskin was an ardent advocate of all things medieval and popularised these ideas. The architect Augustus Welby Pugin, who designed mainly for the growing Roman Catholic Church, set himself to recreate not only the structural appearance of medieval churches, but also the richly decorated and colourful interiors that had been almost entirely lost, existing only as a painted screen here <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>a</b> few tiled floors such as those at Winchester and Canterbury and the intricate painted wooden ceiling of Peterborough Cathedral.|$|E

25|$|Florrie O'Donoghue, {{intelligence}} {{officer of the}} 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, described the scene in Cork {{on the morning of}} the 12th:Many familiar landmarks were gone forever– where whole buildings had collapsed here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> solitary wall leaned at some crazy angle from its foundation. The streets ran with sooty water, the footpaths were strewn with broken glass and debris, ruins smoked and smoldered and over everything was the all-pervasive smell of burning.|$|E

25|$|With the {{so-called}} Primary Chronicle, also attributed to Nestor, begins the {{long series of}} the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work attributed to Nestor the Chronicler, we have chronicles of Novgorod, Kiev, Volhynia and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, Pskov and Suzdal among others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters, remind us of Herodotus, dry details alternating with here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> picturesque incident; {{and many of these}} annals abound with the quaintest stories.|$|E

500|$|Bax's First Symphony {{was written}} in 1921–22, and when first given {{it was a great}} success, despite its ferocity of tone. The critics found the work dark and severe. The Daily News commented, [...] "It is full of arrogant, almost blatant, virility. Its {{prevailing}} tone colour is dark, very dark – thick clouds with only here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> ray of sunlight." [...] The Daily Telegraph suggested that if there was any humour in the piece, it was sardonic. The Manchester Guardian noted the severity of the work, but declared it [...] "a truly great English symphony". The work was a box-office attraction at the Proms for several years after the premiere. In Foreman's view, Bax was at his musical peak for a fairly short time, and his reputation was overtaken by those of Vaughan Williams and William Walton. The Third Symphony was completed in 1929 and, championed by Wood, remained for some time among the composer's most popular works.|$|E
5000|$|Browne {{said in a}} radio interview: [...] "It's about runaways, and, you know... {{as sort of a}} bystander, it's about Hollywood Boulevard. I used to {{live right}} above Hollywood Boulevard, <b>and</b> <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> place called The Gold Cup <b>and</b> <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> lot of runaway kids <b>and</b> <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> lot of teen {{prostitution}} around there. It was partly written {{from the point of view}} of a young person on that street, yet it's not really immersed in that. You're sort of, maybe, empathizing with them to some degree, and also trying to say 'it's only time.' It's time on the boulevard, but this doesn't mean this is who you are and where you'll always be, I guess was what I was trying to say..." ...|$|R

500|$|Similarly, The Illustrated London News {{concluded}} that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert's [...] "caustic humour and quaint satire". It {{found that there was}} [...] "much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits.... Dr. Sullivan's music is as lively as the text to which it is set, with here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> touch of sentimental expression... The piece is well performed throughout." [...] The Daily News, The Globe, The Times (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and The Standard concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, [...] "adds to the reality of the illusion". The Times also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a [...] "national musical stage" [...] with a libretto free from risqué French [...] "improprieties" [...] and without the [...] "aid" [...] of Italian and German musical models.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, [...] "Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here <b>and</b> <b>there.</b> <b>A</b> lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Ian McDiarmid {{required}} little make-up in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. He recalled, [...] "I'm ... slightly aged [...] In {{the last}} film, I had a fairly standard make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my face." [...] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked {{in an interview}} with Star Wars Insider magazine, [...] "Yes—that was a four-hour job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the end. But this was {{just a little bit of}} latex here <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>a</b> little bit of skin-scrunching." [...] He told the Homing Beacon newsletter, [...] "When my face changes in the film, my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney, Sr.." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he [...] "looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal" [...] (1957) and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).|$|E

500|$|Starting out for Franz Josef Land to the {{south-east}} on July 22, {{the three}} soon {{found that their}} struggle across the ice, which had ridges two-stories high, was hardly bringing the goal any nearer: the drift of the ice was in the opposite direction, moving them backwards. On August 4 they decided, after a long discussion, to aim for Sjuøyane in the southwest instead, hoping to reach the depot there after a six- to seven-week march, {{with the help of}} the current. The terrain in that direction was mostly extremely difficult, sometimes necessitating a crawl on all fours, but there was occasional relief in the form of open water—the little boat (not designed by Andrée) was apparently a functional and safe conveyance—and smooth, flat ice floes. [...] "Paradise!" [...] wrote Andrée. [...] "Large even ice floes with pools of sweet drinking water and here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> tender-fleshed young polar bear!" [...] They made fair apparent headway, but the wind turned almost as soon as they did, and they were again being pushed backwards, away from Sjuøyane. The wind varied between southwest and northwest over the coming weeks; they tried in vain to overcome this by turning more and more westward, but it was becoming clear that Sjuøyane was out of their reach.|$|E
