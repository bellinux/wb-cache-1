5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer {{is found in the}} rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus. RNAi has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{contains}} a bioactive compound named clitocine that has antibiotic activity against {{a number of}} bacteria that are pathogenic to humans, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis; an earlier (1945) study showed antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi, and Brucea abortus. Clitocine has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to promote apoptosis (cell death) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro (HeLa). The mycelia of L.giganteus, when grown in liquid culture, {{has been shown to}} produce phenols and flavonoids that have antioxidant activity.|$|E

5|$|Regardless, {{research}} {{has continued to}} illuminate {{the complexity of the}} lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the ring-tailed lemur. As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated that they could be trained through operant conditioning using standard schedules of reinforcement. The species {{has been shown to be}} capable of learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The ring-tailed lemur has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.|$|E
5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Suillus sibiricus {{has been}} {{recorded}} in parts of Europe, North America and Siberia. The fungus forms strict ectomycorrhizal associations with pines of the subgenus Strobus. These include Swiss pine (Pinus cembra) in the Alps and Tatras of central Europe, Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in the Balkans, western white pine (P.monticola) and limber pine (P.flexilis) in the Pacific Northwest of North America, P.banksiana in Quebec, Canada, and Siberian pine (P.sibirica) and Siberian dwarf pine (P.pumila) in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The range of the fungus is hence limited by {{the distribution of the}} host tree. S.sibiricus has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to be able to form ectomycorrhizae with the Himalayan species P.wallichiana in pure culture conditions in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet may be {{a successful}} treatment for several rare metabolic diseases. Case reports of two children indicate that it {{may be a}} possible treatment for astrocytomas, a type of brain tumour. Autism, depression, migraine headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2 have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to improve in small case studies. There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} by ecologists due {{to a number of}} unique features it possesses. It is a representative example of a plant whose seeds are spread through myrmecochory, or ant-mediated dispersal, which is effective in increasing the plant's ability to outcross, but ineffective in bringing the plant very far. This has led ecologists to question how it and similar plants were able to survive glaciation events during the ice ages. The height of the species has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to be an effective index of how intense foraging by deer is in a particular area.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E
