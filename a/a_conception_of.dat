5|$|Æthelred usually {{acted with}} the {{permission}} of or in association with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history). While poets and dramatists were {{reworking}} the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E
2500|$|... "Where is [...] learned? In life." [...] And how can earnestness be lost? How is it {{related to}} the resolution? Does [...] "love conquer everything?" [...] Kierkegaard thinks, [...] "a true <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> life and of oneself is {{required}} for the resolution of marriage; but this already implies the second great requirement, which is just like the first: <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> God. No one can have <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> God without having <b>a</b> corresponding <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> life and oneself, or <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> life without <b>a</b> corresponding <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> God, or <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> life without <b>a</b> corresponding <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> oneself. But <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> God is required; an understanding between God and the happy one is required, and thus a language is required in which they talk to each other. This language is the resolution, the only language in which God will involve himself with a human being." [...] He asks, [...] "Where does a person find guidance if he himself does not work out his own soul's salvation in fear and trembling"? He's writing about the wedding ceremony in this discourse just as he wrote about it in Either/Or and Repetition. Here he presents his own imaginative construction {{of the value of the}} single individual making a decision about marriage in the presence of God. Even though he never married he still knows that [...] "the adult learns only by appropriating and he essentially appropriates the essential only by doing it." ...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{examines}} a presupposed {{correlation between}} the way one look upon values and the way one look upon {{the will of the}} people in a theoretical democratic context. The more specific purpose is to test the following hypothesis: There is a reversed connection between the way one look upon values and the way one look upon {{the will of the people}} in a theoretical democratic context, that is; a strong claim of values give reason to <b>a</b> limited <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the will of the people and a weak claim of values gives reason for <b>a</b> more unlimited <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the will of the people. In order to test the hypothesis I examine three different <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> democracy, these are: pluralist democracy, deliberative democracy and constitutional democracy. I analyze the way they look upon values, there view of the will of the people and finally if there is a connection between the way they look upon values and the will of the people. Values should be understood in a metaethical context. In other words it is not values in the “common” meaning, instead its how val-ues in them selves should be understood, and even more relevant, what we mean when we ex-press values. My conclusions are, first and foremost, that there is a {{correlation between the}} will of the people and values, according to the formulation of the hypothesis. This leaves, for that specific issue, two alternatives; <b>a</b> weak <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> values with <b>a</b> strong <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the will of the people, and, <b>a</b> strong <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> values with <b>a</b> weak <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the will of the people. I also conclude that there are problems with both alternatives. <b>A</b> weak <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> values could result in moral diffi-culties, such as a majority oppresses a minority. And <b>a</b> strong <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> values could result in an excavation of democracy. <b>As</b> for the <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> democracy, I conclude that the pluralistic democracy has a relativistic view on values and an (more or less) unlimited <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the will of the people. The delibera-tive democracy has <b>a</b> similar <b>conception</b> with <b>a</b> few exceptions. The constitutional democracy have <b>a</b> somewhat relativistic <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> values but with objectivistic elements, and hence <b>a</b> limited <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the will of the people...|$|R

Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's {{work in this area}} was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.|$|E

25|$|The {{translation}} of Thomas Taylor (1887) {{has given rise}} to <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> Melinoe as half-black, half-white, representing the duality of the heavenly Zeus and the infernal Pluto. This had been the interpretation of Gottfried Hermann in his annotated text of the hymns in 1805. This duality may be implicit, like the explanation offered by Servius for why the poplar leaf has a light and dark side to represent Leuke ("White"), a nymph loved by Pluto. The Orphic text poses interpretational challenges for translators in this passage.|$|E

In particular kintsugi implies that the authentic is that which displays and values its true, dynamic relation to history.

25|$|The letter {{shown in}} her right hand {{contains}} a demand from David for her to choose between fidelity to her husband or obedience to her king, and is an anecdotal catalyst for her introspection. In representing this moment, Rembrandt extrapolated from the biblical text, which treated Bathsheba incidentally while focusing on David's sinfulness. As a result, her expression is profound enough to suggest not only her sense of resignation, but the broader narrative as well. As <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the nude figure suffused with complexity of thought, Bathsheba at Her Bath is nearly unique in art.|$|E
25|$|Althusser's {{influence}} is also {{seen in the}} work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick, who have interpreted that Marx's mature works hold <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> class different from the normally understood ones. For them, in Marx class refers not to a group of people (for example, those that own the means of production versus those that do not), but to a process involving the production, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor. Their emphasis on class as a process is consistent with their reading and use of Althusser's concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.|$|E
25|$|In {{presenting}} {{his theory}} of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of utilitarianism. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly {{the desire to be}} happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society, and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim per se—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.|$|E

25|$|In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites {{passages}} from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French {{literature of the}} day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the reader who must recognise the sources and appreciate {{the results of the}} revision. Marino challenges the reader to pick up on the quotations and to enjoy {{the way in which the}} material has been reworked, as part of <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> poetic creation in which everything in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone into a kind of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instance}} of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought {{is found in}} the Gathas of Zarathustra, composed between 1,000BCE600BCE in Greater Iran. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic god or Great Architect of the Universe was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life. This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu.|$|E
25|$|He {{participated in}} the conference {{that led to the}} merger of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, the Lettriste Internationale, and London Psychogeographical Association to form the Situationist International in 1957.

Jorn never believed in <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and {{at the core of the}} Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord. The Situationist general principles were an attack on the capitalist exploitation and degradation of the life of people, and solution of alternative life experiences, construction of situations, unitary urbanism, psychogeography, with the union of play, freedom and critical thinking. Such general principles were applied by Jorn to painting.|$|E
