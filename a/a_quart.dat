Solihull Police Court later heard how, after Jenkyns lost the race, he knocked his opponent off his bicycle, hit another man, {{and returned to the}} public house where he struck a third man in the face. He was convicted on three counts of assault, and fined 20s plus costs on each count. In the following day's visit to Everton, Small Heath had Oliver and Charles Partridge to thank for the score being restricted to 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E

Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for the Pontiac, the “Iron Duke,” nicknamed for its heavy iron block. This engine was too blocky to fit into the tiny car so it was equipped with a smaller oil pan, causing the engine to always run <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> low.|$|E

When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: [...] "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them."

500|$|Another form of wife selling was by deed of conveyance. Although {{initially}} {{much less}} common than sale by auction, the practice became more widespread after the 1850s, as popular opinion {{turned against the}} market sale of a wife. The issue of the commonly perceived legitimacy of wife selling was also brought to the government. In 1881, Home Secretary William Harcourt was asked to comment on an incident in Sheffield, in which a man sold his wife for <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> of beer. Harcourt replied: [...] "no impression exists anywhere in England that the selling of wives is legitimate", and [...] "that no such practice as wife selling exists", but as late as 1889, {{a member of the}} Salvation Army sold his wife for a shilling in Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, and subsequently led her by the halter to her buyer's house, the last case in which the use of a halter is mentioned. The most recent case of an English wife sale was reported in 1913, when a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court during a maintenance case claimed that her husband had sold her to one of his workmates for £1 (equivalent to about £ in [...] ). The manner of her sale is unrecorded.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{initiative}} was usually the husband's, the wife {{had to agree}} to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that [...] "after several biddings she [...] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> of ale". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers. In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife [...] "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, the man asked his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth.|$|E
