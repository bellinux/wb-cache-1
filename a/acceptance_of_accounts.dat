40|$|The new {{cooperative}} law of 1982 is strengthening principles of self-government and independence of cooperatives to considerably higher degree than the former act of 1961. It is particularly visible in regulations concerning cooperative organs. All those, {{with the exception}} of general meeting, of course, are elected and are operating collegiately. Board of cooperative has a particular function assigned. It is directing the operation of cooperative and represets it outside. It is vested with all the competence which has not been assigned to other cooperative organs in the Act or cooperative statute. That wide scope of tasks and competence calls not only for a precise definition of a board role as a collegiate organ but also of a role of its members. Respecting the principle of the collegiate board, {{cooperative law}} is individually treating the legal status of its members. It is manifested in the folkowing legal solutions: — a competent cooperative organ is not electing a board, but its members, specifying at the same time their positions i. e. {{the chairman of the board}} and co-chairmans, — a board cannot be called off as a cooperative organ, it is its particular members who are in a position of being recalled, — the general meeting is voting <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> individually for every member of a board, — a particular board member can be suspended in his activities by a board of supervisors, — board members are personally responsible for their actions and omissions causing damage to a cooperative. The above circumstances which individualize a legal status of board members result in exposition of bonds of collegiality and one man management in the process of managing cooperative activities. It can be particularly visible in large cooperatives, operating in a wide range. It is also observed in instituting a post of a manager of current operation of cooperative in the new cooperative law. Such institution was not provided by previous cooperative acts of 1920 and 1961. The managerial post is usually offered to a board member, usually to a chairman. With that moment he becomes vested with a competence of a sole manager of establishment within a meaning of Labor Code.

40|$|Accounting is {{not only}} a {{technical}} apparatus, but also manifests a societal dimension. This paper proposes that accounting is a protean and complex form of myth making, and as such forms a cohesive tenet in societies. It is argued that there are intrinsic parallels between the theoretical attributes <b>of</b> myth and <b>accounting</b> practice, and that these mythical characteristics sustain the existence and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> and its consequences in societies over time. A theoretical exploration <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> as a form <b>of</b> myth reveals <b>accounting</b> as pluralistic and culturally sensitive. Such an analysis challenges theoretical explanations <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> that are presented as a “grand narrative ” universal understanding <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> Manifestations <b>of</b> the attributes of myth are described in the calculus and artefacts <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> practice to demonstrate how accounting stories and beliefs are used as a form of myth by individuals to inform and construe their world picture...|$|R

Following the announcement, the Accountants General Department (AGD) of Malaysia has been appointed as the agency to head and responsible for the implementation <b>of</b> accrual <b>accounting</b> system in the public sector. The shift from cash basis accounting to accrual accounting represents the fiscal management change in the Malaysian public sector. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} transition process from cash basis accounting to full adoption <b>of</b> accrual <b>accounting</b> was not easy. Countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and United Kingdom took a long period of time to fully adopt the accrual accounting system. The Malaysian government however, has directed the agency to complete the full adoption <b>of</b> accrual <b>accounting</b> system within a period of only 8 years. In order to ensure the implementation success <b>of</b> the accrual <b>accounting</b> system, there is a need to examine the <b>acceptance</b> level <b>of</b> accrual <b>accounting</b> system among the personnel in the public sector. This study examines the <b>acceptance</b> level <b>of</b> accrual <b>accounting</b> system among public sector accounting personnel. Subsequently, this study examines whether the <b>acceptance</b> level <b>of</b> accrual <b>accounting</b> system among the public sector accounting personnel influence their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance. This study found that the public sector accounting personnel are ready for accrual accounting due to the high rate <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> level among them. This study also shows that the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> accrual <b>accounting</b> system among the public sector accounting personnel significantly influences their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance. Further analyses show that employees' motivation has significant influence on job satisfaction and job performance. The results in this study indicates that <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a technology leads to positive attitude among the public sector accounting personnel and this consequently influence their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance.

The Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF) released for public comment on December 18, 2007 with a response period ending on February 10, 2008, "Proposed Changes to Oversight, Structure, and Operations of the FAF, FASB, and GASB" (the proposal). This commentary concerns four important public policy issues in the proposal with the most relevance for accounting standard setting: 1. Reduce {{the size of the}} FASB from seven members to five; 2. Retain the FASB simple majority voting requirement; 3. Realign the FASB composition; and 4. Provide the FASB Chair with decision making authority to set the FASB technical agenda. On February 26, 2008, the FAF accepted all four proposals that we commented on. Despite their approval by the FAF, we maintain that each of these proposals not only does not improve, but potentially weakens the standard setting model. We encourage the FAF to renew its commitment to a member selection model designed to create an independent standard setting board. The four proposals put forth by the FAF can only increase the political nature of the FASB, further concentrate decision making power, and create higher barriers to achieve general <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> standards. We maintain that the FAF should move in the opposite direction. In particular, we recommend that the FAF not reduce the FASB size and adopt a supermajority requirement not a simple voting requirement. If the majority cannot convince other members of the FASB about their views, how can we expect general <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> standards in society? We also want a FASB that is open to more diverse views and more democratic.

40|$|According to doxastic <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> trust, trusting {{a person}} to Φ involves, among other things, holding a belief about the trusted person: either {{the belief that the}} trusted person is {{trustworthy}} or the belief that she actually will Φ. In recent years, several philosophers have argued against doxastic <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> trust. They have claimed that the phenomenology of trust suggests that rather than such a belief, trust involves some kind of non-doxastic mental attitude towards the trusted person, or a non-doxastic disposition to rely upon her. This paper offers a new <b>account</b> <b>of</b> reasons for trust and employs the account to defend a doxastic <b>account</b> <b>of</b> trust. The paper argues that reasons for trust are preemptive reasons for action or belief. Thus the Razian concept of preemptive reasons, which arguably {{plays a key role in}} our understanding of relations of authority, is also central to our understanding of relations of trust. Furthermore, the paper argues that <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a preemptive <b>account</b> <b>of</b> reasons for trust supports the adoption <b>of</b> a doxastic <b>account</b> <b>of</b> trust, for <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> such an <b>account</b> both neutralizes central objections to doxastic <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> trust and provides independent reasons supporting a doxastic account...|$|R

Furthermore, the principles-based approach involves major changes in the expertise held by accountants and, hence, in their educational background, training programs, and in the organizational and business models <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> firms.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> researchers in winning competitive Australian Research Council (ARC) grants, when compared with researchers from the medical, engineering and law professions, during a period of heightened questioning <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> methods, bounded by the end of the dot. com boom in 2001 and the global financial crisis in 2008. Protection and expansion of a profession's core knowledge through effective research is regarded as a hallmark of ongoing professional recognition and success in winning ARC grants is one indicator of the strength of this research. Reasons for the absolute and relative performance <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> researchers in winning ARC grants are explored. Design/methodology/approach – ARC statistics for the 2000 - 2008 period were analysed, along with additional data from the relevant professional associations and the Commonwealth Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. Findings – The results indicate that Australian accounting researchers are performing poorly in absolute and relative terms when compared with their professional peers. Some evidence exists that accounting research cultures seem to flourish in only a handful of universities, and that accounting academics are overloaded with teaching to the detriment of research. Originality/value – The study adds to the growing interest in the value added by accounting research to the accounting profession, the corporate sector and society at large. While the publishing record <b>of</b> Australian <b>accounting</b> researchers appears healthy, when compared with their accounting peers overseas, they perform poorly in winning competitive grants relative to researchers from other professions.

40|$|Double entry {{bookkeeping}} {{is generally}} considered to be a topic that students struggle to learn. In part, this is seen as being due to their lacking awareness of both business processes and of the business environment in which accounting operates, which makes double entry appear an abstract concept and one they find hard to justify the effort of learning. It is also seen by many faculties as failing to encourage critical thinking; and as a purely mechanical process that is unnecessary in a university degree in accounting - that it belongs in the professional office where it can be taught in context in the work environment. This paper argues that there is an alternative justifiable view that, far from being unnecessary and failing to encourage critical thinking, knowledge and understanding of double entry is a key element required of anyone who seeks to fully engage in critical thinking concerning the validity <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> information. It argues that double entry should be retained in the undergraduate accounting curriculum - that its absence from the curriculum encourages blind <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> information as 'truth' and makes it more difficult to encourage accounting students to think critically about accounting information at later stages of their studies. This paper suggests that by adopting an accounting history-based approach, students can be presented with a context that may overcome their traditional failure to grasp the topic well at an early stage in their accounting studies. To support this claim, the paper suggests themes that could be covered when introducing the topic, suggests sources of teaching material, and offers access to historical background material concerning the 'father of accounting', Luca Pacioli, in order to assist faculties that wish to try it for themselves in the classroom.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis examines process of IFRS development, endorsement and enforcement {{from the perspective}} <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> regulation on global scale, identifies nature of IFRS due process in all its phases and compares IFRS due process with accounting regulation in Czech Republic, especially with legislative process <b>of</b> creating Czech <b>accounting</b> legislation. The due process <b>of</b> any <b>accounting</b> rules, whether standards or legislation, determines quality of these rules and consequently also potential level quality of financial statements prepared in accordance with such rules. Process of IFRS development and endorsement is to guarantee quality of standards that are the output of such a process. For global accounting harmonization, which requires transparent, reliable and comparable information in financial reporting across countries of the world, the IFRS due process is essential. The whole process of IFRS development, endorsement and enforcement, which develops IFRS as global accounting standards, also is connected with several obstacles associated to political and social aspects {{as well as to}} cultural differentiation. In the thesis the legal systems, as determinants of the nature <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> regulation, are used for analysis and identification of possible natures <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> regulation from global perspective. For global accounting regulation it is necessary its acceptance by major interested parties, specification of the range of entities for which it is meaningful and desirable, establishment of an independent, reliable and respected international professional organization in the role of standard-setter and development of a sophisticated, transparent and comprehensive standard setting process. Besides the thorough analysis of particular phases of IFRS due process, the thesis also maps current <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> IFRS in the world and describes endorsement process in Europe Union applied for the adoption of IFRS within its area, what provides an integrated view of current evolution in global accounting harmonization. Global accounting regulation, which requires the adoption and application of IFRS in their original range, still faces many obstacles. Less than half countries of G 20 (ie 9 countries) requires the use of IFRS in their original form for listed companies. Problem with such <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> IFRS especially have the countries with tradition based on Roman law (continental European legal culture), where the creation of rules is exclusive subject to state. Quantitative analysis of IFRS due process performed on three selected projects of IASB agenda is a core of application part of the thesis. On the basis on the timeline the analysis follows particular steps of IFRS due process, especially from the perspective of particular comment periods quantified through the comments received, not only in number but also the composition of comments by geographical region and respondent type. The analysis showed the due process as complicated and time-consuming process leading to global consensus of opinions and also showed the importance of compliance of its complexity, which leads to general agreement on adopted solutions and to global <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> these solutions by all of the interested parties. The analysis of IASB due process leads into its comparison with legislative process <b>of</b> creating <b>accounting</b> legislation in Czech Republic. The comparison of both of the processes enables to identify the weaknesses of Czech due process and provides specific recommendations for its improvement and increase efficiency. From the perspective <b>of</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> regulation the delegation <b>of</b> creating <b>accounting</b> rules from the state to the accounting profession is important especially to strengthen the quality, understanding and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> rules, which can be effectively ensured through the due process different from that legislative.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, it aims to defend my {{position}} against charges levelled by Tadeusz Ciecierski, and second, to venture into the possibility of an irrealist position concerning propositional attitudes. Regarding the first aim, I argue that the distinction proposed by Holton, between theories of truth and theories of truth-aptitude remains relevant, and allows for the joint <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> deflationary <b>account</b> <b>of</b> truth and a selective realist approach to truth-aptitude. As for the second aim, I consider several possible motivations for denying that sentences about propositional attitudes cannot be true, which do not rely on any substantial theory of truth. I also argue that even if we reject the strong form of irrealism about propositional attitudes, there is still space left for a moderate version of anti-realism concerning this domain. Such a position does not deny that propositions ascribing propositional attitudes might be described as true or false, but they are still not to be treated in a strongly realist manner. The anti-realistic element of this approach consists either in denying that the propositional attitudes are causally relevant or in claiming that they do not form natural kinds...|$|R

We offer a narrative analysis examining how smartphone photography may (partially) bridge physical distance between managers and engineers, and how sharing images establishes ‘truths’ and provides ‘evidence’. We further explore the challenges engineers face as {{the demand for}} images impacts the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> their verbal <b>accounts.</b> We conclude that smartphone photography prompts the negotiation of new narratives of knowledge sharing, narratives that highlight tensions around the role and status of the digital image. With the increasing availability of smartphones at work, and an emerging interest in the visual in organisational studies, this research offers both practical and theoretical insights...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates false {{rejection}} risk, analysing the {{a priori}} {{relationship between the}} risk of false rejection and the more common risk <b>of</b> false <b>acceptance,</b> <b>of</b> an <b>account</b> balance by a substantive test. The paper uses probability theory to specify {{the relationship between these}} two risks and thus generate a model of posterior audit risk. The paper proceeds to investigate the relationship using the power function of basic statistics. This specifies the relationship between (i) the probability <b>of</b> rejecting the <b>account</b> balance and (ii) the size of the error which the balance contains. We argue that unless there is a discontinuity in the power function around the specified value of material error, then posterior audit risk will be unaffected by the substantive tests undertaken. Posterior risk will then be determined entirely by the assessed inherent and control risks. This conclusion is counter-intuitive to the approach to audit risk adopted by many professional pronouncements and results from the adoption of a mathematically rigorous definition of the risks encountered by the auditor. The primary conclusion is that the discontinuity arises under conditions of careful audit planning. If planning is careful, then false rejection risk contributes very little to posterior risk. In addition, there is very little difference between planned risk and posterior risk...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{variation}} in psychological functioning in adolescents with cystic fibrosis. Explaining this heterogeneity is a major challenge in research. This study explored the role <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> in <b>accounting</b> for psychological functioning. We expected that adolescents who reported more <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> their illness would be less anxious, depressed and disabled. Thirty-six adolescents completed a battery of questionnaires including the Illness Cognition Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Inventory and Functional Disability Inventory. Regression analyses showed that acceptance had a significant and unique contribution in explaining adolescents' anxiety, depression and disability, beyond the contribution of demographic variables and disease severity. Disease severity also had a unique contribution in explaining disability. The {{results of this study}} provide evidence for the important role <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> in psychological functioning in adolescents with cystic fibrosis. This is in line with studies in other chronic conditions such as chronic pain and chronic fatigue syndrome. Results are discussed in the context of acceptance-based therapies that might prove useful in promoting well-being in adolescents with cystic fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Widely {{accepted}} <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> {{human action}} {{strongly suggest that}} actions can only be identified from the first personal perspective, i. e. {{from the point of}} view of the reasons that motivate an agent. That view has important consequences for moral realism, since it seems to entail that values are subjective: constructivist views of value would then be the only viable <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> moral experience that does justice to claims of objectivity. This essay suggests that moral realism can still be maintained, if it understood as the existence of a fitness between potentialities existing in reality and volitional powers of well-functioning human agents. On the basis <b>of</b> the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the first-personal <b>account</b> <b>of</b> reasons for action and of some basic normative intuitions, the essay argues that an agent has to make room for the possibility that the way in which he responds to facts may be inadequate. On the other hand, that is possible – it is argued – if and only if there are correct and incorrect ways of responding to facts, i. e. there are ways in which well-functioning human beings respond to fact...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the influence of individual factors on the <b>acceptance</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> software with the technology <b>acceptance</b> model, consist <b>of</b> perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitude toward using (ATU), behavioral intention to use (BITU), and Actual System Usage (ASU). The sample of this research are 47 employees PT. Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Tbk who work with the accounting software (BDS and WEB). The data will be analyzed by using SmartPLS ver. 2. 0 M 3. The result showed that individual factor have significant positive influence to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use have significant positive influence to perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have significant positive influence to attitude toward using the software. Perceived usefulness doesn’t have influence with behavioral intention to use software. Attitude toward using the software have significant influence to behavioral intention to use. Behavioral intention to use have significant positive influence to actual system usage...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years there has been a {{significant}} increase in the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> International <b>Accounting</b> Standards (IASs) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Many countries are adopting the IASs/IFRSs using various approaches. These various approaches to converge and harmonize include adoption of IASs/IFRSs in its entirety, full adoption of IASs/IFRSs with time lags, selective adoption of IASs/IFRSs and countries developing national standards based on IASs/IFRSs. Given this divergence in adoption of IASs/IFRSs, national standard setters in many countries that are adopting IASs/IFRSs are struggling to impose standards that reflect the perspectives and needs of their respective users. This study seeks to examine issues that affect the adoption and implementation of IASs/IFRSs. Using countries from the South Pacific region, namely Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, this study provides examples of how these countries have adopted IASs/IFRSs. Importantly, this study identifies various factors that should be considered and proposes actions to be taken by relevant stakeholders in countries adopting IASs/IFRSs. In conclusion, we reiterate the misconception that it is not a case of 'flicking a switch' to comply with IASs/IFRSs. We suggest that country specific contextual factors should be considered in adopting IASs/IFRSs. İstanbul Ticaret Üniversites...|$|R
40|$|A central {{feature of}} the modern {{democracy}} is public debate on issues of government; this debate is most effective when it assumes a form of rational inquiry resembling the practices of the natural and historical sciences. History suggests, however, that a deep impetus in human nature is to suppress such debate {{in order to avoid}} offense. I argue that universities, which should be the standard-bearers of rational inquiry, are succumbing to this instinct. The erosion of rational inquiry in universities is caused by the growing tolerance of shoddy scholarship and pseudoscience in certain disciplines, together with widespread uncritical <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> cultural constructivist <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the nature of knowledge. This has contributed to the replacement of evaluation of evidence by forms of ad-hominem argument, to the growing acceptability of advocacy in the classroom, to the politicization of scholarship, and to forms of intellectual tribalism. I illustrate the problem by presenting examples of shoddy scholarship, and by describing recent trends in elementary mathematics and science education. I conclude by suggesting approaches to reform within universities...|$|R
