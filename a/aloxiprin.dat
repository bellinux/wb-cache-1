50|$|<b>Aloxiprin</b> (or {{aluminium}} acetylsalicylate) is {{a medical}} drug used {{for the treatment of}} pain and inflammation associated with muscular skeletal and joint disorders.It is used for its properties as an anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic drug.It is a chemical compound of aluminium hydroxide and aspirin.|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} potency {{and duration}} of action of single doses of aspirin B. P., claradin (a low sodium effervescent preparation of acetylsalicylic acid) and <b>aloxiprin</b> (an aluminium co-polymer of acetylsalicylic acid) on platelet release reaction induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were studied in seventeen volunteers. Aspirin B. P. and claradin at 300 mg and 150 mg inhibited release reaction in all subjects within 24 hr; 75 mg was effective only in some subjects. <b>Aloxiprin</b> gave less marked response and a dose of 300 mg was required to inhibit the effect in all volunteers. Where occurring, inhibition of release reaction persisted for three days after treatment with all preparations and restoration to normal occurred in most subjects by the sixth day...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen men aged 73 - 94 {{showed a}} fall in {{leucocyte}} ascorbic acid levels during five days' treatment with 1 g of tetracycline daily. A control group of nine men aged 74 - 90 showed no fall in leucocyte ascorbic acid levels. Of the control group, three {{were treated with}} phenobarbitone 60 mg thrice daily, three with phenylbutazone 200 mg thrice daily, and three with <b>aloxiprin</b> 1, 200 mg four times a day. A further two men aged 87 and 90 showed increased urinary excretion of ascorbic acid while receiving 1 g of tetracycline daily...|$|E
40|$|A {{randomized}} crossover {{trial of}} micro-encapsulated aspirin {Levius) and <b>aloxiprin</b> {Palaprin Forte) {{was carried out}} on thirty-three hospital out patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Both preparations improved the clinical. status of the patients. The difference {{in response to the}} two preparations was not significant, except for effect on functional status where the micro-encap. sidated aspirin was found to be significantly better at the 5 % level. Apart from six complaints of constipation with <b>aloxiprin</b> compared with only one with Levius, the side-effects were similar. The trial has shown that Levius can be conveniently given in divided doses thrice daily without loss of efficacy. I n t r o d u c t i o n In spite of current advances in therapy, aspirin remains the cornerstone of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. It was hoped that the introduction of benorylate would perhaps have eliminated gastro-intestinal bleeding, but this was not entirely borne out in practice (Croft, Cuddigan & Sweetlord 1972). As the expense of benorylate is considerable, it seemed worthwhile testing the efficacy of a micro-encapsulated formulation of aspirin (LeviusÂ®, Montedison),which hasbeenshown to maintain higher plasma concentrations after an oral dose than the equivalent dose of standard aspirin and thought likely to give more prolonged analgesia (Saggers, Chas-seaud & Cooper 1972). The preparation of the micro-encapsulated particles of aspirin in Levius is intended to improve gastric tolerance and allow for a rapid release of part of the dose followed by a slower diffusion of the remainder. The aluminium compound o...|$|E
