5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing <b>a</b> <b>stampede,</b> opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Storms {{accompanying}} Billie and its remnants brought {{heavy rains}} and strong winds to South Korea, knocking out police telephone lines in Busan. The sudden onslaught of these storms caused <b>a</b> <b>stampede</b> of roughly 70,000people {{out of a}} stadium, resulting in the indirect deaths of 68people, including 51children. Around 125people were injured and 40were hospitalized after the mass evacuation.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike Gold Rush was a {{migration}} by {{an estimated}} 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike {{region of the}} Yukon in north-western Canada between 1896 and 1899. Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year, it triggered <b>a</b> <b>stampede</b> of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in photographs, books, films, and artifacts.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of gold near Barnette's trading post {{caused him to}} turn {{what had been a}} temporary stop into a permanent one. The gold caused <b>a</b> <b>stampede</b> of miners to the area, and buildings sprang up around Barnette's trading post. In November 1903, the area's residents voted to incorporate the city of Fairbanks. Barnette became the city's first mayor, and the city flourished as thousands of people came in search of gold during the Fairbanks Gold Rush.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1960, Dutton {{was named}} {{president}} of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede on a two-year term. He had been <b>a</b> <b>Stampede</b> director for ten-years previous to his appointment. As head of the exhibition, he also spoke for the Stampeders hockey team of the Western Hockey League, and was its chief negotiator. Through his work and community spirit, Dutton {{played a major role}} in helping Calgary and the surrounding area shed its rural image in the 25 years following World War II.|$|E

In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game.

5|$|Near Decatur, Brig. Gen. John W. Sprague, {{in command}} of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division of the XVI Corps, was {{attacked}} by Wheeler's cavalry. Wheeler had taken the Fayetteville Road, while Hardee's column took the Flat Shoals Road toward McPherson's position. The Federals fled the town in <b>a</b> <b>stampede,</b> but managed to save the ordnance and supply trains of the XV, XVI, XVII, and XX corps. With the failure of Hardee's assault, Wheeler was in no position to hold Decatur, and fell back to Atlanta that night. Sprague was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E
5|$|Despite safety measures, {{incidents}} {{may happen}} during the Hajj as pilgrims are trampled or ramps collapse {{under the weight}} of the many visitors. During 2015 Hajj, <b>a</b> <b>stampede</b> resulted in 769 deaths and injuries to 934 others, according to the Saudi authorities. A report from Associated Press totalled at least 1470 fatalities from official reports from other countries, making it the most deadly such episode to date. Concerns were raised in 2013 and 2014 about the spread of MERS because of mass gatherings during the Hajj. Saudi Health Minister Abdullah Al-Rabia said authorities have detected no cases of MERS among the pilgrims so far. He also said that, despite few cases of MERS, Saudi Arabia was ready for the 2014 pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|Gallimimus are {{featured}} in <b>a</b> <b>stampede</b> scene {{where one of}} them is devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E

5|$|Scar sets a trap for {{his brother}} and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of {{wildebeest}} into <b>a</b> <b>stampede</b> that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge and is betrayed by Scar, who sends him falling to his death. Scar convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba {{were killed in the}} stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a large pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.|$|E
5|$|Grant, {{demanding}} {{the truth from}} the Kirbys, learns they are actually a middle-class divorced couple, {{who are looking for}} their son Eric, and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who have been missing on the island for eight weeks. Later, the group finds the parasail with Ben's corpse attached. The group takes the parasail, and then encounter raptor nests. They find an abandoned InGen compound, where Amanda is ambushed by a raptor. The group manages to trap it, but it escapes and contacts the rest of its pack. The group flees into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing <b>a</b> <b>stampede,</b> separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Grant retrieves Billy's satchel, while Udesky is left on the ground barely alive by the raptors, who set a trap in an attempt to lure the others out of the tree they had climbed into. Amanda is nearly killed by the raptors when she tries to descend to help Udesky, and upon the failure of their trap, the raptors kill Udesky before departing.|$|E
5|$|The Whig National Convention {{opened on}} December 4, 1839, {{almost a year}} before the general election. The {{candidates}} did not travel to the convention, and with no telegraph yet in operation, they did not learn of events in Harrisburg until the convention was over. Each state was allocated two delegates for each member of the House of Representatives and Senate it was entitled to send to Washington. There were four absent states from the South, which hurt Clay. The rules of the convention, once passed by the delegates, also hurt Clay, since they provided that the entirety of a state's vote would be cast as a majority of the delegation directed, negating Clay's sizable minorities in Northern states such as New York. That state's delegation was run by its Whig boss, Thurlow Weed, who deemed Clay unelectable as a slaveholder. New York provided much of Scott's vote through the first four ballots, which were deadlocked, with Clay ahead but not close to a majority. Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, a leader of the Harrison forces, had obtained possession of a letter Scott had written expressing sympathy for abolitionists. Stevens intentionally dropped the letter while walking among the pro-Clay Virginia delegation. After reading it, the Virginians announced Harrison was their second choice, setting off <b>a</b> <b>stampede</b> for him, and he became the Whig nominee for president on the fifth ballot.|$|E
