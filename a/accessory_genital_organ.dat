40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether {{the central nervous system}} is involved in the effect of Chinese herbal medicine on sexual function recovery in orchidectomized rats. MethodsOrchidectomized rats were administered intragastrically with a decoction of “kidney-nourishing” Chinese herbal medicine once per day for 28 days. <b>Accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> weight, plasma testosterone, and mating behavior were investigated. The expression of c-Fos and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in neuronal cells in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ResultsThere was a decrease in <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> weight, plasma testosterone, and sexual behavior, as well as a low number of c-Fos-positive cells and a large nNOS-positive cell area in orchidectomized rats. Administration of the herbal medicine increased <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> weight, testosterone level, mating behavior, and c-Fos-positive cell number, while it decreased the nNOS-positive cell area in orchidectomized rats. ConclusionAn increase of plasma testosterone after administration of “kidney-nourishing” herbal medicine might contribute to the elevated sexual function and activity in orchidectomized rats. In addition, a central nervous system mechanism, such as the functional alteration of NAc, might be involved...|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of land planarian from Colombia, Gigantea maupoi sp. nov., is {{described}} herein. The penis papilla of the new species is provided with numerous <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organs,</b> or mgo. These mgo are of a unique morphology, consisting of a very strong barrel-shaped circular muscle coat and an underlying longitudinal one, both derived from the subepithelial musculature of the penis papilla. The central mass of each mgo contains secretions and 8 - 15 canalicula that open to the male atrium on the central region of the organ. Differences in structures constituting the mgo and details of the muscular systems and of the reproductive organs among the 11 Gigantea species from literature and from type material of G. bistriata (Hyman, 1962), G. chiriquii (Hyman, 1962), and G. sandersoni (Prudhoe, 1949) reexamined here show that the genus is heterogeneous...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that a single {{intracutaneous}} injection of autologous or homologous spermia, or testicular suspension incorporated in a water-in-oil emulsion containing killed mycobacteria, induces aspermatogenesis in the guinea pig (1). This process results in the degeneration, necrobiosis, and elimination of most of the germinal cells without injury to the Leydig cells or <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organs,</b> such as the seminal vesicles and the prostate. The purpose of the present paper is to give an account of an effort to purify the antigenic material, and of observations on anaphylactic systemic and cutaneous sensitizations to homologous testicular extracts. Interest in the antigenic properties of animal tissues has never been lacking. Many studies have dealt with the nature of the specificity of cellular antigens-namely, whether they are species-, intraspecies-, or "organ"-specific. These observations led to inquiries as to the specific cytotoxic action of antibodies, to problems in oncology, blood groups, and serological changes which occur in connection with certain infectious diseases (Wassermann reaction, cold agglutinins, etc.) (2) ...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the several}} {{advantages}} over conventional procedures, the laparoscopic disease diagnosis and surgery has now started receiving attention in small ruminants. The normal laparoscopic anatomy {{needs to be}} described for comparison with the findings in animals with various diseases. The objective {{of the present study}} was therefore to describe the laparoscopic anatomy of the caprine pelvic cavity. Adult Bakerwal and Pashmina goats (n= 25) of both the sexes were included in this laparoscopy study. All the animals were restrained in dorsal recumbency and Trendelenburg position under lumbosacral epidural anesthesia and sedation. After creating the pneumoperitoneum, the primary port for 5 mm laparoscope was placed at linea alba (3. 0 cm cranial to mammary glands in does), and at right paramedian (3. 0 cm cranial to the rudimentary teat in the bucks) site. Secondary port was placed under direct laparoscopic observation 5 - 6 cm away from the primary port in horizontal plane, to allow insertion of the grasping forceps. Scan was performed first at the primary port and subsequently through the secondary port for orientation and exploration of the pelvic cavity. The ventral laparoscopic approach provided satisfactory exposure of the pelvic cavity in goats. Comprehensive description of the pelvic organs could be obtained. However, dorsal aspect of the urinary bladder neck and <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> of male animals could not be visualized. Major complications were not encountered during or after laparoscopy. Laparoscopy a minimally invasive procedure has several advantages over alternate methods of understanding anatomy, physiology and pathology of most of the intraperitoneal pelvic structures in goats. The technique has high pedagogic value. The procedure is safe in experienced hands...|$|R
40|$|Background: There are {{multiple}} diagnostic tests and procedures {{are available for}} diagnosis of infertility but semen analysis still is considered as most valuable diagnostic test for investigation of infertility. it is equally important that the semen analysis should be performed by experienced and expert person by proper technique. Biochemical analysis seminal fluid provide valuable information regarding functional status of main and <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organs.</b> the acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase level in seminal fluid is higher than blood but its relation to inferlity is still unidentified and its results are conflicting. so this study is carried out to know any relationship between seminal acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase level to sperm counts. Objective: This study is carried out to know any relationship between seminal acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase level to sperm counts. Materials and Methods: this study was carried out at Department of Pathology of Shree M. P. Shah Medical College, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India during the one and half year period from 1 st april 2004 to 31 st October 2005. 100 cases of male infertility patients were enrolled as study group visiting OPD, G. G. Hospital, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India. Sperm count is done by improved neubauer counting chamber. seminal acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase level is determined by method suggested by kind and king. Results and conclusion: out of 100 patients most of the patient is in 26 - 35 years of age group. there is highest amount of acid phosphatase levels in azoospermic patients while lowest in in patient with highest sperm counts. there is no any significant relationship between alkaline phosphatase level with sperm count while there is inverse relationship between acid phosphatase levels with sperm count.

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of terrestrial flatworms is presently {{based upon a}} combination of external morphological characters, and internal anatomical characters revealed by histological investigation. Uncertainties regarding the functional anatomy of Terricolan organ systems, particularly the copulatory apparatus, have hindered the exploitation of available characters for taxonomy. Considerable revision {{remains to be done}} on taxa world-wide, and provision of character-comparable taxonomic descriptions a priority. The functional histology of selected anatomical systems and their application in taxonomy are reviewed, and include epidermis, subepidermal secretions, musculature and copulatory apparatus. Secretions from the flatworm epithelium comprise at least six types, broadly grouped on the basis of histochemical staining reactions. The secretions are principally concerned with adhesive, locomotory, prey capture, repugnatorial and homeostatic functions in these soil-dwelling animals. Structure and organisation of the body-wall musculature is important in the {{taxonomy of}} the Terricola, especially at the levels of sub-family and genus. Cutaneous musculature is normally tripartite, the uncommon simple bipartite structure probably an apomorphic condition. Characters provided by the gonads and copulatory apparatus are important at the subfamily, genus and especially species level. Criteria are provided fur the recognition of eversible and protrusible types of penis. Ejaculate in Terricola is similar in composition and function to that in mammals. Spermatophores are uncommon. Functions of the atrium include resorption of unwanted sperm and yolk, and cocoon formation. The mechanisms of cocoon formation in the Tenicola differs from that described in the other Triclads. Vitelline cells appear not to participate {{in the development of the}} outer cocoon wall. The outer wall is a laminate, fibrous composite, composed of at least two scleroproteins produced by globules and strand cells in the atrium. <b>Accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> include viscid glands which are involved in cocoon deposition, copulatory bursae which receive sperm and which may also resorb copulatory products, and adenodactyli which in some species are responsible for cocoon wall formation. Seven types of adenodactyli are recognised, and the occurrence of these organs on Australian and New Zealand caenoplanids are listed...|$|R
40|$|This is {{to report}} a {{statistical}} investigation on infertility in the males who were seen to the clinic of the Department of Urology, Osaka Medical College {{during the period of}} past five years, 1956 to 1960. Statistics include frequency, age, duration of childless marriage, past history, occupation and etiology. (1) 3, 205 patients were seen to the c l inic during above period, among whom 127 (4. 0 %) adults were childless. They consist of 87 cases (2. 7 %) of male infertility 24 cases (0. 8 %) of abnormalities in <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> and 16 cases (0. 5 %) of other sexual insufficiencies. (2) Age distribution shows the youngest 24, the oldest 44 and the a verage 32. 4. The fourth dacade occupies 66. 8 % with a peak at age of 31 being followed by gradual decrease in incidence. (3) Duration of marriage the shortest 1 year, the longest 20 years and the average 5. 7 years. 63. 2 % of them complained childless marriage within 5 years with a peak at 3 years and 8 years. (4) Past histories revealed epidemic parotitis in 15 cases, gonorrhea in 10 cases, malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, typhoid fever, dysentery, inguinal hernia, epididymitis, varicocele of the pampiniform plexus, atomic bomb exposure, irradiation to the genitalia, scarlet fever, malnutrition, undescended testicles, diabetes mellitus and syphilis. Among them, infertility was obviously caused by tuberculous epididymitis in 2 cases, gonococcal epididymitis in one case and radiation in 2 cases. As to the other past histories, exact relationship could not be established regarding their infertile condition. No past history was remarkable in 28 cases (32. 2 %). (5) As far as occupation s are concerned, only one occupational infertility was noted in a patient working under a high temperature in certain glass factory. Otherwise, {{there was no significant difference}} between mental job and physical job. (6) Etiology of 87 cases of male infertility consisted of intr i n sic spermatogenic defects in 72 cases (82. 2 %), pathological changes in <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> or semen in 9 cases (10. 3 %), and 6 cases (6. 9 %) of obstruction of the seminal ducts. It should be empha sized that certain conditions of the seminal vesicles were obviously responsible for infertility in 10. 3 % of total cases.

40|$|Autonomic nerves {{supplying}} mammalian male internal <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> have {{an important}} role in the regulation of reproductive function. To find out the relationships between the neurochemical content of these nerves and the reproductive activity, we performed an immunohistochemical study in a species, the water buffalo, exhibiting a seasonal sexual behaviour. The distribution of noradrenergic and peptide-containing nerves was evaluated during the mating (autumn-winter) and non-mating (spring-summer) periods. During the mating period, a dense noradrenergic innervation was observed to supplì the vas deferens as well as the <b>accessory</b> <b>genital</b> glands. Peptide-containing nerves were also observed but with a lower density. During the non-mating period noradrenergic nerves dramatically reduced. These results suggest that there is a neuro-endocrine interaction between androgen hormones and the autonomic nerve supply in the regulation of male water buffalo reproductive functions...|$|R

40|$|Severe {{sex ratio}} {{imbalance}} at birth is now becoming {{an important issue}} in several Asian countries. Its leading immediate cause is prenatal sex-selective abortion following illegal sex identification by ultrasound scanning. In this paper, a fast automatic recognition and location algorithm for fetal <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> is proposed as an effective method to help prevent ultrasound technicians from unethically and illegally identifying {{the sex of the}} fetus. This automatic recognition algorithm can be divided into two stages. In the ‘rough’ stage, a few pixels in the image, which are likely to represent the <b>genital</b> <b>organs,</b> are automatically chosen as points of interest (POIs) according to certain salient characteristics of fetal <b>genital</b> <b>organs.</b> In the ‘fine’ stage, a specifically supervised learning framework, which fuses an effective feature data preprocessing mechanism into the multiple classifier architecture, is applied to every POI. The basic classifiers in the framework are selected from three widely used classifiers: radial basis function network, backpropagation network, and support vector machine. The classification results of all the POIs are then synthesized to determine whether the fetal <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> is present in the image, and to locate the <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> within the positive image. Experiments were designed and carried out based on an image dataset comprising 658 positive images (images with fetal <b>genital</b> <b>organs)</b> and 500 negative images (images without fetal <b>genital</b> <b>organs).</b> The experimental results showed true positive (TP) and true negative (TN) results from 80. 5 % (265 from 329) and 83. 0 % (415 from 500) of samples, respectively.
