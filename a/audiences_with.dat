5|$|Audience tastes {{were fairly}} eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with <b>audiences,</b> <b>with</b> The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) {{becoming}} {{the most successful}} films in their respective years of release, with the trend {{coming to an end}} with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with <b>audiences,</b> <b>with</b> 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for <b>audiences,</b> <b>with</b> Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Times {{estimated}} that nearly 5,000 Speed Racer film-related products were licensed by Warner Bros. The film {{was backed by}} multiple promotional partners with over $80 million in marketing support. The partners include General Mills, McDonald's, Target, Topps, Esurance, Mattel, Lego, and Petrobras. The film also received support from companies outside of America {{in an attempt to}} attract international <b>audiences.</b> <b>With</b> early support before the film's release, the studio provided 3D computer models of the Speed Racer vehicle Mach 5 to the companies so they could accurately render the vehicle in their merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Agharta is a 1975 live double album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. By {{the time}} he {{recorded}} the album, Davis was 48 {{years old and had}} alienated many in the jazz community while attracting younger rock <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> his radical electric fusion music. After experimenting with different line-ups, he established a stable live band in 1973 and toured constantly for the next two years, despite physical pain from worsening health and emotional instability brought on by substance abuse. During a three-week tour of Japan in 1975, the trumpeter performed two concerts at the Festival Hall in Osaka on February 1; the afternoon show produced Agharta and the evening show was released as Pangaea the following year.|$|E

5|$|Bernie Brillstein, Henson's talent agent, {{helped him}} {{move away from}} working solely on {{productions}} for children. When Henson decided to engage Brillstein as his talent agent, Henson was not well known within the industry. Brillstein was an asset to Henson; his clients included Lorne Michaels and three Saturday Night Live cast members, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi. Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into Saturday Night Live {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his characters were only for young <b>audiences.</b> <b>With</b> help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on Saturday Night Live. His new characters were featured in the television program's first season. Henson designed the conceptual framework of The Land of Gorch characters to be eccentric.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{was nervous}} about the film's {{reception}} because silent films were becoming obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined his confidence. Nevertheless, City Lights became one of Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed works. Following the good reception by American <b>audiences,</b> <b>with</b> earnings of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between February and March 1932, starting with a premiere at London's Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $5 million during its initial release.|$|E
5|$|Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the {{coronation}} {{there was a}} banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations {{during a time of}} war. At the beginning of the reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden (where Charles's military headquarters were located) to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> the Prime Minister or military briefings, and she had a special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong-willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war-wounded.|$|E

5|$|Highmore and Ellys, both gentlemen and not actors, {{insisted on}} {{actively}} participating in every day-to-day decisions regarding scheduling, choice of plays, expenses, actors' behaviour. Their management style clashed with Theophilus, when he recovered and returned in February. They denied his play The Harlot's Progress instead putting a play by Ellys. The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance {{from both the}} epidemic in London and other theatres attracting <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> popular operatic performances. Theophilus's play The Mock-Officer failed, which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him. However, his 31 March 1733 The Harlot's Progress, based on William Hogarth's painting of the same name, proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with <b>audiences.</b> <b>With</b> each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{and roll}} {{developed}} out of country, blues, and R Rock's exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated, {{and are the}} subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco. Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly, which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, {{but it was the}} white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> a black style of music, becoming one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.|$|E

5|$|Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first {{announced}} plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In {{the wake of the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.|$|E
5|$|When the Athenians {{received}} this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae {{could no longer}} be defended, then Athenian security {{could no longer be}} guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement. The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose a common peace in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they {{had little choice but to}} accept Philip's terms. On 23 April, the Athenians made swore to the terms of the treaty which is now known as the Peace of Philocrates in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to Amphipolis.|$|E
