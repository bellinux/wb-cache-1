She also raced airplanes competitively during this period and won the 1957 Powder Puff Derby, capturing the first prize pot of $800 (approximately $ in present-day terms). In 1962, she joined Harvey Mudd College and, in association with the Bates Foundation, founded the school's Bates Aeronautics Program. She ran the program with her husband until he retired in 1979, and continued alone until the program ended with her 1990 retirement. She continued teaching classes on aeronautics, however, until 1996. Her students include astronauts George Nelson and Stanley G. Love. She also served as an FAA Pilot Examiner for over two decades and was named the organization's Flight Instructor of the Year for the Ontario district in 1972.|$|E

40|$|Engineering as a {{discipline}} has been taught for centuries. Over the years, <b>a</b> standard engineering <b>curriculum</b> (with many variations) has evolved. However, engineering curriculum development has not followed a structured approach. While accreditation agencies have provided general guidelines, courses were often created and taught by the instructor most interested in the subject area. The result is often <b>a</b> fragmented <b>curriculum</b> in need of more focus and cohesion. Even so, little regard was given to creating a methodology for engineering curriculum development until after World War II. Since that time, several curriculum design methods have been developed. As {{yet there is no}} universal agreement on <b>a</b> methodology for <b>curriculum</b> innovation or renewal, and in fact there is significant variation in opinion as to what constitutes <b>a</b> good <b>curriculum.</b> One reason for this lack of a universal methodology is the large number of constraints involved in developing any particular engineering curriculum (e. g., budget, facilities, identification of employer needs, and available faculty time), and effects of these constraints are almost certain to be different from campus to campus. In this paper, we present a framework for continuous improvement concepts that can be applied to engineering curriculum innovation and renewal. While it is neither possible nor desirable to develop <b>a</b> universal engineering <b>curriculum,</b> <b>a</b> systematic means of assessing and continuously improving <b>an</b> existing <b>curriculum</b> as <b>a</b> whole should be valuable to department chairs and engineering faculty. This methodology has been developed to enhance efforts by a department's faculty, led by its chair, to analyze and understand <b>an</b> existing <b>curriculum,</b> to measure and assess input from a variety of informed sources, and to design <b>an</b> improved <b>curriculum</b> in response to the input received.

5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E

5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> {{that required}} more scientific study than practically any undergraduate {{institution of the}} era.

However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2005 The {{literature}} on teaching <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum</b> provides many theoretical models of teaching practice. These models {{range from the}} belief that thinking should be taught as a separate subject to those demonstrating the belief that thinking skills should be taught {{as an integral part}} of discipline content. Through questionnaires and interviews this research project sought to explore teachers' beliefs and understandings of <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum</b> and teaching practices deemed to be effective in teaching <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum.</b> It also sought to determine what factors teachers believed promoted effective teaching practices. The research literature provides an abundance of thinking curriculum models as frameworks for thinking-oriented approaches. The explosion of resources that provide teachers with tools to aid the implementation of <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum</b> in their classrooms is evidence of an increasing interest in <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum.</b> This interest in the area of teaching thinking is further apparent in the thinking-oriented professional development opportunities devoted to creating a culture of thinking in the classroom, student questioning and student reflection to name a few. It is little wonder that curriculum models abound. What is less evident in the literature is an examination of teachers' beliefs and understandings of <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum.</b> Likewise the literature reviewed by this researcher does not address the factors that promote effective classroom teaching practices in <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum.</b> If, as the literature suggests, <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum</b> enhances and promotes the generic skills required for the new millennium, it is important that educators, including school leaders, are aware of, and understand, the factors that promote these teaching practices. It is anticipated that if these factors can be identified, strategies can be implemented to facilitate effective teaching practices in <b>a</b> thinking <b>curriculum.</b> Data was collected through questionnaires and interviews. Participants included Year 7 and Year 8 teachers, the Principal and Assistant Principal and twenty-five Year 7 and Year 8 students.

5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
