25|$|Food {{irradiation}} is {{the process}} of exposing foodstuffs to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact to the source of the energy (radiation) capable of freeing electrons from their <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> (ionization) in the targeted food. This treatment is used to preserve food, reduce the risk of food borne illness, prevent the spread of invasive pests, and delay or eliminate sprouting or ripening. Irradiated food does not become radioactive. The radiation can be emitted by a radioactive substance or generated electrically.|$|E
500|$|Atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy (AAS) is a destructive technique that {{is able to}} determine the elements {{that make up the}} analyzed sample. [...] AAS performs this analysis by subjecting the sample to an extremely high heat source, breaking the <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> of the substance, leaving free atoms. Radiation in the form of light is then passed through the sample forcing the atoms to jump to a higher energy state. [...] Forensic chemists can test for each element by using a corresponding wavelength of light that forces that element's atoms to a higher energy state during the analysis. [...] For this reason, and due to the destructive nature of this method, AAS is generally used as a confirmatory technique after preliminary tests have indicated the presence of a specific element in the sample. [...] The concentration of the element in the sample is proportional to the amount of light absorbed when compared to a blank sample. [...] AAS is useful in cases of suspected heavy metal poisoning such as with arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium. The concentration of the substance in the sample can indicate whether heavy metals were the cause of death.|$|E

40|$|Different {{modes of}} shear banding in bulk {{metallic}} glass (BMG) matrix composites are identified from the systematic simulation studies {{based on a}} mesoscopic phase-field model for deformation in glassy alloys. We characterize the interaction between shear band and crystalline reinforcements by considering the residual stress and <b>atomic</b> <b>bonding</b> condition at the interface between BMG-matrix and the reinforcement. The simulation demonstrates that compressive residual stress assists to impede the shear bands propagating toward the reinforcements, while tensile residual stress accelerates such process. In addition, the effect of <b>atomic</b> <b>bonding</b> at the interface on shear banding is investigated by the simulation.

500|$|The primary game mode of SpaceChem {{depicts the}} {{internal}} workings of a Reactor, mapped {{out to a}} 10×8 regular grid. [...] Each reactor has up to two input and up to two output quadrants, and supports two waldos, red and blue, manipulated through command icons placed on the grid. [...] The player adds commands from an array to direct each waldo independently through the grid. [...] The commands direct {{the movement of the}} waldo, to pick up, rotate, and drop atoms and molecules, and to trigger reactor events such as chemical bond formation. [...] The two waldos can also be synchronized, forcing one to wait for the other to reach a synchronization command. [...] The reactors may support specific nodes, set by the player, that act where <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> can be made or broken, where atoms can undergo fission or fusion, or where logic decisions based on atom type can be made. As such, the player is challenged to create a visual program to accept the given inputs, disassemble and reassemble them as necessary, and deliver them to the target output areas to match the required product. The product molecule does not need to match orientation or specific layout of the molecules as long as the molecule is topologically equivalent with respect to atoms, bonds, and bond types; however, in larger puzzles, these factors will influence the inputs to downstream reactors. While the two waldos can cross over each other without harm, collision of atoms with one another or with the walls of the reactor is not allowed; such collisions stop the program and force the player to re-evaluate their solution. Similarly, if a waldo delivers the wrong product, the player will need to check their program. The player successfully completes each puzzle by constructing a program capable of repeatedly generating the required output, meeting a certain quota.|$|E
2500|$|Triple bonds {{could not}} be {{accounted}} for by the cubical atom model, because {{there is no way of}} having two cubes share three parallel edges. Lewis suggested that the electron pairs in <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> have a special attraction, which result in a tetrahedral structure, as in the figure below (the new location of the electrons is represented by the dotted circles in the middle of the thick edges). This allows the formation of a single bond by sharing a corner, a double bond by sharing an edge, and a triple bond by sharing a face. It also accounts for the free rotation around single bonds and for the tetrahedral geometry of methane.|$|E
2500|$|Structural {{properties}} of the analyte molecule {{play an important role}} in its retention characteristics. In general, an analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area (C–H, C–C, and generally non-polar <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds,</b> such as S-S and others) is retained longer because it is non-interacting with the water structure. On the other hand, analytes with higher polar surface area (conferred by the presence of polar groups, such as -OH, -NH2, COO− or -NH3+ in their structure) are less retained as they are better integrated into water. Such interactions are subject to steric effects in that very large molecules may have only restricted access to the pores of the stationary phase, where the interactions with surface ligands (alkyl chains) take place. [...] Such surface hindrance typically results in less retention.|$|E

By using molecular dynamics simulation and ab initio calculations, a comprehensive analysis of the results is executed.

50|$|All {{physical}} damage begins on the atomic level, with the shifting or breaking of <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{and the rate}} at which damage to any physical thing occurs is therefore largely dependent on the elasticity of such bonds in the material being subjected to stress. Damage can occur where <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> are not completely broken, but are shifted to create unstable pockets of concentration and diffusion of the material, which are more susceptible to later breakage. The effect of outside forces on a material depends on the relative elasticity or plasticity of the material; if a material tends towards elasticity, then changes to its consistency are reversible, and it can bounce back from potential damage. However, if the material tends towards plasticity, then such changes are permanent, and each such change increases the possibility of a crack or fault appearing in the material.|$|E
