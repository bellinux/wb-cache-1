2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not strictly a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E
5000|$|Its battery was a Planté or pure lead 15 cell. Each cell had a 115 amp hour capacity. The {{traction}} system {{was covered by}} seven patents. It was direct drive from the <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> on to {{the wheel of the}} vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The EC class handled all duties from Christchurch to Lyttelton. They {{were capable}} of {{handling}} 600 LT freight trains and the famous Boat Train, known colloquially as the 'Jackaroo', which regularly loaded up to 400 LT. Early problems with motor flashover and <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> fractures during transition from series to parallel meant that the parallel connections were removed, halving the voltage to the motors and reducing the running speed to 42km/h.|$|E
50|$|In the armature, an {{electromotive}} force {{is created by}} the relative motion of the armature and the field. When the machine acts in the motor mode, this EMF opposes the armature current, and the armature converts electrical power to mechanical power {{in the form of}} torque (unless the machine is stalled), and transfers it to the load via the shaft. When the machine acts in the generator mode, the armature EMF drives the <b>armature</b> current, and <b>shaft</b> mechanical power is converted to electrical power and transferred to the load. In an induction generator, these distinctions are blurred, since the generated power is drawn from the stator, which would normally be considered the field.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{submarine}} designs put {{the diesel}} engine and the electric motor {{on the same}} shaft, which also drove a propeller with clutches between each of them. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine as required. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the boat dived so that the motor {{could be used to}} turn the propeller. The motor could have more than one <b>armature</b> on the <b>shaft</b> — these would be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and parallel for high speed (known as [...] "group down" [...] and [...] "group up" [...] respectively).|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the advent}} of nuclear marine propulsion, most 20th-century {{submarines}} used batteries for running underwater and gasoline (petrol) or diesel engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline, but this quickly gave way to kerosene (paraffin), then diesel, because of reduced flammability. Diesel-electric became the standard means of propulsion. The diesel or gasoline engine and the electric motor, separated by clutches, were initially on the same shaft driving the propeller. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the submarine dived, so that the motor could drive the propeller. The motor could have multiple <b>armatures</b> on the <b>shaft,</b> which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called [...] "group down" [...] and [...] "group up", respectively).|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} shaft with {{bevel gears}} to drive the {{camshaft}} was common in overhead camshaft designs before the Second World War. Examples include the Maudslay 25/30 built between 1908 and 1911, the Bentley 3 Litre, the 850cc MG Midget and various racing motorcycles including the Velocette 'K' series and the Norton Manx. The MG engine used the <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> of the dynamo as the camshaft drive, which was an economical use of parts but made servicing difficult.|$|E
5000|$|Departing New York City {{under tow}} of {{submarine}} tender Ozark (ex-Arkansas) the submersible torpedo boat {{arrived at the}} torpedo station, Newport, Rhode Island, on 28 February 1914. Attached to the Atlantic Submarine Flotilla, G-2 spent the next five months conducting dive training and engineering exercises with [...] in Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay. During these trials the boat made six submerged runs to a maximum depth of 37 ft. Her engines proved troublesome, however, and after the port <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> failed on 31 March, the boat was towed to New York for repairs. While there, financial considerations led to G-2 being put in reserve commission on 15 June 1914.|$|E
5000|$|Table fan: Basic {{elements}} of a typical table fan include the fan blade, base, armature and lead wires, motor, blade guard, motor housing, oscillator gearbox, and oscillator shaft. The oscillator is a mechanism that moves the fan from side to side. The <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> comes out {{on both ends of}} the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator. The oscillator shaft combines to the weighted base and the gearbox. A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety.|$|E

50|$|A {{coil of wire}} {{rotating}} in {{a magnetic}} field produces a current which changes direction with each 180° rotation, an alternating current (AC). However many early uses of electricity required direct current (DC). In the first practical electric generators, called dynamos, the AC was converted into DC with a commutator, a set of rotating switch contacts on the <b>armature</b> <b>shaft.</b> The commutator reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180° rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process. It {{was used by the}} firm of Elkingtons for commercial electroplating.|$|E
50|$|According to some sources, the Woods Dual Power car {{manufactured}} by the Woods Motor Company in Chicago {{also used the}} Entz transmission. That is not true. The Woods Dual Power had a drivetrain based on Roland Fend's U.S. patent #Patent number 1,303,870, not the inventions of Justus Entz. The Entz transmission had no physical connection between the gasoline engine and the driveshaft, while the Woods Dual Power had a clutch between the gas engine and the electric motor, allowing the engine to also drive the car through the <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> of the motor, which itself {{was connected to the}} driveshaft. The Woods car was similar in many ways to today’s hybrids. It used both a gasoline engine and an electric motor to propel the wheels, had regenerative braking to recharge the batteries and in some circumstances the car could charge the batteries while running on gasoline.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To offer {{a complex}} {{diagnostic}} parameter (or system of parameters) {{that would allow}} determining the fault of electric traction motor as well as electromagnetic and mechanical nature. Methodology. Technology transition to maintenance and repair of equipment in accordance with its actual condition are developed rapidly in the world practice in recent years. Control of equipment and forecasting of its technical condition {{with the use of}} non-destructive testing and diagnosis in-place methods is the basis of such technologies. In operation the reliability level of electrical machines including traction electric motor is very difficult to maintain. Analyzing failures of rolling stock, which arise from the operation, we can see that traction electric motors are the least reliable nodes. Diagnostics of traction electric motor at irregularity in speed of anchor rotation is proposed. A measurement device for irregularity in speed of anchor rotation was developed. Findings. An experimental research {{in order to determine the}} irregularity in speed of anchor <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation and coupling of irregularity in speed of anchor rotation with traction electric motors nodes failures was executed. The experimental dependence of the waveform uneven rotation anchor for engines with different technical conditions. Originality. A method for diagnosis of traction electric motors at irregularity in speed of anchor <b>armature</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation was first proposed. This method after further improvement can be used at bench test of engines in their work without load and for the quality of the repair. Practical value. The device for detecting defects of the traction electric motor nodes as well as electromagnetic and mechanical nature without engine disassembly may be used for control of engine assembly after repair, and at testing of traction electric motor without load...|$|E
