500|$|During pre-production, {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that several actresses including Genelia D'Souza, Priyanka Chopra and Kareena Kapoor were {{being considered for}} the role of Kaali Gawde. However, Chopra was approached over the others, who agreed to do the film instantly. While initial reports suggested that Chopra would be playing the role of a sex worker in the film, they were later denied as rumours. In an interview with Rediff.com, she clarified that she was playing a prostitute's daughter. On Chopra's character, Malhotra commented, [...] "Despite being a male dominated film, the part played by Priyanka is very prominent. It isn't that of a simple or ordinary lover. She is there for Vijay unconditionally and without any expectations. With all the dangerous people around her, she is like this pretty flower standing there with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face." [...] In preparation for her role, Chopra wanted to visit a brothel, but Malhotra insisted that she doesn't for safety reasons.|$|E
500|$|After their plane crashes in the woods, Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) desperately {{fight to}} stay alive. Meredith is {{relatively}} unscathed, {{while the rest}} have serious injuries: the pilot, Jerry (James LeGros), has a major spine injury, and Yang dislocates her arm. Robbins' femur is broken and sticking through the skin, Sloan has serious internal injuries; though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is sucked out {{the side of the}} plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize that they cannot save her, so Sloan holds her hand while she dies, telling her that he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together, Lexie dies with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face just as Meredith and Yang are approaching.|$|E
2500|$|In this play, {{there are}} very few {{dialogue}} passages that are written without script directions (written in italics inside parentheses before the actual printed dialogue). Although it is common practice for playwrights to supply some interpretation of how the dialogue should be delivered, Albee supplies these directions quite liberally and quite specifically. For instance, in the opening scene, he directs Agnes’s first lines with these directions: “ (Speaks usually softly, with a tiny hint of <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face: not sardonic, not sad [...] [...] [...] wistful, maybe).” In a later line for Tobias, Albee directs the actor to deliver it in this way: (Very nice, but there is steel underneath). For one of Claire’s lines, Albee suggests that the actor speak, “ (to Agnes’ back, a rehearsed speech, gone through but hated)”.|$|E

2500|$|Vanessa is {{described}} by the BBC as [...] "scheming", [...] "conniving and calculated". Ash called the role a [...] "meaty, hard part", explaining of her character: [...] "She's not had to work {{her way to the}} top and people resent her for it. She's used her toughness all the way." [...] As part of the character's costume, she wears black, thick-rimmed glasses. Due to Ash's disability, Vanessa uses a walking stick. Ash commented: [...] "Disability is misrepresented on television and it's really fantastic that it did not worry the production team I was disabled." [...] Of Vanessa's backstory, Ash explained: [...] "She rose through the ranks from a nurse to become a CEO rather easily and we can only imagine that she’s done it by stepping over people along the way. But with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face." [...] With regards to Vanessa's nursing background and the difference it made to her position, Ash explained: [...] "They’re all so used to CEOs being very bureaucratic. I think it’s quite a shock to find someone who knows the medical side of things. They can’t get away with things, because she understands what’s going on." ...|$|E
