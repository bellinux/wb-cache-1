Walter played Test cricket for Australia despite below average performances for South Australia and when George was named Captain of the 1894 tour Walter having made 11 runs in his three Tests to date and a poor domestic season was also named, many believing because of George's influence over the selection.

Stifft Station Historic District is a credit to its humble but handsome housing stock, reasonable real estate prices, minimal intrusive or unsightly infill and, significantly, its residents willingness to acknowledge the importance of an active neighborhood association.|$|E

In the hindwing, the tornal ocellus much as on the upperside; an obscure ill-defined highly arched postdiscal narrow whitish band from above the tornal ocellus to the costa, ends near apex of interspace 7 in a broad white lunule; beyond this a double subterminal row of somewhat straight ochreous-white lunules in the interspaces, each lunule of the inner row bordered outwardly with blue, this bordering very faint in many specimens.

500|$|Small {{was born}} in Princes Town, Trinidad, in 1892. He first played cricket for a club in Trinidad called Stingo, which {{included}} players from the lowest social class. Cricket in Trinidad {{at the time was}} divided along racial lines. For cricket clubs on the island, the colour of a player's skin was crucial. Stingo was described by writer and historian C. L. R. James: [...] "They were plebeians: the butcher, the tailor, the candlestick maker, the casual labourer, with <b>a</b> <b>sprinkling</b> <b>of</b> unemployed. Totally black and of no social status whatever." [...] James described Small as a genial presence on the cricket field: [...] "Small talked to everybody and everybody talked to him: Joe radiated good nature and self-satisfaction." [...] Outside of his cricket career, Small worked for the Stores Department of Trinidad Leaseholds oil company.|$|E
500|$|The show's {{producers}} and writers {{decided to build}} the new show around a brownstone on an inner-city street, a choice writer Michael Davis called [...] "unprecedented". They reproduced their viewers' neighborhoods—as writer Cary O'Dell described it, [...] "a realistic city street, complete with peeling paint, alleys, front stoops, and metal trash cans along the sidewalk". [...] Director Jon Stone was convinced {{that in order for}} inner-city children to relate to Sesame Street, the show had to be set in a familiar place. Despite its urban setting, the producers depicted the world in a positive way—both realistically and as it could be. [...] They attempted to present [...] "an idealized world of learning and play", and from a child's perspective. Director Jim Martin called Sesame Street [...] "an urban show kids could relate to" [...] and [...] "a reality show with <b>a</b> <b>sprinkling</b> <b>of</b> fantasy".|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack was {{released}} under the label EMI Records. [...] "Yen Iniya Pon Nilavae" [...] {{was written in}} January 1980.

Ilaiyaraaja had composed the song [...] "Ilaya Nila" [...] which was initially supposed to feature in this film, but Mahendra rejected it and chose [...] "Yen Iniya Pon Nilavae" [...] instead. [...] "Ilaya Nila" [...] was subsequently used in Payanangal Mudivathillai (1982). According to A. S. Panneerselvan of Frontline, the dominant genre of the music used in Moodu Pani was [...] "modern jazz with <b>a</b> <b>sprinkling</b> <b>of</b> avant-garde elements." [...] Gangai Amaran was the main lyricist of the soundtrack, except for the English-language number [...] "Sing Swing" [...] (also known as [...] "Swing Swing") which was written by Viji Manuel (credited as Vijaysamuel on the first soundtrack edition, and Vijaymanuel on the second); the lyricist of [...] "Aasai Raja", is not credited.

[...] Robbie Daw of Idolator gave the song a positive review, while complimented Minaj's dual rapping and singing, {{as well as the}} use of the sample. Backy Bain also of Idolator additionally gave the song a positive review stating [...] "We were a bit worried that Harujuku Barbie would forever be the garnish on other people’s tracks instead of the main dish, but this sweet song proves otherwise." [...] Mariel Concepcion of Billboard commented on Minaj toning it down stating, [...] "the Young Money rap princess puts the sleazy talk aside and finds herself smitten with a young man... Minaj proves that even the wildest ones can be tamed." [...] While reviewing the music video, Brad Wete also of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the song positively, stating that Minaj was [...] " [...] slicing the competition to pieces with her second try." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic deemed the song an album highlight, additionally adding that the song, [...] "waltzes out of the speakers.

500|$|Stephanie Zacharek, {{writing for}} Salon.com, liked the reinvention {{of the plot}} and the style and {{execution}} of the action sequences, specifically those involving the trio of Mini Coopers, which she wrote were {{the stars of the}} film. BBC reviewer Stella Papamichael gave The Italian Job 4 stars out of 5, and wrote that the [...] "revenge plot adds wallop lacking in the original". Los Angeles Times reviewer Kevin Thomas praised the opening Venice heist sequence and the characterization of each of the thieves, but felt that the Los Angeles heist sequence was [...] "arguably stretched out a little too long". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, writing that the film was [...] "two hours of mindless escapism on a relatively skilled professional level." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concurred, describing The Italian Job as pure but smart entertainment [...] "plotted and executed with invention and humor". Reviewer James Berardinelli also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and said that Gray had discovered the right recipe to do a heist movie: [...] "keep things moving, develop a nice rapport between the leads, toss in the occasional surprise, and top with <b>a</b> <b>sprinkling</b> <b>of</b> panache." [...] Varietys Robert Koehler compared The Italian Job to The Score (2001), another [...] "finely tuned heist pic" [...] which also featured Edward Norton in a similar role.|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review published in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as [...] "party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies". Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, raved that [...] "One {{of the great}} satisfactions of Spectre is that, {{in addition to all}} the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone's personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person." [...] Stephen Whitty from The New York Daily News, who awarded the film four of five stars, stated that [...] "Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn't leave a huge impression as this film's 'Bond girl', perhaps it's because we've already met—far too briefly—the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real 'Bond woman' since Diana Rigg." [...] Chicago Sun-Times film reviewer Richard Roeper, who gave the film three stars out of four, considered the film [...] "solidly {{in the middle of the}} all-time rankings, which means it's still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, <b>a</b> <b>sprinkling</b> <b>of</b> dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way." [...] Michael Phillips, reviewing for the Chicago Tribune, stated, [...] "For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, Spectre works best when everyone's on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes." [...] Variety film critic Guy Lodge complained in his review that [...] "What's missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of Skyfall, as the film sustains its predecessor's nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent." ...|$|E
