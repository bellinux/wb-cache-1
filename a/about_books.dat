25|$|Shelfari was {{a social}} {{cataloging}} website for books. Shelfari users built virtual bookshelves of the titles which they owned or had read and they could rate, review, tag and discuss their books. Users could also create groups that other members could join, create discussions and talk <b>about</b> <b>books,</b> or other topics. Recommendations could be sent to friends on the site for what books to read. Amazon bought the company in August 2008. Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016, when Amazon {{announced that it would}} be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari.|$|E

25|$|Montag, meanwhile, {{concedes that}} Mildred is {{a lost cause}} and he will need help to {{understand}} the books. Montag remembers an old man named Faber he once met in a park a year ago, an English professor before books were banned. He telephones Faber with questions <b>about</b> <b>books,</b> and Faber soon hangs up on him. Undeterred, Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of the Bible, the book he stole at the woman's house. He tries to read it on the way, but gets distracted by a radio jingle for Denham's Dentifrice and nearly goes insane. Once he arrives at Faber's house, Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer constant guidance.|$|E

500|$|In Ireland Heseltine {{combined}} {{studies of}} early {{music with a}} fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates {{that at this time}} he was [...] "tamper ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused <b>about</b> <b>books</b> [...] "full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of Béla Bartók.|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday People, [...] "though {{critics said}} it was an affectionate tribute about a nice man. Van went on to urge fans not to buy it." [...] According to The Boston Globe, Van Morrison [...] "disdained the book". In an {{interview}} with The Boston Globe, Turner commented on this: [...] "He considers anything that reveals details of family background or anything like that an invasion of his privacy. He doesn't believe in biographies, and I do." [...] When the biography came out in hardcover, Van Morrison sent Turner 36 statements from the book that he called [...] "lies, gross exaggerations and innuendo". Van Morrison told Turner that none of the 40 individuals the author had interviewed for the biography were currently friends of his. The letter from Van Morrison to Turner concluded with: [...] "I am very sorry that you feel you are entitled to earn a living by peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally." [...] In his reply letter to Van Morrison, Turner wrote: [...] "You may not think you are 'difficult' or 'introvert' but other people do and have the right to express their opinions." [...] The Sunday Times reported that [...] "Allegedly, Van's management even considered buying up all 25,000 copies of the book to pulp them," [...] and this was also reported in The Independent. The Evening Times wrote that Van Morrison [...] "reportedly tried to buy all the copies of a biography by Steve Turner." [...] Representatives for Van Morrison did not confirm whether he attempted to purchase the 25,000 copies of the biography, and confirmed that [...] "representatives of the singer discussed various possibilities". Van Morrison's manager, Chris O'Donnell, said of the musician: [...] "He is not happy <b>about</b> <b>books,</b> period. He is an artist and stands up for himself – he doesn't want his private life raked over." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fan {{fiction has}} become more popular and {{widespread}} {{since the advent of}} the World Wide Web; according to one estimate, fan fiction comprises one third of all content <b>about</b> <b>books</b> on the Web. In addition to traditional fanzines and conventions, Usenet group electronic mailing lists were established for fan fiction as well as fan discussion. Online, searchable fan fiction archives were also established. The online archives were initially non-commercial hand-tended and fandom- or topic-specific. These archives were followed by non-commercial automated databases. In 1998, the not-for-profit site FanFiction.Net came online, which allowed anyone to upload content in any fandom. The ability to self-publish fan fiction at an easily [...] accessible common archive that did not require insider knowledge to join, and the ability to review the stories directly on the site, became popular quite quickly.|$|E

2500|$|While Montag and Mildred are perusing {{the stolen}} books, a {{sniffing}} occurs at their front door. Montag recognizes it as The Hound while Mildred passes {{it off as}} a random dog. They resume their discussion once the sound ceases, but Mildred refuses {{to go along with}} it, questioning why she or anyone else should care <b>about</b> <b>books.</b> Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He then states that maybe the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the [...] "parlor walls" [...] (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, Big Frame began {{investigating}} {{the demographics of}} channels that {{are now part of}} Wonderly in an attempt to bring together creators and community. In an interview, Big Frame talent manager and Wonderly head Rachel Skidmore said: [...] "... We saw, for example Squaresville and Life According to Jimmy—we saw that their audiences were kind of similar and it was this really amazing group of teen to early twenties girls that were rabid fans. We realized that it wasn’t necessarily the content that was bringing them together but their obsession, in the coolest way. These were girls that, even though they were subscribed to both channels, were also posting <b>about</b> <b>books</b> on Tumblr or they had their own channels; they were just super fans. So we thought “How do we have a place where these creators can come together and sort of geek out together?” We started digging in and after many brainstorming sessions and hours of work and lots of pizza, Wonderly came to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{if we use}} {{very large}} blocks, then the {{estimate}} of per-character entropy rate may become artificially low. This is because in reality, the probability distribution of the sequence is not knowable exactly; it is only an estimate. For example, suppose one considers the text of every book ever published as a sequence, with each symbol being the text of a complete book. If there are [...] published books, and each book is only published once, the estimate of the probability of each book is , and the entropy (in bits) is [...] As a practical code, this corresponds to assigning each book a unique identifier and using it {{in place of the}} text of the book whenever one wants to refer to the book. This is enormously useful for talking <b>about</b> <b>books,</b> but it is not so useful for characterizing the information content of an individual book, or of language in general: {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct the book from its identifier without knowing the probability distribution, that is, the complete text of all the books. The key idea is that the complexity of the probabilistic model must be considered. Kolmogorov complexity is a theoretical generalization of this idea that allows the consideration of the information content of a sequence independent of any particular probability model; it considers the shortest program for a universal computer that outputs the sequence. A code that achieves the entropy rate of a sequence for a given model, plus the codebook (i.e. the probabilistic model), is one such program, but it may not be the shortest.|$|E
