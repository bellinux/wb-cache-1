5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated <b>aliphatic</b> <b>alcohol</b> that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Selective {{oxidation}} of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> under {{mild and}} base-free conditions is a challenging process for organic synthesis. Herein, we report a one-pot {{process for the}} direct oxidative esterification of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> that is significantly enhanced by visible-light irradiation at ambient temperatures. The new methodology uses heterogenerous photocatalysts of gold–palladium alloy nanoparticles on a phosphate-modified hydrotalcite support and molecular oxygen as a benign oxidant. The alloy photocatalysts can absorb incident light, and the light-excited metal electrons {{on the surface of}} metal nanoparticles can activate the adsorbed reactant molecules. Tuning the light intensity and wavelength of the irradiation can remarkably change the reaction activity. Shorter wavelength light (< 550 nm) drives the reaction more efficiently than light of longer wavelength (e. g., 620 nm), especially at low temperatures. The phosphate-exchanged hydrotalcite support provides sufficient basicity (and buffer) for the catalytic reactions; thus, the addition of base is not required. The photocatalysts are efficient and readily recyclable.
