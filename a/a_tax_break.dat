5|$|With the Canary Islands' {{power grid}} {{substantially}} disrupted, the Unelco-Endesa power company {{was forced to}} use temporary generators to boost power at sub-stations far from the main grid. In La Corujera in Santa Úrsula, these generators were poorly received and over 1,000local residents claimed {{to be affected by}} the noise and pollution. Children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely. Roughly €25million (US$37.25million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds. Of this total, €22.5million (US$33.5million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; €1.5million (US$2.2million) was used for agricultural relief; and €1million (US$1.5million) was used in home repairs. Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. <b>A</b> <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta.|$|E
5|$|New York {{was unable}} to build on their 1970 success. Tarkenton left the team's 1971 {{training}} camp in a salary dispute, before coming back {{a few days later}} after signing a one-year contract. In place of a salary increase, Tarkenton had asked for a large loan to get <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>break,</b> but the Maras turned it down, and made sure the press knew the raise and loan were denied. Johnson missed most of the season with a knee injury, and the Giants dropped to 4–10. Before the 1972 season they traded Tarkenton, who frequently feuded with Webster, back to the Vikings. Initially the trade produced positive results, as New York rallied to finish 8–6 in 1972. The 1972 team was led by veteran journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton), who led the league in passing and had the best season of his career. They set a still-standing team record on November 26 when they scored 62 points via eight touchdowns and two field goals. After the 1972 season however, the Giants suffered one of the worst prolonged stretches in their history. Meanwhile, Tarkenton would lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and establish a Hall of Fame resume.|$|E

40|$|A CGE {{model of}} South Africa {{is used to}} find the {{potential}} for a double or triple dividend if the revenues raised from <b>an</b> energy-related environmental <b>tax</b> are recycled to households and industry through lowering existing taxes. Four environmental taxes and three revenue-recycling schemes are compared. The environmental <b>taxes</b> are (i) <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on greenhouse gas emissions, (ii) <b>a</b> fuel <b>tax,</b> (iii) <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on electricity use, and (iv) <b>an</b> energy <b>tax.</b> The four taxes are constructed such that they have a comparable effect on emissions. The revenue is recycled through either (i) <b>a</b> direct <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> on both labour and capital, (ii) <b>an</b> indirect <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> to all households, or (iii) a reduction in the price of food. A triple dividend is found � decreasing emissions, increasing GDP, and decreasing poverty � when any one of the environmental taxes is recycled through a reduction in food prices.

25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and {{its impact}} on the {{alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>break,</b> restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code.

25|$|In {{built up}} {{cities around the}} world, urban {{planning}} uses cycling infrastructure like bikeways to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. A number of cities {{around the world have}} implemented schemes known as bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs. The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in Amsterdam in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in La Rochelle and green bicycles in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing.
