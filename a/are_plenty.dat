5|$|And, {{at the end}} of the day, that's {{one thing}} we can't get past—serious BlackBerry enthusiasts will tell you that the {{interface}} is doing just fine, and there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of {{opportunities}} in the county for hiking, observing wildlife and admiring the scenery. These include Brechfa Forest, the Pembrey Country Park, the Millennium Coastal Park at Llanelli, the WWT Llanelli Wetlands Centre and the Carmel National Nature Reserve. There are large stretches of golden sands and the Wales Coast Path now provides a continuous walking route around the whole of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{writing was}} retraced by a later scribe (usually dated to the 10th or 11th century), {{and the beauty}} of the original script was spoiled. Accents and breathing marks, as well as punctuation, have been added by a later hand. There are no enlarged initials, no divisions into chapters or sections such as are found in later manuscripts, but a different system of division peculiar to this manuscript. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of the itacistic faults, especially the exchange of ει for ι and αι for ε. The exchange of ει and ο for ω is less frequent.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there <b>are</b> <b>plenty,</b> by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E

25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of maceiós {{and lakes}} {{in this part}} of Brazil; because of this, the city was named Maceió, and the State, Alagoas.

25|$|I {{think that}} Gould's {{separate}} compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious {{people to the}} science camp. But it's a very empty idea. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of places where religion does not keep off the scientific turf.

25|$|Health {{officials}} say there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of problems in China's approach to AIDS. There are frequent reports of police crack-downs on local NGOs involved in AIDS prevention. There have also been reports of police using {{the presence of a}} condom in a sex worker's handbag to justify detention. This has been partially blamed on policy incoordination, and contradictions and conflicts between laws and regulations.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that they were most likely facing two perpetrators, who had meticulously planned the murders in advance, due to the difficulties a single perpetrator would face in controlling both girls.

The odds were good that a lone assailant would fail.|$|E

25|$|In the UK {{there are}} {{a high level of}} Japanese imports used within the {{drifting}} scene, {{due in part to the}} UK sharing a right-hand drive layout with Japan. However, these cars often cost more than UK-market cars, partly due to import costs. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of UK and European models used as drift cars as well, older BMW's are particularly prominent due to cost and availability, with Volvo 300 series and Ford Sierras also proving popular.|$|E

Most college facilities have summer camps or youth tournaments that would conflict with LCBL games. One potential solution is {{the creation of a new}} baseball-only four-field complex in St. Louis, though no plans are currently in the works.|$|E
