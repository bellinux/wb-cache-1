5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
500|$|As seen on closed-circuit {{television}} cameras, the pair departed the services on foot <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> down the central reservation of the M6 motorway before attempting {{to cross the}} motorway, causing chaos to the traffic and picking up minor injuries in the attempt. Their elder brother claimed in a Swedish newspaper that his sisters were fleeing from maniacs who were chasing them. Highways Agency Traffic Officers responded to the incident, and Police Officers were called to assist. Along with the police came a small television crew {{who happened to be}} filming Motorway Cops with one of the officers. Sabina later told an officer at the police station, [...] "We say in Sweden that an accident rarely comes alone. Usually at least one more follows – maybe two." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dallas {{was then}} penalized with a {{controversial}} foul call that sent Wade {{to the line}} to shoot the go-ahead free throws with 1.9 seconds left on the overtime game clock. Wade hit the first free throw, and Dallas Mavericks coach Avery Johnson signaled to his team to call a timeout after Wade's second attempt. [...] Josh Howard then made a timeout gesture with his hands <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> off the floor, and the referees called the Mavericks' last remaining timeout, which prevented them from advancing the ball after the second attempt if Wade converted. [...] After the timeout, Wade made the second free throw to give his team a one-point lead, after which Devin Harris missed a Hail Mary half-court shot as time expired. [...] Wade finished the game with 43 points while setting an NBA Finals record for most made free throws in a game with 21. Shaquille O'Neal added a double-double with 18 points and 12 rebounds. [...] Miami converted 32 of its 49 attempts from the free throw line.|$|E
60|$|This for B. B. is {{the last}} straw. He {{completely}} loses his temper <b>and</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> excitedly about.|$|R
60|$|FRANKLYN [leaving {{his table}} <b>and</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up <b>and</b> down the room discontentedly] Savvy's manners jar on me. They would have horrified her grandmother.|$|R
60|$|Before {{we could}} answer, Mr. Morgan hammers {{on the floor}} with his cane <b>and</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up <b>and</b> down, {{swearing}} in a loud tone of voice.|$|R
60|$|Albert turned <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> along slowly, by Mary Erskine's side.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sumner {{jumped to}} his feet, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up and down nervously.|$|E
60|$|Kirk got up <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> quickly up and down. Steve {{watched him}} furtively.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not know!" [...] exclaimed Lingard, {{taking up}} the child again, <b>and</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up <b>and</b> down the verandah. [...] "I have my plans. I have--listen." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{criminals in}} {{question}} have escaped {{from a local}} high-security prison by tunneling out. Criminals emerge from the ground somewhere on the current level <b>and</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is so, sir," [...] said Butler, {{turning off}} <b>and</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> forward, [...] "but {{it was my}} misfortune at one time to see it prove greatly too weak." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{taking no}} more heed of the conquered knight, Wulf turned <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> towards his horse.|$|E
60|$|He {{got up and}} {{gathered}} his coat-tails under his arms, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{up and down the}} cabin.|$|E
60|$|Hugh stood {{a moment}} on the river's bank, staring at the stream beneath; then he turned <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> slowly toward the dead swan.|$|E
6000|$|... "So far as one {{can judge}} from the system in practice," [...] said Ann Veronica, {{speaking}} in a loud, common-sense, detached tone, <b>and</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> slowly but resolutely toward the lawn, [...] "it doesn't work." ...|$|R
6000|$|LUBIN [rising <b>and</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up <b>and</b> {{down the}} room with his {{considering}} cap on] I admit that I am impressed, gentlemen. I will {{go so far as}} to say that your theory is likely to prove more interesting than ever Welsh Disestablishment was. But as a practical politician--hm! Eh, Burge? ...|$|R
50|$|The next morning, Mari is seen {{standing}} near a wall. The entire wall is scribbled with names. She {{is the human}} survivor of the Apocalypso <b>and</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> through the empty streets. She assumes that the gods are the only other survivors, as she passes a gigantic statue of the Hindu monkey-god Hanuman.|$|R
60|$|He stooped over her, and her raised arms {{fell upon}} his shoulders. He lifted her up, steadied himself <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> looking {{straight}} before him.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt she}} must get away or {{there would be}} hysterics somewhere. She sprang up <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> rapidly towards the gate. He {{followed}} her.|$|E
60|$|Uncertainty in {{such cases}} is the unnerving thing. I turned sharply, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back on tiptoe in the {{direction}} from which I had come.|$|E
500|$|Clarence Leiter was {{an agent}} for Station S, while being a {{combination}} of Felix Leiter and René Mathis. The name [...] "Mathis", and his association with the Deuxième Bureau, {{was given to the}} leading lady, who is named Valérie Mathis, instead of Vesper Lynd. Reports that {{towards the end of the}} broadcast [...] "the coast-to-coast audience saw Peter Lorre, the actor playing Le Chiffre, get up off the floor after his 'death' <b>and</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> his dressing room", do not appear to be accurate.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, she recovers {{her mind}} <b>and</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> again, <b>and</b> she plans {{her return to}} the world of show {{business}} under the name of Chaquira (not {{to be confused with the}} real life singer Shakira). She uses that name so not to tip off her enemies as to who she really is and that she's still alive.|$|R
50|$|After Izzy attacks one of {{the nuns}} on the bus for {{seemingly}} no reason, she's kicked off <b>and</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back along the road. She runs into the two boys, and lures the friend out of the car. She kills him, and the other boy quickly discovers the scene. Izzy chases him across a field and tackles him.|$|R
60|$|He {{hurried to}} her side, and forced some more brandy between her lips. Then he laid her {{flat on the}} floor, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up and down.|$|E
60|$|She went out. Scott bade good night, and {{followed}} her. The four people {{remained in the}} room, quite silent. Then Robert rose <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> about, agitated.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were both}} silent for some time, {{and at last}} Roderick gave a heavy sigh <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away. [...] "Where are you going?" [...] Rowland then asked.|$|E
50|$|The main protagonist, Elijah is {{introduced}} {{on the run}} from Propater. He encounters some mercenaries also eluding Propater and is forced to join them.

6000|$|... "Nonsense, Mary," [...] said Katharine, rather distractedly, {{taking her}} arm <b>and</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{up the street}} in the {{direction}} of the main road. [...] "Let me see; we went to Kew, and we agreed to be friends. Yes, that's what happened." [...] Mary was silent, in the hope that Katharine would tell her more. But Katharine said nothing.|$|R
50|$|The reunited {{couple is}} confronted by Lincoln, who dies getting shot by Sir Wilfred and falls in a vat of boiling wax. Sir Wilfred is decapitated by a {{werewolf}} as Sarah and Mark manage {{to escape the}} burning waxwork with their lives <b>and</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> home, not noticing that the hand from the zombie display is scuttling away from the rubble.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Tim Rokens {{turned on his}} heel, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{up and down the}} deck as calmly as if nothing {{whatever}} had occurred to disturb his equanimity.|$|E
60|$|Jonas {{then went}} to Mr. Woodman, and transacted his {{business}} successfully, according to the farmer's directions. Then he turned around, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back, {{as fast as he}} could go.|$|E
60|$|I got up <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up {{and down}} the room, while she watched me with a silent calm which was incomprehensible. In vain I summoned my faculties to meet it.|$|E
60|$|He {{scraped the}} last spoonful {{out of the}} iron pot, <b>and</b> they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back <b>to</b> the house.|$|R
60|$|As he did {{not leave}} her, however, she had to wipe her eyes, and to raise them {{to the level of}} the factory {{chimneys}} on the other bank. She saw also the arches of Waterloo Bridge and the carts moving across them, like the line of animals in a shooting gallery. They were seen blankly, but to see anything was of course to end her weeping <b>and</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was curious}} {{to see how this}} {{faithful}} beast accustomed itself to the darkness, and made its other senses, especially that of smell, serve the purpose of eyes as do the blind. By degrees, too, it learned all the details of the operations; thus, when the cartridge was in place for firing, it would rise <b>and</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of the tunnel even before the men in charge.|$|R
