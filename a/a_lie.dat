5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable inner product. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> group can be given naturally the structure of <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra {{and can be used}} to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E

50|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of Lie theory, {{there are two}} definitions of <b>a</b> compact <b>Lie</b> algebra. Extrinsically and topologically, <b>a</b> compact <b>Lie</b> algebra is the <b>Lie</b> algebra of <b>a</b> compact <b>Lie</b> group; this definition includes tori. Intrinsically and algebraically, <b>a</b> compact <b>Lie</b> algebra is <b>a</b> real <b>Lie</b> algebra whose Killing form is negative definite; this definition is more restrictive and excludes tori,. <b>A</b> compact <b>Lie</b> algebra {{can be seen as}} the smallest real form of <b>a</b> corresponding complex <b>Lie</b> algebra, namely the complexification.|$|R

5|$|The Lorentz {{group is}} <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> group and has as such <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra, The Lie algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be}} said to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E

5|$|Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages is a 1996 {{science fiction}} {{adventure}} game developed by Epic Multimedia Group {{and published by}} Inscape. The game propounds the conspiracy theory that all of human history is <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> and that the human race's development and evolution were aided by extraterrestrials. The player attempts to uncover the truth {{through the course of}} the game by traveling to a variety of different worlds, interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and can choose to press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E

Colleen takes an {{immediate}} dislike to Jack's fiancée, Phoebe, but takes a liking to Liz, whom she originally mistakes for Phoebe. The stress of his approaching wedding {{and the arrival of}} his mother prompt Jack to have a heart attack. While at the hospital, Colleen uses a heart monitor as <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> detector, on Jack, which leads him to revealing that he does not love Phoebe. They break off their engagement.|$|E

Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for {{the activities of the}} military–industrial complex. Mulder dismisses these claims until Scully tells him Kritschgau told her that she was given cancer to make him believe.|$|E
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was <b>a</b> <b>lie,</b> flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E

The necessary and sufficient conditions on an almost complex structure on <b>a</b> real <b>Lie</b> supergroup for defining <b>a</b> complex <b>Lie</b> supergroup are deduced. The classification of real Lie supergroups with such almost complex structures yields a new approach to the known classification of complex Lie supergroups by complex Harish-Chandra superpairs. A universal complexification of <b>a</b> real <b>Lie</b> supergroup is constructed. Comment: This is a condensed version of the previous file with additional remark...|$|R

5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Fox Mulder. Both Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) eventually meet Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee who claims that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens is <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> Kritschgau tells Mulder that his sister Samantha Mulder's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body discovered in Canada was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for the military–industrial complex. Distraught by Kritschgau's claims, Mulder loses his faith. Later, the FBI investigates Mulder's apparent suicide. Scully confirms the unseen body's identity.|$|E

Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade, where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a {{different}} person—which Mulder denounces as <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the Vietnam War as he looks upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.|$|E
