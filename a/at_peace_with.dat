5|$|In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia {{had ended}} the Thirty Years' War, {{during which the}} Swedish Empire emerged as a major European power. In the Torstenson War, a theater of the Thirty Years' War, Sweden had {{defeated}} the former Baltic great power Denmark. Sweden had been <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Russia since the Treaty of Stolbovo had ended the Ingrian War in 1617. Sweden had remained {{in a state of}} war with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth since the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), which was concluded by the repeatedly renewed truce (Altmark, Stuhmsdorf).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> France and Spain and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Calshot {{was held by}} Parliamentary forces against King Charles I, and protected with a 15-strong garrison at an annual cost of £107. Parliament considered the fortress important and kept it supplied with ammunition; unlike several other local forts, Parliament kept the castle operational, probably because of its ongoing role in defending Southampton Water. During the early 18th-century War of Spanish Succession it was equipped with up to 25 guns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> France and Spain and the coastal forts, {{included}} Portland, received little attention. A 1623 survey {{reported that the}} castle was equipped with three culverins, nine demi-culverins and a saker, but that the fortifications had suffered badly from sea erosion and required extensive repairs. Fourteen years later, the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men.|$|E

5|$|In foreign policy, Grant {{sought to}} {{increase}} trade and influence while remaining <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the world. With Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, he successfully resolved the Alabama claims through the Treaty of Washington with Great Britain. Grant and Fish negotiated a peaceful resolution with Spain over the Virginius Affair. Congress rejected Grant's initiative to annex the Dominican Republic, creating a rift among Republicans. His administration implemented a gold standard and sought to strengthen the dollar. Grant's immediate response to the Panic of 1873 failed to halt a severe industrial depression that produced high unemployment, deflation, and bankruptcies. When Grant left office in 1877, he embarked on a two-year world tour that captured favorable global attention for him and the United States.|$|E
5|$|In late 842 or 843, with Neapolitan support, the Muslims conquered Messina. In 845, the {{fortress}} of Modica also fell, while the Byzantines, now <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Abbasid Caliphate, received reinforcements {{from the eastern}} theme of Charsianon. The two armies met near Butera, where the Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat, losing about 10,000 men. In the wake of this disaster, the Byzantine position deteriorated rapidly: al-Fadl ibn Ja'far took Leontini by a ruse in 846, and {{the fortress}} of Ragusa followed in 848, when its garrison was forced by severe famine to surrender it to the Muslims, who razed it to the ground. At {{about the same time}} (late 847 or 848), an attempt by the Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo failed, and subsequently the Byzantines lost seven out of their ten ships in a storm.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> France and Spain {{and as a}} result the coastal defences {{received}} little attention; surveys reported multiple problems with Tilbury Fort including flooding caused by the estuary tides, and ferry passengers and animals making their way uninvited into the fort. In 1642 civil war broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Tilbury was controlled by Parliament, who placed the Tilbury and Gravesend forts under the command of a military governor, using them to control traffic entering London and to search for spies; it saw no military action during the war. Tilbury remained in use during the interregnum, having a garrison of three officers and sixty-six men in 1651.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges {{taking up the}} post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E
5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E

5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria {{it was decided}} that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that the deterioration of the Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> his neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's {{first few}} years as king can be {{interpreted}} in different ways. From a positive perspective, he stabilised the northern border with Scotland, contained Geoffrey's attacks on Normandy, was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Louis VI, enjoyed {{good relations with the}} church and had the broad support of his barons. There were significant underlying problems, nonetheless. The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles they felt they deserved or were owed. Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry's considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen's more lavish court and the need to raise and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.|$|E
5|$|That the Sacs and Foxes did {{claim the}} country generally, where this land lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States till 1824. And {{this raises the}} {{question}} whether, according to Spanish usage, whilst that power governed Louisiana, an existing Indian claim to territory precluded inhabitation and cultivation under a permit to inhabit and cultivate a particular place designated in the permit, and {{which was in the}} Indian country. Spain had no treaties with any of the Indian tribes in Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The Indians were kept quiet, and <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Spanish subjects, by kind treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands claimed by them, without written permits from the Governor; but that such permits were usual, cannot be doubted.|$|E

5|$|While he was triumphantly {{campaigning in}} the north, a rumour {{of his death}} caused the Thebans and Athenians to rebel against Macedonian hegemony once more. Alexander reacted {{immediately}} but, while the other cities hesitated when he advanced into Greece, Thebes decided to resist with the utmost vigor. However, the resistance was useless, and the city was captured and then razed to the ground, and its territory was divided between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission, leaving all of Greece at least outwardly <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Alexander. With Macedon's vassals and allies once again peaceable, Alexander was finally free {{to take control of}} the stalled war with Persia, and in early 334 BC he crossed with an army of 42,000 men into Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|Although Višeslav is only {{mentioned}} by name, the DAI mentions that the Serbs served the Byzantine Emperor, {{and that they}} were at this time <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Bulgars, their neighbours with whom they shared a common frontier. The Bulgars, under Telerig, planned to colonize Bulgaria with Slavs from the neighbouring Berziti, as the earlier Bulgar expansion had caused massive Slav migrations and depopulation of Bulgaria when, in 762, more than 200,000 people fled to Byzantine territory and were relocated to Asia Minor. The Bulgars were defeated in 774, after Emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) learned of their planned raid. The Bulgars had by 773 cut off the communication route, the Vardar valley, between Serbia and the Byzantines. In 783, a large Slavic uprising took place in the Byzantine Empire, stretching from Macedonia to the Peloponnese, which was subsequently quelled by Byzantine patrikios Staurakios. In Pannonia, to the north of Serbia, Frankish ruler Charlemagne (r. 768–814) started his offensive against the Avars. Dalmatia, at this time, had firm relations with Byzantium. There was a Byzantine–Frankish conflict in the period of 789–810 over Dalmatia, although nothing is known from contemporary sources about the Slavs in the hinterland. When the general Byzantine–Frankish conflict ended in 812, the Franks held the Dalmatian coast while the Byzantines held the Dalmatian cities.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Parthia, Rome still {{interfered}} in its affairs. The Roman emperor Tiberius (r.14–37AD) {{became involved}} in a plot by Pharasmanes I of Iberia to place his brother Mithridates on the throne of Armenia by assassinating the Parthian ally King Arsaces of Armenia. Artabanus III {{tried and failed to}} restore Parthian control of Armenia, prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to Scythia. The Romans released a hostage prince, Tiridates III of Parthia, to rule the region as an ally of Rome. Shortly before his death, Artabanus managed to force Tiridates from the throne using troops from Hyrcania. After Artabanus' death in 38AD, a long civil war ensued between the rightful successor Vardanes I and his brother Gotarzes II of Parthia. After Vardanes was assassinated during a hunting expedition, the Parthian nobility appealed to Roman emperor Claudius (r. 41–54AD) in 49AD to release the hostage prince Meherdates to challenge Gotarzes. This backfired when Meherdates was betrayed by the governor of Edessa and Izates bar Monobaz of Adiabene; he was captured and sent to Gotarzes, where he was allowed to live after having his ears mutilated, an act that disqualified him from inheriting the throne.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> France and Spain, and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. Deal Castle {{was in a}} poor state of repair by 1615, the outer walls damaged by storms and coastal erosion, and a 1616 survey suggested that repairs estimated at £396 were necessary. The problems persisted, with the winter storms filling the moat with water and stones from the beach, and undermining the foundations; the castle's captain, William Byng, sent numerous complaints about this to his superiors. By 1634, surveys were suggesting that the repairs would now cost £1,243; a suggestion was put forward by the George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, that nearby Camber Castle should be demolished to help provide materiel for the work at Deal. Most of the garrison were now living {{in the town of}} Deal and complaints were made by the Lord Warden in 1618 that only a small guard force was being left to secure the castle at night. As the condition of the castle waned, fighting between Dutch, French and Spanish ships in the Downs became common. Some repairs were probably finally carried out in the late 1630s.|$|E
5|$|The early Ming {{court could}} not, and did not, aspire {{to the control}} imposed upon the Jurchens in Manchuria by the Mongols, yet it created a norm of {{organization}} that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers. By {{the end of the}} Hongwu reign, the essentials of a policy toward the Jurchens had taken shape. Most of the inhabitants of Manchuria, except for the wild Jurchens, were <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> China. The Ming had created many guards (衛, wei) in Manchuria, but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control. In 1409, the Ming dynasty under Yongle Emperor established the Nurgan Regional Military Commission {{on the banks of the}} Amur River, and Yishiha, a eunuch of Haixi Jurchen derivation, was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the Amur to pacify the Wild Jurchens. After the death of Yongle Emperor, the Nurgan Regional Military Commission was abolished in 1435, and the Ming court ceased to have substantial activities there, although the guards continued to exist in Manchuria. By the late Ming period, Ming political presence in Manchuria had waned considerably.|$|E
