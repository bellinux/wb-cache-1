5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|Lee's audio cables met {{resistance}} at first, {{because most}} audio cabling {{at the time}} was zip cord provided by audio vendors for free. Sales improved as retailers witnessed audio demonstrations <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> his Monster-branded cables offered better profit margins than other electronics products. Lee is credited with building the Monster business and shaping today’s audio components market.|$|E
5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the {{conscience}} of his generation. He gazed upon {{the great wall of}} segregation <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
6000|$|Conrad looked confusedly around, and {{the same}} voice said again, [...] "Mr. Dryfoos!" [...] <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> it was a lady {{speaking}} to him from a coupe beside the curbing, <b>and</b> then he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> it was Miss Vance.|$|R
60|$|Harper {{pulled at}} the wheel, <b>and</b> Appleby <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> he was {{addressing}} him.|$|R
60|$|Waldron {{opened his}} hand, <b>and</b> Rollo <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{there was nothing}} in it.|$|R
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the author}} of the Gesta Henrici quinti, Henry V aimed ‘to promote the honour of God, the {{extension}} of the Church, the deliverance of his country and the peace and tranquillity of kingdoms’. He was deeply religious, engaged with ecclesiastical issues <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> his role as king was to honour God, extend the church, fight heresy and defend the established social order. All his victories, especially Agincourt, were attributed to divine intervention. Henry V founded Syon Abbey in 1415, as penance for his father’s execution of Archbishop Scrope, and three monasteries in London: for Carthusian, Bridgettine and Celestine orders. The equally devout Henry VI continued the architectural patronage begun by his father, founding Eton College and King's College, Cambridge and leaving a lasting educational and architectural legacy in buildings including King's College Chapel and Eton College Chapel.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E
60|$|Lisle {{abruptly}} strode away, <b>and</b> Crestwick <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Nasmyth was regarding him curiously.|$|R
60|$|Lydgate did not answer, <b>and</b> she <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> he was debating with himself.|$|R
60|$|Then Charmion {{drew near}} me, <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> she, too, was weeping.|$|R
5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Blaine {{ran for a}} seat in the Maine House of Representatives, and was elected. He ran {{for reelection}} in 1859, 1860, and 1861, and was {{successful}} each time by large majorities. The added responsibilities led Blaine to reduce his duties with the Advertiser in 1860, and he soon ceased editorial work altogether. Meanwhile, his political power was growing as he became chairman of the Republican state committee in 1859, replacing Stevens. Blaine was not a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860, but attended anyway as an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Returning to Maine, he was elected Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1861 and reelected in 1862. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he supported Lincoln’s war effort <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the Maine Legislature voted to organize and equip units to join the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Skanderbeg had positioned his forces {{at the bottom of a}} hill. Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of his forces down the hill to attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was devastating for the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
60|$|A number rushed in, <b>and</b> Robert <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{the boat}} {{would soon be}} full.|$|R
60|$|He {{raised his}} hand, <b>and</b> they <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{he was holding}} a small revolver.|$|R
60|$|Helen {{raised her}} head, <b>and</b> Philippa <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{her eyes were}} filled with tears.|$|R
5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Ziv once {{came into}} the school <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> in the row of galoshes that had been lined up outside the study hall, one of the pair of galoshes was not {{in line with the}} others. Rb Ziv {{dedicated}} an entire ethical sermon to the need for order in light of this event.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> her face was unusually pale.|$|R
60|$|Gladwyne made {{a little}} abrupt {{movement}} <b>and</b> Batley <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> his shot had told.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she looked}} up, <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{her face was}} torn with passion.|$|R
25|$|Despite his {{election}} to the Chatham town council, Bennett's days in the town were numbered. He was ambitious <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the small community was too narrow a field for him. He was already negotiating with Sir James Lougheed {{to move to the}} North-West Territories and become his law partner in Calgary. Lougheed was Calgary's richest man and most successful lawyer.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} Freyja woke <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{the doors to}} her bower were open, yet unbroken, and that her {{precious}} necklace was gone. Freyja had an idea of who was responsible. She got dressed and went to Odin. She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, {{and that he should}} give her back her jewelry.|$|E
25|$|Sun Quan once visited Jiang Qin's house <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Jiang's {{mother had}} only a light bed-curtain and cotton blankets, while Jiang's wife and concubines wore only simple cloth dresses. Sun Quan was so {{impressed}} with Jiang Qin's frugality that he ordered his own household to make silk blankets for Jiang's mother and exchange her curtains for better ones. Jiang Qin's wife and concubines also received silk and embroidered garments.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer. Her {{face was}} set, <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{he was only}} boring her. She put on a coat and her hat. She moved towards the door, <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> in a moment she would be gone. He went up to her quickly and fell on his knees before her, seizing her hands: he {{abandoned}} all self-respect.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} silence, <b>and</b> Brooke <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Saxton was holding himself in with difficulty.|$|R
60|$|She paused, <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{her breath}} was coming more quickly at the remembrance.|$|R
25|$|Finally, he {{followed}} the serpent to lake in the mountains. He watched <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that,</b> while one of the serpents two heads would be awake during daylight, the other would sleep. Then during night, they would switch and the other would stay awake. Training and sacrificing more, Xwechtáal prayed for the answer to defeat the dreaded two-headed serpent. Then one night he had a vision.|$|E
25|$|According to Eleanor Womer, Dugal Campbell (Mary's brother) {{accompanied}} Colonel Bouquet to the Muskingum. He {{stood on}} a log and yelled out Mary Campbell's name, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> a Native woman clapped her hand over a girl's mouth in response. The girl was Mary Campbell, {{and that is how}} she was recovered. While this is uncertain, it is known that relatives of a number of known captives traveled with Bouquet in October 1764.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{the removal}} of the child suited the plans of the comte de Provence, now Louis XVIII, along with those of the revolutionary government. The royal family made no serious attempt to {{ascertain}} the truth, though they paid no tributes to the memory of the deceased king as might have been expected, had they been convinced of his death. Even his sister wore no mourning for him until she arrived at Vienna <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> this was expected of her.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised its}} drapery, <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the sofa was built of packing cases.|$|R
60|$|He conferred {{with the}} police, <b>and</b> Koolau <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> they were {{preparing}} to rush him.|$|R
60|$|He {{gripped her}} gloved fingers, brushed past her, <b>and</b> she <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> she was alone.|$|R
