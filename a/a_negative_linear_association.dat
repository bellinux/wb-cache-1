40|$|Abstract Objective: The {{objective}} is to examine competing explanatory and suppression influences on <b>a</b> <b>negative,</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> between age and depressive symptoms. Methods: Two samples were used: a community sample of physically disabled individuals and a comparison sample matched on age, sex, and area of residence. Results: Fewer economic hardships and fewer experiences of negative interpersonal exchanges among older disabled and nondisabled respondents account for the negative relationship between age and depressive symptoms. Higher scores on a composite measure of religiosity among older disabled adults also account {{for part of the}} negative age effect. Conversely, a lower sense of mastery among older respondents in both samples suppresses the size of the negative age slope. Discussion: Findings are discussed in terms of stress process and socioemotional selectivity theories, which predict that personal and social arrangements influence the experience of emotions differentially across the life course...|$|E

We determined {{adherence to}} antihypertensive(s) and its associated factors among 280 Iranian patients. Methods. They were recruited consecutively from private and university health centers and pharmacies in four cities. The validated Persian version of the 8 -item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS- 8) was administered to measure adherence. Results. Mean (±SD) overall MMAS- 8 score was 5. 75 (± 1. 88). About half of the sample (139 cases, 49. 6 %) showed low adherence (MMAS- 8 score < 6). There was <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> between the MMAS- 8 score and systolic BP (r=- 0. 231, P< 0. 001) as well as diastolic BP (r=- 0. 280, P< 0. 001). In linear regression model, overweight/obesity (B=- 0. 52, P= 0. 02), previous history of admission to emergency services due to hypertensive crisis (B=- 0. 79, P= 0. 001), and getting medication directly from drugstore without refill prescription in hand (B=- 0. 51, P= 0. 04) were factors recognized to have statistically significant association with the MMAS- 8 score. Conclusion. Antihypertensive adherence was unsatisfactory. We suggest that health care providers pay special attention and {{make use of the}} aforementioned findings in their routine visits of hypertensive patients to recognize those who are vulnerable to poor adherence...|$|E

A completely randomized 3 x 2 design (restriction level x sex class) was used to evaluate thirty lambs approximately two months of age with an average initial body weight of 13 ± 1. 49 kg. When the average body weight of the animals in one of the treatment groups reached 28 kg, all animals were slaughtered. Sex class had effect on body weight at slaughter, empty body weight, hot carcass weight and cold carcass weight. The weight of the leg was greater in non-castrated animals. There was linear decreased effect according to increasing levels of restriction for the carcass cuts, except for leg and rear loin yield. There was statistic difference between sex class for the weights of kidneys, paw, and large intestine of non-castrated animals (P < 0. 05).

An overall individual animal prevalence of 46. 8 % (548 of 1171 animals) and a herd prevalence of 91. 7 % (11 of 12 farms) were recorded in 12 dairy farms by the CIT test. There were significant (P < 0. 0001) differences in individual prevalence between farms and breeds (pure Holstein and their crosses with Zebu). There was positive correlation (r = 0. 41) between herd size and prevalence of bovine tuberculosis. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> (R 2 = 0. 24) was found between mean score of management of the farm and prevalence, indicating that the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis could be improved by sanitary measures.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the association between weekly alcohol consumption and brain atrophy in adults aged 60 to 64 years. Methods: Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans from 385 adults recruited through a community survey were analyzed. Automated segmentation and manual tracing methods were used to obtain brain subvolumes and automated methods were used to obtain quantification and localization of white matter hyperintensities. Visual measures of cortical atrophy were obtained as were data on health and lifestyle factors. Alcohol consumption was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Results: In men, weekly alcohol consumption had a positive linear association with ventricular volume and gray matter and <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> with white matter. In women, weekly alcohol consumption had a nonlinear relationship with cerebrospinal fluid and white matter. Alcohol consumption was not associated with white matter hyperintensities, corpus callosum size, hippocampal or amygdala volumes in analyses adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusion: An association between alcohol consumption and brain atrophy is evident at the population level. In women, detrimental effects of alcohol on the brain appear to occur at lower levels of consumption. It remains possible that low levels of alcohol consumption have neuroprotective benefits but is clear that high levels of consumption are detrimental.

Design, setting and participants: A cross-sectional study using Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data on statin prescribing by rurality, gender and patient postcode {{for the period}} May to December 2002. Participants were the Australian population, stratified by gender, quintile of index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage and rural, remote and metropolitan areas classification. Results: Statin prescribing (scripts per 1000 population per month) was higher in urban areas (women, 51. 915; men, 51. 892) than in rural (women, 48. 311; men, 48. 098) or remote (women, 39. 679; men, 34. 145) areas.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} {{the influence of}} plasma total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides on risk of cerebrovascular disease. DESIGN [...] The Copenhagen City Heart Study is a prospective observational survey with two cardiovascular examinations at five year intervals. Non-fasting plasma lipids were measured in participants once at each examination, along with other variables. The Cox regression model was used to establish {{the effect of the}} factors recorded on cerebrovascular events of mostly, but not exclusively, ischaemic origin. SUBJECTS [...] 19, 698 women and men at least 20 years old, randomly selected after age stratification from an area of central Copenhagen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Initial cases of stroke and transient ischaemic attack recorded from hospital records and death certificates from 1976 through 1988. RESULTS [...] 660 non-haemorrhagic and 33 haemorrhagic events were recorded. Total cholesterol was positively associated with risk of non-haemorrhagic events, but only for levels > 8 mmol/l, corresponding to the upper 5 % of the distribution in the study population. For lower plasma cholesterol values the relative risk remained nearly constant. Plasma triglyceride concentration was significantly, positively associated with risk of non-haemorrhagic events. The relative risk corresponding to an increase of 1 mmol/l was 1. 12 (95 % confidence interval 1. 07 to 1. 16). There was <b>a</b> <b>negative,</b> log <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> between high density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of non-haemorrhagic events (0. 53 (0. 34 to 0. 83)). There was no indication that the effects of plasma lipids were different in women and men. CONCLUSIONS [...] The pattern of the association between plasma cholesterol and risk of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease was not log linear, and the increased risk was confined to the upper 5 % of the cholesterol distribution.

However, the association of motor behaviour and white matter integrity of motor pathways in MDD is unclear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to first investigate structural connectivity of white matter motor pathways in MDD. Second, we explore the relation of objectively measured motor activity and white matter integrity of motor pathways in MDD. Therefore, 21 patients with MDD and 21 healthy controls matched for age, gender, education and body mass index underwent diffusion tensor imaging and 24 hour actigraphy (measure of the activity level) the same day. Applying a probabilistic fibre tracking approach we extracted connection pathways between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), the SMA-proper, the primary motor cortex (M 1), the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the pallidum and the thalamus. Patients had lower activity levels and demonstrated increased mean diffusivity (MD) in pathways linking left pre-SMA and SMA-proper, and right SMA-proper and M 1.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explore which factors best predict the occurrence of burden on primary caregivers of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Understanding these factors enables the identification of those caregivers at risk of having their physical and psychological health adversely affected, and the implementation of intervention strategies to reduce the negative impact of caring on parents of children with chronic medical conditions. The study sample consisted of a total of 62 caregivers (89 % women) aged between 30 and 54 years (Mean = 41. 98, SD = 5. 64). CP affected children were aged between 1 and 17 years (Mean = 7. 69, SD = 4. 18) and the average degree of disability (% reflected in the medical record assessed by the Ministry of health, social services and equality of Spain) was 77. 098 (scale of 100) (SD = 14. 62). A burden model was constructed based on multiple linear regressions. The model included the following variables: degree of disability, depression (assessed by Beck Depression Inventory-II) and self-efficacy (measured by the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy). The regression model explained 40. 9 % of the total variance. It was found that self-efficacy had <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> with burden, while the degree of disability and depression showed a positive linear association.

We also wished to elucidate whether the interpretation of the results was depending on the methods used for adjustment of transfection efficiency and protein content. With ss-galactosidase as transfection control, 22 CAG had the highest activity (set to 100 %) compared to 16 CAG (mean 78 % [range 41 - 132], p= 0. 005) and 28 CAG (68 % [26 - 162], p= 0. 006), whereas renilla-luciferase resulted in 16 CAG behaving similar to 22 CAG (104 % [56 - 165], p= 0. 7) and 28 CAG having lower activity (59 % [33 - 101], p= 0. 004). In these experiments, also the empty vector displayed considerable background activity.

40|$|Police {{officers}} encounter unpredictable, evolving, and escalating stressful {{demands in}} their work. Utilizing the Spielberger Police Stress Survey (60 -item instrument for assessing specific conditions or events {{considered to be}} stressors in police work), the present study examined the association {{of the top five}} highly rated and bottom five least rated work stressors among police officers with their awakening cortisol pattern. Participants were police officers enrolled in the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) study (n= 338). For each group, the total stress index (product of rating and frequency of the stressor) was calculated. Participants collected saliva by means of Salivettes at four time points: on awakening, 15, 30 and 45 min after waking to examine the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Saliva samples were analyzed for free cortisol concentrations. A slope reflecting the awakening pattern of cortisol over time was estimated by fitting a linear regression model relating cortisol in log-scale to time of collection. The slope served as the outcome variable. Analysis of covariance, regression, and repeated measures models were used to determine if there was an association of the stress index with the waking cortisol pattern. There was <b>a</b> significant <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> between total stress index of the five highest stressful events and slope of the awakening cortisol regression line (trend p-value= 0. 0024). As the stress index increased, the pattern of the awakening cortisol regression line tended to flatten. Officers with a zero stress index showed a steep and steady increase in cortisol from baseline (which is often observed) while officers with a moderate or high stress index showed a dampened or flatter response over time. Conversely, the total stress index of the five least rated events was not significantly associated with the awakening cortisol pattern. The study suggests that police events or conditions considered highly stressful by the officers may be associated with disturbances of the typical awakening cortisol pattern. The results are consistent with previous research where chronic exposure to stressors is associated with a diminished awakening cortisol response pattern.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{examined}} how total volume {{of physical activity}} and reallocation of time spent at various objectively measured intensities of physical activity (PA) were associated with overall and abdominal fat distribution in adult Inuit in Greenland. METHODS: Data were collected {{as part of a}} countrywide cross-sectional health survey in Greenland. A combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor measured total physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and intensities of PA (N= 1536). Visceral- and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT) was assessed by ultrasonography. Isotemporal substitution modeling was used to analyse the association between substitution of 1 -hour of sedentary time to light or moderate intensity PA and 1 -hour light intensity PA to moderate or vigorous intensity PA in relation to BMI, waist circumference (WC), SAT and VAT. RESULTS: <b>A</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> was found for total PAEE and BMI, WC, VAT and SAT. Exchanging 1 -hour of sedentary time with light intensity PA was associated with lower WC (- 0. 6 cm., p= 0. 01), SAT (- 0. 08 cm., p< 0. 001) and VAT (- 0. 04 cm., p= 0. 359). Exchanging light intensity PA with vigorous intensity PA resulted in - 6. 1 cm. lower WC (p< 0. 001), - 0. 7 cm. lower VAT (p= 0. 018) and - 0. 7 cm. lower SAT (p< 0. 001). When further adjusting for BMI the associations were attenuated; however, most of them remained significant, and the directions were mostly unchanged. Both 1, 5, and 10 minutes bouts of MVPA were negatively associated with overall and abdominal fat distribution. CONCLUSION: PAEE is associated with lower BMI, WC and abdominal fat among Greenland Inuit. The importance of promoting an upward shift of the whole PA intensity distribution and to spur even short bouts of MVPA to limit excessive accumulation of SAT and VAT is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Background: The role of body {{composition}} as {{a risk factor}} for death remains controversial in older persons. Objective: We determined the role of body-composition variables in mortality in older women. Design: Longitudinal analyses were performed in a prospective cohort study of older women. Participants were 4574 community-dwelling women aged $ 75 y at the baseline visit (between January 1992 and April 1994). Several body-composition variables were assessed by using anthropometric measures and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the baseline visit. The main outcome was overall mortality. Body-composition variables were body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2), hip circumference, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, fat mass/height 2, lean mass/height 2, percentage of fat mass, percentage of lean mass, and the lean mass:fat mass ratio. Results: The mean (6 SD) age at baseline was 80. 26 3. 8 y. During the 17. 7 y (IQR: 17. 2 – 18. 1 y) of follow-up, 2876 women died. U-shaped in crude analyses and reversed J-shaped relations in adjusted anal-yses between BMI, hip and waist circumferences, fat mass/height 2, and risk of death were shown. Adjusted risk of death was signifi-cantly higher in participants with BMI # 24. 6 and fat mass/height 2 # 8. 2 kg/m 2. There was <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> between fat mass (%) and risk of death: a 10 % increase in fat mass was asso-ciated with a 12 % reduction of mortality risk (adjusted HR: 0. 88; 95 % CI: 0. 84, 0. 92; P, 0. 001). Linear and statistically significant relations were shown between lean mass/height 2 and risk of death in crude but not adjusted analyses. Conclusions: Risk of mortality was consistently higher in older women with low adiposity. No lean mass indicator was associated with risk of death. Clinicians should be alerted by low adiposity in older women. Am J Clin Nutr 2014; 100 : 1352 – 60...|$|E

Results: The mean galantamine plasma concentration demonstrated a strong positive linear association with dose (r= 0. 51, p< 0. 001). Moreover, patients with separate doses of galantamine (8, 16 and 24 mg daily) differed significantly in plasma concentration (p< 0. 001). No gender differences regarding dose were observed. There was no linear relationship between galantamine plasma concentration and BMI in the entire cohort. When investigating the impact of gender, <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> (r=- 0. 45, p= 0. 001) between concentration and BMI was found in the male group but not in the female.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the relationships between objectively measured and self-reported physical activity, sedentary behavior, and academic performance in Finnish children. Methods: Two hundred and seventy-seven children from five schools in the Jyväskylä school district in Finland (58 % of the 475 eligible students, mean age = 12. 2 yr, 56 % girls) {{participated in the study}} in the spring of 2011. Self-reported physical activity and screen time were evaluated with questions used in the WHO Health Behavior in School-Aged Children study. Children’s physical activity and sedentary time were measured objectively by using an ActiGraph GT 1 M/GT 3 X accelerometer for seven consecutive days. A cutoff value of 2296 counts per minute was used for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and 100 counts per minute for sedentary time. Grade point averages were provided by the education services of the city of Jyväskylä. ANOVA and linear regression analysis were used to analyze the relationships among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and academic performance. RESULTS: Objectively measured MVPA (P = 0. 955) and sedentary time (P = 0. 285) were not associated with grade point average. However, self-reported MVPA had an inverse U-shaped curvilinear association with grade point average (P = 0. 001), and screen time had <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> <b>negative</b> <b>association</b> with grade point average (P = 0. 002), after adjusting for sex, children’s learning difficulties, highest level of parental education, and amount of sleep.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of male and female factors on the pregnancy rate in an intrauterine insemination (IUI) programme. Data on 522 cycles were retrospectively studied. All patients 39 years or younger were included in the study where data were available on male and female diagnosis, as well as on ovulation induction methodology. Regression analysis was possible on 495 cycles to study different factors affecting the pregnancy rate per treatment cycle. Logistic regression identified variables which were related to outcome and were subsequently incorporated into a statistical model. The number of follicles was found to have a <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> with the risk ratio (chance) of pregnancy. The age of the woman was also found to have <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> (<b>negative)</b> <b>association</b> with pregnancy. The percentage motility and percentage normal morphology (by strict criteria) of spermatozoa in the fresh ejaculate were the male factors that significantly and independently predicted the outcome. Percentage motility ≥ 50 was associated with a risk ratio of pregnancy of 2. 95 compared to percentage motility 14 % was associated with a risk ratio of pregnancy of 1. 8 compared to percentage normal morphology ≤ 14 %. Female patients with idiopathic infertility were divided into three groups according to normal sperm morphology. The pregnancy rate per cycle was 2. 63 % (1 / 38) for the P (poor) pattern group (0 - 4 % normal forms), 11. 4 % (17 / 149) for the G (good) pattern group (5 - 14 %), and 24 % (18 / 75) for the N (normal) pattern group (> 14 % normal forms). A female diagnosis of endometriosis or tubal factor impacted negatively on the probability of pregnancy (risk ratio of 0. 17), compared with other female diagnoses. Male and female factors contribute to pregnancy outcome, but the clinician can influence prognosis by increasing the number of follicles, especially in severe male factor cases. Articl...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{epidemiological}} and malacological data pertaining to schistosomiasis in Chad. In view of a recently articulated elimination agenda, {{a deeper understanding of}} the spatio-temporal distribution of schistosomiasis inter- mediate host snails is pivotal. We conducted cross-sectional malacological surveys during the dry season (April/May 2013) and after the short rainy season (October 2013) in N’Djamena, the capital of Chad. Snails were identified at the genus and species level using morphological keys and molecular DNA barcoding approaches. Those belonging to Bulinus and Biomphalaria were examined for cercarial shedding. Snail habitats were characterised and their predictive potential for the presence of schistosomiasis intermediate host snails explored. Seasonal patterns were studied using geographical information system and kriging in order to interpolate snail abundance data to make predictions at non-sampled locations across N’Djamena. Overall, 413 Bulinus truncatus, 369 Bulinus forskalii and 108 Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails were collected and subjected to cercarial shedding. During the dry season, one Bu. truncatus of 119 snails collected shed Schistosoma spp. cer- cariae (0. 84 %), while S. mansoni was shed by one of 108 Bi. pfeifferi snails (0. 93 %). None of the snails collected after the rainy season shed Schistosoma spp. cercariae. The abundance of Bu. truncatus and Bu. forskalii showed an inverse U-shape relationship with the square term of conductivity, i. e. low abundance at the lowest and highest levels of conductivity and high abundance at intermediate levels. Bi. pfeifferi showed <b>a</b> <b>negative,</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> with pH in the dry seasons. It is planned to link these intermediate host snail data to infection data in human populations with the goal to draw a predictive risk map that can be utilised for control and elimination of schistosomiasis in N’Djamena...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{distribution}} of airway responsiveness {{in a general}} population of non-smokers without respiratory symptoms has not been established, limiting its use in clinical and epidemiological practice. We derived reference equations depending on individual characteristics (i. e., sex, age, baseline lung function) for relevant percentiles of the methacholine two-point dose-response slope. Methods In a reference sample of 1567 adults of the SAPALDIA cross-sectional survey (1991), defined by excluding subjects with respiratory conditions, responsiveness during methacholine challenge was quantified by calculating the two-point dose-response slope (O'Connor). Weighted L 1 -regression was used to estimate reference equations for the 95 th, 90 th, 75 th and 50 th percentiles of the two-point slope. Results Reference equations for the 95 th, 90 th, 75 th and 50 th percentiles of the two-point slope were estimated using {{a model of the}} form a + b* Age + c* FEV 1 + d* (FEV 1) 2, where FEV 1 corresponds to the pre-test (or baseline) level of FEV 1. For the central half of the FEV 1 distribution, we used a quadratic model to describe the dependence of methacholine slope on baseline FEV 1. For the first and last quartiles of FEV 1, a linear relation with FEV 1 was assumed (i. e., d was set to 0). Sex was not a predictor term in this model. <b>A</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> with slope was found for age. We provide an Excel file allowing calculation of the percentile of methacholine slope of a subject after introducing age – pre-test FEV 1 – and results of methacholine challenge of the subject. Conclusion The present study provides equations for four relevant percentiles of methacholine two-point slope depending on age and baseline FEV 1 as basic predictors in an adult reference population of non-obstructive and non-atopic persons. These equations may help clinicians and epidemiologists to better characterize individual or population airway responsiveness. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between weight change and baseline body mass index (BMI) over 8 years in a cohort of continuing and quitting smokers. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Oxfordshire general practices nicotine patch/placebo trial with 8 -year follow-up. Participants: Eighty-five participants were biochemically proven abstinent at 3, 6, 12 months and 8 years (abstainers). A total of 613 smoked throughout the 8 years (smokers), 26 quit {{for a whole year}} but were smoking again by 8 years (relapsed); 116 smoked for the first year but were abstinent at 8 years (late abstainers). Measurements: Weight and BMI was measured at baseline and at 8 years. Regression models were used to examine weight gain by smoking status and the association of BMI at the time of quitting. Findings: Abstainers gained 8. 79 kg [standard deviation (SD) 6. 36; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 7. 42, 10. 17]. Smokers gained 2. 24 kg (SD 6. 65; 95 % CI 1. 7, 2. 77). Relapsed smokers gained 3. 28 kg (SD 7. 16; 95 % CI 0. 328, 6. 24). Late abstainers gained 8. 33 kg (SD 8. 04; 95 % CI 6. 85, 9. 81). The association between baseline BMI and weight change was modified by smoking status. In smokers there was <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> of BMI, while in abstainers a J-shaped curve fitted best. These models estimated weight change over 8 years in abstainers of + 9. 8 kg, + 7. 8 kg, + 10. 2 kg, + 19. 4 kg and in smokers of + 3. 9 kg, + 2. 6 kg, 1. 0 kg and − 0. 8 kg, where BMI was 18, 23, 29 and 36, respectively. Conclusion: Obese smokers gain most weight on quitting smoking, while obese continuing smokers are likely to remain stable or lose weight. Obese quitters have the greatest need for interventions to ameliorate weight gain...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{introduce}} a structural vegetation map of the Serengeti ecosystem and, based on the map, to test the relative influences of landscape factors on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in the ecosystem. This study was conducted in the Serengeti-Maasai Mara ecosystem in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, between 34 degrees and 36 degrees E longitude, and 1 degrees and 2 degrees S latitude. The vegetation map was produced from satellite imagery using data from over 800 ground-truthing points. Spatial characteristics of the vegetation were analysed in the resulting map using the fragstats software package. Average patch area and nearest neighbour distance (NND) were determined for grassland, shrubland and woodland vegetation types. The heterogeneity of vegetation types was estimated with Simpson's diversity index (D). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to explore the relationships between the spatial characteristics of vegetation and three predictor variables: annual rainfall, coefficient of variation (CV) in annual rainfall, and topographic moisture index (TMI). A vegetation map is presented along with a detailed summary of the distribution of land-cover classes and spatial heterogeneity in the ecosystem. Significant relationships were found between vegetation diversity (D) and TMI, and also between D and average rainfall. The average area of grassland patches showed significant relationships with average rainfall, with rainfall CV and with TMI. Grassland NND was positively associated with average rainfall. Woodland patch area showed a unimodal response to average rainfall and <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> with TMI. Woodland NND showed a U-shaped association with annual rainfall and a weaker positive linear association with TMI. An acceptable model that explained variation in shrubland patch characteristics could not be identified. The vegetation map and analysis thereof resulted in three significant causal explanatory models that demonstrate that both rainfall and topography are important contributors to the distribution of woodlands and grasslands in the Serengeti. These findings further indicate that changes in patch characteristics have a complex interaction with rainfall and with topography. Our results are concordant with recent studies suggesting that percent woody cover in African savannas receiving less than c. 650 mm year(- 1) is bounded by average annual rainfall...|$|E
40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) is the mediator of androgen actions. In the AR coding region {{there is a}} polymorphic CAG repeat encoding a stretch of the amino acid glutamine (Q). The repeat length modulates receptor activity and is normally distributed between 10 - 30 CAG with a median length of 22 repeats in white men. At {{the start of this}} work, <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>linear</b> <b>association</b> between AR function and the CAG repeat number was generally assumed. This assumption was supported by clinical findings in patients with Kennedy’s disease, which is a neuromuscular disorder caused by an abnormally expanded CAG repeat (> 40 CAG). However, in vivo data concerning the association between CAG numbers within normal length and androgenic effects were conflicting. As understanding the impact of CAG number on the AR activity is important for proper interpretation of this polymorphism and risk of pathological conditions other than Kennedy’s disease, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the influence of CAG length, if any, on AR activity. Firstly an in vitro study was performed. A reporter gene with a human androgen responsive promoter was used in a transactivation assay. The repeat lengths included were 16, 22 and 28 CAG, which represent a short, the median, and a long repeat within the normal human range. The study showed that the AR with median repeat length had the highest activity in vitro. Secondly, the effect of the CAG repeat in relation to two androgen dependent conditions, infertility and PCa, was analysed in two separate meta-analyses. When stratifying the CAG repeats into three groups, shorter than median, median and longer than the median CAG length, the meta-analysis on infertile men showed 20 % increased risk of infertility in men harbouring other repeat lengths than the most common. On the other hand, CAG number did not have any effect on PCa risk. The AR regulates the expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Thus the expression of PSA can be used as a marker of AR activity in tissue. We measured the AR protein and PSA amount in human prostate tissue from 19 men with known CAG length. Those who were carriers of 22 CAG had lower AR amount and higher PSA than counterparts with other CAG lengths, but this was not statistically significant, probably due to the small study size. Taken together, these studies indicate that the median length of the {{androgen receptor}} CAG repeat is associated with optimal activity, in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
