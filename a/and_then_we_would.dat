[...] For example, [...] "the scene where I (Ken Jeong) say 'Good job' to Michael and he says 'Nice job, Bill... not' was improvised." [...] Jeong, who had {{previously}} taken part in an actual improv class, noted that [...] "Anyone who's ever taken an improv class appreciates that bit [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that some first season episodes were too neatly wrapped and solved, Jeff Pinkner commented {{towards the end}} of that season, [...] "We found that, absolutely, early on, we were falling into the trap of—the tease would be fantastic. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> too quickly answer it and [...] the tension. And we've tried to course-correct and have the tease promise" [...] questions that don't get answered right away. He further elaborated that the goal now is to [...] "have the energy of the show get bigger as [...] goes along... We're learning how to tell this version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're getting better at finding our way through these stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Fred Toye {{served as}} the episode director, his second after {{directing}} [...] "The Ghost Network" [...] six installments earlier. To create the opening scene of character Mark Young being [...] "attacked" [...] by butterflies, Toye shot it in multiple phases. Series co-creator Roberto Orci preferred the opening scene to involve a [...] "more subtle" [...] death, so Young was made to die from falling out a window, which was [...] "a real thing, something that's not imagined or whimsical". VFX coordinator Christopher Stollard stated that his crew [...] "relied entirely on actor performance," [...] with guest actor Ptolemy Slocum communicating often with the crew during filming. He shot his scenes in short bursts. Slocum summarized that he [...] "would experience the [...] cut <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> freeze, apply make-up , and then unfreeze and move on" [...] filming. On his first day, Slocum stated that he wore more than 75 individual prosthetics over his entire chest and arms.|$|E

500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
2500|$|Each summer, Hines toured {{with his}} whole band for three months, {{including}} through the South – {{the first black}} big band to do so. He explained, [...] " [...] we traveled by train through the South, they would send a porter back to our car {{to let us know}} when the dining room was cleared, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> all go in together. We couldn't eat when we wanted to. We had to eat when they were ready for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> go out and get it done".|$|E

2500|$|Wesley {{undergoes}} {{yet another}} drastic personality change in Angels fifth season {{following the death}} of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably [...] "unbalanced". [...] "By the time we get to the last few episodes, he's got a handle on the grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way," [...] says Denisof. [...] "But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart and it makes it possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, the stage is set for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there's nothing more for him to lose." [...] Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a [...] "much deeper, darker place" [...] than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, [...] "The Girl in Question". Denisof continues, They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having these two people that he was having these strong feelings about. That {{was going to be a}} fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [...] decided to cancel the show. The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley's death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, [...] "It was very upsetting to read. It's too good a story because it hurts." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{made him}} fully {{sensible}} {{that we knew}} how obliging that compliment was, but begged he would admit any whom he thought worthy to be trusted with a secret of the last importance.

5000|$|The idea of phonosemantics was {{sporadically}} discussed {{during the}} Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In 1690, Locke wrote {{against the idea}} in an essay called [...] "An Essay on Human Understanding". His argument was {{that if there were}} any connection between sounds <b>and</b> ideas, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> all be speaking the same language, but this is an over-generalisation. Leibniz's book New Essays on Human Understanding published in 1765 contains a point by point critique of Locke's essay. Leibniz picks up on the generalization used by Locke and adopts a less rigid approach: clearly there is no perfect correspondence between words and things, but neither is the relationship completely arbitrary, although he seems vague about what that relationship might be.|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have offered}} several {{explanations}} for the decline in unionization. Many emphasize that "globalization" and the technological advances embodied in the "new economy" have made unions obsolete. However, if the decline in unionization is the inevitable response to the twin forces of globalization <b>and</b> technology, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> expect unionization rates to follow a similar path in countries subjected to roughly similar levels of globalization and technology. This paper looks at union membership and coverage for 21 rich economies, including the United States, and finds {{over the last five}} decades a wide range of trends in union membership and collective bargaining. The national political environment, not globalization or technology, is the most important factor driving long-run changes in unionization rates in the United States...|$|R

40|$|A {{connection}} between self-monitoring, {{which is an}} individual difference in concern about self-presentation, and partner knowledge structures, which is how people organize thoughts about their current romantic partner, is explored in this study. There were two competing hypotheses. If people structure thoughts about their partner in a way similar to how they structure their social worlds, then low self-monitors would have integrated partner knowledge structures and high self-monitors would have compartmentalized partner knowledge structures. If people structure thoughts about their partner {{in a way that}} reflects their relationship motivations <b>and</b> needs <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> find the opposite pattern of results. We used a measure of compartmentalization and integration as well as Snyder’s (1974) Self-Monitoring Scale to explore our hypotheses. Although both low self-monitors and high self-monitors had relatively compartmentalized partner knowledge structures, we found support for the relationship motivations and needs hypothesis. Low self-monitors had more compartmentalized partner knowledge structures than did high self-monitors. In fact, low self-monitors were more likely than high self-monitors to have completely compartmentalized views of their partners. Reasons for these findings, limitations of this study, and future directions are discussed...|$|R
