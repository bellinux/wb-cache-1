2500|$|The {{policies}} of Weltpolitik, especially the Tirpitz Plan {{brought about a}} period of Anglo-German tension {{in the first years}} of the 20th century. Chamberlain who detested the land of his birth had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism. Chamberlain who came to hate Britain expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonestly vacuuming up the world's wealth was the same as his own. In another letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "There are periods, when history is, as it were, woven on a loom.. in such a way that the warp and woof are established and are essentially unalterable; but then come times when the threads are introduced for a new fabric, when the time of material and the design must first be determined...We find ourselves in such a time today." [...] Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world's greatest power, both for its own good and the good of the rest of the world. In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of [...] "stupid" [...] Slavs which was only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood, without the German blood in the House of Romanov [...] "nothing would remain but a decaying matière brute" [...] in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism. Chamberlain was very anti-American and called the United States a [...] "Dollar dynasty", writing: From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will live only so long as the stream of European spiritual power flows there, not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer.</b> That part of the world, it may be proven, creates sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past. Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: [...] "The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth". To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the High Seas Fleet which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing, völkisch Pan-German League.|$|E

60|$|Allow me {{to dwell}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> {{on the story}} which these pages contain.|$|E
60|$|At length {{the train}} {{came along and}} she was off. I waited <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> and then drove away.|$|R
60|$|Still {{he endured}} her for <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer.</b> He spoke no word to her, but {{he let her}} remain there with her head upon his breast.|$|R
60|$|The brig {{remained}} within Jim's {{range of}} vision but <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer,</b> {{and when she}} disappeared entirely he threw himself on a locker, trying to stifle with its cushion the sobs which convulsed him.|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> Midwinter {{maintained}} his hold, {{and in that}} moment he decided what to do.|$|E
60|$|By and by, {{he paused}} all at once; so suddenly, indeed, {{that my own}} cachinnation lasted <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her eyes rested <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> on his sturdy {{figure and}} his beautifully bronzed skin, {{then she turned}} to her companions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, no. So no more, ma'am. You do but harass yourself. Fare you well, my lady. If I may {{trespass}} for <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> {{upon the}} hospitality of Stretton House, I'll be your debtor." ...|$|R
60|$|Eustace lingered <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer,</b> before, heaving <b>a</b> deep sigh he {{returned}} to the hall, where he found Gaston and Ingram, just come in from attending to the horses, and Ralph hurrying the servants in setting out an ample meal for the travellers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I did mean it. But {{bear with me}} for <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> and you shall know all. It's a long story. Will you walk on, and--take my arm? You do not shrink from me, Miss Nott. Thank you. I {{scarcely}} deserve the kindness." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him through and through <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer.</b> Then, seeming {{satisfied}} with her scrutiny, {{she picked up her}} pail.|$|E
6000|$|GUNNER. Do {{you suppose}} I want to stay? Do you think I would breathe this {{polluted}} atmosphere <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> than I could help? ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer.</b> [...] "You're too particular!" [...] he rather oddly sounded, turning away with it to meet Mr. Longdon.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{versions}} of the legend, in another Roland's lover Alda was fated to die when {{the last of the}} sun’s rays shone on her so Roldan cut out part of the mountain in order that the sun would take longer to set ensuring that Alda would live <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{he waited}} <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> for the shoemaker, {{of whom he}} {{purchased}} a pair of top boots. Tucking his trousers into these, he had the satisfaction of knowing that he bore very {{little resemblance to the}} district messenger boy, who had left New York believing his destination to be Yonkers.|$|R
6000|$|He and the Colonel went before, {{and helped}} the ladies down the {{difficult}} descent. Irene seemed less sure-footed than the others; she clung to the young man's hand <b>an</b> imperceptible <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> than need be, or else he detained her. He found opportunity of saying, [...] "It's so pleasant seeing you again," [...] adding, [...] "all of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir. Please {{to look at}} your watch. You mustn't be with Miss Regina <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> than {{a quarter}} of an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby {{stood still}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> with a flush in his face. [...] "Nothing would stop that woman's talking--not even a gag. It's horribly unfortunate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} keep Mr. Trenchard <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> than is necessary," [...] said Wilding, giving {{no hint of}} the second meaning in his words.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} was," [...] replied George; [...] "but, {{at the same}} time, it is well to be sure. It will only take <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer,</b> and, since Ralph and I have got mixed up in this thing, I insist that you find out whether any one is there before you attempt {{to go into the}} hut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Say this {{to put you}} in {{the least}} out of your way, or make you stay <b>a</b> [...] <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> than your {{business}} requires; for a walk in the Park is [...] an excuse she uses for her health; and as she designs staying some [...] months in town, if she misses you one day she may have luck another.” ...|$|R
60|$|He saw Diogenes still {{standing}} there, waving his hat in farewell: for <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> his splendid figure stood out clearly against the flat grey landscape beyond, then slowly {{the veil of}} mist began to envelop him, at first only blurring the outline of his mantle or his sash, then it grew more dense and the sledge moved away more rapidly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me keep it <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer,</b> Sister Nightmare," [...] {{answered}} Scarecrow. [...] "I thought I had {{a glimpse}} of something behind that thick bush." ...|$|E
6000|$|He let {{her hand}} go. If {{he held it}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer,</b> {{and a little more}} firmly than was {{absolutely}} necessary, was he much to blame? ...|$|E
60|$|And Jerry, {{under this}} caressing {{hand of a}} god, albeit it did not wear pants, forgot for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> the fate that was upon him.|$|E
60|$|If his object were {{to prolong}} the {{conversation}} about Lynde, he was disappointed, for the old woman had turned abruptly to her work again and, though Alan lingered for <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer,</b> she took no further notice of him. But when he had gone she peered stealthily after him from the door until he was lost to sight among the pines.|$|R
60|$|Thus they {{remained}} for <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> side by side: she slightly above him, with head bent, with hot tears falling slowly from her downcast eyes, her heart well-nigh breaking with {{the consciousness of}} the irreparable; he somewhat below, silent too, and rigid, all passion, all emotion, love even, numbed momentarily by the violence, the suddenness of this terrible blow.|$|R
60|$|She waited <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two <b>longer,</b> {{then she}} quietly slipped down the broken stairs, wrapped her dark cloak closely round her and {{slipped out of}} the inn.|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> he {{reflected}} behind the mask as it were, then let go the door-handle {{and came back}} {{to the middle of the}} room.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must escape if we {{possibly}} can, Nellie," [...] said Dora. [...] "We cannot afford to remain <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer</b> on this houseboat than is necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet he knew in {{his heart}} that he was {{yielding}} to her, {{that he could not}} resist her <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longer.</b> What was this madness of love? ...|$|E
60|$|Lydie {{drew her}} cloak closely round her figure; though the August night {{was hot and}} heavy with the acrid scent of late summer flowers she felt an inward shivering, whilst her temples throbbed and her eyes seemed made of glowing charcoal. A few more rooms to traverse, <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> wherein to keep her {{trembling}} knees from giving way beneath her, {{and she would be}} in milor's rooms.|$|R
6000|$|Olive listened till he {{had done}} speaking; she stood <b>a</b> single <b>moment</b> <b>longer,</b> and then, without a word, a glance, she rushed into the house. Ransom saw that Miss Birdseye was {{immersed}} in her letters; so he went straight to Verena and stood before her, looking far into her eyes. He was not smiling now, {{as he had been}} in speaking to Olive. [...] "Will you come somewhere apart, where I can speak to you alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She rose to take leave, and Clara {{clung to}} her, {{emerging}} from the shade of her cabinet with colour little mitigated since her disappearance. James would have come with them, but was detained by Lady Conway for <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>longer</b> than it took them to put on their shawls; and Clara would not wait. She dragged Mary down the steps into the darkness, and groaned out, 'O Mary, he can never speak to me again!' ...|$|R
