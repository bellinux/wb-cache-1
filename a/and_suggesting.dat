5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} to discredit Patrick Darby by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> the murder was politically motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they knew of no hostility between Beauchamp and Sharp, and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.|$|E
5|$|Educar al soberano, a {{compilation}} of letters written from 1870 to 1886 {{on the topic of}} improved education, promoting <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> new reforms such as secondary schools, parks, sporting fields and specialty schools. This compilation was met with far greater success than Ortografía, Instrucción Publica and received greater public support.|$|E
5|$|A third {{possibility}} is {{the involvement of}} a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars, point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E

5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|Millen {{stood for}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade {{candidate}} for Bourke in 1891, but was defeated; he contested the seat again in 1894 and won. He {{became known as}} a strong advocate for land reform, urging changed pastoral conditions <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> additional government assistance to deal with Australia's dry climate, particularly during the 1890s drought.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{addresses}} {{magic in}} Book XXX. He {{is critical of}} the Magi, attacking astrology, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health.

He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E

5|$|The DOB {{spread to}} Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and The Ladder {{was mailed to}} hundreds—eventually thousands—of DOB members {{discussing}} the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging {{the idea that it}} was a sickness, with readers offering their own reasons why they were lesbians, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> ways to cope with the condition or society's response to it. British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{received}} the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, {{stating that the}} sculptor's models were in too high relief, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that Ortmayer come to the mint to discuss the matter. A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece {{were expected to be}} tested by coining trial strikes in early July.|$|E

5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{her death}} four years prior, the Swedish {{mathematician}} Gösta Mittag-Leffler considered nominating her for the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, and wrote to Shapley requesting more information on her work on Cepheid variables, offering to send her his monograph on Sofia Kovalevskaya. Shapley replied, letting Mittag-Leffler know that Leavitt had died, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the true credit belonged to his (Shapley's) interpretation of her findings. She was never nominated, because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his accepted impending death <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that they may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War to an end <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> the possibility of {{his return to the}} country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E
5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, {{pointing out that}} Champollion {{had never been to}} Egypt <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than the church-sanctioned chronology according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, MacArthur {{met with}} Curtin and {{detailed}} {{his plans for}} the Western New Guinea campaign, explaining that he would assume direct command of land forces when he reached the Philippines, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that Blamey could either go with him as an army commander, or remain in Australia as Commander in Chief. The new organisation went into effect in September 1944, with Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth US Army, Lieutenant General Robert Eichelberger's Eighth United States Army, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee's First Australian Army, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead's I Australian Corps and Major General Oscar Griswold's XIV Corps reporting directly to GHQ. Allied Land Forces remained as an important administrative and logistical command, until it was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E

5|$|In a {{television}} report taped and broadcast {{shortly after the}} bombing, Tuđman said that the attack {{appears to have been}} meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia, and as a decapitation strike. He concluded with statements of resolve to end foreign occupation and rebuild the nation. Marković telephoned his office in Belgrade blaming Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević for the attack. He demanded his resignation, threatening not to return to Belgrade until Kadijević was out of office. The Yugoslav Defence Ministry brushed away the accusation, claiming that the attack was not authorized by the central command <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the event might have been stage-managed by the Croatian authorities. The Yugoslav military later suggested that Croatian leadership planted plastic explosives in the Banski dvori.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, {{although he did not}} say how he distinguished them: one composed of T. horridus, T. prorsus, and T. brevicornus; the other of T. elatus and T. calicornis. Two species (T. serratus and T. flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of T. obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and T. elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{eleventh}} century BC, Mari became part of Hana whose king Tukulti-Mer took the title king of Mari and rebelled against Assyria, causing the Assyrian king Ashur-bel-kala to attack the city. Mari came firmly under the authority of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was assigned {{in the first half of}} the 8th century BC to a certain Nergal-Erish to govern under the authority of king Adad-Nirari III (reigned 810–783 BC). In c. 760 BC, Shamash-Risha-Usur, an autonomous governor ruling parts of the upper middle Euphrates under the nominal authority of Ashur-dan III, styled himself the governor of the lands of Suhu and Mari, so did his son Ninurta-Kudurri-Usur. However, by that time, Mari was known to be located in the so-called Land of Laqe, making it unlikely that the Usur family actually controlled it, <b>and</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the title was employed out of historical reasons. The city continued as a small settlement until the Hellenistic period before disappearing from records.|$|E
