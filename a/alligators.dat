5|$|American <b>alligators</b> will {{occasionally}} prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American <b>alligators</b> {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American <b>alligators</b> have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American <b>alligators</b> have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E
5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American <b>alligators</b> intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American <b>alligators</b> killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American <b>alligators</b> killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American <b>alligators</b> in the United States since 1970.|$|E
5|$|Domestic American <b>alligators</b> {{range from}} long and slender to short and robust, {{possibly}} due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. American <b>alligators</b> have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the lower teeth which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult American <b>alligators</b> may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|E

50|$|The main {{products}} of <b>alligator</b> hunting are <b>alligator</b> meat and skin. <b>Alligator</b> skins have been harvested since the 1800s. <b>Alligator</b> skin {{was used in}} the manufacture of boots, belts, and saddles. In the early 1900s some states began the commercial tanning of <b>alligator</b> skin. The increased popularity of <b>alligator</b> leather lead to the rise of <b>alligator</b> farming, now a $60 million industry. Following the global economic recession of 2008, demand for wild <b>alligator</b> skins declined dramatically. In the state of Louisiana the number of reported skins dropped from 35,625 to 9,139 in one year.|$|R
5|$|Some American <b>alligators</b> {{are missing}} an {{inhibited}} gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These American <b>alligators</b> are extremely rare and almost impossible {{to find in the}} wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|E
5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American <b>alligators</b> eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of this unexpected part of the American alligator diet further reveals that American <b>alligators</b> {{may be responsible for}} spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat. Additionally, American <b>alligators</b> engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{margins are}} habitat for the {{threatened}} American crocodile. The construction {{of miles of}} cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals' warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and American <b>alligators</b> both occur in extreme southern Florida, <b>alligators</b> are uncommon in Biscayne, since <b>alligators</b> mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne's somewhat saltier estuarine waters.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a Miocene fossil <b>alligator's</b> skull {{was found}} at Marion County, Florida. Unlike the other extinct <b>alligator</b> species of in the same genus, the fossil skull was {{virtually}} indistinguishable {{from that of the}} modern American <b>alligator.</b> This <b>alligator</b> and the American <b>alligator</b> are now considered to be sister taxa, meaning that the <b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis lineage has existed in North America for over 8 million years.|$|R
50|$|Biological {{pest control}} agents now in use to reduce <b>alligator</b> weed infestations include the <b>alligator</b> weed flea beetle (Agasicles hygrophila), the <b>alligator</b> weed thrips (Amynothrips andersoni), and the <b>alligator</b> weed stem borer (Arcola malloi).|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese <b>alligator</b> (<b>Alligator</b> sinensis) ( [...] , yáng zǐ è), {{also known}} as the Yangtze <b>alligator,</b> is one of two known living species of <b>Alligator,</b> a genus in the family Alligatoridae. This {{critically}} endangered species is endemic to eastern China.|$|R
5|$|<b>Alligators</b> {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The <b>alligators</b> then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole.|$|E

5|$|American <b>alligators</b> are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They play an {{important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American <b>alligators</b> bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American <b>alligators</b> use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E

5|$|American <b>alligators</b> {{are less}} {{vulnerable}} to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American <b>alligators</b> are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American <b>alligators</b> stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|American <b>alligators</b> are {{recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. <b>Alligators</b> are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and <b>alligators</b> into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|American <b>alligators</b> {{have been}} {{documented}} using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American <b>alligators</b> are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E

5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American <b>alligators,</b> however, feed heavily on nutria, so American <b>alligators</b> may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American <b>alligators</b> that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is considered}} an apex predator throughout its range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both the size and age of the American alligator and the size and availability of prey. Most American <b>alligators</b> will eat {{a wide variety of}} animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms. As they grow, American <b>alligators</b> gradually expand to larger prey. Once an American alligator reaches adulthood, any animal living in the water or coming to the water to drink is potential prey, due to the size and power of the American alligator. However, most animals captured by American <b>alligators</b> are considerably smaller than the American alligator itself. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons {{are some of the most}} commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced coypu are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult American <b>alligators,</b> although only larger adult American <b>alligators</b> commonly eat this species. Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral wild boars, but these are not normally part of the diet. Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults. Water birds, such as herons and egrets, storks, waterfowl and large dabbling rails such as gallinules or coots, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by American <b>alligators,</b> but most predation on bird species occur with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer as the prey of American <b>alligators,</b> as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water's edge.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{unregulated}} hunting {{has led to}} dramatic {{decreases in}} <b>alligator</b> populations. In 1973 the American <b>alligator</b> was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

5|$|The diet {{of adult}} American <b>alligators</b> from central Florida lakes was {{dominated}} by fish, highly opportunistically based upon local availability. In Lake Griffin, fish made up 54% of the diet by weight, with catfish being most commonly consumed while in Lake Apopka, fish made up 90% {{of the food and}} mostly shad were taken and in Lake Woodruff the diet was 84% fish and largely consists of bass and sunfish. Unusually in these regions, reptiles and amphibians were the most important non-piscivore prey, mostly comprised by turtles and water snakes. In southern Louisiana, crustaceans (largely crayfish and crabs) were found to be present in the southeastern American <b>alligators</b> but largely absent in the southwestern American alligator which consumed a relatively high proportion of reptiles, although fish were the most recorded prey for adult American <b>alligators</b> and adult males consumed a large portion of mammals. In East Texas, diets were diverse and adult American <b>alligators</b> took mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates (i.e. snails) in often equal measure as they did fish.|$|E
5|$|American <b>alligators</b> {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken {{identity}} leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American <b>alligators</b> are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
