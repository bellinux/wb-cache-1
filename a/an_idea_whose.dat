25|$|Fyodor Sologub was {{the first}} writer to {{introduce}} the morbid, pessimistic elements characteristic of fin de siècle literature and philosophy into Russian prose.

His next large prose work, A Created Legend (a trilogy consisting of Drops of Blood, Queen Ortruda, and Smoke and Ash), contained many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive and hopeful view of the world.|$|E

25|$|Foote was {{enthusiastic}} {{about the prospect of}} using gunboats for reconnaissance, and promptly made preparations in January, 1863 to further navigate the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. The idea of using gunboats for river reconnaissance was before this time <b>a</b> novel <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> tactics were not thoroughly tested, and it was important to make careful reconnaissance trips, without arousing any suspicion of what was being planned. It was also uncertain how ironclads would fare against land-batteries at close range.

In this paper we develop a notion of expanding space that is completely valid as a framework for the description of the evolution of the universe and whose application allows an intuitive understanding of the influence of universal expansion. We also demonstrate how arguments against the concept in general have failed thus far, as they imbue expanding space with physical properties not consistent with the expectations of general relativity...|$|R
50|$|In common usage in the 21st century, a {{hypothesis}} refers to <b>a</b> provisional <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> merit requires evaluation.

In due course, a confirmed hypothesis may {{become part of a}} theory or occasionally may grow to become a theory itself. Normally, scientific hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model. Sometimes, but not always, one can also formulate them as existential statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon under examination has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.|$|R
