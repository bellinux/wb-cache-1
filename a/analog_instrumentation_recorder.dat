A tape dropout is defined in the Telemetry Standards as “a reproduced signal of abnormally 1 low amplitude caused by tape imperfections severe enough to produce a data error” Bit errors were chosen as the measure of data quality. Signals were recorded on several tracks of a wideband <b>analog</b> <b>instrumentation</b> magnetic tape <b>recorder.</b> The tape tracks were 50 mils wide.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaAlthough {{magnetic}} recording devices employing rotary head technology {{have been around}} for many years, specific products were not developed with the bit error performance to satisfy the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>recorder</b> needs of the telemetry community. Only recently have a number of new products and new product development programs materialized which offer positive indications that telemetry systems will soon benefit from the higher data rates and storage capacities. The lack of standards in development of rotary head technology has led to development of a variety of design approaches by various manufacturers and system designers. If this trend continues, the telemetry community will not enjoy the media compatibility which has contributed so much {{to the success of the}} IRIG <b>instrumentation</b> <b>recorder.</b> The ability to remove a tape recorded on one vendors recorder and replay the tape on a different ground station containing a second vendors recorder is a capability that should be retained with the advent of the new machines.

40|$|A report {{discusses}} the continuing {{development of a}} scalable multiprocessor computing system for hard real-time applications aboard a spacecraft. "Hard realtime applications" signifies applications, like real-time radar signal processing, in which the data to be processed are generated at "hundreds" of pulses per second, each pulse "requiring" millions of arithmetic operations. In these applications, the digital processors must be tightly integrated with <b>analog</b> <b>instrumentation</b> (e. g., radar equipment), and data input/output must be synchronized with <b>analog</b> <b>instrumentation,</b> controlled to within fractions of a microsecond. The scalable multiprocessor is a cluster of identical commercial-off-the-shelf generic DSP (digital-signal-processing) computers plus generic interface circuits, including analog-to-digital converters, all controlled by software. The processors are computers interconnected by high-speed serial links. Performance can be increased by adding hardware modules and correspondingly modifying the software. Work is distributed among the processors in a parallel or pipeline fashion {{by means of a}} flexible master/slave control and timing scheme. Each processor operates under its own local clock; synchronization is achieved by broadcasting master time signals to all the processors, which compute offsets between the master clock and their local clocks...|$|R

25|$|Limited amateur radio {{operations}} have occurred, using moon bounce or Earth–Moon–Earth communication, in which radio signals {{aimed at the}} Moon are reflected back to Earth. The first of these operations was on June 13–14, 1964, using the call KP4BPZ. A dozen or so two-way contacts were made on 144 and 432MHz. On July 3 and July 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432MHz during the limited time slots available. For these tests, a very wide-band <b>instrumentation</b> <b>recorder</b> captured {{a large segment of}} the receiving bandwidth, enabling later verification of other amateur station callsigns. These were not two-way contacts. From April 16–18, 2010, again, the Arecibo Amateur Radio Club KP4AO conducted moon-bounce activity using the antenna.|$|R

50|$|Contact Stylus {{technology}} utilizes a touch-probe to {{ride along}} the tire surface as it rotates. <b>Analog</b> <b>instrumentation</b> senses {{the movement of}} the probe, and records the run-out waveform. When used to measure radial runout, the stylus is fitted to a large-area paddle that can span the voids in the tread pattern. When used to measure lateral runout on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The contact stylus method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance. The small area-of-interest in the sidewall area limits the effectiveness in discerning sidewall bulges and depressions elsewhere on the sidewall.|$|R
