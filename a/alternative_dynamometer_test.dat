40|$|Abstract: In this paper, some vehicle models {{used for}} <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> bench are put forward to adapt {{different}} performance tests of two-axle vehicle. Firstly, the vehicle driving model with two {{degrees of freedom}} is established by analyzing the force condition of a moving vehicle. And it can be used in performance tests which do not need complex road condition, such as acceleration test. Secondly, considering pitching motion of vehicle, the driving model with three degrees of freedom is proposed and applied to performance tests which need complex road condition, like thermal balance test or road simulation experiment. Finally, in order to do steering performance <b>test</b> in <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> bench, the driving model is modified by considering the influence caused by steering and combines steering model to become a whole steering model of vehicle.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF John Goodloe, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Mechanical Engineering, {{presented}} on April 13, 2016, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: STANDARDIZED SUB-SCALE DYNAMOMETER SCALING METHOD FOR 	 	 TRANSIT AND FREIGHT TRAIN APPLICATIONS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Peter Filip 	Dynamometers are machines {{that are used}} in several industries for measuring force, torque, or power of a mechanism. These devices are in fact very useful in the friction material industry. Friction materials are created and then <b>tested</b> on <b>dynamometers</b> to analyze physical properties such as the dynamic coefficient of friction of the material based upon its retarding force against the wheel or disc, which is mounted to the dynamometer drive shaft. <b>Dynamometer</b> <b>testing</b> is expensive and often time consuming. Sub-scale dynamometers may be used to reduce cost, time, and material use while providing similar test results by implementing a proper scaling method. There are several scaling methods, but this approach will use surface analysis and the energy dispersed per surface contact area strategy to verify the testing conditions of both sub-scale and full scale testing. Since lab analysis costs are expensive, the project budget is restricted to analyzing the maximum of 1 full-scale disc and pad specimen and 2 subscale disc and pad sets. The test results are expected to prove that when the surface conditions of the analyzed specimens agree to each other, the <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> results will also agree. Due to restrictions with budget and time the fastest and most effective way to test this hypothesis is by creating the baseline on the full-scale and then adjusting the scaling on the subscale dynamometer until similar results are given. Once similar <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> results are obtained, the material specimens can be analyzed in the lab. Testing will continue as long as necessary, and if the expected results are not obtained, the results will still be tested for analysis and compared to the baseline. The results are expected to show that two separate machines may provide similar surface conditions for testing, as well as similar <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> results for any given friction material. However, if the expected results cannot be obtained, then it may still prove that without matching the surface layer conditions while <b>testing,</b> the <b>dynamometers</b> recorded <b>test</b> results will not match either, which is in agreeance with the hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Unintended gearbox {{failures}} have {{a significant}} impact on the cost of wind farm operations. In 2007, NREL initiated the Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC). The project combines analysis, field <b>testing,</b> <b>dynamometer</b> <b>testing,</b> condition monitoring, and the development and population of a gearbox failure database in a multi-pronged approach to determine why wind turbine gearboxes do not achieve their expected design life. The collaborative of manufacturers, owners, researchers, and consultants focuses on gearbox testing and modeling and the development of a gearbox failure database. Collaborative members also investigate gearbox condition monitoring techniques. Data gained from the GRC will enable designers, developers, and manufacturers to improve gearbox designs and testing standards and create more robust modeling tools. GRC project essentials include the development of two identical, heavily instrumented representative gearbox designs. Knowledge gained from the field and <b>dynamometer</b> <b>tests</b> conducted on these gearboxes builds an understanding of how the selected loads and events translate into bearing and gear response.
