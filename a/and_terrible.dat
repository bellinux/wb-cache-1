5|$|At {{the start}} of the siege, Gibraltar was garrisoned by around 2,000 Dutch, English, Austrian and pro-Habsburg Spanish troops facing a besieging force of up to 8,000 French, pro-Bourbon Spanish and Irish troops. The {{defenders}} were able to hold off the numerically superior besieging force through exploiting Gibraltar's geography and the small town's fortifications, though they were frequently short of manpower and ammunition. The besiegers were undermined by disputes between the French and Spanish officers <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> conditions in their trenches and bastions, which led to outbreaks of epidemic disease and undermined morale. Sea power proved crucial, as the French navy sought unsuccessfully to prevent the Grand Alliance shipping in fresh troops, ammunition and food. Three naval battles were fought during the siege, two of which were clear defeats for the French and the last of which resulted in the siege being abandoned as hopeless after nine months of fruitless shelling. The outcome was disastrous for the French and Bourbon Spanish side, which was said to have lost 10,000 men against only 400 for the Grand Alliance.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the Hundred Years' War, {{the town}} was {{alternately}} occupied by the English and French causing {{the inhabitants of the}} town enormous suffering. They were tested by excessive taxes <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> epidemics. Over the decades, the region was devastated by looting, epidemics and wolves. The city thus appealed to the King of France twice, in 1406 and in 1415.|$|E

25|$|The Frogs Who Desired a King is a fable, {{attributed}} to Aesop. The Frogs prayed to Zeus {{asking for a}} King. Zeus set up a log to be their monarch. The Frogs protested they wanted a fierce <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> king, not a mere figurehead. So Zeus sent them a Stork to be their king. The new king hunted and devoured his subjects.|$|E
25|$|In early January, Yudenich {{secretly}} {{left its}} winter quarters and marched towards the major Ottoman fort at Erzurum. The winter is not normally {{a time for}} military activity {{in this part of}} the world. The bitter cold <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> roads contributed greatly to the annihilation of Enver Pasha's 3rd Army in the previous year. The Russian General Yudenich viewed this as an opportunity to take the Ottomans by surprise. The Russians achieved total surprise and destroyed an Ottoman division that was in winter quarters at Battle of Koprukoy (January 10–18).|$|E
25|$|Between 21 and 24 September Yeltsin {{was confronted}} by popular unrest. The demonstrators were protesting the new <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> living {{conditions}} under Yeltsin. Since 1989 GDP had declined by half. Corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing, food and fuel were increasingly scarce and life expectancy was falling for all but a tiny handful of the population; moreover, Yeltsin was increasingly getting the blame. By early October, Yeltsin had secured the support of Russia's army and ministry of interior forces. In a massive show of force, Yeltsin called up tanks to shell the Russian White House, Russia's parliament building.|$|E

25|$|Neptuno put to sea on 1 February 1797 {{with the}} rest of Córdoba's fleet, {{consisting}} of 27 ships of the line, twelve frigates, one brig and several smaller craft. They sailed from Cartagena and passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on 5 February. Córdoba had orders to deliver a number of gunboats to Algeciras to support the bombardment of Gibraltar, safely escort a convoy of four urcas carrying mercury from Málaga to Cadiz, and then sail to Brest to link up with the French. The first part of the operation went smoothly, and Neptuno was detached with the 74-gun ships Bahama <b>and</b> <b>Terrible,</b> the 34-gun Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe to take the gunboats into Algeciras. Neptuno and Bahama remained at Algeciras, while Terrible sailed to rejoin Córdoba.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, minor {{actions were}} {{fought in the}} fortifications {{surrounding}} Bucharest between the invading Germans and the Romanian reserves which had failed to arrive and {{the remnants of the}} defenders of the Sereth–Putna line, yet it was occupied by the Germans on 6 December 1916, which was the same day that southern Romania capitulated, as the monarchy had fled to Iași. Heavy rain <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> roads were the only things that saved the remainder of the Romanian Army, which began to withdraw towards the Siret River and Russia, where the campaign drew to a close in January 1917. Romanian losses during the battle on the Argeș and the fighting that preceded it were very high, with about 300,000 being lost, around 150,000 of which were captured. In this same period, the Germans had suffered about 60,000 casualties.|$|E
25|$|In {{the region}} of Syrmia, people {{believed}} that dragons lived on high mountains and flew {{high in the sky}} shedding many sparks. Beneath them, in dense <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> clouds, flew gigantic winged serpentine demons called aždaja, which spewed hail on fields. A special man, called an oblačar, would fight against them and their associates. This name is derived from the noun oblak ("cloud"). The oblačar would rush directly beneath the dark clouds, as soon as he noticed that they were gathering above the fields of his village. There he would run to and fro, following the movement of the aždaja, at the same time waving his arms, or holding a stick raised {{in the direction of the}} cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. Sometimes he succeeded in preventing hail fall, and other times not, as was the case with an oblačar from Mirkovci. When the wind blew the clouds away from Mirkovci without a damage to its crops, this man would return from the fields and boast to the villagers of his persistence in warding off the hail bringers despite their ferocity. And when hail fell on the crops, he would humbly state that he did his best, but the adversaries flung themselves upon him with tenfold fierceness. The villagers believed and felt sorry for their oblačar, all drenched and bruised by hail. In autumn, he drove his cart from house to house in Mirkovci, receiving wheat from farmers for his struggle.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} {{characterized}} as a [...] "dramatic" [...] Bildungsroman with a [...] "big twist" [...] because the coming-of-age story is revealed to be the incorrect one: after being nurtured as a woman, Cal must instead learn to become a man. The book has [...] "twodistinct and occasionally warring halves". Whereas the first part is about hermaphrodites, the second is about Greeks. The latter half, [...] "full of incest, violence, <b>and</b> <b>terrible</b> family secrets", was considered by Daniel Mendelsohn, an author and critic, {{to be more effective}} because Middlesex is largely about how Callie inherited the momentous gene that [...] "ends up defining her indefinable life".|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare is also {{careful to}} make the {{distinction}} that Prospero presents himself as a rational, and not an occultist, magician. He does this by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax. Sycorax {{is said to have}} worshipped the devil and been full of [...] "earthy and abhored commands". She was unable to control Ariel, who was [...] "too delicate" [...] for such dark tasks. Prospero's rational goodness enables him to control Ariel where Sycorax can only trap him in a tree. Sycorax's magic is frequently described as destructive <b>and</b> <b>terrible,</b> where Prospero's is said to be wondrous and beautiful. Prospero seeks to set things right in his world through his magic, and once that is done, he renounces it, setting Ariel free.|$|E

500|$|On December 4, 2009 Terrible and Texano Jr. {{defeated}} No Limit in a Luchas de Apuesta hair vs. hair {{match that}} was the main event of CMLL's Sin Salida show. After the match both members of No Limit had their heads shaved completely bald per lucha libre traditions. On February 14, 2010 Texano Jr. <b>and</b> <b>Terrible</b> travelled to Japan to challenge No Limit for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but were not able to defeat No Limit in their home country. By virtue of holding the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship El Texano Jr. participated in the 2010 Universal Championship tournament. He was part of [...] "Block A" [...] that competed on the July 30, 2010 Super Viernes show. He co-won the eight-man seeding battle royal, and then won his first round match by defeating Ephesto. The second round was a rematch from the previous year's tournament, only this time La Sombra eliminated El Texano Jr. and not vice versa. On August 12, 2010, El Texano Jr.'s NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship was replaced with the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship after CMLL had received complaints from the National Wrestling Alliance. In October and November 2010, El Texano Jr. and El Terrible took part in New Japan's 2010 G1 Tag League. After victories over Takashi Iizuka and Toru Yano and No Limit, Texano Jr. <b>and</b> <b>Terrible</b> finished fifth in their block and didn't advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On December 14, 2010, El Texano Jr. lost the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship to Shocker.
