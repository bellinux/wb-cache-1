40|$|In the Czech Republic (CR) {{there are}} about 60 100 nonprofit nongovernmental organisations (NPO). They present quite big amount of {{potential}} customers, making use of various services which are needed for their function. In this paper offers of various kinds of services for NPO in the Czech Republic were analysed. Special offers of banks, insurance companies, post, phone and others were looked for. Mostly all services are offered with some discount for NPO. EBanka, <b>a.</b> s. <b>offers</b> <b>transparent</b> account without monthly fees. Postovni sporitelna and its mother bank Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a. s. offer account without monthly fees as well. Some companies have no special offers for NPO. Their offers are included in overture for companies and firms. They are not special financially advantageous for NPO. In case of Czech Post this {{can be caused by}} it’s monopol in the CR. On the other hand there are several telephone providers and none does offer anything special for NPO. It is possible to find some websites and internet domain providers, who offer their services with discount for NPO. They provide it without any tax allowance only for acquisition of more customers. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the absorption coefficient of <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> slab, which forms the outer layer of a roof/wall, on such factors as average thermal flux passing/through/a roof/wall, maximum and minimum values of this thermal flux and the thermal load levelling. It is seen that <b>a</b> non-completely <b>transparent</b> slab (non-zero absorption coefficient) performs slightly better than <b>a</b> completely <b>transparent</b> slab (zero absorption coefficient) for small thicknesses, as far as the average thermal flux through a roof/wall is concerned. <b>A</b> non-completely <b>transparent</b> slab with <b>an</b> absorption coefficient greater than 3 m- 1 is as effective as <b>a</b> completely <b>transparent</b> slab in introducing thermal load levelling. For both <b>a</b> non-completely <b>transparent</b> slab and <b>a</b> completely <b>transparent</b> slab, maximum, minimum and average values of the thermal flux increase with increasing thickness. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere are {{a variety}} of {{stakeholders}} involved with CCS, including the general public who may not have relevant scientific knowledge. Although CCS is an issue for everyone, only a few people have, or have access to knowledge that is required as a basis of rationally motivated consensus. In order to resolve the situation, a mechanism that allows efficient dissemination of knowledge and expedites discussion among the stakeholders is required. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a prototype of such a mechanism making use of information technologies and test it s practicality. The key strategy of the current study is to utilize information technology as a vehicle for disseminating knowledge of CCS and for expediting deliberation among interested individuals. More specifically, an “Internet forum” titled CO 2 -CoBW eb that is designated for issues concerning CCS has been formed by using JAVA -based collaborative software. CO 2 -CoBWeb offers a range of functionalities including, online consultation, online deliberative polling, online argumentation and online facilitati on. In February and March 2008, a community consisting of some thirty members consisting of experts and interested non-experts was formed and two series of dry runs were carried out. The results revealed that the “On -line deliberation” in an Internet forum can be useful in enhancing the interactions among the members that is an essential part of confidence building in the following perspectives; -Online consultation helps non-experts to acquire knowledge and experts to know what non-experts wish to know,-Online argumentation among the experts on topics selected by non-experts highlights key issues in <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> manner and <b>offers</b> opportunity for the members to evaluate their confidence based on the evidence referred to by the experts. -Online facilitation supported collaboration between experts and non-experts to identify set of requirements for building confidence of the “community”...|$|R
