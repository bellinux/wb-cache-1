5|$|When {{flying the}} Lithuanian flag with other flags, the {{following}} is the correct order of precedence: The national flag, the historical (state) flag, flags of foreign states, {{the flag of the}} European Union, international NGOs, the presidential standard, military and government standards, county flags, city flags and <b>any</b> <b>others.</b> When foreign flags are used alongside the Lithuanian flag, the flags are sorted according to their countries' names in the Lithuanian language. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Lithuanian dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The European Union flag has been hoisted since Lithuania {{became a member of the}} organization. While not mentioned by name in the law, the flag of NATO can be used in Lithuania, since it belongs to that organization as well. It is also common to fly the flags of Estonia and Latvia during certain occasions, mainly the celebration of independence of the three Baltic states. The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the National Flag and Other Flags governs the rules, use, protocol and manufacturing of the national and other flags used inside the country.|$|E
5|$|With Sam {{closing in}} on Lilith, Castiel and Zachariah imprison Dean within an idyllic waiting room, where he will be made {{comfortable}} until the time comes for him to play his role in stopping the Apocalypse. Dean refuses to remain idle, and continually requests {{to be able to}} see Sam, which is denied. Once Dean discovers the angels are allowing the Apocalypse to happen, he implores for Castiel to help him stop the final seal from being broken. Though Castiel refuses at first, he returns ready to help not long after. He takes Dean to see the prophet Chuck for information on Sam. Their presence does not fall in line with Chuck's Gospel, so the Archangel Raphael begins to descend. Castiel sends Dean to Sam, remaining behind to hold back the archangel and <b>any</b> <b>others</b> who might come. He is subsequently killed, with his host's body being blown to pieces.|$|E
