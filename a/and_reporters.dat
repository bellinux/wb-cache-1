5|$|The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or {{freedom of the}} press. The author analyzes {{the impact of this}} clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that freedom of the press would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens <b>and</b> <b>reporters</b> merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E
