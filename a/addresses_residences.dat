40|$|One of the {{greatest}} threats to coral reefs of the Hawaiian Islands is sedimentation from land-based sources. Sedimentation occurs when runoff from storm events carries terrigenous sediments into the marine environment. Once in the marine environment it increases turbidity and eventually settles onto the coral, effectively smothering it. The severity of sedimentation depends {{on the type of}} sediment, the sediment load, and the residence time of the sediment. Land use that results in exposed soil, such as development, causes an increase in sedimentation. Because sedimentation begins on land, the policies addressing it must also be focused on the land. Current land use policy in Maui does not effectively address sedimentation, as it only tries to minimize the total sediment load. Land use policy does not <b>address</b> <b>residence</b> time of the sediment. Residence time is limited by wave exposure. Where wave exposure is higher, sediment is removed faster, thus having less impact on the coral. In order to effectively limit the impact of sedimentation, there must be spatially explicit land use regulations that require sediment filtration, density restriction, increased limits to total exposed soil, impervious surface restrictions, while encouraging habitat restoration and open space preservation, in areas where wave exposure is low. To better understand spatial and temporal variations in wave exposure in Maui, I created a GIS-based model of nearshore wave exposure. Using a model such as the one described here to identify critical areas that are more susceptible to sedimentation could result in more effective management of Maui’s reefs...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Evidence {{is growing}} on {{association}} between exposure to road traffic noise and health effects, in particular cardiovascular and myocardial infarction (MI). The ongoing study aims {{to evaluate the}} association between MI incidence and residential exposure to road traffic noise by a case control (CC) study, on current data. Methods: Mortality and hospitalization data (1998 - 2006) {{have been used to}} obtain cases of first MI incidence in 2002 - 2006 through a validated algorithm. Five controls will be matched to each case by gender, age and a deprivation index (DI), based on 2001 census. Residential <b>address,</b> <b>residence</b> length and geographical coordinates come from Municipality archives. Road traffic noise exposure have been estimated at the buildings façades from Pisa noise map built by Environmental Protection Agency of Tuscany Region according to new acoustic indicators and interim methods issued by European Directive 2009 / 49 /CE. Results: The CC study is ongoing. 823 MI cases (age 35 + years) have been identified in 2002 - 2006 with the aim to analyze also the last- residence noise exposure length. Preliminary analyses of MI cases on residents, living in the same building (769 different buildings) on the same year, estimated incidence rates, direcly standardized by age and DI, computed by sex and night noise levels (< 50 dB; 50 - 54 dB; 55 + dB). The rate ratios vs the lowest noise level were 1. 14 at 50 - 54 dB, 1. 33 at 55 + dB among men while were respectively 1. 12 and 1. 06 among women. Conclusions: Preliminary results confirm, in men, the presence of an association between first MI occurrence and high leves of nocturnal traffic noise exposure at residence place. The ongoing CC study will consider the residence length and will try to evaluate the confoundig effect of air pollution exposure by means of traffic characterization (veichles number, pedestrian area, vicinity to airport,railway etc) in the road of residence...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Asthma is a {{multifactorial disease}} {{and a serious}} public health problem. Environmental factors and poverty are the main {{determinants}} of this disease. Objective: To describe the spatial and temporal distribution of asthma-related hospitalizations and identify the areas with the highest prevalence of and vulnerability to severe asthma in a major Brazilian city. Methods: An ecological study of hospitalizations for asthma from 2002 to 2012, {{in children and adolescents}} under 15 years of age, living in Belo Horizonte, Southeast Brazil. All events were geocoded by <b>residence</b> <b>address</b> using Hospital Information System data. The socioeconomic vulnerability of <b>residence</b> <b>address</b> was ranked using the Health Vulnerability Index. Raster surfaces were generated and time-series plots were constructed to determine spatial and time trends in the frequency of asthma-related hospitalizations, respectively. Results: Asthma-related hospitalization rates were highest in children aged 0 – 4 years and in boys. There was a decreasing trend in the number of asthma-related hospitalizations across the study period. Approximately 48 % of all hospitalizations were children living in health vulnerable areas. Seasonal trends showed a hospitalization peak in March, April, and May, coinciding with the post-rainy period. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that social and environmental factors may be determinants of disparities in severe asthma...|$|R
50|$|According to Polish law, the {{registration}} plate {{is tied to}} the vehicle, not the owner. There is no possibility for the owner to keep the licence number for use on a different car, even if it's a custom number. The licence plates are issued by the powiat (county) of the vehicle owner's registered <b>address</b> of <b>residence,</b> {{in the case of a}} natural person. If it is owned by a legal person, the place of registration is determined by the address of its seat. Vehicles leased under operating leases and many de facto finance leases will be registered at the seat of the lessor. When a vehicle changes hands, the new owner must apply for new vehicle registration document bearing his or her name and registered address. The new owner may obtain a new licence plate although it is not necessary when new owner's <b>residence</b> <b>address</b> lies in the same area as the previous owner's. In such a situation the licence plates are usually carried over to the new owner, because the change carries an additional cost. Upon purchasing a vehicle from another person, if the vehicle has an EU plate, the new owner must replace it with a license for their address and area, and give the EU plate to their powiat plate mint to free up numbers in the future. If the car has a pre- May 1, 2006 plate, the owner is free to do whatever they wish with it, as long as it's legal with the Polish law. The plaque cannot be replaced if destroyed. The change of the whole set is required.|$|R
