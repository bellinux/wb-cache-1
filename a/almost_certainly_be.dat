5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E
5|$|Only three Milky Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in the Milky Way, and that any galactic supernova would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> detected.|$|E

25|$|Mulroney's {{approval}} ratings declined and by 1993 opinion polls showed that his Progressive Conservative Party would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> {{defeated by the}} Liberals under Chrétien in the election due that year. Mulroney announced his retirement in February, and was succeeded by Minister of National Defence Kim Campbell in June. Campbell managed to pull the PCs to within a few percentage points of the Liberals {{by the time the}} writs were dropped in September.|$|E
25|$|Turkish and {{international}} media speculated that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> the AKP's {{candidate for the}} Presidency. This was proven correct on 1 July when Erdoğan's candidacy was announced. Abdullah Gül, the outgoing President of Turkey elected in 2007 caused media speculation regarding a potential candidacy in January 2014. He {{announced that he would}} not stand on 29 June 2014. A full list of possible AKP candidates which at one point showed intentions of running for election is as follows.|$|E

25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child {{and his or her}} family, antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the weather improved, but {{thoughts}} of attempting the summit were quickly abandoned when Art Gilkey collapsed just outside his tent. Houston diagnosed him as suffering from thrombophlebitis - blood clots which would be dangerous at sea level, but would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> fatal at 7800m. The whole team was now forced into {{a desperate attempt to}} save him. While they believed that there was little or no chance of saving him, the possibility of abandoning him was never discussed. However, the unacceptable avalanche risk followed by a renewal of the storm prevented a descent at that time, and the team remained at Camp VIII for several more days {{in the hope that the}} weather would improve.|$|E
25|$|Chalk and Jonassohn {{argued that}} the {{deportation}} of the Cherokee tribe along the Trail of Tears would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> considered an act of genocide today. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 led to the exodus. About 17,000 Cherokees—along with approximately 2,000 Cherokee-owned black slaves—were removed from their homes. The {{number of people who}} {{died as a result of}} the Trail of Tears has been variously estimated. American doctor and missionary Elizur Butler, who made the journey with one party, estimated 4,000 deaths. Historians David Stannard and Barbara Mann have noted that the army deliberately routed the march of the Cherokee to pass through areas of known cholera epidemic, such as Vicksburg. Stannard estimates that during the forced removal from their homelands, following the Indian Removal Act signed into law by President Andrew Jackson in 1830, 8000 Cherokee died, about half the total population.|$|E

5000|$|Kaspar Hauser {{fits into}} the {{contemporary}} European image of the [...] "wolf child" [...] (despite {{the fact that he}} <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not one), and he became possibly the best-known example of the genre. As a result, his story inspired numerous works.|$|R
25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the park's high plant species richness is its location at the confluence of several diverse and unique floristic regions: the tropical Amazon lowlands and pampas {{to the north and}} southeast, the subantarctic high Andes and altiplano to the west and southwest, the subtropical Tucumano-Boliviano forests to the south (these forests do not actually reach Amboró but many of their constituent species occur within the park), and the semiarid inter-Andean valleys and wet-tropical yungas forests that characterize the eastern slopes of the central Bolivian Andes. Due to the difficulty of the terrain and the almost complete lack of infrastructure throughout the park, much of it has never been botanically surveyed, and it is essentially beyond doubt that many more plant species await discovery within the park's more remote regions. The high rates of endemism throughout the tropical Andes (Amboró is no exception) suggest quite strongly {{that at least some of}} the undocumented plant species yet to be discovered within Amboró will <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> Amboró endemics that are currently unknown to science.|$|E
25|$|King Charles II of Spain finally died on 1 November 1700. Louis XIV now faced {{a dilemma}} which he himself {{recognised}} as intractable. If he forbade the Duke of Anjou {{to accept the}} Spanish thrones and instead adhered to the Second Partition Treaty — which Leopold I had refused to sign and the Spanish had refused to recognise — Archduke Charles would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> acknowledged as the King of Spain and all its dominions, as stipulated in Charles II's last will {{in the event of}} refusal by the Duke of Anjou. The Austrian Habsburgs would accrue enormous power while France would gain nothing, and war with both Spain and Austria would be inevitable. Accepting the will of Charles II would also mean war with Leopold I, but in this case France would be allied with Spain defending rights recognised in the Spanish Monarchy. In any event the French king surmised that the Maritime Powers — anxious themselves for peace — would be either neutral or only half-heartedly involved, so long as the French and Spanish crowns were not united. With this reasoning, Louis XIV decided to accept Charles II's last testament, and sent his grandson to Madrid to reign there as King Philip V of Spain.|$|E
25|$|Some pros {{always had}} {{problems}} with how the ABA decided its number one pros for the year {{going back to the}} 1979 season. The biggest complaint that it was canted to have the points work out so that the number one pro would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> decided going into the ABA's Grand National in November with the lion's share of the points being doled out then (the points that were earned was {{the amount of money that}} was earned through the year. At that time the ABA AA pro who won the most money was declared No. 1 pro). The pros claimed that this benefited the ABA since it meant an exciting finish to the season, but it was detrimental to the pros in that a season of consistent wins and near wins could be undone by having an off day and/or a normally inconsistent rider having a great day and capturing the number one plate. Other issues like a bigger pro purse and that the purse be spread out over eight places instead of the top four at ABA Nationals which would ensure anyone making the pro main would get a share of the winnings were also a factor. The claim was while NBL, NBA and independent promotional races' purses have gone up over the years, the ABA's purses had remained relatively stagnant.|$|E

500|$|Response to MOBA's {{opening and}} {{continued}} success is, for some, evocative {{of the way}} art is treated in society. MOBA works {{have been described as}} [...] "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of Ed Wood. Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In Gullible's Travels, Cash Peters [...] contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as Southern California's Getty Museum; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> thrown out.|$|E
500|$|Wihtred {{emerged from}} this disarray and became king {{in the early}} 690s. [...] Bede {{describes}} his accession by {{saying that he was}} the [...] "rightful" [...] king, and that he [...] "freed the nation from foreign invasion by his devotion and diligence". [...] Oswine was also of the royal family, and arguably had a claim to the throne; hence {{it has been suggested that}} Bede's comments here are strongly partisan. Bede's correspondent on Kentish affairs was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury, and these views can <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> ascribed to the Church establishment there.|$|E
500|$|Alleging Taft {{had stolen}} the nomination, Roosevelt and his {{followers}} formed the Progressive Party. Taft knew he would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> defeated, but concluded that through Roosevelt's loss at Chicago the party had been preserved as [...] "the defender of conservative government and conservative institutions." [...] He made his doomed run to preserve the Republican Party. Governor Woodrow Wilson was the Democratic nominee. [...] Seeing Roosevelt as the greater electoral threat, Wilson spent little time attacking Taft, arguing that Roosevelt had been lukewarm in opposing the trusts during his presidency, and that Wilson was the true reformer. Taft contrasted what he called his “progressive conservatism” with Roosevelt’s Progressive democracy, which to Taft represented “the establishment of a benevolent despotism.” ...|$|E

500|$|Squires, {{charged with}} assault and theft, and Wells, with [...] "well-knowing" [...] what her {{accomplice}} had done, were tried on 21February at the Session House of the Old Bailey.

The gallery was packed with interested spectators. [...] The charge of theft was extremely serious; the value of Canning's stays (about 10shillings) meant that if she was found guilty, Squires would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> hanged at the Tyburn Tree.|$|E
500|$|Broadwater noted, [...] "given the {{difficulty}} of the task he had set for himself, his stubborn independence, and his lack, by 1787, of any concern for his own political future, {{it is not surprising that}} he left Philadelphia at odds with the great majority of his fellow delegates". Madison recorded that Mason, believing that the convention had given his proposals short shrift in a hurry to complete its work, began his journey back to Virginia [...] "in an exceeding ill humor". Mason biographer Helen Hill Miller noted that before Mason returned to Gunston Hall, he was injured in body as well as spirit, due to an accident on the road. Word of Mason's opposition stance had reached Fairfax County even before the convention ended; most local sentiment was in favor of the document. Washington made a statement urging ratification, but otherwise remained silent, knowing he would <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> the first president.

Kasavin summarized it as [...] "a short, uninspired game that's yet another would-be imitator of Capcom's own Devil May Cry." [...] Matt Casamassina of IGN wrote that players will [...] "want to like" [...] the game, but that its [...] "design flaws and sloppy execution" [...] are impossible to overlook. He found it to be shallow and repetitive, and he wrote that its fast pace and [...] "unresponsive control setup" [...] combine to place the game [...] "at war with itself." [...] However, he believed that P.N.03 is [...] "not a disaster—merely a disappointment", and that it sits [...] "solidly in average country." [...] In a 2012 retrospective from Eurogamer, Chris Schilling called the game the outcast of Shinji Mikami's work, criticizing its plot and calling its control scheme its [...] "biggest obstacle". He later added [...] "if at times its appeal can be hard to pin down, that doesn't mean it should be so easily forgotten", mentioning the satisfaction of beating the bosses in the game.|$|E
