5|$|Air Hong Kong was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, {{which is a}} new variant of the Airbus A300-600F. This new variant has a cargo loading system capable of handling virtually every type of container and pallet, and <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> {{at the rear of}} the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E
50|$|These 2 rail buses saw {{a return}} to having only a driving {{position}} at one end only along with only having <b>a</b> <b>door</b> on one <b>side.</b> The <b>door</b> on these buses however was <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> <b>door</b> instead of the swing door on the previous rail buses.|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} <b>a</b> driver's <b>side</b> sliding <b>door,</b> the edge of the driver's door was extended rearward six inches (152 mm), as {{it was not possible to}} create <b>a</b> driver's <b>side</b> sliding <b>door</b> with the current body shell. When the Windstar was being designed in the early 1990s, Ford claimed that <b>a</b> driver's <b>side</b> sliding <b>door</b> was not noted as a key feature indicated by focus groups; also at that time, minivans with that feature had sold very poorly.|$|R

5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E

However, upon noticing police sirens, he retreated back inside the building and fired three more shots at fleeing moviegoers before committing suicide.|$|E
25|$|Abbate {{was allowed}} to enter his {{courtroom}} hearing through <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> in order to shield himself from the press. This generated controversy and allegations surfaced that the police ticketed the vehicles of news organizations and threatened reporters with arrest.

25|$|An {{end door}} boxcar {{includes}} swinging doors {{on one or}} (less commonly) both ends to facilitate the loading of automobiles or other objects not easily loaded through <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> These required clever engineering, as generally the ends of a boxcar provide the strength to carry the roof {{and to keep the}} structure stiff. This added cost, along with the difficulties of loading a rail car from the end, means they were less common than plain boxcars, although they usually also had side doors so they could be used as regular boxcars.|$|E

5000|$|An E-210 was at {{the first}} post war Paris Exhibition in late 1946. [...] Praga {{continued}} development and in 1947 produced the E-211. This used the more powerful, 105 hp (78 kW) Walter Minor 4-111 engines and had a central fin {{in addition to the}} endplates. It had the tricycle undercarriage of the later E-210, but was now described as a 4-5 seater and had better access, with <b>a</b> starboard <b>side</b> <b>door</b> opening onto the front seats and <b>a</b> port <b>side</b> <b>door</b> for the rear seat passengers. The door revisions brought in train some changes to the side glazing of the cabin. Fabric covering replaced the plywood of the E-210 as fin and tailplane covering.|$|R
25|$|The Twin Bonanza is an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever cabin monoplane initially {{powered by}} two wing-mounted Lycoming GO-435 piston engines {{each with a}} wooden two-bladed propeller.

To gain access to the door a retractable three-tread steps is used. The Twin Bonanza has a tricycle landing gear with the nose wheel retracting rearwards and the main landing gears retracting partially into the engine nacelles, this leaves the tire exposed to assist {{in the event of a}} wheels-up landing.|$|E
25|$|On 20 January, a {{majority}} of 57 MPs {{voted in favor of}} PD-backed Pavel Filip Government. During the parliamentary meeting, the Parliament building was surrounded by about 1,000 protesters that demanded the interruption of the vote. They broke <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> of the Parliament and entered the building, forcing the cordon of gendarmes. Many gendarmes offered no resistance, being dragged out of the device and giving up shields and batons. After several hours, police intervened in force, removing the protesters from the Parliament and cordoning the building off. 15 people, six protesters and nine gendarmes, suffered contusions after confrontations at Parliament. One of them was President of the Liberal Party, Mihai Ghimpu, who had his head broken, being hit by protesters while leaving the Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In June 1896, Ghenadie {{received}} {{an order from}} the Attorney General to vacate the Metropolitan's Palace. He objected, arguing that the Synod had broken the governing law, and stating that he would only leave if presented with a Royal Decree. As a consequence, Ghenadie {{was taken into custody}} by the authorities, driven out of the Palace through <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> and taken by Romanian Police carriage to Căldărușani Monastery, where his banishment came in effect. Reportedly, the prosecutors caused embarrassment when they also proceeded to evacuate Ghenadie's friends and supporters, including Conservative politico Lascăr Catargiu, out of the repossessed building. A while after, Carol signed a Royal Decree confirming his government's decision, and the interim leadership was left to a triumvirate of bishops: Partenie Clinceni, Iosif Naniescu, Gherasim Timuș.|$|E

25|$|A {{room on the}} {{northeast}} corner of {{the third floor of the}} Arsenal was made into a courtroom, and the prisoners were brought into the room through <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> which prevented them from passing by or being harassed by spectators. Surratt was given special considerations during the trial because of her illness and gender. In the courtroom, she sat apart from the other prisoners. Sources differ as to whether an armed guard sat on either side of her, like for other prisoners during the trial. While the others wore wrist and ankle manacles in the courtroom, she did not. She was also permitted a bonnet, fan, and veil to hide her face from spectators. As her illness worsened during the trial, she was moved to a larger and more comfortable prison cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{between the}} columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On {{them had been}} carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora {{had been dead for}} several years, as well as a many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the {{architrave}} was a repoussé medallion of Christ. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} in question, Bellamy made several harassing {{telephone}} calls, including one to the Natchez Trace Restaurant where Sadler and Sharpe were having dinner and drinks with two friends. That resulted in Sadler asking a bartender to telephone the police, who never responded. Bellamy later went to Sharpe's apartment complex {{and knocked on the}} door. Sadler exited through <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> On seeing Sadler, Bellamy fled to his van. It was at this time, Sadler testified, that he saw a flash of metal. Believing it to be a gun, he fired one shot. The bullet struck Bellamy right between the eyes, and he died several hours later in a Nashville hospital. It turned out that Bellamy was unarmed. According to court records, Sadler had then placed a handgun in Bellamy's van, presumably to strengthen his claim of self-defense. After a plea bargain, on June 1, 1979, Sadler was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the death of Lee Emerson Bellamy, and sentenced to from 4 to 5 years in prison. His legal team worked to lower the sentence, which a judge reduced to just 30 days in the county workhouse. He served 28 days. Sadler was sued for wrongful death by Bellamy's stepson, and was ordered to pay compensation of about $10,000.|$|E

25|$|The {{hull of the}} Fahd is of {{all-welded}} steel armor construction giving complete {{protection against}} attack by 7.62 mm caliber AP rounds and shell splinters. The vehicle is equipped with air conditioning. The driver sits {{at the front of}} the vehicle on the left side with the commander to the right. Both have forward observation via large bulletproof windows, which can be rapidly covered by an armored shutter hinged at the top, and <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> that opens to the front, featuring a window in its upper part that can also be covered by a shutter as well. Above the commander's position is a single-piece, rear-opening hatch cover. The driver has a forward-facing, roof-mounted day periscope, which can be replaced by a passive periscope for night driving. The troop compartment is at the rear of the hull with the infantry entering via a door in the rear, the upper part of which folds upwards and the lower part downwards to form a step. Over the top of the troop compartment are two rectangular roof hatches hinged in the center that can be locked vertically. The infantry sits on individual bucket seats down the center of the vehicle facing outwards. In either side of the troop compartment are four firing ports with a vision block above so that the troops can fire their weapons from within the vehicle. Either side of the rear door has a firing port with a vision block above. Optional equipment may be fitted on the vehicle, such as an NBC protection system and passive IR among others.|$|E
