25|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>pallet</b> {{capacity}} {{is measured by}} how many PMC-type LD7s (96 in × 125 in) can be stored. These pallets occupy approximately three LD3 positions (it occupies two positions of one row {{and half of the}} two positions of the following row) or four LD2 positions. PMCs can only be loaded in cargo compartments with large doors designed to accept them (small door compartments are container only).|$|E
50|$|The En Route {{configuration}} is {{a stand-alone}} DJC2 suite which enables the commander {{to establish and}} sustain effective command and control and situational awareness while traveling by air from the garrison headquarters to a deployed location. It provides 6 - 12 workstations, mounted to a special <b>aircraft</b> <b>pallet,</b> which allow operators to communicate, connect to two networks (one secure and one non-secure), and perform command and control functions while in flight on a C-130 or C-17 aircraft. Specially designed “roller carts” house the primary networking and communications equipment {{and at least one}} system administrator position to manage the network and communication interfaces. The En Route configuration can be marshaled from short-term storage and ready for aircraft installation within 3 hours of notification. The workstations are also operable on the ground, and onboard while the aircraft is on the flight line. The En Route configuration requires an external power source, such as power from the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The army Forward Surgical Team (FST) is {{a mobile}} {{surgical}} asset {{designed to provide}} life- and limb-saving combat surgery in remote and austere ter-rains. Operation EUFOR RDC in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2006 {{was the first one}} planned and conducted solely by the European Union Forces (EUFOR). The first two European FSTs reported in the present article were established by the Finnish Defence Forces. The Finnish FSTs were deployed for 4 months in Kinshasa. Three different deployment scenarios were trained; the equipments loaded on two trucks and carried by two C- 130 aircrafts, the equipments loaded on two <b>aircraft</b> <b>pallets</b> (no trucks) and carried by one C- 130 aircraft, and the equipment...|$|R

30|$|DALP-TS {{utilizes}} three search {{neighborhoods to}} traverse the solution space: (1) unload entire <b>aircraft,</b> (2) intra-aircraft <b>pallet</b> swap, and (3) inter-aircraft pallet swap. DALP-TS calls each neighborhood under specific strategic circumstances.|$|R
30|$|The DALP-TS {{solution}} representation assigns pallets {{to specific}} positions in available aircraft. By the US Air Force designation, each <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>pallet</b> position has a specific reference number. In aircraft {{with a single}} row of pallet positions, the numbering is sequential from nose to tail; in aircraft with parallel rows of pallet positions, the pallet position designation is 1 L, 1 R, 2 L, 2 R, etc. For example, in a C- 17 aircraft in the logistics configuration, 18 pallet positions exist; Fig.  2 graphically depicts this configuration. The pallet position closest to {{the nose of the}} aircraft on the left (port) side is designated 1 L, and the pallet adjacent to it is 1 R; the pallet positions at the tail of the aircraft are 9 L and 9 R. DALP-TS uses the US Air Force designation for single row aircraft and a modified version for double row aircraft (i.e., the designation changes from 1 L, 1 R, 2 L, …, 9 R to 1, 2, 3, …, 18).|$|R
30|$|The pallet input object {{presented}} in Table  1 contains three physical and four temporal data fields. The pallet object physical data fields detail an identification {{number and the}} height and weight of the loaded pallet which indicate whether a pallet feasibly fits into an <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>pallet</b> position. Utilization of the military standard 463 L pallet system removes the necessity of including length and width dimensions for a loaded pallet, which are 108 ″ ×  88 ″. The pallet’s available load date corresponds to the earliest date available for loading on an aircraft; as such, it is strictly enforced by DALP-TS. Violations of the remaining three temporal fields are allowed but penalized. Pallets reaching the APOD prior to the earliest arrival date may arrive before the necessary equipment and/or personnel required for cargo unloading are in place and may also cause port congestion issues (i.e., exceeding airfield storage capacity) at the APOD. The pallet latest arrival date and pallet required delivery date are very similar and often identical. The latest arrival date is the latest date by which the pallet should arrive at the APOD to enable proper unloading and assembly; the required delivery date is the latest date by which the pallet must arrive at the APOD prior to the deploying force departing the APOD.|$|R
30|$|The overall DALP goal {{includes}} minimizing {{not only}} the number of flights required to transport all pallets, but also {{the total number of}} aircraft required, {{while at the same time}} minimizing aircraft allowable cabin load (ACL) violations and pallet temporal violations. An aircraft available for a DALP scenario but not required in the final solution can be utilized for other logistical transportation needs. ACL violations occur when the assigned cargo load weight surpasses the <b>aircraft’s</b> ACL; <b>pallet</b> temporal violations occur when a pallet’s arrival date is outside of its acceptable arrival window. By considering feasible and infeasible solutions (i.e., those with violations), senior level decision makers can choose a preferred solution from a set of solutions in order to balance the effectiveness and efficiency of airlift aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Four F-111C {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C reconnaissance configuration. These aircraft met the RAAF's requirement for aircraft to reinstate its photographic reconnaissance capacity. While the original order for F-111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six reconnaissance variants, the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike aircraft and later retrofit six with reconnaissance pallets. In 1971 the USAF dropped plans to fit {{some of its}} F-111s as reconnaissance aircraft, but sold {{the design of the}} reconnaissance pallet to Australia for $3 million. At this time the RAAF decided to fit the pallet to four rather than six <b>aircraft.</b> The reconnaissance <b>pallet</b> contains four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit and is fitted in the F-111's weapons bay. The RF-111Cs retained their strike capability.|$|R
30|$|The unload entire <b>aircraft</b> {{neighborhood}} removes <b>pallets</b> from {{a selected}} aircraft trip and strategically inserts them onto non-empty aircraft trips. This neighborhood swaps all pallets {{from a single}} aircraft with empty positions on other aircraft, resulting in an unloaded aircraft. DALP-TS transfers the pallets in order of decreasing weight into non-empty aircraft {{with at least one}} empty pallet position and an acceptable arrival date. If multiple aircraft contain acceptable arrival dates, DALP-TS selects the aircraft with the greatest weight capacity remaining. If multiple pallet positions are empty in an aircraft, DALP-TS assigns the pallet to the empty position closest {{to the front of the}} aircraft. For this move neighborhood, DALP-TS does not consider aircraft CB; the algorithm utilizes the two other move neighborhoods to correct violations of aircraft CB. If no aircraft has an acceptable arrival window, DALP-TS chooses the aircraft with the smallest amount of pallet temporal violation penalty. The unloaded aircraft trip is no longer considered available for pallet transportation. This neighborhood endeavors to decrease the total number of trips required.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} report {{determined that}} while the Helderberg was over the Indian Ocean, a fire had occurred in the main deck cargo hold, originating in the front right-hand cargo <b>pallet.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> parts recovered from the ocean floor showed fire damage in temperatures over tests showed that temperatures of [...] would have been required to melt a carbon-fibre tennis racket recovered from the crash site. The reason for the loss was not specified, but two possibilities were detailed in the official report: Firstly, that the crew became incapacitated due to smoke penetration into the cockpit. Secondly, that the fire weakened the structure and the tail separated leading to impact with the ocean. The commission concluded {{that it was impossible}} to apportion blame to anyone for the fire. The manufacturer is quoted in the report as having [...] "contested" [...] any scenario that involved a break-up of the aircraft and thus the commission did no more than mention the two possible scenarios in its final report as incidental to the primary cause of the accident.|$|R
5000|$|The WC-130J was {{the first}} variant {{obtained}} new from the factory since 1965. Ten were procured and assigned to the 53d WRS, now the only manned weather reconnaissance unit in the Department of Defense. The new model encountered teething problems that delayed its Initial Operational Capability until just before the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Conversion of the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules greatly enhanced the capability and safety of the WC-130 in its penetration of tropical cyclones on critical [...] "fix" [...] missions. The WC-130J carries a minimum crew of five: pilot/aircraft commander, co-pilot, combat systems officer, aerial reconnaissance weather officer and weather reconnaissance loadmaster. The 53d WRS maintains twenty air crews (ten full-time and ten part-time) to meet its capabilities obligations in support of requirements for the National Hurricane Operations Plan of five sorties per day from Keesler AFB and two from deployed locations. Weather data instrumentation and the dropsonde delivery and recording systems are mounted in the <b>aircraft</b> on removable <b>pallets</b> at {{the front end of}} the cargo compartment, giving the aircraft a standard cargo mission capability also.|$|R
30|$|To {{generate}} the pallet {{data from the}} information contained in a TPFDD line item, DALP-TS computes upper and lower bounds on the required number of pallets. The bounds indicate the smallest and largest number of pallets that could be created from the given cargo weight. In order to be a non-trivial load, pallets were assumed to have a lower weight bound of 2500  lb. The structural limitations of the pallet base, as well as most cargo <b>aircraft,</b> restrict the <b>pallet</b> upper weight limit to 10, 000  lb. Thus, if a TPFDD line item specified 63, 800  lb of cargo, the minimum number of possible pallets is: 63, 800 / 10, 000  =  7, and the maximum number of pallets is: 63, 800 / 2500  =  25. DALP-TS randomly selects an integer between these bounds (inclusive) as the total number of pallets and assigns a random weight between 2500 and 10, 000  lb to each pallet such that the sum of the pallet weights equals the specified weight by the TPFDD line item. Each pallet associated with a given TPFDD line item has identical temporal constraints.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{changes to}} an {{aircraft}} trip’s temporal information {{results from the}} unload entire <b>aircraft</b> and inter-aircraft <b>pallet</b> swap neighborhoods. First, an aircraft trip departure date might require modification to minimize pallet temporal violations. If the current departure date of a trip is later than the ready to load date, DALP-TS can decrease the departure date; however, the algorithm does not schedule an aircraft trip’s departure date prior to its ready to load date. Decreasing a departure date only occurs if doing so improves the solution. Changing the departure date to a date which causes infeasibilities {{in the majority of}} the loaded pallets is unproductive. Decreasing the departure date of an aircraft trip creates a series of ready to load date decreases in subsequent aircraft trips; DALP-TS modifies the departure date of the succeeding aircraft trips if doing so improves the overall objective function value. Note that the trip ready to load date is the earliest date upon which an aircraft may depart; this date does not necessarily correspond to the best departure date for a given pallet load. By increasing a trip’s departure date, DALP-TS could trigger a series of updates to the subsequent aircraft trips. This occurs when a trip’s altered departure date causes the ready to load date of the succeeding trip to be after its departure date; DALP-TS then equates the departure date with the ready to load date.|$|R
30|$|A loaded aircraft’s CB is the {{distance}} (measured in inches) {{of the cargo}} load CB from an associated reference line. For an aircraft’s longitudinal CB, the reference line is {{at or near the}} front of the aircraft (varies for each aircraft type); for <b>aircraft</b> with two <b>pallet</b> rows, the reference line for the lateral CB follows the center of the aircraft from nose to tail. An aircraft’s CB is computed as the sum of the pallets’ moments divided by the total weight of the cargo, where a pallet’s moment is the product of the pallet weight and {{the distance}} from the associated reference line. For a given cargo load’s total weight, each aircraft type stipulates a lower and upper bound CB which enables safe flight; additionally, each aircraft type specifies an optimal or target CB location for the best fuel consumption rate at a given cargo load’s total weight. The ready to load date specifies the earliest date the aircraft is available for use. The required travel time indicates the amount of time required for the aircraft to travel from the APOE to APOD. The crew rest time specifies the amount of time required for the crew to rest at the APOD prior to returning to the APOE. Since the DALP’s initial focus is to be effective first and efficient second, the aircraft set is sufficiently large to transport all <b>pallets</b> (i.e., available <b>aircraft</b> is not a limitation in solving the DALP). Senior decision makers may modify the set of aircraft to coincide with their preferences.|$|R
