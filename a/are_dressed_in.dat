5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> white {{robes and}} sit on two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E
5|$|The two upper {{register}} wings {{on either}} side of Jesus show a pair of angels holding the instruments of the Passion. These include a lance, crown of thorns and a stick with a sponge soaked in vinegar. The angels <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> white liturgical vestments.|$|E
5|$|The 1430s dating is {{supported}} by the style of the underdrawing, which is consistent with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In addition, the figures <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> clothes fashionable in the 1420s {{with the exception of one}} of the possible donors, tentatively identified as Margaret of Bavaria, who is depicted as the sybil standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears clothes in style in the early 1430s.|$|E
50|$|At Eurovision, Proeski {{created an}} ethno {{sound on the}} Istanbul stage. The {{performance}} contained elaborate choreography and dancers who wore very little clothing. Tose <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> white, while the backing vocals <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> black. The performance contained attention grabbing shots, which placed Macedonia in the 14th position.|$|R
5000|$|Episode 6: The catwalk was {{all about}} embodying {{specific}} emotions brought out by the clothing. The female models <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> deep scarlet clothing and had to portray sensuality and [...] "fire", while the male models <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> white and had to embody [...] "ice", or smoothness.|$|R

5|$|The video {{opens on}} a stately room, with plum colored walls and antique furniture. Bunton opens a large, black door and is {{followed}} by Halliwell, Beckham, Mel B and Chisholm. The girls <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> beautiful gowns throughout the video, presumably designed by Roberto Cavalli, who designed the costumes for their then-upcoming tour. Vignettes of the girls singing together and separately are sewn {{together to create a}} collage. Fading in and out, the music video ends with the girls combined together although they are at different places.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Foreign Ministry {{has also}} {{recognized}} {{the power of}} cute merchandise and have sent three 18-year-old women overseas {{in the hopes of}} spreading Japanese culture around the world. The women <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> uniforms and maid costumes that are commonplace in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Hamas {{also runs}} a two-week camp for 5,000 boys at a Hamas {{military}} base. The boys <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> military-style uniforms and trained {{by members of}} the Hamas National Guard and militants from Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. They learn karate, street-fighting, and how to throw a hand grenade.|$|E

25|$|A 15th-century {{restored}} Tree of Jesse {{window in}} the chapel of {{the east end of}} the church. Thirteen of the figures are original, seventeen are partly restored and thirty-one are modern. The kings <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> short doublets which are compared with similar figures in the manuscript of 1640 representing the victories of Edward IV which is in the British Library Harleian MS. 7353.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who typical painted exterior wings in grisaille, Memling shows the saints in a realistic manner. Although the donors in van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and van der Weyden's Beaune Altarpiece are also painted realistically, they are placed within architectural niches {{separate from the}} adjacent statue-like grisaille saints. Memling breaks with that tradition in these exterior panels, but the subdued palette he uses retains some sense of grisaille. The donors <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> their Augustinian habits; {{the two men in}} stark black and the two women in white on black. The saints <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> monochromatic clothing. St James wears a light blue cloak and St Anthony's is grey. St Agnes is dressed in drab green and St Clare is also in a dark habit. Although the figures seem to be in two niches, they are enclosed in a single shallow space, with stone walls behind, trefoil arches above, and two columns adorning the outermost edges. Where the wings open is a single column which has the appearance of two separate columns.|$|E
25|$|The second storey is {{supported}} on six pillars {{and the space}} {{is divided into two}} arched spaces. To the right and facing right in prayer is Sir George Shirley with his two sons behind him. All three figures <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> brightly painted period dress and the clothes include details in gold. In the left arch is his wife (d. 1595), daughter, and two babies. According to the Latin inscription, Shirley's wife died aged 29 whilst giving birth.|$|E

25|$|Yup'ik dolls (yugaq, irniaruaq, sugaq, sugaruaq, suguaq in Yup'ik, cugaq, cugaruaq in Cup'ik, cuucunguar in Cup'ig) <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> {{traditional}} Eskimo style clothing, {{intended to}} protect the wearer from cold weather, and are often made from traditional materials obtained through food gathering. Play dolls from the Yup'ik area were made of driftwood, bone, or walrus ivory and measured from one to twelve inches in height or more. Some human figurines were used by shamans. Dolls also mediated the transition between childhood and adulthood in the Yup'ik shamanism.|$|E
25|$|Harold Waring, an under-secretary {{of state}} {{at the age of}} only thirty, is enjoying a holiday in the country of Herzoslovakia at a hotel by the side of Lake Stempka. The only other English people there are an elderly woman, Mrs Rice, and her married daughter, Mrs Elsie Clayton. Two other women cause Harold a moment of disquiet. He first sees them as they come up a path from the lake to the hotel. They <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> black-flapping cloaks, have hooked noses and bring to Harold's mind an image of evil birds of prey.|$|E
25|$|Dog Clothing is {{a garment}} made by humans for their canine companions. Dog clothes are {{available}} in various price ranges from inexpensive to high-end designer styles. Typically toy and small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Yorkshire Terriers <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> dog clothes, although even large breeds like Golden Retrievers can wear clothes, too. It is more common to dress small dogs because they are easier to dress and they often suffer from the cold more due to their coats being less thick. Dog clothes are made to be either functional or for show. Functional dog clothes are for protection from the elements and allergens. Dog clothes that are purely for show would be used as costumes for holidays and special occasions such as Halloween or weddings.|$|E

25|$|The two musical {{panels are}} {{commonly}} known by variants of the titles Singing Angels and Music-making Angels, and are both 161cm x 69.3cm. Each features a choir; {{on the left}} angels gather behind a wooden carved music stand positioned on a swivel, to the right a group with stringed instruments gather around a pipe organ, played by a seated angel, shown full-length. The presence {{of the two groups}} {{on either side of the}} DeÃ«sis reflects a by then well-established motif in representations of the heavens opening; that of musical accompaniment provided by celestial beings. As was common in the Low Countries in the 15th century, the angels <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> liturgical robes, a custom that migrated from Latin liturgical drama to the art of the period.|$|E
25|$|They <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> {{colorful}} clothes, {{usually in}} an eccentric version of traditional Japanese clothes. Women may be {{dressed up like}} a Geisha, with heavy make up. Men usually have their hair in a top knot, although nowadays they are usually wigs, and some may wear fancy hats. They parade through the streets playing various instruments, including both traditional Japanese instruments and western instruments. Usually, one person carries a combined instrument consisting of a small gong (giving the chin sound in chindon'ya) and two small drums (giving the don sound in cindonya). Additional instruments by other performers may include a larger drum and a woodwind instrument, as for example a clarinet, a trumpet or a saxophone. They often play traditional Japanese tunes, military marches, or jazz.|$|E
25|$|The {{groups of}} {{figures in the}} mid-ground, {{to the left and}} right of the altar, are known as the male and female martyrs. Identifiable biblical figures carry palms. They enter the {{pictorial}} space as though through a path in the foliage, males standing to the left, women to the right. The female martyrs, sometimes known as the holy virgins, are gathered by an abundant meadow, a symbol of fertility. A number are identified by their attributes: in front St. Agnes carries a lamb, St. Barbara a tower, Saint Catherine of Alexandria is finely dressed, and St. Dorothy carries flowers; further back St. Ursula carries an arrow. The women wear flowered crowns. The men on the left include confessors, popes, cardinals, abbots and monks who <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> blue.|$|E

25|$|The {{left hand}} panel's frame is inscribed {{with the words}} MELOS DEO LAUS ("Music in Praise of God"), the frame of to the right with LAUDATE EUM IN CORDIS ET ORGANO ("Praise him with {{stringed}} instruments and organs"). A number of art historians have defined the figures as angels based on their positioning and role within the overall context of the registers. They are sexless and possess cherub faces, which contrast with the realistic depictions of the other full-sized non-divine females in the work; Eve in the same register and Lysbette Borluut in the outer panels. The angels <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> elaborately brocaded ecclesiastical copes or chasubles, mostly painted in reds and greens. Their robes indicate that they are intended as representative of the celebration of mass before the altar in the lower central panel.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Buru {{houses were}} made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs were covered with palm leaves or reeds. Cement, metal and tiles were {{introduced}} in the 20th century and urged to build more permanent dwelling, but with limited results, as the locals continued to relocate. This was {{partly due to the}} habits of relocation and partly due to local disputes or superstitions, such as cursing a place where a certain number of people died within a short period. Presence of a church in a village might hindered relocation for a century, but not always. Traditional Buru costumes are similar those of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> sarong and a shorter jacket. However, the dress color systematically varies between the different tribes of the island.|$|E
25|$|In {{the centre}} panel, Mary {{is shown in}} a red robe holding the Christ's lifeless long body. Saint Peter and Luke the Evangelist stand {{on either side of}} her. Both <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> black clothes, and represent, the {{foundation}} of the early Church and the Gospels, respectively. The right-hand panel shows the moment (not in any of the Gospels) when Christ appears to his mother after his Resurrection, which is repeated at a smaller scale in the distance through the open doorway at rear. Although van der Weyden had otherwise presented the chronology of the triptych from left to right, the background resurrection is {{to the right of the}} Appearance in the foreground. The sequence is suggested by the picture's depth (in that the scene in the foreground is chronologically the more recent), and by the long winding path that leads from the tomb to the interior.|$|E
