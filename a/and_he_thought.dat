McMullen {{noted that}} Kehoe had stopped {{working on his}} farm altogether {{for most of the}} preceding year, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that he might be planning suicide.

5|$|A year {{prior to}} Kameo release, GamesRadar wrote {{that while they}} highly {{anticipated}} the title and {{expected it to be}} of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product. Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that he had expected the game to be the best among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to par with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it would provide {{a link to the}} past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Krichell {{was honored}} by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) with the William J. Slocum Memorial Award. Named after the former head sportswriter of the New York Journal American and {{president}} of the BBWAA, the award honored his longevity in baseball. The final players Krichell signed were two bonus babies: infielder Tom Carroll from Notre Dame University and Frank Leja, an 18-year-old first baseman. Krichell advised the Yankees staff to sign Carroll for $30,000 ($ in 2010) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Leja could be the next Gehrig, but both flopped. By the time he retired, he was the most experienced employee still working for the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield's first {{club was}} Evesham Colts under-10s. He played at county level for Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Devon. When his family settled back in Devon he joined Twyford Spartans, scoring 84 goals in 54 matches. He played in Tiverton Town's youth {{team as a}} left back before {{reverting}} to being a striker at his first senior club, non-League side Cullompton Rangers. He later moved to Elmore, where he attracted trials from Exeter City, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Torquay United, {{all of which were}} unsuccessful. His siblings joined the Royal Air Force <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of joining them, but continued searching for a breakthrough in professional football.|$|E

5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E
5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmj√§ger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck {{said it was not}} his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E

25|$|The first-century Roman-Jewish scholar Josephus {{wrote that}} Korah was an Israelite of {{principal}} account, both {{by family and}} wealth, {{who was able to}} speak well and could easily persuade the people.

25|$|Hynek was an {{associate}} {{member of the}} Robertson Panel, which recommended that UFOs needed debunking. A few years later, however, Hynek's opinions about UFOs changed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they represented an unsolved mystery deserving scientific scrutiny. As the only scientist involved with US Government UFO studies {{from the beginning to}} the end, he could offer a unique perspective on Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book.|$|E
60|$|Somerset House! <b>thought</b> Endymion, as <b>he</b> {{stood before}} the fire alone. Is it so near as that?

25|$|Ben-Gurion's plan didn't work. In {{the course}} of a meeting with Revisionist party member Yaakov Chinsky, Ben Ami told him that Haganah knew the kidnapped {{soldiers}} were being imprisoned under Banai's house. Chinsky, who knew the information was wrong, passed it to Avraham Assaf, the Irgun's district commander in the Netanya area. Assaf knew the hostages were not in Banai's cellar, but it did contain the equipment used in the kidnapping, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> its discovery might assist the British in finding the kidnappers or their hostages. He therefore arranged to have the evidence removed.|$|E
25|$|Narayan Debnath's first comic {{characters}} in color {{were for the}} comic strip and book 'Bantul The Great'. By Debnath's admission, he thought {{up the idea of}} the superhero while returning from College Street, Calcutta. The name came to him instantly <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> up the figure of the protagonist rapidly. Batul the Great, written and illustrated with red and black ink made his first appearance in comic strips in the May‚ÄìJune (Bengali Baishak), 1965 issue of the monthly children‚Äôs periodical called Shuktara, published by Dev Sahitya Kutir (henceforth DSK) publishing house.|$|E
25|$|Vance asked Davidson to {{describe}} his fictitious band and their music. Initially, Davidson said that the Cruisers sounded like Dion and the Belmonts, but when they meet Frank, they have elements of Jim Morrison and The Doors. However, Davidson {{did not want to}} {{lose sight of the fact}} that the Cruisers were essentially a Jersey bar band, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The filmmaker told Vance to find him someone that could produce music that contained elements of these three bands. Davidson was getting close to rehearsals when Vance called him and said that he had found the band--John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band from Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E

25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E
25|$|Although Drottning Kristina och Monaldeschi was popular, H√∂ckert rose to fame in 1855 {{with his}} {{painting}} Gudstj√§nst i L√∂vmokks fj√§llkapell (English: Worship service in L√∂vmokk's fell chapel). It {{was inspired by}} a sketch H√∂ckert had made while traveling in Lapland, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it would draw attention to itself. The painting was put on display at the 1855 World's Fair in Paris, and H√∂ckert was awarded with a gold medal for it. French critics characterized it as a piece of French art, commenting that H√∂ckert was most likely influenced by Eug√®ne Delacroix and Thomas Couture. The painting was then bought by Napoleon III of France and was given to the art museum in Lille. Its current home is the National Museum of Arts in Sweden. At this time, H√∂ckert became recognized as one of Sweden's foremost figure painters.|$|E
