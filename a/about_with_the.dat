In addition to a new Batwoman series, DC released Voodoo, which featured an African American bisexual woman as the title character. Additionally, The New 52 also introduced Bunker, the first openly-gay superhero ever to be featured in the Teen Titans ongoing series. Another of the changes brought <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DC reboot was the reinvention of a classic character as an out gay man, with DC as of 2012 depicting its longtime Green Lantern Alan Scott as a gay man in stories set on the parallel world of Earth-2.|$|E
5|$|One branch would {{evolve into}} cetaceans, {{possibly}} beginning <b>about</b> , <b>with</b> <b>the</b> protowhale Pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, {{a large family}} of four-legged beasts, the earliest of which in the late Eocene would have resembled skinny hippopotamuses with comparatively small and narrow heads. All branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants.|$|E

5|$|Late in life, Henry became obese, with a waist {{measurement}} of , {{and had to}} be moved <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.|$|E

25|$|Clermont-Ferrand's {{first name}} was Augusta Nemetum. It {{was born on}} the central knoll where the cathedral is {{situated}} today, known then as Nemossos. It overlooked the capital of Gaulish Avernie. The fortified castle of Clarus Mons gave {{its name to the}} whole town in 848, to which the small episcopal town of Montferrand was attached in 1731, together taking the name of Clermont-Ferrand. The old part of Clermont is delimited by the route of the ramparts, as they existed {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages.

25|$|Many {{economic}} and political changes occurred in Europe during {{the latter part of}} the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, changes which affected the lives of millions of people. One of these changes came <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of the Second Industrial Revolution. Many people who worked the farmlands abandoned their homes and moved to the larger, industrialized cities with the hope of finding better paying jobs. Those who continued to work in the agricultural sector suffered the consequences of the widespread crop failures which came about as the result of long periods of drought and disease, the cholera epidemic and a general deterioration of economic conditions. Starvation and unemployment were on the rise.|$|E
25|$|Certain changes {{occurred}} in Europe during {{the end of}} the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century that would greatly affect the lives of the French and the people of Corsica. One of those changes came <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of the Second Industrial Revolution. With the Second Industrial Revolution, {{many of the people who}} worked in agriculture began to move to the larger cities with hopes of finding better jobs and better lives. Also, there was a widespread crop failure due to long periods of drought and crop diseases (e.g., the Phylloxera epidemic destroyed the Corsican wine industry), a cholera epidemic and a general deterioration of economic conditions. Thus, many of the farms in Corsica began to fail.|$|E

25|$|Horace left Rome, {{possibly}} {{after his}} father's death, and continued his formal education in Athens, a great centre {{of learning in}} the ancient world, where he arrived at nineteen years of age, enrolling in The Academy. Founded by Plato, The Academy was now dominated by Epicureans and Stoics, whose theories and practises made a deep impression on the young man from Venusia. Meanwhile, he mixed and lounged <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> elite of Roman youth, such as Marcus, the idle son of Cicero, and the Pompeius to whom he later addressed a poem. It was in Athens too that he probably acquired deep familiarity with the ancient tradition of Greek lyric poetry, at that time largely the preserve of grammarians and academic specialists (access to such material was easier in Athens than in Rome, where the public libraries {{had yet to be}} built by Asinius Pollio and Augustus).|$|E
25|$|By the 1990s, {{some of the}} {{previous}} research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized {{that a lot of}} the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.|$|E
25|$|Michael warns Dominic {{not to make}} {{an enemy}} of Don Samuele Mangano (Ralph Peduto), so Dominic offers him a partnership, which he accepts. Meanwhile, Dominic bombs the Granados {{compound}} and kills Rico. Subsequently, Fredo and Dominic are almost killed in a drive-by shooting. Fredo blames Samuele for the hit, urging Dominic to strike back. He does so, taking over Mangano's warehouse in Florida. A furious Samuele denies he ordered the hit, and declares war against Dominic's family. Dominic asks Roth for advice, who tells him he can reason with Mangano, if Dominic is willing to help him out. Roth still believes the Cuban deal is possible, and his associate, CIA agent Henry Mitchell (Peter Hulne), tells Dominic the CIA want Fidel Castro dead so they can bring back Batista. Mitchell proposes that Dominic travel to Cuba and kill Castro. Dominic is worried that Michael is unaware of any of this, but Roth assures him that Michael has enough to worry <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> senate hearings.|$|E

25|$|Canada shifted back to Edinburgh {{for their}} fourth match {{of the tournament}} against hosts Scotland. Canada had lost the coin-toss again in this match and the home team {{inserted}} Canada into batting first. They {{got off to a}} quick start, racing to 24 in 2.3 overs before Alasdair Evans dismissed Ruvindu Gunasekara. The other bowlers too did not allow any meaningful partnerships to develop between any of the Canadian batsmen, reducing them to 87 for the loss of 8 wickets by the 16th over. A 48-run, ninth-wicket partnership between Navneet Dhaliwal (34*) and No. 10 Junaid Siddiqui, who scored 28 off 16, took them past the triple-figure mark to help them finish on 135 for 8. In response, Scotland started off brightly – at a stunning rate of 10 runs per over till the sixth over – even as Satsimranjit Dhindsa got rid of Calum MacLeod for a 15-ball 29. The wicket didn't cost Scotland much as they went <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same momentum despite losing Matthew Cross to Dhindsa as well, and cruised to a comfortable win with 32 balls to spare.|$|E
25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled <b>about</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E
