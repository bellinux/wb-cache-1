Ferraro, enraged and bitter after the nature of the primary, ignored Abrams and <b>accepted</b> <b>Bill</b> Clinton's request to campaign for his presidential bid instead.

D'Amato won the election by a very narrow margin. Overall the 1992 U.S. Senate elections saw five victories that it became known as the [...] "Year of the Woman". The Ferraro-Holtzman fighting of the campaign was viewed as a disaster by many feminists, however, with Ferraro denied her political comeback while Holtzman also politically damaged herself. The feud between Ferraro and Holtzman from the 1992 Senate primary lingered, as the following year Ferraro supported Assemblyman Alan Hevesi's successful primary challenge that unseated Holtzman as New York City comptroller; Ferraro denied that her endorsement was motivated by revenge against Holtzman, saying it was due to his liberal State Assembly voting record.|$|E

And first he acknowledged the <b>accepted</b> <b>bill</b> for four thousand pistoles, which he afterwards paid punctually; other bills that I had also payable at Amsterdam he procured to be received for me; and whereas one of the bills for one thousand two hundred crowns was protested at Amsterdam, he paid it me himself, for the honour of the indorser, as he called it, which was my friend the merchant at Paris.|$|E

The rest I had in other bills of exchange, drawn by himself upon other merchants in Holland. Having secured my jewels too, as well as I could, he sent me away the same evening in a friend's coach, which he had procured for me, to St. Germain, {{and the next morning}} to Rouen. He also sent a servant of his own on horseback with me, who provided everything for me, and who carried his orders to the captain of the ship, which lay about three miles below Rouen, in the river, and by his directions I went immediately on board. The third day after I was on board the ship went away, and we were out at sea the next day after that; and thus I took my leave of France, and got clear of an ugly business, which, had it gone on, might have ruined me, and sent me back as naked to England as I was a little before I left it.|$|E

Or thus, 'I refuse to <b>accept</b> this <b>bill,</b> because I not only gave no orders to draw, but gave positive orders not to draw.'

40|$|In {{competitive}} markets {{participants in}} the markets rapidly drive out arbitrage profits. Thus, assuming markets are competitive, cointegration provides one test of arbitrage based pricing models as this test identifies 2 ̆ 7 longer-term 2 ̆ 7 deviations from an equilibrium relationship. In this paper the equilibrium is described by the cost of carry model, an arbitrage relationship between the bank <b>accepted</b> <b>bill</b> price, the bank <b>accepted</b> <b>bill</b> futures price and the interest rate to futures contract maturity. Time series observations are available for 90 day bank <b>accepted</b> <b>bill</b> futures contracts starting with the contract maturing in June 1980 extending through to the contract maturing in March 1990. Unit root tests are conducted on the times series and these identify the underlying variables {{in the cost of}} carry relationship as I(1) processes. Cointegration tests are then applied to test for longer-term deviations from the cost of carry relationship. The level of cointegration identified in these series increases in the later half of the 19802 ̆ 7 s. Perhaps the most dramatic change in the money market occurred over the period September 1985 to April 1986 when fourteen new foreign banks set up operations in the Australian market. This resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of competition among the trading banks, the major players in the bank <b>accepted</b> <b>bill</b> futures market. Perhaps the additional players in the market and the dramatic growth in the bill market resulted in greater attention being paid to arbitrage profits arising between the bank <b>accepted</b> <b>bill,</b> and bank <b>accepted</b> <b>bill</b> futures markets...|$|E

It is shown that statistically significant gross profits can be generated by a naïve strategy for most of the considered holding periods ranging from 3 months to 18 months. However, after the deduction of generous transaction costs, the net profits are statistically significant only for the 6 -month holding period returns. The implications of the profits produced by calendar spread trading methodology on the efficiency of the BAB futures market are also addressed. The empirical results reveal that the efficiency market hypothesis for the BAB futures market cannot be universally accepted in the 1990 s.

Most of the financial products are based on conventional instruments such as Bank Guarantee (BG), Letter of Credit (LC), <b>Accepted</b> <b>Bill</b> (AB), Shipping Guarantee (SG), Export Credit Refinancing (ECR) and others. In order to be accepted in Islamic Finance, some amendments will have been made so that it will be ‘sharia compliant’ by applying muamalat contracts in those products. Muamalat contracts that are widely used in Islamic Trade Finance products are murabahah, bay‘ al-dayn, kafalah and wakalah. This article analyses the views of previous and contemporary Islamic scholars and experts in Islamic financial jurisprudence on the use of bay‘ al-dayn contracts. This article also analyses the application of Islamic Trade Finance products namely <b>Accepted</b> <b>Bill</b> (AB-i), Bill of Exchange Purchase (BEP-i) and Export Credit Refinancing (ECR-i).
