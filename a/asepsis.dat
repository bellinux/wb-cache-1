25|$|Some of his {{innovations}} were in {{the field}} of general medicine: he was an early practitioner of <b>asepsis,</b> taking exceptional care to clean his hands, instruments, and the operating room. He isolated patients while they were undergoing surgery, instead of operating in a room with other patients.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century William Stewart Halstead (1852–1922) laid out basic {{surgical}} principles for <b>asepsis</b> known as Halsteads principles. Halsted also introduced the latex medical glove. After {{one of his}} nurses suffered skin damage due to having to sterilize her hands with carbolic acid, Halsted had a rubber glove that could be dipped in carbolic acid designed.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for necrotizing {{fasciitis}} may involve an interdisciplinary care team. For example, {{in the case}} of a {{necrotizing fasciitis}} involving the head and neck, the team could include otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and plastic surgeons or oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Maintaining strict <b>asepsis</b> during any surgical procedure and regional anaesthesia techniques is vital in preventing the occurrence of the disease.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{the demand}} grew for {{surgeons}} to formally study {{for many years}} before practicing; universities such as Montpellier, Padua and Bologna were particularly renowned. In the 12th century, Rogerius Salernitanus composed his Chirurgia, laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals. Barber-surgeons generally had a bad reputation that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine, rather than an accessory field. Basic surgical principles for <b>asepsis</b> etc., are known as Halsteads principles.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{advances}} {{occurred in}} the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to <b>asepsis,</b> reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in pharmacology and physiology {{which led to the}} development of general anesthesia and the control of pain.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{the project}} then is to explore the use of {{touchless}} interaction within surgical settings, allowing images to be viewed, controlled and manipulated without contact {{through the use of}} camera-based gesture recognition technology. In particular, the project seeks to understand the challenges of these environments for the design and deployment of such systems, as well as articulate the ways in which these technologies may alter surgical practice. While our primary concerns here are with maintaining conditions of <b>asepsis,</b> the use of these touchless gesture-based technologies offers other potential uses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{empirical}} days of vaccination, before Pasteur's work on establishing the germ theory and Lister's on antisepsis and <b>asepsis,</b> {{there was considerable}} cross-infection. William Woodville, {{one of the early}} vaccinators and director of the London Smallpox Hospital is thought to have contaminated the cowpox matter—the vaccine—with smallpox matter and this essentially produced variolation. Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from cowpox, but from other skin eruptions of cattle. In modern times, an effective scientific model and controlled production were important in reducing these causes of apparent failure or iatrogenic illness.|$|E
25|$|As midwifery {{began to}} develop so did the {{profession}} of obstetrics {{near the end of}} the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But the specialty was still behind in its development stages in comparison to other medical specialities, and remained a generality in this era. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in <b>asepsis</b> and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.|$|E
25|$|Other surgeons' poor {{results of}} failed {{fracture}} union via sepsis were sometimes erroneously associated with Lane. British Medical Association appointed {{a committee to}} investigate Lane's practice—and ruled in Lane's favor. Whereas other surgeons would attempt <b>asepsis</b> but lapse, perhaps touching an unsterilized surface, Lane's utterly fastidious protocol was unrelenting. His 1905 book The Operative Treatment of Fractures reported good results. Lane introduced plates, made of steel, in 1907. (Stainless steel, discovered the next decade, was not widely used in medicine or surgery until much later.) Radiography's introduction vindicated Lane's assertion of frequent disunion via nonsurgical intervention. Lane's influence introducing internal fixation rivals and perhaps exceeds that of other, early pioneers like Albin Lambotte and later William O'Neill Sherman.|$|E
25|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of antisepsis and <b>asepsis</b> when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% carbolic solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution. He also introduced the steam steriliser to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|E
2500|$|Sir William Arbuthnot Lane, Bt, CB, FRCS, Legion of Honour (4 July 1856– 16 January 1943), was a British {{surgeon and}} physician.

2500|$|Putting a horse {{under general}} {{anaesthesia}} for castration is preferred by some veterinarians because [...] "surgical exposure is improved and it carries less (overall) risk for surgeon and patient." [...] For simple castration of normal animals, the advantages to recumbent castration {{are that the}} horse is prone, better <b>asepsis</b> (sterile environment) can be maintained, and better haemostasis (control of bleeding) is possible. In addition, there is significantly less risk of the surgeon or assistants being kicked. In a more complex situation such as castration of cryptorchid animals, the inguinal canal is more easily accessed. [...] There are several [...] different techniques (such as [...] "open", [...] "closed", and [...] "semi-closed") that may be employed, but the basic surgery is similar. However, general anaesthesia is not without risks, including post-anaesthetic myopathy (muscle damage) and neuropathy (nerve damage), respiratory dysfunction (V/Q mismatch), and cardiac depression. [...] These complications occur with sufficient frequency that castration has a relatively high overall mortality rate. [...] To minimize these concerns, the British Equine Veterinary Association guidelines recommend two veterinary surgeons should be present when an equine general anaesthetica is being performed.|$|E
2500|$|H.L. Mencken {{considered}} Halsted {{the greatest}} physician {{of the whole}} Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken’s praise of his achievements when he reviewed Dr. MacCallum's 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. “His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, {{he was the first}} to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and hard to describe. It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. Antisepsis and <b>asepsis,</b> coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted changed all that. He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. Dr. William Mayo, one of the cofounders of the Mayo Clinic, once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision. Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of Ambroise Paré: ‘God cured him; I assisted.’ Above all, he was a superb teacher, though he never formally taught. The young men who went out from his operating room were magnificently trained, and are among the great ornaments of American surgery today.” ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Asepsis</b> is {{the state}} of being free from disease-causing {{micro-organisms}} (such as pathogenic bacteria, viruses, pathogenic fungi, and parasites). The term often refers to those practices used to promote or induce <b>asepsis</b> in an operative field of surgery or medicine to prevent infection.|$|E
50|$|Ayliffe et al. (2000) {{suggests}} that {{there are two types of}} asepsis--medical and surgical.

50|$|The modern {{concept of}} <b>asepsis</b> {{evolved in the}} 19th century. Ignaz Semmelweis showed that washing hands prior to {{delivery}} reduced puerperal fever. After the suggestion by Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates. Lawson Tait went from antisepsis to <b>asepsis,</b> introducing principles and the iconic statutes that have remained valid to this day. Ernst von Bergmann introduced the autoclave, a device used {{for the practice of}} the sterilization of surgical instruments.|$|E
