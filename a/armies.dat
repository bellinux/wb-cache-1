5|$|As the 5th century progressed, {{many of the}} Empire's {{original}} borders {{had been}} either wholly or partially denuded of troops to support the central field army. In 395, the Western Roman Empire had several regional field <b>armies</b> in Italy, Illyricum, Gallia, Britannia and Africa, and about twelve border <b>armies.</b> By about 430, two more field <b>armies</b> were established in Hispania and Tingitania but the central government had lost control of Britannia as well as much of Gaul, Hispania, and Africa. In the same period, the Eastern Roman Empire had two palatine field <b>armies</b> (at Constantinople), three regional field <b>armies</b> (in the East, in Thrace, and in Illyricum) and fifteen frontier <b>armies.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Persian wars {{both sides}} {{made use of}} spear-armed {{infantry}} and light missile troops. Greek <b>armies</b> placed the emphasis on heavier infantry, while Persian <b>armies</b> favoured lighter troop types.|$|E
5|$|The later 4th-century army {{contained}} {{three types}} of army group: (a) Imperial escort <b>armies</b> (comitatus praesentales). These were ordinarily based near the imperial capitals (Milan in the West, Constantinople in the East), but usually accompanied the emperors on campaign. (b) Diocesan field <b>armies</b> (comitatus). These were based in strategic regions, {{on or near the}} frontiers. (c) Border <b>armies</b> (exercitus limitanei).|$|E

5|$|The {{troops of}} the field <b>armies</b> and of the border <b>armies</b> had {{different}} arrangements for their accommodation. The {{troops of the}} field <b>armies</b> were often billeted on the civilian population, while the troops of the border <b>armies</b> had permanent bases.|$|E
5|$|Aided by NATO air cover, {{the rebel}} militia pushed westward, {{defeating}} loyalist <b>armies</b> and securing {{control of the}} centre of the country. Gaining the support of Amazigh (Berber) communities of the Nafusa Mountains, who had long been persecuted as non-Arabic speakers under Gaddafi, the NTC <b>armies</b> surrounded Gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western Libya. In August, the rebels seized Zliten and Tripoli, ending the last vestiges of Gaddafist power.|$|E
5000|$|In 1942, <b>Army</b> Group South was to {{spearhead}} the German summer {{offensive in}} Russia known as Case Blue. The 17th <b>Army</b> {{was to give}} flank protection to 1st Panzer <b>Army</b> as it struck towards the Don River. From June to July, the German 17th <b>Army,</b> the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia, and the Romanian 3rd <b>Army</b> were organized as [...] "Army Group Ruoff". In August 1942, Hitler sub-divided <b>Army</b> Group South into two new <b>army</b> groups: <b>Army</b> Group A and <b>Army</b> Group B. <b>Army</b> Group A included the 17th <b>Army,</b> the 1st Panzer <b>Army,</b> and the 4th Panzer <b>Army.</b> <b>Army</b> Group B included the 2nd <b>Army,</b> the 6th <b>Army,</b> the Italian 8th <b>Army,</b> and the Hungarian 2nd <b>Army.</b> By October 1942, the Romanian 3rd <b>Army</b> and the Romanian 4th <b>Army</b> were added to further bolster <b>Army</b> Group B.|$|R

50|$|On 15 June, <b>Army</b> Group North Ukraine under {{command of}} Josef Harpe was {{composed}} of the 4th Panzer <b>Army,</b> 1st Panzer <b>Army,</b> and the First <b>Army</b> (Hungary). <b>Army</b> Group Centre had the 2nd <b>Army,</b> 4th <b>Army,</b> 9th <b>Army</b> and 3rd Panzer <b>Army.</b>|$|R
5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the Jin <b>armies</b> {{had left}} Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and {{dispatched}} two <b>armies</b> to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Hejian. An army of 90,000 soldiers and another of 60,000 were defeated by Jin forces by June. A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|British {{discipline}} of the First World War was not especially severe compared to most other <b>armies</b> of the time (e.g. the Russians and Italians). The French admitted to only 133 executions and the Germans 48, but these figures may not be reliable as both <b>armies</b> had problems with discipline.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, the German {{forces had}} {{advanced}} {{within a few}} kilometers of Kiev below the Pripyat Marshes. The 1st Panzer Group then went south while the 17th Army struck east and trapped three Soviet <b>armies</b> near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the tanks turned north and crossed the Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, diverted from Army Group Center, had crossed the Desna River with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two panzer <b>armies</b> now trapped four Soviet <b>armies</b> and parts of two others.|$|E

5|$|German {{forces in}} the area had been further split up, as German general Erich von Manstein was given command of the newly created Army Group Don, {{comprising}} the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth <b>Armies,</b> and the Third and Fourth Romanian <b>Armies.</b> Although the situation looked bleak for the Germans, a moment of relative calm had settled {{after the end of}} Operation Uranus; German and Soviet forces were planning their next movements.|$|E

50|$|<b>Army</b> Group Courland {{was created}} on 25 January 1945, when German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler renamed <b>Army</b> Group North, <b>Army</b> Group Center, and <b>Army</b> Group A.

5|$|In {{the late}} 13th century Edward I {{expanded}} the familia regis {{to become a}} small standing army, forming the core of much larger <b>armies</b> up to 28,700 strong, largely comprising foot soldiers, for campaigns in Scotland and France. By the time of Edward III, <b>armies</b> were smaller in size, but the troops were typically better equipped and uniformed, and the archers carried the longbow, a potentially devastating weapon. Cannons were first used by English forces at battles such as Crécy in 1346. Soldiers began to be contracted for specific campaigns, a practice which may have hastened {{the development of the}} <b>armies</b> of retainers that grew up under bastard feudalism. By the late 15th century, however, English <b>armies</b> were somewhat backward by wider European standards; the Wars of the Roses were fought by inexperienced soldiers, often with outdated weapons, allowing the European forces which intervened in the conflict to have a decisive effect on the outcomes of battles.|$|E
5|$|Khalid, sensing Heraclius' plan, {{feared that}} the Muslim <b>armies</b> would indeed be {{isolated}} and destroyed. In a council of war he suggested that Abu Ubaidah draw all the Muslim <b>armies</b> to one place so as to fight a decisive battle with the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the troops}} in the Coalition <b>armies</b> were inexperienced. The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, {{following}} the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With {{the exception of the}} British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition <b>armies</b> had spent some of their time in the French army or in <b>armies</b> allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Heraclius had {{concentrated}} a large army at Antioch to {{roll back}} Syria. Khalid got the news from Roman prisoners in Northern Syria. After his past experiences Heraclius had been avoiding pitched battles with the Muslims.
