5|$|Alternate plans {{included}} constructing {{two sets}} of two tubes, one for commuter and freight service from the LIRR {{and the other for}} rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual tubes for freight and subway service. The freight service would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 <b>a.m.</b> <b>to</b> 6 a.m.), middays (10 <b>a.m.</b> <b>to</b> 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E
