40|$|Researching the {{equality}} implications {{of being a}} migrant in Britain is hampered by imprecise definitions of what a migrant is and {{by a lack of}} data on many equality groups (groups which share a common attribute in respect of age, disability, gender, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation, as defined by the Equality Act 2006). The literature and evidence on inequalities tends to be more abundant on gender and race but remains focused on ethnic minority categories rather than on migrants as such. While the foreign-born population in the UK has increased from four to six million over the last decade, people arrive via different routes and with varying intentions. Much recent debate on the benefits and pressures resulting from immigration has been provoked by the large numbers of arrivals from Eastern Europe since 2004, but they, like other migrants from the European Union (EU), have freedom of movement guaranteed by EU Directives. Although they have to register or obtain <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> legally (and 766, 000 had registered by the end of 2007), there are few reliable statistics on their presence in specific areas or in the UK as a whole. Other migrants from outside the EU also come to the UK to work (about 200, 000 in 2006) or study (309, 000 in 2006). A number of migrants, estimated at between 310, 000 and 570, 000, are believed to be living in the country without formal immigration authorisation. In 2007, the largest group of those born abroad was from India (553, 300), followed by those from Poland (423, 300). There are significant differences in terms of gender and age between different national groups, comprising recent and established migrants, and in their experiences of employment and access to services. This heterogeneity makes policymaking based on averages or an assumed homogeneity meaningless or even dangerous...|$|E
40|$|The {{growing number}} of {{irregular}} migrant workers, i. e. unlawfully or lawfully present foreigners who engage in employment although not legally authorised to do so, poses a challenge for national social security policy. The challenge is twofold. First, irregular work by foreigners is usually undeclared work, i. e. work for which no social security contributions and taxes are paid. Second, irregular migrant workers may be confronted with the realisation of a social risk, such as the loss of income due {{to the birth of}} a child or the need for health care. This poses the question for social security of how to deal with people who have no <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the country, and possibly also no authorisation to reside there. Preliminary investigations have shown that both legal science and national legislators struggle with this question. The doctoral research of Klaus Kapuy sought to contribute to the current legal discourse on the social security status of migrants in an irregular situation. It was the aim of the research to come up with suggestions on how to treat irregular migrant workers in national social security law by deploying a method which has not hitherto been used in legal research: an analysis of social security law itself. In order to understand the mechanisms of social security law better, the author has not only looked at the treatment of irregular migrant workers, but also at the treatment of a reference group. The reference group the author identified consists of nationals whose work is not declared to social security authorities. The comparison between irregular migrant workers and undeclared national workers has been conducted in three different countries (Belgium, Canada and the Netherlands) and the results of the country investigations have been compared between the three countries. In order to better understand the results of the analysis of national law and to ascertain the legal limits of any proposal on the legal position of irregular migrant workers, the author also investigated the existing international legal framework in this field. This approach has proven to be beneficial. The analysis of national and international law has produced some interesting insights, which have allowed Klaus Kapuy to elaborate a proposal for a coherent social security policy towards irregular migrant workers. The policy proposal is based on the idea that the objectives and logic of social security should be decisive in determining the status of irregular migrant workers in national social security law, although without undermining the objectives of immigration law and without contravening international legal obligations. status: publishe...|$|E
