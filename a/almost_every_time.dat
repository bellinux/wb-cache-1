Begg claimed that the real reason for the confiscation was his campaign to prove UK and US complicity in the use of torture and rendition of suspects, and that he had been stopped for questioning <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> he had travelled, even when returning from an official speaking invitation at the European Parliament.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>time,</b> the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|E

Up to that point, he had been making $57.50 per week at UP, but he had reservations about broadcasting. He initially accepted the offer. When he informed his boss Harrison Salisbury, UP countered with a raise of $17.50 per week; Hugh Baillie also offered him an extra $20 per week to stay. Cronkite ultimately accepted the UP offer, a move which angered Murrow and drove a wedge between them that would last for years.|$|E

The opening match of the season {{was held at the}} Brisbane Cricket Ground, [...] "before one of the biggest attendances which a club [...] "soccer" [...] match has had in Brisbane", where Wellingtons defeated Bulimba Rangers 1-0.

[...] The play that drew the most {{attention}} was Sparks' drop-kick on a broken play that gave Michigan a 3-0 lead in the first quarter. [...] The play called for Sparks to take the snap from center and hold the ball for a field goal attempt. [...] The snap from center was high, forcing Sparks to react quickly. [...] One press account described Sparks' actions as follows:"And then seemingly with a single movement, Sparks jumped to his feet, grabbed the ball as {{it was about to}} clear his head, whirled to face the goal posts and drop-kicked the ball over the Aggie bar for a count of three points, which then and there cinched the game for the Wolverines.

2500|$|In 1572 {{the city}} of Zaltbommel had {{declared}} independence from Spanish authority and had switched their allegiance with the Sea Beggars. [...] The city then became a target for the Spanish and was besieged by them as a distraction to the siege at Leiden.

The Spanish troops were, however, able to recover, and {{made a number of}} attacks during which the Spanish were beaten off <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>time.</b> Zaltbommel had long been an important city for the States-General, because it was a border fortress. Maurice knew of its strategic importance and from 1580 the city was strengthened under the guidance of Adriaen Anthonisz. Several ravelins and bastions were built around the city but the walls of Zaltbommel were in need of significant repair. Maurice however made sure that Zaltbommel was fully prepared for a siege, not just for the soldiers but also for the towns population with a good deal of food and supply. A number of measures were applied, between the unfinished defences; pontoon bridges were constructed so that troops and supplies could be easily fed into the city. The threat to the area occurred when the Spanish wanted to reclaim all the land that they had lost during the ten-year campaign.|$|E

40|$|Short range radio systems make it {{possible}} to implement relatively low cost location-aware network and service solutions. Guidance system is an application which gains added value from that kind of a network. As mobile terminals with Bluetooth properties emerge an intelligently working guidance system becomes available.

When using wireless connection there is always some delay caused by the change of the used access point. With Bluetooth technology this delay gets too big for <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> real <b>time</b> application because the searching of surrounding devices (inquiry) is very time consuming operation. Therefore, our approach relies on predelivered Bluetooth device addresses of client devices, in which case the time consuming inquiry is avoided.
