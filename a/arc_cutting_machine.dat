Therefore, the roughness of the surface area of the material cut by the plasma arc cutting process {{and the rate of}} the removed material by the manual plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was importantly considered. Plasma arc cutter Selco Genesis 90 was used to cut Standard AISI 1017 Steel of 200 mm x 100 mm x 6 mm manually based on the selected parameters setting. The material removal rate (MRR) was measured by determining the weight of the specimens before and after the cutting process. The surface roughness (SR) analysis was conducted using Mitutoyo CS- 3100 to determine the average roughness value (Ra). Taguchi method was utilized to achieve optimum condition for both outputs studied. The microstructure analysis in the region of the cutting surface is performed using SEM. The results reveal that the SR values are inversely proportional to the MRR values. The quality of the surface roughness depends on the dross peak that occurred after the cutting process.

Plasma arc cutting (PAC) is a widely used process for the cutting of different types of metals in several operating conditions. PAC is considered a challenging technology compared to its main competitors: oxy-fuel and laser cutting. Today, because of advances in equipment design and improvement in cut quality, previously unheard of applications, such as multiple torch cutting of mild steel, are becoming common place. The aim of the work is the optimization of PAC of mild steel thin plates, both in terms of cut quality and performances of the consumables, to achieve cut quality standards and productivity levels usually obtainable through laser cutting processes. The temperature of the plasma arc melts the metal and pierces through the work piece while the high velocity gas flow removes the molten material {{from the bottom of the}} cut. PAC of mild steel thin plates of 10 mm through a KALI- 100 Plasma <b>Arc</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>Machine</b> is operating in the range 25 - 120 A.

In thesis work literature has been studied in context to parametric optimization of Plasma <b>Arc</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>Machine.</b> In order to attain target and optimum results, Taguchi method employed. The appropriate orthogonal array has been selected as per number of factors and there levels to perform minimum experimentation. The work pieces of Stainless Steel (316 L) materials were used for experiment purpose. The optimum value has been determined with the help of main effect plot and ANOVA table. The Regression equation for MRR and Surface Roughness (Ra) has been developed with the help of Minitab 15 Software. Confirmation test have done to confirm the value estimated through the software. The Confirmation for MRR run was done by using the setting of 5. 0 bar (Gas pressure), 150 A (Current flow rate), 600 m/min (cutting speed) and 4. 0 mm (arc gap). The optimum parameter level for Surface Roughness are 6. 0 Bar (Gas Pressure), 150 A (Current), 400 mm/min (Cutting Speed) and 2 mm (Arc Gap). Experimental results are provided to confirm the effectiveness of this approach. After the confirmation the MRR value was 0. 8331 g/sec and Ra 2. 635 μm. Error within 10 % was allowed...|$|E

In pipe profile cutting operations using plasma arc, CNC automation introduces higher precision, repeatability and speed. One method of simplifying the automation and hence improving the profit margins is the reduction of the number of controlled axes. Further by simplifying the design, the CNC machine is made more compliant to the technique of error modeling and compensation.

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine.</b> The first drive is a classic rack and pinion drive for <b>cutting</b> <b>machines.</b> To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position.
