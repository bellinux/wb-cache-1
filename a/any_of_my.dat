5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

500|$|After {{the show}} ended, several media outlets {{reported}} that Madonna {{may have been}} drunk during the performance; however, Madonna blasted these reports, by responding: [...] "Thanks for supporting me. Too bad people don't know the art of acting and playing a character. I could never do <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> shows high or drunk. And yes underlying {{all of this is}} sexism and mysongony [...] which proves that not only do we not get equal pay but we are still treated like heretics if we step out of line and think outside the box! Sexism is alive and kicking but i am #livingforlove." ...|$|E
500|$|Some bookmakers {{made the}} Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched. One New York Times writer found [...] "little {{justification}} for installing either team as the favorite". Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, [...] "We're {{going to come}} through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's {{what it takes to}} win. ... We're going to beat the Yankees. <b>Any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ball players will tell you that, and we expect to do it." [...] Yankee skipper Miller Huggins retorted, ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cover for}} Off the Deep End parodies the famous cover of Nirvana's album Nevermind, which depicts an infant {{in the deep}} end of a pool chasing after a dollar bill on a hook and line. The Off the Deep End cover shows Yankovic in the baby's place {{apparently}} chasing after a doughnut on a string. While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby, Yankovic instead wore a bathing suit {{in a way that}} his body position hid it; he later jokingly noted, [...] "I never really anticipated going full-frontal on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> album covers." [...] The CD, liner notes, and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana's album, borrowing the same blue, wave-light graphics from the printed surface of Nevermind.|$|E

500|$|Beckinsale {{decided at}} a young age she wanted to be an actress: [...] "I grew up {{immersed}} in film. My family were in the business. I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends' parents." [...] She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau. She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P.D.James' Devices and Desires. Also that year, she appeared as a young woman engaging in a forbidden affair with a Nazi officer in the Hallmark film One Against the Wind. In 1992 she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in Rachel’s Dream, a 30‑minute Channel4 short, and in 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs.|$|E
500|$|On 27 March 1784 he was {{appointed}} Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased {{to act as an}} MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said [...] "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all". On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802.|$|E
500|$|Having {{withdrawn}} from politics, Kenyon instead switched his focus {{to his job}} as Master of the Rolls. As a judge of the Court of Chancery he was required to deal with cases of equity; though he was almost entirely unfamiliar with the Roman law it was based on, he had previously practised in the Chancery. He was not considered {{as good as his}} successor, Sir William Grant, but Lord Eldon wrote that [...] "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all". With the retirement of Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, Kenyon succeeded him on 9 June 1788, and was made Baron Kenyon of Gredington, in the county of Flint.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the album's release, Cooder {{played a}} union hall in San Francisco for a longshoremen's union, which {{according}} to him, [...] "got every turn of phrase. They'd never heard of me before or <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> records, but they understood all of these lyric things immediately. Because they've been educated in the union, you know what I mean? Because they lived it." [...] On October 14, Cooder performed at This Land Is Your Land, a concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in tribute to Woody Guthrie. Cooder did not tour in promotion of Election Special, as the Kennedy Center was his last show. In an interview for The Strand at the time, he expressed disinterest in playing larger concert venues for the album, finding them more suitable for [...] "fame" [...] purposes rather than spreading a political message. Cooder remarked on the album's potential with listeners in general in an interview for Uncut, saying that: ...|$|E
500|$|From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC {{operated}} {{a de facto}} ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering {{her to be a}} [...] "second-rater" [...] whose work was without literary merit. The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to [...] "slow poison", and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out [...] "mediocre material", noting that [...] "her capacity to do so amounts to genius... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago". Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that [...] "I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books." [...] The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the [...] "drip, drip, drip of disapproval" [...] associated with the books. Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from [...] "stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> books".|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 2003, Spears {{announced}} {{through her}} official website US concerts {{to support her}} fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). The tour would kick off on March 2 in San Diego, California, at iPayOne Center. However, Spears released a statement saying, [...] "I'm especially looking forward to bringing my tour to new markets and performing in front of fans {{that may not have}} had the opportunity to see <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> previous tours." [...] On January 12, 2004, four dates were announced in Glasgow, Manchester, London and Birmingham, her first UK dates in four years. After the beginning of the North American leg, Spears announced a summer leg in the United States in June as well as a European leg starting on April 27 in London and ending on June 5 at Rock in Rio Lisboa. It was also rumored to visit Latin America and Asia later in the year. The Onyx Hotel Tour was originally going to be called In the Zone Tour. On February 17, 2004, a San Diego clothing manufacturer of the same name sued Spears for $10 million and banned her from using the trademark. On May 17, 2004, a hotel named Onyx Hotel opened in Boston, Massachusetts. Kimpton Hotels & Restaurant Group had come up with the name two years before the tour was developed. Spears and the Kimpton group decided to promote the hotel by featuring a room named The Britney Spears Foundation Room. It was designed by Spears's mother, Lynne, reflecting Spears's personality and taste. The room opened six weeks later and a portion of the fee was destined to the Britney Spears Foundation.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} chosen by fans, in a Billboard poll for Madonna's best videos, as her sixth best effort of all time, in honor of her 54th birthday. At the 2013 International Dance Music Awards, the video was {{nominated}} in the categories of Best Dance Music Video and Best Pop Music Video, but failed to win either of them. Shortly after [...] "Girl Gone Wild"s release to YouTube on March 21, 2012, the video was rated by many viewers as inappropriate. This caused YouTube to set an age restriction, only allowing those of age 18 or older to view the video. According to the website, the video was labeled explicit because of the [...] "raunchy" [...] and [...] "orgy" [...] scenes, thereby blocking it from getting uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. YouTube also asked Madonna's representative to upload a more PG-rated version. Madonna later commented, [...] "What's wrong with... what grinding? I'm {{supposed to be a}} 'girl gone wild' in the video—how can I go wild and not grind? This is the question that people should be asking." [...] During her interview with Jimmy Fallon on Facebook, Madonna jokingly confessed that if she were president, [...] "There would be no restrictions whatsoever on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> videos, ever". Jane Martinson of The Guardian expressed her disappointment with the ban, since she felt there were far more provocative content in YouTube than Madonna's video. Martinson also noted that the semi-nudity in question came from the men featured in the clip, and felt that Madonna had turned Francis' concept of girls going wild, to [...] " [...] can also be the ones in control. I watched the video ready to slate her and came away thinking, after 30 years Madonna can still show Rihanna how sex and music can subvert expectations." ...|$|E
