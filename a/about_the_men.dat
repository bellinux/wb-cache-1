5|$|The idea <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{with the}} inborn ability {{to leave their}} bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E

25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E

500|$|During the Dive Bar Tour, Gaga {{recalled}} {{that she and}} musician Hillary Lindsey were seated in couches and having a back-and-forth conversation with guitar and piano. The singer asked questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in her life, including her father and boyfriends, wondering why they would give her million reasons to leave them, but all she wanted was to have one reason to stay. Lindsey, who previously had experiences in writing country songs in Nashville, was identified by Interscope as a potential collaborator on Joanne. The label's A Aaron Bay-Schuck, who had heard the initial Joanne material, introduced Gaga to Lindsey. They bonded over drinks and Gaga also played initial demos {{of some of the}} tracks she had written. Lindsey remembered that Gaga's personal experiences and stories resulted in many ideas for songs. [...] "Million Reasons" [...] was similarly picked from their conversations, including the title phrase. It was a straightforward songwriting session according to Lindsey, with Gaga using an [...] typewriter.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{talks about}} females wanting to submissevely serve their male love {{interests}} {{and take care}} of them as they admire their hard work and are inspired by them. The trio further sings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of their lives {{and the way in which}} they will take care of them. [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was written as a continuation on the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Soldier"; after the trio sings about finding a suitable lover in the aforementioned song, they express a will to cater to him in [...] "Cater 2 U". In the second edition of the book Introducing Cultural Studies, the authors argued that the song contained lyrics about objectification of women, which suggested that their gender role was to [...] "'keep herself up', 'keep it right', 'cater to' their man by providing him with his dinner, a foot rub, a manicure, fetching his slippers, and much more, on demand". An editor writing in The Times of India found a theme of feminine assertiveness in [...] "Cater 2 U"; he noted that [...] "the women come off not so much as lovers as full-service romantic servants". J. Freedom du Lac, a staff writer of The Washington Post wrote that the song's theme was supplication.|$|E
