40|$|Background: Tobacco endgame {{policies}} are increasingly advocated to end tobacco use. This study investigated {{public support for}} <b>a</b> total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> tobacco sales, use and possession in Hong Kong. Methods: A telephone survey was conducted among 1537 randomly selected residents in 2012 to assess their support for <b>a</b> total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> tobacco sales, usage and possession. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, and second hand smoke exposure were collected. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with support for <b>a</b> total <b>ban.</b> Results: Most of the never smokers (75. 3 %), ex-smokers (63. 9 %), and nearly half of current smokers (48. 9 %) backed some form of <b>a</b> total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> tobacco. <b>A</b> total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> tobacco sales {{was the most popular}} option among the three groups, with over half (64. 8 %) of all respondents supporting <b>a</b> <b>ban</b> within 10 years. Current smoking and higher educational attainment were associated with less support for <b>a</b> total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> tobacco sales. Among current smokers, having quit intentions and attempts to quit were associated with support for <b>a</b> total <b>ban.</b> Conclusions: <b>A</b> total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> tobacco sales was supported by most respondents. Ex-smokers and current smokers also voiced substantial support, although less than never smokers. <b>A</b> total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> tobacco sales before 2022 should be the goal as it is supported by most of the respondents. Interim tobacco control measures, such as tax increases, expansion of smoking cessation services and plain packaging should be implemented to help current smokers quit and reduce smoking initiation before implementation of the ban. © 2013 by the BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
