In order to realize those, prediction of chip-breaking in machining is one of effective methods. In this paper, to predict the chip breakage systematically, the equivalent parameters concept is used. Through presenting a study of the effect of complicated groove insert equivalent parameters on chip formation and breaking, a predictive model of chip-breaking is constructed. Finally, chip-breaking experiments are made and the tested results show that differential chip-breaking point’s ratio is fewer than five percent, so it proves that the chip-breaking predictive model is reasonable...|$|E

[Med Phys. 2006; 33 (9) : 3274 – 82]. To date, the methodology described has been successfully {{used to create a}} series of three different adult phantoms at the University of Florida (UF). All phantoms were constructed in 5 mm transverse slices using materials designed to mimic human tissue at diagnostic photon energies: soft tissue-equivalent substitute (STES), lung tissue-equivalent substitute (LTES), and bone tissue-equivalent substitute (BTES). While the formulation for BTES remains unchanged from the previous epoxy resin compound developed by Jones et al. [Med Phys. 2003; 30 (8) : 2072 - 81], both the STES and LTES were redesigned utilizing a urethane-based compound which forms a pliable tissue-equivalent material. These urethane-based materials were chosen in part for improved phantom durability and easier accommodation of real-time dosimeters. The production process has also been streamlined with the use of an <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> <b>system</b> to create molds for the phantom slices from bitmap images based on the original segmented computed tomography (CT) datasets. Information regarding the new tissue-equivalent materials, as well as images of the construction process and completed phantom, are included. PACS number: 87. 53.

40|$|With the {{expanding}} use of automation in machining technology, the modern manufacturing aims toward achieving high productivity without close human supervision. This aim requires reliable machining processes. The chip control {{is one of}} major concern in <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> <b>system.</b> It {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined parts, the convenience of chip disposal, and the possible power reduction. This thesis major deals with theoretical modelling for the 3 -D chip curling process, including geometry and mechanics consideration. These models are then used to develop a computer animation system to simulate the process of chip curling in 3 -D metal cutting. Hence the work described in this thesis is devoted to developing an effective theoretical technique for chip control in automated machining systems. Firstly, a new method to describe the development process of 3 -D chip curling is developed in accord with the mechanics and kinematics characters of chip curling in 3 -D machining. This analysis divided the process of 3 -D chip development into different stages based on the deformation mechanism and characteristics, i. e. chip forming stage, chip curling stage, chip breaking stage, and the kinematical characters according to whether the curled chip, after leaving the rake face, hits the backwall of breaker/groove, or/and workpiece, or/and backface of tool, or/and extends along the chip breaker. Then new basic chip curling forms, up-curling, side-curling and twisting, are proposed based on the continuum mechanics theory. It reveals that a 3 -D curling chip body m a y undergo longitudinal bending, transversal bending and torsional deformations. The analysis provides the fundament for the theoretical modelling of the 3 -D chip curling and breaking. Secondly, a general geometric model of 3 -D chip curling generated by typical chip breakers is developed by introducing the three-dimensional deformation state of the chip curling. The model, so developed, can be used to predict the 3 -D chip curling forms. The prediction includes a group of criteria for the effects of ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηo on the chip forms/shapes. The varying tendency of the chip radius and chip pitch with varying ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηO is further discussed based on a sensitivity analysis the results of which are summarised graphically. The sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the significance of three basic chip curling forms, namely up-curling, side-curling and twisting to the general helical chip form. Thirdly, a set of 3 -D mechanics models of chip curling with chip breaker for the internal resisting forces is developed for the 4 basic chip deformation cases of chip curling process based on the structural mechanics theory, These internal forces, in particular the bending moments and torques are expressed as variations along the length of the curled chip. The set of models considers a spatial force system including the longitudinal bending moment, transversal bending moment and the torsional torque. Then the distribution of the bending moments and torques along the chip body are discussed based on graphically presented calculated results. The models reveal, in theory, new insights into the chip breaking mechanisms. More importantly it provides a new approach to theoretically asses the curling chip breakability. Notably it is shown that the bending moment and torque are the main causes of chip breaking. Furthermore the bending moment and torque in the chip body are caused by the chip breaker and the obstacle the curling chip contacts. Finally, a computer animation system for 3 -D chip curling in machining process is developed based on the 3 -D chip curling developing process, geometry model and mechanics models of 3 -D chip curling presented in the research work. The 3 -D chip animation integrates the chip flow equation, chip curling patterns, chip geometrical features and mathematical expressions for the 3 -D helix surface. Based on the input conditions (namely chip breaker parameters and cutting conditions), a computer program is developed to convert the parametric prediction into a series of dynamic graphs demonstrating the chip formation process. Then the animation results are analysed and compared with the experimental observations. The methodology presented will provide assistance for machine operators to select machining conditions or for process planning designers to confidently and thoroughly plan the cutting process, control chip breakage and evaluate the chip control effect...|$|E

40|$|Chip {{control and}} tool wear {{estimation}} {{are two major}} concerns in <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> <b>systems.</b> Chip control {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined part, the convenience of chip disposal, and possible power reduction; while tool wear estimation is vital to an effective tool change policy and quality control strategy, especially in finish-machining. This thesis first presents a new method for quantifying chip breaking and chip shapes with a fuzzy rating system, and further for predicting the chip breakability for arbitrary combinations of machining conditions through a fuzzy-set mathematical model. A predictive expert system for off-line assessment of machining performance, with chip control as a major criterion and due consideration to surface finish and power consumption, is then developed. A knowledge-based system for designing optimum chip breakers is set up with a criterion of efficient chip breaking at reduced power consumption. The method is based on the analysis of three-dimensional chip flow in oblique machining for a wide range of work materials, cutting conditions, tool geometries, chip breaker styles/sizes and restricted contact lengths. Experimental results of tool wear patterns in finish-machining show that estimation of more than one type of tool wear is required to assure the quality of a finished product. In order to achieve this, a dispersion analysis algorithm, derived from the established multivariate time series models, is used for the overall estimation of tool wear, including major flank wear, crater wear, minor flank wear and groove wear at the minor cutting edge. Finally, neural network techniques are used for modelling the dynamic interrelationship between the chip forming behaviour and different tool wear states. By integrating the developed methods for predicting chip breakability/shapes and for estimating comprehensive tool wear, the initially-predicted chip forming/breaking patterns can be updated with tool wear progression during the machining process through the use of neural network techniques. The results show that the methods developed in this thesis, for predicting chip breaking and shapes, and for evaluating machining performance, including chip control, surface finish and power consumption, m a y be used to form a basis for the off-line assessment of 2 ̆ 2 total machinability 2 ̆ 2 for <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> <b>systems.</b> The strategy of comprehensive tool wear estimation provides a feasible means for on-line tool wear monitoring to assure product quality, especially under finish-machining conditions.

The formation of chip and its removal have a remarkable {{effect on the}} state of the cutting tool during turning. This work presents a new technique using acoustic emission (AE) to monitor the tool condition by separating the chip formation frequencies from the rest of the signal which comes mostly from tool wear and plastic deformation of the work material. A dummy tool holder and sensor setup have been designed and integrated with the conventional tool holder system to capture the time-domain chip formation signals independently during turning. Several dry turning tests have been conducted at the speed ranging from 120 to 180 m/min, feed rate from 0. 20 to 0. 50 mm/rev, and depth of cut from 1 to 1. 5 mm. The tool insert used was TiN-coated carbide while the work material was high-carbon steel. The signals from the dummy setup clearly differ from the AE signals of the conventional setup. It has been observed that time-domain signal and corresponding frequency response can predict the tool conditions. The rate of tool wear was found to decrease with chip breakage even at higher feed rate. The tool wear and plastic deformation were viewed to decrease with the increased radius of chip curvature and thinner chip thickness even at the highest cutting speed, and these have been verified by measuring tool wear.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} an in-process monitoring and identification of cutting states in turning process inorder {{to realize the}} intelligent machine tools. Design/methodology/approach: The developed method utilizes the power spectrum density, or PSD ofdynamic cutting force measured during the cutting. The experimentally obtained results suggested that there arebasically three types of patterns of PSD when the cutting states are the continuous chip formation, the brokenchip formation, and the chatter. The broken chip formation is desired to realize safe and reliable machining. Themethod proposed introduces three ratios, which are calculated and obtained by taking the ratios of cumulativePSD for a certain frequency range of three dynamic cutting force components corresponding to those three statesof cutting, to classify the cutting states. The algorithm was developed to calculate the values of three ratiosduring the process {{in order to obtain}} the proper threshold values for classification of the cutting states. Findings: The method developed has been proved by series of cutting experiments that the states of cutting arewell identified regardless of the cutting conditions. The broken chips are easily obtained by changing the cuttingconditions during the processes referring to the algorithm developed. Practical implications: There are still not many systems being used in practice mainly {{due to the lack of}} generalapplicability such as a requirement of <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> <b>systems</b> regardless of the cutting conditions. Theaim of this research is to develop an in-process monitoring system for identification of continuous chip, brokenchip, and chatter regardless of the cutting conditions by spectrum analysis based on the power spectrum density,or PSD of dynamic cutting force measured during the cutting. Originality/value: The largest potential advantage of the method proposed in this paper is that the statesof cutting can be readily identified during the in-process cutting under any cutting conditions by simply mappingthe experimentally obtained values of parameters referring to the proper threshold values in the reference featurespaces...|$|R

UCDA uses a freely available natural language parser and Rational Rose’s extensibility interface {{to support the}} automation of the Object Model Creation Process (OMCP). The parser is a shift-reduce parser and is implemented in Python. This paper introduces the UCDA tool and its application in OMCP. The process of automation is illustrated in {{a case study of}} an <b>Automated</b> Teller <b>Machine</b> (ATM) <b>System.</b> The UCDA tool increases design productivity, reduces time-to-market and is of great help to novice software developers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Replay {{attack is}} {{considered}} a common attacking technique {{that is used by}} adversaries to gain access to confidential information. Several approaches have been proposed to prevent replay attack in security-critical systems such as <b>Automated</b> Teller <b>Machines</b> (ATM) <b>systems.</b> Among those approaches is a recent one called the Mutual Chain Authentication Protocol for the Saudi Payments Network transactions (MCAP). This protocol aims to allow Saudi banking systems to overcome existing weaknesses in the currently used Two-Factor Authentication (2 FA) protocols. In this paper, we analyze and verify the recent MCAP authentication protocol against replay attacks. Therefore, we examine the mutual authentication between the ATM Terminal, Sponsoring Banks (SBAT), Saudi Payments Network (SPAN) and the Issuing of Financial Bank (CIFI). The paper also provides a formal analysis of the MCAP to conduct formal proofs of the MCAP protocols against replay attacks...|$|R

These <b>systems</b> {{have been}} shown to generate simple designs for simple tasks - but their practical ability to scale up to higher complexities remains questioned. One of the keys to accomplishing higher-level evolutionary design is the ability of the process to identi and reuse knowledge discovered at lower levels, thus scaling its search capacity. One way to capture this knowledge {{is in the form of}} reusable building blocks - modules. In this paper we define modularity and discuss several approaches to promoting modularity in evolutionary design systems. In particular, we propose a new mechanism that can enhance modularization. This mechanism is based on the observation that designs that exhibit modularity have higher adaptability and consequently have better survival rates under changing requirements. Contrary to other techniques, this is a weak (indirect) formulation that does not require representation of partial solutions or definition of a genotype from which a design is developed. We demonstrate this principle on an abstract general design problem on which modularity can be statistically quantified...|$|R
