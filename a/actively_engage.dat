25|$|Research {{has shown}} that 66% of social media users <b>actively</b> <b>engage</b> in {{political}} activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones. With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating that {{young people who are}} politically active online are double as likely to vote than those who are not politically active online. Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites. Social media is therefore a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to <b>actively</b> <b>engage</b> in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach children to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E

500|$|Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy {{gave the}} episode three stars out of five. His opening said [...] "Fantastic effects and a well {{developed}} moral dilemma bolster 'The Fires Of Pompeii', although the episode fails to erupt." [...] Rawson-Jones felt that Moran's script took [...] "too long to <b>actively</b> <b>engage</b> the viewer and {{tap into the}} compelling premise of the time travellers arriving in the doomed city shortly before 'volcano day'." [...] and that [...] "the subplots are unsatisfyingly muddled {{for the majority of}} the narrative." [...] He also complained about the characterisation of the supporting cast, saying that [...] "Peter Capaldi and Phil Davis [...] better". However, he said the moral dilemma the Doctor faced was [...] "compelling" [...] and the Doctor's use of the water pistol [...] "adds a pleasing sense of fun to counterbalance the impending stench of death and harks nicely back to the Tom Baker era of the show." [...] Overall, he appreciated the premise of the episode, but thought the episode [...] "deserved better writing".|$|E
500|$|The {{termination}} of paramountcy {{would have in}} principle meant that all rights that flowed from the states' relationship with the British crown would return to them, leaving them free to negotiate relationships with the new states of India and Pakistan [...] "on a basis of complete freedom". Early British plans for the transfer of power, such as the offer produced by the Cripps Mission, recognised {{the possibility that some}} princely states might choose to stand out of independent India. This was unacceptable to the Indian National Congress, which regarded the independence of princely states as a denial of the course of Indian history, and consequently regarded this scheme as a [...] "Balkanisation" [...] of India. The Congress had traditionally been less active in the princely states because of their limited resources which restricted their ability to organise there and their focus on the goal of independence from the British, and because Congress leaders, in particular Mohandas Gandhi, were sympathetic to the more progressive princes as examples of the capacity of Indians to rule themselves. This changed in the 1930s {{as a result of the}} federation scheme contained in the Government of India Act 1935 and the rise of socialist Congress leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan, and the Congress began to <b>actively</b> <b>engage</b> with popular political and labour activity in the princely states. By 1939, the Congress' official stance was that the states must enter independent India, on the same terms and with the same autonomy as the provinces of British India, and with their people granted responsible government. As a result, it insisted on the incorporation of the princely states into India in its negotiations with British, but the British took the view that this was not in their power to grant.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] empiricist theory suggests, contra Chomsky, {{that there}} is enough {{information}} in the linguistic input children receive and therefore, {{there is no need}} to assume an innate language acquisition device exists (see above). Rather than a LAD evolved specifically for language, empiricists believe that general brain processes are sufficient enough for language acquisition. During this process, it is necessary for the child to <b>actively</b> <b>engage</b> with their environment. For a child to learn language, the parent or caregiver adopts a particular way of appropriately communicating with the child; this is known as child-directed speech (CDS). CDS is used so that children are given the necessary linguistic information needed for their language. Empiricism is a general approach and sometimes goes along with the interactionist approach. Statistical language acquisition, which falls under empiricist theory, suggests that infants acquire language by means of pattern perception.|$|E
