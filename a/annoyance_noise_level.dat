40|$|Abstract: This {{cross-sectional}} study investigated <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> awareness and practice among {{the workers in}} two steel factories in UAE. The study involving 468 steel workers randomly selected. Noise exposure was estimated using the integrated sound level meter. A structured interview questionnaire {{was used to assess}} the <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> awareness and practice of workers towards the noise. The results showed that about 89 % of the workers exposed to a daily Leq above the permissible level which is 85 dB (A) and 45 % of them had never used any hearing protection devices. About 58 % of the workers experienced a moderate or high degree of <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> Only 4. 1 % and 1. 9 % of the workers aware about the health effects of noise and the methods of prevention respectively and awareness was positively associated with noise exposure. Few workers (13. 2 %) used the hearing protection devices during the working time. Thus workers within both factories are at high risk of developing <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> and other related ailments due to excessive occupational expo-sure to noise, and non-use of hearing protection devices. There was an association between <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and any one of them could influence the workers to use the hearing protection devices. There is a need to have a hearing conservation program in both factories one of its main components is education to raise the awareness of workers about noise hazards and methods of prevention.

Fair sound management reduces annoyance, however {{only when}} the sound pressure level is high, concludes Eveline Maris based on two laboratory experiments. Being exposed to man-made sound is more than mere exposure: it is a social experience, too: You expose Me. This social hypothesis of <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> has been confirmed in two laboratory experiments. Participants were exposed to aircraft <b>noise</b> (sound pressure <b>level</b> (SPL) : 50 or 70 dB A) and treated either in a neutral, fair, or unfair manner.

The second experiment shows a main effect of procedural unfairness on <b>noise</b> annoyance: <b>annoyance</b> ratings are significantly higher in the unfair than in the neutral conditions, regardless of SPL.

The home address of people who complain about aircraft noise at the Environment Advisory Committee Schiphol was combined with annual average <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> using a Geographic Information System. The prevalence of complainants in areas with different noise exposure was calculated. In addition, data from a questionnaire survey was used to gain insight into the influence of sound insulation, personal characteristics, and aspects of health on complaint behaviour. The prevalence of complainants increases from < 1 % at 50 dB(A) (Lden) to about 7 % at 62 dB(A). Above this level the prevalence drops back to < 3 %. An increase {{in the percentage of}} sound insulated houses with increasing <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> is observed, rising markedly above 60 dB(A) (from 24 % to almost 90 %). When comparing people who complain with those who do not complain about aircraft noise, complainants report more <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> (OR= 10. 2, 95 % CI= 8. 54 - 12. 3), sleep disturbance (OR= 9. 87, 95 % CI= 8. 19 - 11. 9), concern about health (OR= 8. 02, 95 % CI= 6. 75 - 9. 53), and fear for an aircraft crash (OR= 3. 64, 95 % CI= 3. 07 - 4. 31).

Policy measures, aimed at reducing social and economic costs, are incorporated in various stages of the causal model. These measures can be subdivided into noise regulation and direct prevention measures. Stricter threshold values lead to higher total costs, but may lower social costs per capita. Economic feasibility of policy measures is usually analyzed by means of a cost-benefit case study. Methods of analysis used are diverse and ad hoc. Therefore, results of different case studies are not easily compared in terms of research synthesis. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} ever been {{conducted}} on the influences of noise upon human creativity {{in spite of the}} emerging importance of the creativity in the learning society to come. This study aims to investigate the overall effect of it, in particular. The experiments were conducted at three elementary schools and a lower secondary school in Niigata Prefecture in the period from October, 1977 to February, 1978. Creativity tests (S-A Creativity Test, "A" or "B" type originally designed by J. P. Guilford, and "P" type originally designed by E. P. Torrance) were conducted in three groups i. e., control group under no noise exposure, and groups under 70 dBA and 80 dBA noises. The noise employed in this study was 1 kHz band noise generated by a noise field generator and its reproduction by a tape deck. The subjects were 527 pupils of fifth and eighth grades. The main findings are as follows: 1. The noise (band noise, central frequency 1 kHz) was uniformly obstructive on the "verbal creativity" (measured by "A" or "B" type) of school children regardless of their grade or sex. But it affected neither negatively nor positively on their "figural creativity" (measured by "P" type) as a whole. 2. 80 dBA noise was more obstructive on "verbal creativity" than 70 dBA noise, but there was no difference of effects between 80 dBA and 70 dBA noises on "figural creativity. " 3. The noise was uniformly obstructive on the factors and the fields of "verbal creativity. " It was accelerating on the perceptivity, the fluency and the flexibility of "figural creativity", but obstructive on the constructability of it. 4. Pupils assess 80 dBA noise more obstructive to perform the creativity tests than 70 dBA noise. This difference of <b>annoyance</b> by <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> was clear for pupils of the eighth grade though vague for those of the fifth grade...|$|R

In addition, annoyance increased significantly for the increase of background <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> over 63 dBA.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} perform {{cost-benefit}} analyses of action {{plans to be}} constructed under the new EU Environmental Noise Directive to reduce noise and maintain environmental noise quality where it is good, the EC and individual Member Countries need to establish interim economic values for noise from different transportation modes and industrial noise. The paper provides an updated overview and evaluation of valuation techniques, empirical noise valuation studies worldwide {{and the potential for}} transfer of noise values across countries. An analysis of Stated Preference (SP) studies on road traffic noise suggests an interim EU-wide economic value of 23. 5 euro/dBA. /household/year. Interim values for noise from aircrafts and railways are possible to establish due to {{a very small number of}} studies. In order to refine and improve the transferability of this estimate, the Damage Function Approach should be applied to value welfare loss from noise annoyance; implying a great need for new SP studies. These studies should be constructed to provide values for endpoints of exposure- response functions for different annoyance levels, defined according to the current international standard. We also need to establish values for: i) <b>annoyance</b> from low <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> and multiple <b>noise</b> sources, ii) health impacts from noise; and iii) the effect of being exposed to multiple environmental impacts including noise...|$|R
40|$|In a {{residential}} area exposed to road traffic noise a socio-acoustic longitudinal {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of a large intervention project on acoustical conditions and resident's noise responses. The paper presents results on general <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> <b>noise</b> disturbed activities and perceptions of the sound environment in relation to obtained <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> before and after the interventions. The most comprehensive abatement measures implemented were construction of new buildings that filled in gaps between buildings facing the highway and erection of a noise barrier to create less noise-exposed court- yards and sides of the dwellings. One building site had a considerable renovation, such as installation of new windows, glazed-in balconies, and an upgrading to two-sided flats with windows facing the quieter courtyard. Overall in the resi- dential area, <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were reduced with 5 – 10 dB at the most traffic exposed side and with 4 – 10 dB at the less noise exposed side. General <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and sleep disturbances decreased substantially and the perceived sound environ- ment indoors and outdoors was improved for a majority of the investigated building sites. Through the successful combination of measures taken in the res- idential area, we obtained significant positive effects; however, measures to fur- ther reduce the negative impacts of noise on health and well-being and to improve the sound environment are needed and suggested...|$|R
