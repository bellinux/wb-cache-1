30|$|Policy {{inconsistencies}} {{may arise}} between safety <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> policies {{due to their}} opposite objectives. And in many cases, it is desirable for access control system to have both of safety <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> policies. Li et al. [4] attempts {{to address the problem}} of consistency checking for safety and availability in the context of access control. Based on the consistency checking method, it can help the policy administrator to specify reasonable access control policies without policy inconsistencies. However, this approach has its own shortcomings, the computing cost is usually unacceptable, and it does not consider optimization on tradeoff between safety <b>and</b> <b>utility.</b> In this paper, we provide a formal examination of policy inconsistencies resolution for safety <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> policies, especially for the coexistence of static separation-of-duty (SSoD) policies and strict availability (SA) policies. The experimental results show the validity of our approach. The resolution for policy inconsistencies is very important for policy administrators to specify reasonable access control policies when both safety <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> policies coexists.|$|R
