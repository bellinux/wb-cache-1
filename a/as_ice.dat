5|$|About 97.5% of {{the water}} is saline; the {{remaining}} 2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> in ice caps and glaciers.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{with a mild}} {{taste and}} a slight odor of maple syrup. American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} a manner similar to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant. Chefs in the San Francisco Bay Area have been known to use it for desserts such <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> creams, cakes and caramels.|$|E
5|$|Products of volcano-ice {{interactions}} {{stand as}} various structures, whose shape {{is dependent on}} complex eruptive and environmental interactions. Glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution, making it an important climatic marker. Since they are imbedded in ice, <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> retracts worldwide there are concerns that tuyas and other structures may destabalize, resulting in mass landslides. Evidence of volcanic-glacial interactions are evident in Iceland and parts of British Columbia, and it is even possible that they {{play a role in}} deglaciation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice</b> caves occur <b>as</b> static <b>ice</b> caves, such <b>as</b> Durmitor <b>Ice</b> Cave, {{and dynamic}} or {{cyclical}} <b>ice</b> caves, such <b>as</b> Eisriesenwelt.|$|R
5|$|This {{judgement}} did {{not remove}} {{the potential for}} disputes, <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> could be washed downstream along rivers, resulting in arguments over the ownership of the displaced ice. In some states it was made illegal to damage the uncut ice belonging to another businessman, but arguments could still become nasty. In the winter of 1900–01, for example, disputes between the Pike and North Lake Company and its rival the Wisconsin Lakes Ice and Cartage Company over the rights to harvest ice resulted in pitched battles between workers and the deployment of a steamship icebreaker to smash competing supplies.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E
5|$|Habitats {{change over}} time. This {{may be due}} to a violent event such as the {{eruption}} of a volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the climate, <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. Other changes come {{as a direct result of}} human activities; deforestation, the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased predation, through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the native species have no immunity.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 80% of tea is {{consumed}} <b>as</b> <b>iced</b> tea. Sweet tea {{is native to}} the southeastern US, and is iconic in its cuisine.|$|R

5|$|The medal {{table is}} based on {{information}} provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. Medals won in team competitions—such <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> hockey—are counted only once, no matter how many athletes won medals as part of the team.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{were thought}} by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and {{epicycle}} motions. Although {{the idea that}} the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, {{it was not until the}} 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such <b>as</b> <b>ice</b> creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E
5|$|Milled sugars (known as confectioner's {{sugar and}} {{powdered}} sugar) are {{ground to a}} fine powder. They are used as powdered sugar (also known <b>as</b> <b>icing</b> sugar or confectionary sugar), for dusting foods and in baking and confectionery.|$|R
60|$|You {{must not}} laugh at this. Our amusements in out-of-the-way Stations {{are very few}} indeed. Then we talked in groups or together, lying under the trees, with the sun-baked roses {{dropping}} their petals on our feet, until supper was ready. It was a beautiful supper, as cold and <b>as</b> <b>iced</b> <b>as</b> you could wish; and we stayed long over it.|$|R

25|$|These trains, {{despite being}} officially notated <b>as</b> <b>ICEs,</b> are more {{comparable}} to a Swiss InterRegio or RegioExpress train, calling at small stations like Möhlin or Sissach. As common in Switzerland, these trains {{can be used}} without paying extra for a supplement.|$|R
50|$|Another cold dessert {{is called}} baobing, which is shaved ice with sweet syrup. Chinese jellies are known collectively in the {{language}} <b>as</b> <b>ices.</b> Many jelly desserts are traditionally set with agar and are flavored with fruits, though gelatin based jellies are also common in contemporary desserts.|$|R
50|$|Mystic Prophecy {{is a power}} metal {{band from}} Bad Grönenbach, Germany. They have been {{described}} as sounding like US-power metal, similar to bands such <b>as</b> <b>Iced</b> Earth (due to the riffing and use of drumming), but still without losing the melodies found in European power metal.|$|R
25|$|Hailstorms are rain drops {{that fall}} <b>as</b> <b>ice,</b> rather than melting before {{they hit the}} ground. A {{particularly}} damaging hailstorm hit Munich, Germany, on July 12, 1984, causing about $2 billion in insurance claims.|$|E
