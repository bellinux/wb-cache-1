5|$|In their {{original}} contracts {{for the first}} season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode. The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least-paid cast member, meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest paid TV actresses of all-time. The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit {{of a piece of}} the show's lucrative back end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in <b>a</b> <b>show,</b> <b>like</b> Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.|$|E
25|$|The Top of the Pops brand {{has also}} been {{exported}} to New Zealand which for many years {{had to rely on}} music-video only shows to demonstrate its Top 20 (as well as the occasional season of the UK version of TOTP) as the world's top acts found New Zealand just too far away from the major markets to visit regularly. This all changed in 2002 when the New Zealand government suggested a voluntary New Zealand music quota on radio (basically a threat that if the stations did not impose a quota themselves then one would be imposed on them). This worked and suddenly the amount of indigenous music played on radio stations increased, as did the number of New Zealand hits in the top 20. Therefore, a new version of <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> Top of the Pops became feasible for the first time, and the show was commissioned by Television New Zealand. The show was Executive Produced by David Rose, managing director and owner of Satellite Media and began in early 2004 with host Alex Behan. The hour-long show (as opposed to the 30-minute UK version) which is broadcast at 5pm on Saturdays on TV2 (New Zealand) contains a mixture of songs recorded on a sound stage in the Auckland CBD, as well as performances from the international versions of the show. The New Zealand Top 20 singles and Top 10 albums are also featured. Alex stayed as host for two years before Bede Skinner took over. Despite a popular fan base in early 2006 TVNZ announced that Top of the Pops has been axed and ideas for new music shows are currently being considered.|$|E

Many people involved with the show found the process extremely disruptive. In particular, Fleder said that he hates to be photographed and found the camera crew distracting and stressful. Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, {{you have to be}} really, really focused, and for me the thing with the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|E
500|$|Early {{childhood}} {{educational research}} {{had shown that}} when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned higher grades and learned more effectively.

[...] Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested [...] "substantially lower" [...] than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school. [...] The field of developmental psychology had grown during this period, and scientists were beginning to understand that changes in early childhood education could increase children's cognitive growth.

500|$|The storylines that {{involved}} Rachel received mixed commentary. Both Poniewozik and Stack appreciated the pairing of Rachel and Kurt: the former called them [...] "probably the strongest pairing" [...] {{of the episode}} due to similarities in their characterization, and the latter lauded Rachel's line [...] "I know you're lonely...but you're not alone" [...] as [...] "an incredibly powerful statement coming {{in the midst of}} all these gay youth suicides further illuminates the relevance and importance of <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> Glee." [...] Fallon said that the episode [...] "added some flavor" [...] to the relationship between Rachel and Finn, which was [...] "in danger of going stale", and Berk noted that [...] "Duets" [...] was the first time he had ever been [...] "marginally compelled" [...] by a storyline which involved the pair. Benigno was far less favorable: he called Rachel a lunatic, and a [...] "self-absorbed crazy woman who will do anything short of black-ops assassination to secure the [...] trophy." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the lines}} and scenes from the episode were {{improved}} or ad-libbed by the cast. Jenna Fischer named the party planning scene her favorite scene and called it [...] "longest most horrible meeting of all time". On the commentary track for the episode, Fischer revealed that the scene was almost entirely ad-libbed. At one point, Phyllis Smith, who portrays Phyllis Margaret Vance (née Lapin), made a joke that made every one on set laugh, forcing production to halt for almost 45 minutes. Dwight's [...] "gun show" [...] joke was written by Rainn Wilson. Larry Wilmore later called the [...] "gun show" [...] scene his favorite. Wilmore later said of ab-libs, [...] "part of the fun in writing <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> this is trying to write lines that sound like ad-libs."

Just {{how do you}} maintain the right balance between holiday cheer and year-round irreverence? It's a delicate formula, and on Thursday night 30 Rock got it just right. That is, they leaned toward the former, delivering a Christmas episode full of cynicism – but topped with just a sprinkle of sweetness." [...] In addition, Blake was complimentary toward Stritch's role on the show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't the best Christmas episode that [...] has had. Past episodes like 'Ludachristmas,' 'Christmas Special' and 'Secret Santa' were put together better and had more heart". Sassone noted that the problem with [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was Tracy's subplot [...] "as it wasn't very funny" [...] {{and the one that}} dragged the episode down.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman {{decided to}} {{alternate}} the episodes between the prime and parallel universes because they [...] "thought {{that the best}} way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly... the journey that our heroine is on and then come back over here because [...] is embedded in our team, we have point of view characters in both universes and it seemed to us the perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way the alternate universe". Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+". He {{argued that the}} episode was [...] "the best season finale cliffhanger the show ever did", and compared it to the second season finale [...] "Anasazi"; he noted that while the latter episode was [...] "pretty amazing", [...] "Requiem" [...] has [...] "a finality" [...] to it and a [...] "sense that nothing will ever be the same" [...] that made its cliffhanger ending work. VanDerWerff also wrote that the nods to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder, he noted that [...] "the truth is The X-Files has been <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> no other and 'Requiem' proved once again there truly {{is a place for}} magic and beauty and love on the small screen and I am delighted to have witnessed it for seven seasons now."

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E

They were the first major recurring characters outside of the Simpson family to appear. They are based on Tom and Jerry and other cat and mouse cartoons. As a child, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra violent cartoon and how much fun {{it would be to}} work on <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> that. The names [...] "Itchy" [...] and [...] "Scratchy" [...] were inspired by [...] "Pixie and Dixie," [...] who were mice on the cartoon show Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks. The comic strip Squeak the Mouse is also considered as an apparent inspiration for the characters. The show is also based on Herman and Katnip, a show that, according to director David Silverman, [...] "is hilarious because it's just bad." [...] As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, {{and it was one of}} the reasons to why he got into cartooning. In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea that it is possible to have a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening.

500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg halted {{production}} of the show after the third season had been completed {{to focus on the}} making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which was set for release in 2004: [...] "I don't want to try and do a movie and the series at the same time. We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [...] really needs. It is a standard number for <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory. He said that Engel [...] "truly was the most influential artistic person in [...] life." [...] The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie grossed $140 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics.

[...] Fellow Guardian {{reviewer}} Gareth McLean stated that Spooks is [...] "so good it makes {{you want to be a}} spy." [...] Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak rated the series eight out of ten, calling it [...] "thrilling, dramatic, and fast", while [...] "much more concise" [...] than many American series. Landmann added; [...] "Each story is complex and convincing, plus the scripts are very well written. A lot goes on in each episode, and it's detrimental for <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> this to keep the action and tension going as fast as possible." [...] The reviewer also noted that having only six episodes worked as an advantage over American television, stating [...] "while this seems incredibly short, the idea is actually very good. This ensures that each episode is strong in content and execution. American shows tend to run for 20–25 episodes a season, and while developments occur, there are always the filler episodes. With [...] there is nothing like it, no filler material at all. In fact, the first season sees a lot of development." ...|$|E

Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>like</b> Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words."
