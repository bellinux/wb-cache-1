The forms could be obtained at all District Police Stations. When applying the name, gender, date and place of birth, digital image, ten fingerprints, palmprints, and an electronic signature in a JPEG2000 format are taken. First-time appliers must also provide a valid birth certificate. It is possible for a person to apply for a renewal of the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant changes in his or hers appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an <b>authorized</b> <b>representative</b> may receive your ID. This does not apply to applying for passports, as fingerprints must be taken.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Thomas Kilgore Kirkpatrick (son of Claude Kirkpatrick); an {{attorney}} who received a Juris Doctor degree from Louisiana State University, began a 30-year military service in 1969 as a private in the United States Army. He obtained a commission in the Judge Advocate General's Corps and served four years on active duty, having reached the rank of captain. He joined the Louisiana National Guard in 1975 {{and served as a}} military judge, state judge advocate, and retired commander of the 61st Troop Command. Kirkpatrick also served as general scounsel of the National Guard Association of the United States. His many military citations included Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with two Bronze Oak leaf clusters, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal with four Bronze Oak Leaf clusters, National Defense Service Medal with one Bronze service star, and the Vietnam Service Medal. After retiring from the private practice of law in Baton Rouge, Kirkpatrick assumed the director's position with the National Guard's Youth Challenge program. His final government service was as general counsel for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. Under Governor Kathleen Blanco, he was named the state coordinating officer and alternate Governor's <b>authorized</b> <b>representative</b> for the relief of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Thomas Kirkpatrick, who died of cancer at the age of sixty-five, was married to the former Sandra Futrell of Pineville and was the father of three children, Sandra Karen Kirkpatrick (1969-2011), Thomas Kirkpatrick, II, and Mildred Kathleen Kirkpatrick.

2500|$|During {{one week}} of October 2008, a zombie plague was spread {{to promote the}} second World of Warcraft expansion, , before its release.

It was compared to Corrupted Blood by The Sunday Times, which described the zombie plague as being more true-to-life. The plague was contagious, but in contrast to Corrupted Blood, which had 100% transmission to nearby characters, being {{in the vicinity of}} a character infected with the zombie plague represented only a small risk of transmission. This meant that encountering a lone zombie was not as dangerous as encountering a large mass of infected. The event—which Blizzard ended on 28 October—earned the company both praise and criticism from its fans.|$|E

60|$|Those {{simple and}} {{definite}} facts were these: I had {{published an article}} in this magazine, with you for my subject; just you yourself; I stuck strictly to that one subject, and did not interlard any other. No one, of course, could call me to account but you alone, or your <b>authorized</b> <b>representative.</b> I asked some questions--asked them of myself. I answered them myself. My article was thirteen pages long, and all devoted to you; devoted to you, and divided up in this way: one page of guesses as to what subjects you would instruct us in, as teacher; one page of doubts as {{to the effectiveness of}} your method of examining us and our ways; two or three pages of criticism of your method, and of certain results which it furnished you; two or three pages of attempts to show the justness of these same criticisms; half a dozen pages made up of slight fault-findings with certain minor details of your literary workmanship, of extracts from your 'Outre-Mer' and comments upon them; then I closed with an anecdote. I repeat--for certain reasons--that I closed with an anecdote.|$|E
60|$|With all {{his energy}} and discretion, the Adelantado found it {{difficult}} to manage the proud and turbulent spirit of the colonists. They could ill brook the sway of a foreigner, who, when they were restive, curbed them with an iron hand. Don Bartholomew had not the same legitimate authority in their eyes as his brother. The admiral was the discoverer of the country, and the <b>authorized</b> <b>representative</b> of the sovereigns; yet even him they with difficulty brought themselves to obey. The Adelantado, on the contrary, was regarded by many as a mere intruder, assuming high command without authority from the crown, and shouldering himself into power on the merits and services of his brother. They spoke with impatience and indignation, also, of the long absence of the admiral, and his fancied inattention to their wants; little aware of the incessant anxieties he was suffering on their account, during his detention in Spain. The sagacious measure of the Adelantado in building the caravels for some time diverted their attention. They watched their progress with solicitude, looking upon them as a means either of obtaining relief, or of abandoning the island. Aware that repining and discontented men should never be left in idleness, Don Bartholomew kept them continually in movement; and indeed a state of constant activity was congenial to his own vigorous spirit. About this time messengers arrived from Behechio, cacique of Xaragua, informing him that he had large quantities of cotton, and other articles, in which his tribute was to be paid, ready for delivery. The Adelantado immediately set forth with a numerous train, to revisit this fruitful and happy region. He was again received with songs and dances, and all the national demonstrations of respect and amity by Behechio and his sister Anacaona. The latter appeared to be highly popular among the natives, and to have almost as much sway in Xaragua as her brother. Her natural ease, and the graceful dignity of her manners, more and more won the admiration of the Spaniards.|$|E
