5|$|Einstein <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is true for}} {{fundamental}} reasons, {{because the}} gravitational field {{could be made to}} vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> ought to extend to the protection of due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E

40|$|The Legal Structure of the Firm {{presents}} two core points. First, it <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{economic reality}} of the modern business enterprise, what it calls the firm, is different from and much broader than the legal entity or entities into which it is organized. My comment will <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> first point is correct, well presented here, and a real contribution to our understanding. Second, The Legal Structure of the Firm <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> separation between the legal entity and the business reality is a good thing, enabling positive asset partitioning and other positive attributes of capital formation which should be preserved. My comment will <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> point is at best incompletely supported and most likely misdirected. ...|$|R
5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, {{but some experts}} opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase {{the rate at which}} England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow {{of a college}} at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, {{the terms of the}} Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.|$|E
5|$|In 1502, {{the whole}} Muslim {{community}} of Teruel (part of Aragon bordered with Castile) converted en masse to Christianity, {{even though the}} 1502 edict of conversion for Castilian Muslims {{did not apply to}} them. Harvey suggested that they were pressured by the Castilians across the border, but historian Trevor Dadson <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> conversion was unforced, caused instead by centuries of contact with their Christian neighbors and a desire for an equal status with the Christians.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Bush {{announced}} the Clear Skies Act of 2003, aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution {{through the use}} of emissions trading programs. Many experts <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal. The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} days, around 2,000 Chetniks {{were in the}} district of Prozor. According to Partisan sources, they moved southeast to the Neretva River and Mostar at the request of Italian officers. Partisan sources claim that this was done because Chetnik and Italian atrocities caused great resentment in the local population, especially the Croatian Home Guard, which felt obliged to intervene militarily in such instances. Chetnik commanders <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> move was initiated by Germans to prevent the Chetniks from heading west towards Mount Dinara.|$|E

Many philosophers think that normative judgements do not aim to represent the world.

I shall <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> shows <b>that</b> normative judgements do aim to represent the world. This paper consists of six sections. In section 1, I distinguish cognitivism from noncognitivism. In section 2, I explain why non-cognitivists need to show that their view is compatible with (A). In section 3, I <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> three simple attempts to show this fail. In sections 4 and 5, I <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> two sophisticated attempts to show this also fail.

5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II.

5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's {{decision}} was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent. They further <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally {{in support of the}} Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At {{the same time}} he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.|$|E

5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work {{he noted that the}} rise of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E
5|$|The 1947–48 season brought Max Bentley to Toronto from Chicago in {{what has}} been called the biggest trade in NHL history as the Leafs gave up five regular players for the league's scoring leader. Evincing the depth of the team at centre, Bentley played on the team's third line, behind Apps and Kennedy. Decades later, Hap Day <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> team was the strongest NHL team ever and Globe and Mail {{reporter}} Dick Beddoes also stirred up controversy by saying Wayne Gretzky would have been relegated to the fourth line on this Leaf team.|$|E

5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} chance and fate, which he characterises as simple luck, to him all-important.

5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
