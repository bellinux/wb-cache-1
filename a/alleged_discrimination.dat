25|$|Caste-related {{violence}} between Dalit and non-Dalits allegedly stems from Dalit's economic success amidst ongoing prejudice. The Bhagana rape case, which arose {{out of a}} dispute of allocation of land, {{is an example of}} atrocities against Dalit girls and women. In August 2015, due to continued <b>alleged</b> <b>discrimination</b> from upper castes of the village, about 100 Dalit inhabitants converted to Islam in a ceremony at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. Inter-caste marriage has been proposed as a remedy, but according to a 2014 survey of 42,000 households by the New Delhi-based National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the University of Maryland, it was estimated that only 5 per cent of Indian marriages cross caste boundaries.|$|E
25|$|Hamburg was hit {{much more}} severely. When the plague had reached Pinneberg and Rellingen {{just north of}} the Hamburg {{territory}} in the summer of 1712, Hamburg restricted travel to the town, which the Danish king used as a pretext to encircle Hamburg with his forces and confiscate Hamburg vessels on the River Elbe, demanding 500,000 thalers (later reduced to 246,000 thalers) to make up for this <b>alleged</b> <b>discrimination</b> against his subjects in Altona. 12,000 Danish soldiers were moved before Hamburg's gates. When the plague broke out in Hamburg less than three weeks later, it was carried there from the Danish troops by a prostitute from Hamburg's Gerkenshof lane, where out of 53 people 35 fell ill and 18 died. The lane was blocked and isolated; however, the quarantine could not prevent the disease from spreading through the densely built-up neighborhoods. Among the dead was the plague doctor Majus, who belonged to those physicians who wore a beak-shaped mask containing a vinegar-soaked sponge to protect him against the miasma. In December, the plague faded out.|$|E
25|$|Drake v New Zealand is a {{case that}} was decided by the Committee in 1997. Drake had been a {{prisoner}} of war in Japan during World War Two and made an individual complaint to the Committee about the actions of the New Zealand Government concerning prisoners of war following the war. One complaint was about the Treaty of San Francisco entered into between the Allies and Japan as Drake felt that his right to a remedy had been removed as a consequence {{of not being able to}} seek reparation from Japan. In addition to this, in 1988 the New Zealand Government issued reparations for those who were prisoners of war in Germany during World War Two and not those in Japan, which Drake alleged was discrimination. In both complaints the events themselves occurred before New Zealand was a party to the First Optional Protocol and so was inadmissible ratione temporis. Even if this were not the case, the claim would have been unsubstantiated as the <b>alleged</b> <b>discrimination</b> was not on any of the listed categories of discrimination of the ICCPR and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the Committee.|$|E

2500|$|Transgender individuals, whether male-to-female, female-to-male, or genderqueer, often {{experience}} transphobic {{problems that}} {{often lead to}} dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them. Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as [...] "women's jobs". One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.

2500|$|There are {{federal laws}} {{addressing}} fair employment practices, and this also concerns performance appraisal (PA). [...] Discrimination can occur within predictions {{of performance and}} evaluations of job behaviors. [...] The revision of many court cases has revealed the involvement of <b>alleged</b> <b>discrimination</b> which was often linked to {{the assessment of the}} employee’s job performance. [...] Some of the laws which protect individuals against discrimination are [...] "the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)." [...] Lawsuits may also results from charges of an employer’s negligence, defamation, and/or misrepresentation. [...] A few appraisal criteria to keep in mind for a legally sound PA is to keep the content of the appraisal objective, job-related, behavior-based, within the control of the ratee, and related to specific functions rather than a global assessment. [...] Some appraisal procedure suggestions for a legally sound PA is to standardize operations, communicate formally with employees, provide information of performance deficits and give opportunities to employees to correct those deficits, give employees access to appraisal results, provide written instructions for the training of raters, and use multiple, diverse and unbiased raters. [...] These are valuable but not exhaustive lists of recommendations for PAs.|$|E
