5|$|On December 13, 1960, while Haile Selassie {{was on a}} {{state visit}} to Brazil, Imperial Guard forces led by Mengistu began an {{unsuccessful}} coup and briefly proclaimed Selassie's eldest son Asfaw Wossen Taffari emperor. Fighting {{took place in the}} heart of Addis Ababa, shells detonated in the Jubilee Palace, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> closest to the emperor were killed. Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled.|$|E

The goal of the organization is to create awareness regarding the plight of Northern Ugandans who {{are caught in the}} midst of a civil war between the government and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army. Bell has also done a public service announcement for Do Something's Healthy Living Campaign. In 2014, Bell launched a Prizeo campaign offering fans a chance to win a date with her in return for donating to Invisible Children.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} film, the film's {{marketers}} continued the trend established during Skyfalls production of releasing still images of clapperboards and video blogs on Eon's official social media accounts. 17 brands {{appear in the}} film through product placement, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> such as Heineken, Bollinger, Omega and Sony – owner of the film's co-distributor Columbia Pictures – did Spectre tie-in advertisements.|$|E

50|$|El-Naggar {{published}} {{more than}} 150 scientific studies and articles, none of them peer reviewed, and 45 books in Arabic, English <b>and</b> French. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> publications deal with what {{are considered to be}} scientific miracles in Qur'an.|$|R
5|$|Various {{substances}} {{have been}} used as shoe polish for hundreds of years, starting with natural substances such as wax and tallow. Modern polish formulas were introduced early in the 20th century <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> original formulations are still in use today. Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials, including naphtha, turpentine, dyes, and gum arabic, using straightforward chemical engineering processes. Shoe polish is usually flammable, can be toxic, and, if misused, can stain skin. It should be used in a well-ventilated area with care taken to protect clothes, carpet and furniture.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{had long}} {{experience}} in the chancery, but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard's ransom. As evidence of this emphasis on raising money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions. Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices {{from a wide range}} of backgrounds, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> sent out on itinerent rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances' successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the Exchequer, or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.|$|E
5|$|During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences {{along the}} coasts of England {{to protect against the}} {{possibility}} of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E

5|$|According to Bruce, {{men were}} needed to allow Australia's {{extensive}} resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia's land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia {{had the potential to}} be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys ("passages"). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce's settlement plan rested on rural growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their willingness to work on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their investment on rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia's rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England's) <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled. Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the White Australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets.|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{advocates for}} radical reform in justice systems {{have called for}} a public policy {{adoption}} of non-punitive, non-violent Restorative Justice methods, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> studying the success of these methods, including a , have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace.

25|$|After {{independence}} was gained after the Algerian War the Harkis (Muslims {{who supported the}} French during the war) were seen as traitors by many Algerians, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who stayed behind suffered severe reprisals after independence.

25|$|Jews {{were banned}} from German {{printing}} guilds; {{as a result}} Hebrew printing sprang up in Italy, beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua.

25|$|The Restoration moderated most of {{the more}} strident sectarian writing, but radicalism persisted after the Restoration. Puritan authors such as John Milton were forced to retire from public life or adapt, and those Diggers, Fifth Monarchist, Leveller, Quaker, and Anabaptist authors who had preached against monarchy and who had participated {{directly}} in the regicide of Charles I were partially suppressed. Consequently, violent writings were forced underground, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who {{had served in the}} Interregnum attenuated their positions in the Restoration.|$|E
