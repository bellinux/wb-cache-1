5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent.

Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E
6000|$|... [28] [The [...] "trivial particular" [...] which {{suggested}} to Byron the friendlessness and desolation of the Childe {{may be explained}} by the refusal of an old schoolfellow to spend the last day with him before he set out on his travels. The friend, possibly Lord Delawarr, excused himself on the plea that [...] "he was engaged with his mother and some ladies to go shopping." [...] "Friendship!" [...] he exclaimed to Dallas. [...] "I do not believe I shall leave behind me, yourself and family excepted, and, perhaps, my mother, a single being who will care what becomes of me" [...] (Dallas, Recollections, etc., pp. 63, 64). Byron, to quote Charles Lamb's apology for Coleridge, was [...] "full of fun," [...] and must not be taken too seriously. Doubtless he was piqued at the moment, and afterwards, to heighten the tragedy of Childe Harold's exile, expanded a single <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> into general abandonment and desertion at the hour of trial.] ...|$|E
50|$|The SCA {{held that}} the general rule was that a {{principal}} was not liable for the wrongs committed by an independent contractor or its employees. The courts have, however, been extending the principal's liability for the acts of independent contractors: a tendency which, if unchecked, {{would result in the}} creation of vicarious responsibility for every <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> performed by an independent contractor in the course of doing the work, thus effacing the distinction between principal and independent contractor.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that both drivers had been negligent, and that the <b>negligence</b> <b>of</b> each was equally to blame. Vorster had been volens in respect of the {{mechanical}} hazards, over which the drivers had no reasonable or immediate control; {{he had not been}} volens, however, in respect <b>of</b> the <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> {{on the part of the}} two drivers. The court found, on the evidence, that the collision had been caused by these <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> not by any defects in the cars themselves; accordingly, the defence of volenti non fit injuria failed.|$|R

The Court held that an LLC does not protect a manager or member {{from their own}} individual <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> Therefore, the Court directed the district court to vacate because, “the varieties of fraud and injustice that the alter ego doctrine was designed to redress can be equally exploited through limited liability companies. ...|$|R
50|$|An {{intervening}} cause {{is an event}} that occurs after a tortfeasor's initial <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> and causes injury/harm to a victim. An {{intervening cause}} will generally absolve the tortfeasor of liability for the victim's injury only if the event is deemed a superseding cause. A superseding cause is an unforeseeable intervening cause. By contrast, a foreseeable intervening cause typically does not break the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible for the victim's injury—unless the event leads to an unforeseeable result.|$|E
5000|$|Concurrent causes. Where two {{separate}} acts of negligence combine to cause {{an injury to}} a third party, each actor is liable. For example, a construction worker negligently leaves the cover off a manhole, and a careless driver negligently clips a pedestrian, forcing the pedestrian {{to fall into the}} open manhole. Both the construction worker and the careless driver are equally liable for the injury to the pedestrian. This example obeys the but for test. The injury could have been avoided by the elimination of either <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> thus each is a but for cause of the injury.|$|E
5000|$|One day, the {{kidnapper}} {{call the}} father of Cheeku to convey {{a message to the}} Home Minister that the kidnapper has kidnapped the son of the Home Minister on purpose. His demand is that he wants his son, who was lost in an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> by the government, be found. It is then revealed that Nirmal had a happy family with his son, Apu (short for Apurva), after his wife left them. Apu died when a bridge collapsed on him on his way to school. Moved and depressed by his loss, Nirmal decided to seek revenge from the politicians and others {{responsible for the death of}} his son.|$|E

50|$|Under the 1980 law, these offenses were {{punishable}} when {{criminal liability}} could be ascribed. Criminal liability {{was attributed to}} intentional offenses and those <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> specifically provided for by the law. There were principal and supplementary penalties. Principal penalties were public surveillance, detention, fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death. Supplementary penalties were fines, deprivation of political rights, and confiscation of property. Supplementary penalties could be imposed exclusive of principal penalties. Foreigners could be deported with or without other penalties.|$|R
50|$|Sufficient {{combined}} causes. Where {{an injury}} results from two separate <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> either <b>of</b> {{which would have}} been sufficient to cause the injury, both actors are liable. For example, two campers {{in different parts of the}} woods negligently leave their campfires unattended. A forest fire results, but the same amount of property damage would have resulted from either fire. Both campers are equally liable for all damage. A famous case establishing this principle in the United States is Corey v. Havener.|$|R

50|$|The Kommandobefehl ("Commando Order") {{was issued}} by Adolf Hitler on 18 October 1942 stating that all Allied commandos {{encountered}} by German forces in Europe and Africa should be killed immediately without trial, even in proper uniforms {{or if they}} attempted to surrender. Any commando or small group of commandos or a similar unit, agents, and saboteurs not in proper uniforms, who fell {{into the hands of}} the German military forces by some means other than direct combat (through the police in occupied territories, for instance) were to be handed over immediately to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Security Service).

5000|$|The {{case was}} heard by Lord Moncrieff in the Outer House on 27 June 1930. In his judgment, {{delivered}} {{on the same}} day, he held that, as a general principle, there should be liability for negligent preparation of food.I am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes {{ought not to be}} heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products, as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage {{in the course of the}} process of manufacture ... Tainted food when offered for sale is, in my opinion, amongst the most subtly potent of 'dangerous goods', and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty. I fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> and does not advertise itself, should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty, or afford him a supplementary defence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{charges against}} Rokossovsky {{stemmed from the}} case of the [...] "Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Military Organization of the 11th Mechanized Corps" [...] where Rokossovsky was implicated after the arrest of Corps Commander K.A. Tchaikovsky who, like Rokossovsky, served in the far east in the early 1930s. The Intelligence Chief of the Transbaikal Military District accused Rokossovsky of meeting with Colonel Komatsubara the head of the Japanese {{military}} mission in Harbin in 1932, when he was commander of the 15th Cavalry Division in Trans-Baikal; a fact that Rokossovsky did not dispute but justified as a meeting to resolve issues regarding Chinese prisoners. This accusation was supported with material charges, which included various <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> <b>of</b> command that were interpreted as deliberate <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> sabotage, such as allowing the quarters of his division to become slovenly, failing to conduct training, and leading his division out into bad weather causing losses of horses and encouraging sickness among his troops.|$|R

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the disaster, the organizer of the festival announced that no further Love Parades would be held and that the festival was permanently cancelled. Criminal charges were brought against ten employees of the city of Duisburg and of the company that organized the event, but eventually rejected by the court due to the prosecutors' failure to establish evidence for the alleged <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> and their causal connection to the deaths. On the 24th April 2017 the State Supreme Court Dusseldorf (Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf) stated that it would be reopening court proceedings for prosecution of 10 people involved in planning the event, accusing them of negligent homicide and mayhem.|$|R
50|$|The {{status of}} the {{claimant}} in an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> {{can result in a}} duty of care arising where it would not normally - {{as is the case with}} rescuers - or prevent a duty of care existing altogether. Claims that a doctor may owe a mother a duty of care to advise against child birth, and claims that police may owe an individual involved in criminal behavior a duty of care, have been barred. In McKay v Essex Area Health Authority, a child's claim that a doctor should have advised his mother to seek an abortion was struck out; Whilst the Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act allows a course of action where negligence is the cause of a disability, wrongful life has remained barred for policy reasons. Similarly, where a criminal attempted to escape police capture in Vellino v Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police, his claim that they owed him a duty of care not to let him escape after they had arrested him was branded 'absurd'.|$|E

5000|$|Though these {{soldiers}} could be legally jailed or executed by most armies a century ago, {{the experience of}} World War II influenced nations occupied by foreign forces {{to change the law}} to protect this group. Many of the post-war victors, such as France, Poland, and the USSR, had the experience of resistance fighters being summarily executed by the Axis if they were captured. The war also influenced them to make sure that commandos and other special forces who were caught deep behind enemy lines would be protected as POWs, rather than summarily executed as Hitler decreed through his 1942 Commando Order.The Commando Order was issued by Adolf Hitler on October 18, 1942, stating that all Allied commandos encountered by German forces in Europe and Africa should be killed immediately without trial, even in proper uniforms or if they attempted to surrender.

40|$|Due to the {{powerful}} nature of confession evidence, {{it is imperative that}} we investigate the factors that affect the likelihood of obtaining true and false confessions. Previous research has been conducted with a paradigm limited to the study of false confessions to an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings. The first goal of the current study was to introduce a novel paradigm involving a more serious, intentional act {{that can be used in}} the study of both true and false confessions. The second goal was to explore the effects of two police interrogation tactics, minimization and an offer of leniency, on true and false confession rates. ^ Three hundred and thirty-four undergraduates at a large southeastern university were recruited to participate in a study on problem-solving and decision-making. During the course of the laboratory experiment, participants were induced to intentionally break or not break an experimental rule, an act that was characterized as “cheating. ” All participants (i. e., both innocent and guilty) were later accused of the act and interrogated. For half of the participants, the interrogator used minimization tactics, which involved downplaying the seriousness of the offense, expressing sympathy, and providing face-saving excuses, in order to encourage the participant to confess. An offer of leniency was also manipulated in which half the participants were offered a “deal” that involved the option of confessing and accepting a known punishment or not confessing and facing the threat of harsher punishment. Results indicated that guilty persons were more likely to confess than innocent persons, and that the use of minimization and an explicit offer of leniency increased both the true and false confession rates. Furthermore, a cumulative effect of techniques was observed, such that the diagnosticity of the interrogation (the ratio of true confessions to false confessions) decreased as the number of techniques used increased. Taken together, the results suggest that caution should be used when implementing these techniques in the interrogation room. ...|$|E

The practical consequence of this regime change is to place the risk of the uncollectible share upon the innocent plaintiff.

It is an {{experiment}} in modifying the tools of architecture (drawing, spatializing, visualizing) with ecological methods and content in order to increase the capacity of built design for evoking the distinctive character of place, in this case, Land's End in San Francisco, California. Land's End is a park that acts as a border between the city and the ocean, and has historically hosted a strange mix of human activities that resonate with the dark, changeable, and ebullient natural forces much in evidence in this locality. Instead of attempting to tame, preserve or even enhance these shifting, unpredictable human and natural activities, a dually-natured infrastructure is proposed. This infrastructure would not only help provide basic services and support for the restless, shifting, memorable events that take place on this unique site, but more importantly, begin to shift their legibility from <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> short sightedness or abandonment to <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> sacrificial return...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} {{an investigation into}} whether it is justifiable to punish deaths resulting from gross negligence within the criminal law. The analysis centres around incidents <b>of</b> gross <b>negligence</b> manslaughter that arise in a medical setting as {{a majority of the}} leading cases in the area arose in this context. The findings are then applied to incidents <b>of</b> gross <b>negligence</b> manslaughter arising in different contexts in an attempt to assess the validity <b>of</b> punishing such <b>acts.</b> An assessment <b>of</b> the harm principle takes place in order to establish whether <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> particularly gross negligence manslaughter, are rightfully considered morally blameworthy by the criminal law. This assessment is supplemented by an in-depth analysis of the legal test applied to establish criminal culpability for the offence. Thought is then given to exploring whether society stands to gain anything from inflicting punishment for the offence. There are four main findings derived from the analysis that takes place. Primarily, it is argued that those who are negligent when acting in a professional position or when performing in a position of responsibility are actors who are morally blameworthy for the results of their actions. Secondly, that the legal test applied is effective in establishing those who should be seen as criminally culpable, as well as morally culpable. Thirdly, that society stands to gain from punishing the criminally culpable negligent actor. Fourthly, that negligence committed by those who are not holding themselves out as a competent individual is not justifiably punishable. ...|$|R
