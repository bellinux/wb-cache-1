The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E

Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W.

Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as Las Meninas.

5|$|Examination of the Deinonychus egg's {{microstructure}} {{confirms that}} {{it belonged to}} a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, the egg of Deinonychus is more {{similar to those of}} oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7cm (2.7in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2cm diameter of the largest Citipati (an oviraptorid) eggs; Citipati and Deinonychus also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of Citipati and Deinonychus eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> {{as that of the}} hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{independent}} non-intersecting cylindrical pore {{nature of}} SBA- 15 materials represents, in principle, a very adequate experimental system {{to analyze the}} N 2 sorption scanning behavior according to the theorems of the Independent Domain Theory of Sorption Hysteresis. In this work, SBA- 15 materials of two general types have been synthesized: (i) substrates made by hexagonal arrays of cylinders of <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sizes,</b> and (ii) solids including a relatively wide distribution of cylindrical pores of varying diameters arranged in a fairly distorted hexagonal packing. Boundary and primary N 2 sorption scanning curves have been experimentally determined on all these materials in order to observe the possible irruption of cooperative processes during the filling and emptying of tubular SBA- 15 pores. Pore domain complexion diagrams (i. e. graphs indicating the amount of pore sizes that are occupied by condensate or vapor) have been constructed by means of Non-Local Density Functional Theory calculations of the pore-size distributions that are incumbent to both boundary and primary scanning curves. It has been inferred that two phenomena branded as advanced adsorption and single pore-blocking can take place in reason of the undulating cross-section nature of some SBA- 15 tube materials; the extents of the above irreversible processes depending {{on the degree of}} sinuosity of the cross sections of the tubes...|$|R
