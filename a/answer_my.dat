2500|$|... "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bob Dylan in 1962 and {{released}} as a single and on his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan in 1963. Although it {{has been described as}} a protest song, it poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war and freedom. The refrain [...] "The <b>answer,</b> <b>my</b> friend, is blowin' in the wind" [...] has been described as [...] "impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind".|$|E

2500|$|MacDonald {{summarized}} what {{he considered}} {{the prospect of a}} fair representation by the SPLC's Beirich: [...] "Given Ms Beirich's poor record in accurately portraying my writings, I had no confidence that she would conduct and report on an interview with me in a non-biased way. Nevertheless, I offered to be interviewed by her if she would <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> concerns about her previous writing about me. She has not responded to this offer." [...] MacDonald specifically named six points which he demands Beirich address before he grants her an interview, in a series of emails between himself and her, published on his website.|$|E
2500|$|In those days, hotel lobbies were {{typically}} elaborately furnished {{and used as}} meeting places, so situations with persons seeking each other were not uncommon. Biow and Lyons had apparently been unnoticed by the 22-year-old bellboy, when, according to the legend, Biow approached him and paid Johnny a dollar to page a [...] "Mr. Philip Morris" [...] throughout the lobby. The small bellboy repeatedly cried out [...] "Call for Philip Morris" [...] in his distinctive high-pitched voice, several times, not knowing {{that there was no}} such person. He did not realize that he had been essentially performing an audition. [...] "I went around the lobby yelling my head off," [...] Johnny recalled later, [...] "but Philip Morris didn't <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> call." [...] Roventini initially thought that his call had been both legitimate and unsuccessful. He was soon to learn that he had been wrong on both counts. He was later quoted in Variety: [...] "I had no idea that Philip Morris was a cigarette." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
