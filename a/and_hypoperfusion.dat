5000|$|The broad term, [...] "stroke" [...] can {{be divided}} into three categories: brain ischemia, subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} and intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain ischemia can be further subdivided, by cause, into thrombotic, embolic, <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion.</b> [...] Thrombotic and embolic are generally focal or multifocal in nature while hypoperfusion affects the brain globally.|$|E
50|$|Complications include pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade, pleuritis, and {{pulmonary}} infiltration. Of these {{cardiac tamponade}} {{is the most}} life-threatening complication. The pericardial fluid increases intra-pericardial pressure therefore preventing complete expansion of the atria and the ventricles upon the diastole. This causes equilibration of the pressure in all four heart chambers, and results in the common findings of the tamponade which are pulsus paradoxus, Beck's triad of hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and JVD, as well as EKG or Holter monitor findings such as electrical alternans. Physically the patients who progress to severe pericardial tamponade obtundate, become mentally altered, and lethargic. If left untreated, severe cardiac output decrease, vascular collapse, <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion</b> of body including the brain results in death.|$|E

50|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex forms {{connections with}} dorsolateral prefrontal cortex meaning prefrontal regions have strong connections with limbic structures. This {{can be seen in}} the following study conducted by Eslinger et al. A woman with bilateral encephalomalacia had a damaged medial thalamus and showed behavioral problems including utilization behavior. She conducted unnecessary motor use of objects in her immediate environment. The effect of the damage to the paramedian thalamic region did not astonish researchers because of its connection to the cingulate cortex. Thalamic infarctions have produced hypometabolism, a decrease in metabolic rate, in the frontal areas <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion</b> resulting in UB. The patient was marked with the behavior, and brain imaging noticed the infarctions in the thalamus.|$|E
50|$|Abdominocentesis usually {{reveals a}} yellow, turbid fluid with an {{increased}} {{white blood cell count}} (usually 5,000-10,000 cells/microliter) and protein level (>3.5 g/dl), although the fluid may be serosanginous in severe cases. A chemistry panel will often show electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia) due to electrolyte loss into the lumen of the intestine. Leukocytes may be normal, increased, or decreased. PCV and total protein are usually both increased due to fluid loss, and the horse displays a prerenal azotemia. On the chemistry panel, liver enzymes such as GGT, ALP, AST are increased, likely due to ascending infection from the common bile duct, endotoxin absorption, <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion.</b> A metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap is often seen due to loss of bicarbonate in gastric reflux and an increase in lactic acid in the blood, secondary to hypovolemia and decreased tissue perfusion.|$|E

Materials and methods: Both phenomena were reproduced by using a rat model of global cerebral ischemia.

40|$|Accurate {{definition}} and {{better understanding of}} the mechanisms of stroke are crucial as this will guide the effective care and therapy. In this paper, we review the previous basic and clinical researches on the causes or mechanisms of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases (ICVD) and interpret the correlation between embolism <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion</b> based on vascular stenosis and arterial intimal lesions. It was suggested that if there is no embolus (dynamic or in situ emboli), there might be no cerebral infarction. Three kinds of different clinical outcomes of TIA were theoretically interpreted based on its mechanisms. We suppose that there is a correlation between embolism <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion,</b> and which mechanisms (hypoperfusion or hypoperfusion induced microemboli) playing the dominant role in each type of ICVD depends on the unique background of arterial intimal lesions (the vulnerability of vessels). That is to say, the vulnerability of vessels is involved in the role of embolism <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion</b> in the mechanisms of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. This inference might enrich and provide better understandings for the underlying etiologies of ischemic cerebrovascular events...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE Within {{the context}} of a {{prospective}} randomized trial (SWIFT PRIME), we assessed whether early imaging of stroke patients, primarily with computed tomography (CT) perfusion, can estimate the size of the irreversibly injured ischemic core and the volume of critically hypoperfused tissue.

METHODS Baseline ischemic core <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion</b> volumes were assessed prior to randomized treatment with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) alone versus IV tPA + endovascular therapy (Solitaire stent-retriever) using RAPID automated postprocessing software.

Methods We studied 55 consecutive patients with acute (< 12 hours) carotid infarct within 36 hours of symptom onset with SPECT. Clinical presentation was assessed by the Canadian Neurological Scale and stroke subtypes. SPECT indices were the degree <b>and</b> size of <b>hypoperfusion</b> <b>and</b> crossed cerebellar diaschisis as assessed by a semiquantitative analysis.

Results The Rankin Scale score correlated with the degree (r=. 580; P<. 00001) and size (r=. 616; P<. 00001) of hypoperfusion. The mean degree <b>and</b> size of <b>hypoperfusion</b> were significantly higher in patients with poor outcome. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis had no significant predictive value. Statistical analysis determined threshold values for the Canadian Neurological Scale score and the degree <b>and</b> size of <b>hypoperfusion</b> for the functional status and mortality. The degree <b>and</b> size of <b>hypoperfusion</b> had no higher performance than the Canadian Neurological Scale score.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Elevated middle {{cerebral}} erythrocyte velocities {{and tissue}} hypoperfusion have been correlated with delayed ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage, but {{few studies have}} compared serial arterial velocities with cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits. Methods: Serial measurements of middle cerebral velocities, using transcranial Doppler ultrasonogra-phy, were performed in 34 patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage and correlated with cerebral blood flow, measured in 20 of the 34 using single-photon emission computed tomography with technetium- 99 m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime and neurological evidence of delayed ischemia. Results: In 16 patients without delayed ischemia, eight had evidence of vasospasm (> 120 cm/sec), but only one of seven had hypoperfusion, suggesting that vasospasm might be more common than hypoperfusion in this group (p= 0. 1). In 10 patients with delayed ischemia and a lateralizing deficit, both asymmetrical middle cerebral vasospasm (eight of nine with vasospasm) <b>and</b> <b>hypoperfusion</b> (six of six studied) were concordant with the clinically ischemic hemisphere (p< 0. 05).

30|$|Off-pump CABG (OPCAB) {{has been}} {{expected}} to have a lower incidence of AKI than on-pump CABG (ONCAB), as CPB has been proven to cause an inflammatory response, lack of pulsatile flow, hemodilution, atheroembolism, hemolysis, low output syndrome, <b>and</b> global <b>hypoperfusion,</b> which may lead to postoperative complications. However, the benefit of OPCAB for AKI remains controversial. Several studies have reported that patients with OPCAB have a lower incidence of AKI than those with ONCAB [10 – 14]; yet, other studies could not find any significant difference between OPCAB and ONCAB [15 – 18]. Possible explanations for a high incidence of AKI in OPCAB include hemodynamically induced renal ischemia, atheroembolism from side clamping, and a technical difficulty requiring heart displacement. Instead of using CPB, OPCAB requires heart displacement during anastomosis of grafts, potentially resulting in intraoperative hemodynamic instability <b>and</b> global <b>hypoperfusion</b> [19]. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between intraoperative hemodynamic instability and the incidence of AKI after OPCAB [20 – 24].|$|R
