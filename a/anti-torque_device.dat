500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device,</b> such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{developed}} as a replacement to Aérospatiale's Alouette helicopter, {{some aspects of the}} Gazelle such as its purpose and layout were based on the previous model. The Gazelle featured several important innovations. It was the first helicopter to carry a fenestron or fantail; this is a shrouded multi-blade <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device</b> housed internally upon the vertical surface of the Gazelle's tail, which replaces a conventional tail rotor entirely. The fenestron, while requiring a small increase in power at slow speeds, has advantages such as being considerably less vulnerable and low power requirements during cruise speeds, and has been described as [...] "far more suitable for high-speed flight".|$|E
2500|$|The EC135 is a {{twin-engine}} rotorcraft. It can be alternatively {{powered by}} a pair of Turbomeca Arrius 2B or Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206B engines, dependent on customer's preference. [...] The main rotor is of a four-bladed, hingeless fiber-composite design; progressive improvements to the main rotor have increased its performance and reduced maintenance costs since the type's introduction. The EC135 holds the distinction of being the quietest helicopter in its class, featuring an anti-resonance isolation system to dampen vibration from the main rotor. The type's fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device</b> can be actively regulated via a HI NR rotor optimization mode, which provides for greater controllability during higher weight take-off and landings. It is capable of performing Category A operations throughout its full flight envelope.|$|E
25|$|Two {{improved}} variants, the EC135 T3 and EC135 P3, {{were developed}} with improved high altitude and hover performance. Changes include repositioned air intakes to the engines, wider blades being {{installed on the}} main rotor, and changes to the fenstron <b>anti-torque</b> tail <b>device.</b> The EC135 T3 was introduced to service in December 2014.|$|R
50|$|The AS565 Panther is a {{twin-engine}} medium-sized multi-mission rotorcraft. It {{is capable}} of performing various naval and land-based missions, such as maritime security, search and rescue (SAR), casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), vertical replenishment, surveillance, special forces operations, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and Anti-surface warfare (ASuW). The Panther {{is powered by a}} pair of Turbomeca Arriel turboshaft engines, which drives the rotorcraft's main rotor as well as the fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> tail rotor <b>device.</b> The flight profile of the Panther has been described as being easy to manoeuver, possessing generous g-force limitations and a high level of stability.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} MH-65 is its fenestron ducted-fan <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device.</b> The fenestron consists of 11 blades spinning inside a circular housing {{at the base of}} the helicopter's tail fin.|$|E
50|$|The Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) EC130 is {{a single}} engine light utility {{helicopter}} developed from the earlier Eurocopter AS350 Écureuil, {{one of the primary}} changes from which was the adoption of a Fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device</b> in place of a conventional tail rotor. It was launched and produced by the Eurocopter Group, which would later be rebranded as Airbus Helicopters.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{development}} of the new rotorcraft continued under Eurocopter, Aerospatiale having merged into the multinational Eurocopter organisation. On 24 June 1999, the first prototype EC130 performed its first flight, being flown from an airfield in France by Steven Page, an Australian test pilot. Major changes from the preceding AS350 included {{the adoption of a}} dual-hydraulic system, the enclosed Fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device,</b> and a wide main body to provide for a cabin with considerably greater internal space.|$|E
50|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were made}} {{with the introduction of}} the SA 365 N1, which had a substantially redesigned Fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device,</b> and with the SA 365 N2, which was equipped with more powerful Turbomeca Arriel 1C2 turboshaft engines. In January 1990, the overall type was formally redesignated as the AS365. The AS365 Dauphin is one of Eurocopter's more successful helicopter designs; and has been widely used as a corporate transport, airborne law enforcement platform, emergency medical services (EMS) helicopter, electronic news gathering platform, and search & rescue helicopter.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-performance}} AS365 N3 {{was developed}} for operations in 'hot and high' climates, and introduced 635 kW (851 shp) Arriel 2C turboshafts equipped with a single channel DECU (Digital Engine Control Unit) with manual reversion, mated to an uprated main transmission for better single engine performance. The AS365 N3 also features a redesigned ten blade composite Fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device</b> with asymmetric blade distribution, offering a further reduction in noise signature. The AS365 N3's gross weight is 4300 kg. Production deliveries began in December 1998 and this version is currently still in production. Also manufactured in Brazil by Helibras.|$|E

50|$|A twin-engined {{version of}} the Dauphin, {{designated}} as the Dauphin 2, was announced in early 1973. The first prototype's first flight took place on 24 January 1975; production model deliveries began in December 1978. In comparison with the earlier model, the SA 365 C featured twin 470 kW (630 shp) Arriel 1 turboshafts in a new engine fairing, a Starflex main rotor hub and a higher maximum take-off weight (3400 kg or 7,495 lb). Its Fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device</b> featured 13 metal blades. Production of both the SA 360 and SA 365 C ceased in 1981, by which time approximately 40 SA 360s and 50 SA 365 C/C1s had been built; both were replaced by the SA 365 N.|$|E

5000|$|The EC130 is {{a single}} engine helicopter. It uses an automatically-varying three-bladed Starflex main rotor which is matched to an {{enclosed}} tail fan <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device,</b> known as a Fenestron, the latter feature replacing the traditional tail rotor found on the older AS350. The Fenestron has unevenly spaced blades to reduce noise generation by 50% compared to a tail rotor; this enabled an FAA Appendix H fly-over noise signature of 84.3 EPNdB, 8.5 dB below stage two limits. The EC130 uses the Turbomeca Arriel 2D turboshaft engine; the performance of this powerplant {{has led to the}} type having been described as possessing [...] "better power margins and range than competing models, particularly in hot and high conditions". The EC130 T2's enhanced Arriel engine is equipped with Full Authority Digital Engine Controls; a dual hydraulic system derived from the Eurocopter AS355 was also adopted.|$|E
40|$|The Ornicopter is {{a single}} rotor {{helicopter}} that uses forced flapping of the blades to propel the rotor and thus to prevent a reaction torque from arising on the fuselage. By changing the am-plitude of this forced flapping motion, the yaw movement of the fuselage can be controlled. As a result, the Ornicopter {{does not require a}} tail ro-tor or a similar <b>anti-torque</b> <b>device.</b> In order to limit the loads that arise on the blades due to forced flapping, and to prevent con-trollability problems, some amount of blade flap-ping freedom is required. Up to now, flapping freedom was provided by blade flexibility, but this implies that a large bending moment is in-troduced in the blade root. In the current paper an alternative solution is presented, one that gets rid of the root bending moment altogether {{and at the same time}} allows free flapping on top of the forced flapping motion. Basic trim equations for the alternative con-figuration are derived, based on a planar model of a rigid blade rotating at constant tip speed. The hub loads in the flapping plane are analyzed and the results are compared with existing Ornicopter theory for rigid blades. Proof of concept is pro-vided with the help of a small electric model ro-tor. The main advantage of the new configuration turns out to be the more beneficial blade loading, which may even allow the use of conventional he-licopter rotor blades. The positive influence on hub loads only becomes significant for relatively large Lock numbers...|$|E
