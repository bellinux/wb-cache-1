5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Sharpeville {{massacre}} in 1960, Makeba {{learned that her}} mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Puritan poetry {{was highly}} religious, {{and one of}} the {{earliest}} books of poetry published was the Bay Psalm Book, a set of translations of the biblical Psalms; however, the translators' intention was not to create literature, but to create hymns {{that could be used in}} worship. Among lyric poets, the most important figures are Anne Bradstreet, who wrote personal poems <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> and homelife; pastor Edward Taylor, whose best poems, the Preparatory Meditations, were written to help him prepare for leading worship; and Michael Wigglesworth, whose best-selling poem, The Day of Doom (1660), describes the time of judgment. It was published in the same year that anti-Puritan Charles II was restored to the British throne. He followed it two years later with God's Controversy With New England. Nicholas Noyes was also known for his doggerel verse.|$|E

500|$|Manning {{was educated}} privately {{at a small}} dame school {{before moving to the}} north of Ireland in 1916, the first of several {{extended}} periods spent there while her father was at sea. In Bangor she attended Bangor Presbyterian School, and while in Portsmouth Lyndon House School, and subsequently Portsmouth Grammar School, developing, as she recalled, [...] "the usual Anglo-Irish sense of belonging nowhere". Schoolmates described her as shy and prone to tantrums; her tendency to tell boastful tall-tales <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> led to ostracism by her peers. Supported by her father, Manning read and wrote extensively, preferring novels, especially those by H. Rider Haggard. Her mother discouraged such pursuits, and confiscated material she thought unsuitable; when she found her daughter reading the Times Literary Supplement she scolded that [...] "young men do not like women who read papers like that", and that Manning should focus on marketable job skills, such as typing.|$|E

According to Susie Abadilla, who took the same vocal sessions together with Imelda, she was not so friendly, and the reason presumably stemmed from the strict and busy routines back then, and her reluctance to talk <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> and her past. Due to the suggestion of having a performance, which became the first and last performance in a music hall from her cousin, Loreto, in Holy Ghost College, she performed three songs, [...] "Calm is the Night", [...] "Sin Tu Amor", and [...] "False Prophet".|$|E
