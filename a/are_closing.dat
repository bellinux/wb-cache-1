In turn, Lowes Foods would take the six Harris Teeter locations that <b>are</b> <b>closing</b> and be compensated $26.5million. Harris Teeter cited this decision was based on focusing their stores on larger, urbanized and more upscale areas rather than rural, middle-market areas. In turn, Lowes Foods stated that their core is shifting to {{the western part of}} North Carolina, and away from Charlotte. However, industry analysts speculate that these changes are happening due to the impending expansion of Publix into the Charlotte market.|$|E

500|$|The party {{return to}} antiquity and defeat Dalton. King Zeal nears the {{fruition}} of his plan, but Melchior and Belthasar enter {{the time period}} to dissuade him. King Zeal leaves the Sun Stone, the trigger for the revival of Zeal, with a follower {{and walks to the}} North Cape. He reveals that Lavos survived defeat in Chrono Trigger and clung to life in the Darkness Beyond Time. He used the Frozen Flame to revive King Zeal, manipulating him to take revenge on the heroes. He is now merging with Schala, as he has done with all the other [...] "Arbiters" [...] who have used the Frozen Flame throughout history. Lavos calls King Zeal, intending to merge with him as well and evolve to become the Dream Devourer (as seen in Chrono Trigger DS). The party convince Zeal's followers not to activate the Sun Stone, and pursue Zeal to the Darkness Beyond Time. King Zeal confronts them once more, revealing his will is stronger than that of Lavos; he'll merge, but become the dominant personality within the Dream Devourer and create a new Zeal using its vast power. The party defeat him and return to Chronopolis. They notice the planet's Gates <b>are</b> <b>closing</b> again, and depart to their homes, promising to stay in touch. Belthasar meanwhile reveals he has the Frozen Flame, which activates and informs him that Lavos is still alive and will become the Time Devourer, the enemy of Chrono Cross. It challenges Belthasar to a grand game, and he begins drawing up plans for Project Kid. The game closes with King Zeal, shown to be alive and imprisoned by Magus in 11,995B.C., who forces him to teach advanced temporal magic.|$|E
