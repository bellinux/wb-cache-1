50|$|Courts {{of civil}} <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> Texas were {{established}} in 1891 by constitutional amendment to help handle the increasing load of the court system. They had jurisdiction to hear appeals and mandamus of any civil case from their region, with the regions decided by the legislature. The amendment provided that three-judge courts of appeals were to be created by legislature, and in 1892, the legislature created 3 courts of appeals: The First Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Galveston, the Second Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Fort Worth, and the Third Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Austin. In 1893, the legislature created the Fourth Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> San Antonio out of territory taken from {{the first and third}} courts, and the Fifth Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Dallas. In 1907, the legislature created the Sixth Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Texarkana. Then in 1911, the Seventh Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Amarillo and the Eighth Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> El Paso were created. Soon after that, the Ninth Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> was created <b>in</b> Beaumont in 1915, the Tenth was created in Waco in 1923, and the Eleventh was created in Eastland in 1925.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the use of {{emotional}} <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> loan advertisements and compare it to the use of emotional <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> savings advertisements. A content analysis of 304 advertisements from nine UK newspapers revealed that the most frequently used emotional <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> loan advertisements are the following positive emotional appeals: relief, security, and excitement. The use of negative emotional appeals such as guilt, fear, and sorrow was sporadic. Loan advertisements featured more appeals than savings advertisements. Further research will focus on analysing tag lines and images featured in the sample advertisements, and exploring consumers’ responses to, and their understanding of emotional <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> those advertisements...|$|R

All appealed to overturn their sentence. The sentences of Chen, Czugaj, Nguyen, Norman and Stephens stand at life imprisonment and Lawrence's sentence remains at 20 years after <b>appeal.</b> <b>In</b> May 2011, Rush's death sentence was reduced to life after he launched a final <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> August 2010.|$|E

40|$|The {{permanent}} {{presence of}} sexual information in Brazilian advertising, {{whether in the}} form of sexual behavior, use of attractive models, nudity, fetishism or promises of sexual satisfaction and intimacy, is not accompanied by the development of knowledge about the use of sexual <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> national advertising. The present paper aims to advance the understanding of consumer perceptions about the sexual <b>appeals</b> used <b>in</b> real ads and investigate relationships between the use of sexual <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> advertising and attitude towards advertising and consumer purchase intent. Thus, we performed a study on sexual <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> beer advertising with college students. Our product choice was {{based on the fact that}} the beer is widely consumed among young adults and because producers have a constant concern in developing new ads in order to maintain or even expand its market share. The data did not provide consistent answers regarding the use of sexual <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> advertisements for beer and purchase intent or attitude toward the advertisement, but served for a discussion on the sex appeal directly related to beer. Furthermore, the study provided some answers related to the identification of effective sex appeal, such as increased sensitivity of the female audience and implications related to the use of sexual <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> advertising relevant to practitioners and academics...|$|R

5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court, {{agreed to}} hear the state's <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> 2006, {{bypassing}} the intermediate court. To the surprise of spectators, there were almost no questions from the judges during oral argument, which took place on December 4, 2006, causing speculation that the court may have taken the appeal just to reverse the Circuit Court ruling. On September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for the plaintiffs in a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the Maryland Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action {{in a court of}} equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously been able to do so.|$|E
