5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices {{can also}} be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed. However, the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> tools of functional analysis can be used instead.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than the Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned {{for use in the}} Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|In Super Metroid, {{just after}} giving the {{hatchling}} to a Federation research station, Samus tracks the hatchling (stolen by Ridley) to a newly rebuilt Space Pirate base on Zebes. She travels deep underground, eventually finding the now-fully-grown Metroid, then battling a newly rebuilt <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Mother Brain. The Metroid hatchling sacrifices itself to save Samus, and Samus in turn defeats Mother Brain and escapes {{as the entire}} planet is destroyed.|$|E

Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads with longer muzzles.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide for diesel service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and were identical to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> HEP generator which had become standard. Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975–1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Dixon {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} his ship alongside the Spanish frigate {{and opened a}} heavy fire, to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside. The larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea, and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered. As Santa Dorotea veered off course, O'Neil passed Lion for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed {{to have an effect}} and again he came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13:10. Gerraro, his isolated ship trapped by Lion, which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender.|$|E
5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E
5|$|In Toraja society, {{the funeral}} ritual {{is the most}} {{elaborate}} and expensive event. The richer <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the aluk religion, only nobles {{have the right to}} have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called rante, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs and poems, and crying and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals for young children, and poor, low-status adults.|$|E

5|$|In most media appearances, pterosaurs {{are most}} often {{depicted}} as piscivores, a behaviour only a few groups actually had in reality. They are also often shown as aerial predators similar to birds of prey, grasping human victims with their taloned feet. No pterosaur species known so far possesses prehensile feet; all known pterosaurs have flat, plantigrade feet with no opposable toes, often poorly muscled and, {{in the case of}} pteranodontians, generally proportionally small. However, some pterosaurs might have had raptorial tendencies; Thalassodromeus possesses powerful jaws akin to those of phorusrhacids, and Hatzegopteryxs short neck <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> jaws have been interpreted as a speciation on larger prey.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man 6 is {{the first}} game in the series to receive {{character}} design input from fans outside Japan. This late-era game was also the last in the series released on Nintendo's 8-bit console. Due to the declining support of the NES and the growing presence of the newer <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Capcom decided not to publish Mega Man 6 in North America. The North American version of Mega Man 6 was released by Nintendo of America instead. Critical reviews favored the game's comparable presentation {{and use of the}} established gameplay model from preceding chapters in the series, though nearly all judged it a redundant sequel.|$|E
5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
