The diet of the crayfish {{during the period of}} the field study (January 1986 to November 1986) consisted largely of macrophyte detritus (principally Elodea canadensis), epilithic algae and exoskeletal material. Fish and other animal tissues appeared rarely in crayfish guts. Crayfish activity was investigated once every two months using a trapping programme. Activity was high in May and September and low in July. The September increase coincided with increases in moult frequency and egg production. Digestive enzyme activity was investigated using standard assay techniques. Hepatopancreas extracts containing digestive enzymes showed catalytic activity toward nine selected substrates. Microbial activity was implicated in the breakdown of three substrates, microcrystalline cellulose, laminarin and collagen.

40|$|The {{growth rates}} of insect herbivores {{commonly}} decrease when they feed on mature leaves due to the combined effects of several nutritional and physiological mechanisms. Environmental stresses during leaf development may also decrease herbivore performance. The present study tests two main hypotheses to help clarify {{the importance of these}} factors for the nutrition and growth of an insect herbivore: (i) decreases in nutrient levels, consumption rates and nutrient <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> impact negatively on herbivores feeding on mature leaves and (ii) wind stress has a negative impact on herbivores feeding on mature leaves. The results show that mature poplar (Populus alba[*]×[*]Populus tremula) leaves have decreased levels of protein and increased levels of fibre, and that {{growth rates of}} gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) are decreased on mature leaves in association with decreased consumption rates. However, in contrast to the first hypothesis, protein and carbohydrate are assimilated efficiently (74 – 82 % and 84 – 87 %, respectively) from immature and mature poplar leaves. The larvae are able to chew mature leaves as efficiently as immature leaves, potentially maximizing nutrient extraction. By contrast to the second hypothesis, wind‐stressed leaves have no significant detrimental effects on nutrient <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> and the lower growth rates of L. dispar larvae feeding on mature wind‐stressed leaves can be explained by lower consumption rates. Therefore, the availability of nutrients to herbivores feeding on mature tree leaves is not necessarily impacted by lower <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> even when leaves develop under wind stress.

The various techniques used to measure contaminant assimilation efficiencies are reviewed. Pulse-chase feeding techniques and the application of gamma-emitting radiotracers have been invaluable in measuring metal assimilation efficiencies in aquatic animals. Uniform radiolabeling of food is required to measure assimilation, but this can be difficult when sediments are the food source. Biological factors that influence contaminant assimilation include food quantity and quality, partitioning of contaminants in the food particles, and digestive physiology of the animals. Other factors influencing assimilation include the behavior of the chemical within the animal's gut and its associations with different geochemical fractions in food particles. <b>Assimilation</b> <b>efficiency</b> is a critical parameter to determine (and to make predictions of) bioaccumulation of chemicals from dietary exposure.

40|$|The {{efficient}} aquisition {{of nutrients}} from leaves by insect herbivores increases their nutrient assimilation rates and overall fitness. Caterpillars of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) have high protein <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (PAE) from the immature leaves of trees such as red oak (Quercus rubra) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) (71 – 81 %) but significantly lower PAE from their mature leaves (45 – 52 %). By contrast to this pattern, both PAE and carbohydrate <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (CAE) remain high for L. dispar larvae on the mature leaves of poplar (Populus alba[*]×[*]Populus tremula) grown in greenhouse conditions. The present study tests two alternative hypotheses: (i) outdoor environmental stresses cause decreased nutrient <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> from mature poplar leaves and (ii) nutrients in the mature leaves {{of trees in}} the poplar family (Salicaceae) remain readily available for L. dispar larvae. When poplar trees are grown in ambient outdoor conditions, PAE and CAE remain high (approximately 75 % and 78 %, respectively) in L. dispar larvae, {{in contrast to the}} first hypothesis.

Larval growth rates are strongly associated with protein assimilation rates, and more strongly associated with protein assimilation rates than with carbohydrate assimilation rates.

In contrast, the <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of Cd remained comparable (81 - 85 % in whelks and 6 - 8 % in fish), because its partitioning in the soluble fraction of different treatments of the prey was similar. The efflux of Ag and Cd in the two predators was comparable after feeding on preexposed mussel prey. Our results imply that the subcellular distribution of metals in prey may affect the dietary assimilation of metals in predators, but such influence is clearly metal-specific. The present study may lead to a better understanding of metal trophic transfer in different marine food chains...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of body mass, carbon content, respiration, growth, and egestion are {{combined}} {{in a model}} of secondary production by the tropical freshwater shrimp Caridina. The model is developed to permit its direct application to empirical data for abundances and size frequency distributions of field populations. Model calculations combined with population data for offshore Lake Victoria {{over a period of}} two years indicate that Caridina consume the equivalent of 2. 2 % of annual lake primary production. Present net annual secondary production by the shrimp is an order of magnitude greater than the present fishery yield of the lake.

The {{assimilation}} efficiencies {{of these plants}} by male and female Penaeus monodon (30 - 40 g wet wt.) were determined using the ash-free method of Conover (1966). Ruppia maritima was assimilated significantly better (70 - 76 %) than N. graminea (40 - 47 %).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model and different scenarios for {{the impact of}} herbivorous zooplankton grazing on planktonic production and vertical flux of particulate organic matter. Sedimentation of phy-toplankton and fecal matter from the mixed layer (i. e. export production PC) is given by P, = [(I- CU) G 4 ws + W-‘,, where (Y is a “pelagic <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiency</b> ” of the mixed layer, w, is phytoplankton sinking rate, G is grazing pressure of the herbivore stock, and P, is the integrated phytoplankton production in the mixed zone. The parameter (Y is influenced by herbivorous assimilation and decomposition of fecal matter in the upper water column. In the above expression the influence of grazing acts like a Michaelis-Menten limitation term [G/(w, + G) ], where sinking rate is the half-saturation parameter and pelagic <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiency</b> represents the maximal influence from grazing. The model seems predictive as it gives reasonable explanations to P, : P, relationships for both freshwater and marine systems, and therefore improves our understanding of several empirical models presented in the literature linking export pro-duction to primary production. During the last decade a variety of approach-es measuring and predicting the magnitude an...|$|E
40|$|An {{energy budget}} was {{constructed}} for the marine nematode Monhystera disjuncta. Respiration {{was measured with}} a modified Cartesian diver technique, in which the nematodes were kept in agar inside the diver 'head'. The relationship between respiration and body weight was: R= 1. 53 W 0. 75. Body growth was exponential during the juvenile phase, with a growth rate equal to 0. 61 d - 1. After maturation the growth rate fell to 0, 17 d - 1. Food uptake was measured in experiments with radiolabeled bacteria. In one series of experiments the accumulation of radiolabel in the nematodes was followed. In a second series the decrease in labeling was followed when pre-labeled nematodes fed on unlabeled bacteria. A model for label uptake permitted the calculation of <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiency</b> and consumption rates. Consumption rates thus measured, correspond well to those calculated from the growth, reproduction and respiration rates. <b>Assimilation</b> <b>efficiency</b> was low, around 25 %. Production efficiency (P/(P+R)) was high: 60 % for the population at stable age distribution, and up to 75 % for reproducing females. This {{seems to be a}} general feature in nematodes...|$|E
40|$|Assimilation {{from the}} diet is {{established}} as {{a key factor in}} the accumulation of very high trace metal concentrations by the barnacle Elminius modestus. <b>Assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (AE) of Cd, Cr, Se and Zn were measured from a diet of different phytoplankton (2 diatoms, a dinoflagellate, a prasinophyte and a chlorophyte) and of zooplankton (the copepod Acartia spinicauda with metal accumulated from solution or diet). AEs of Cd, Se and Zn (but not Cr) varied greatly with phytoplankton type, and for Cd and Se the AE was correlated with the percentage of metal burden held in the cytoplasm of the phytoplankton diet. A-E was generally higher from the zooplankton diet than from a phytoplankton diet. Variation in AEs of Cd, Se and Zn was not explained by any correlation with the percentage of copepod metal burden held in the soft tissues, nor was there variation for either Cd or Zn according to whether the copepod prey had accumulated metal from dissolved or food sources, Comparisons of the assimilation and efflux of accumulated metals by the archaeo-balanid barnacle E. modestus and literature data for (phylogenetically younger) balanid species of the genus Balanus indicate some differences in digestive physiology of barnacles from the 2 families, tending towards higher AEs in the balanids. Modeling of the accumulation of Cd and Zn by E. modestus predicts that for each metal > 97 % of accumulated metal has been derived from dietary ingestion. The dominance of dietary ingestion in trace metal accumulation {{is a function of the}} conspicuously high <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and high ingestion activity of barnacles. This study adds to the small but growing list of examples highlighting the significance of trophic transfer in metal accumulation by aquatic invertebrates...|$|R
40|$|The uptake of {{trace metals}} from the diet is a {{significant}} route for their entry into marine animals, and the chemical form of trace metals accumulated by food organisms is one potential factor controlling their assimilation from the diet. Therefore, we investigated relationships between the <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (AE) of the trace metals Cd, Ag and Zn in the neogastropod mollusc Nassarius festivus and their subcellular compartmentalized fractionation in selected tissues of 4 species of bivalve prey, seeking to identify the relative trophic availabilities of such different fractions. We also sought parallels between the AE of N. festivus and 2 in vitro models of digestion, a generalised invertebrate model and a human digestion model. The bivalves were the scallop Chlamys nobilis, the clam Marcia hiantina, the green mussel Perna viridis and the oyster Saccostrea cucullata, as these show a range of accumulated trace metal concentrations and detoxificatory binding to subcellular compartments. Measured <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of N. festivus for Cd, Ag and Zn from invertebrate prey tissues are very high in comparison to other marine animals, assimilation occurs from accumulated metal in prey bound in subcellular fractions across the insoluble and soluble spectrum, and assimilation is best modelled in vitro by a human digestion model with low pH (1. 3) rather than an invertebrate model (pH 5. 6). It is concluded that what is trophically available to one predator (feeding on one prey type) is not necessarily trophically available to another (taxonomically separated) predator even if feeding on the same prey, given the variability between invertebrate digestive systems. Variation in the subcellular distribution of accumulated trace metals within different prey will also add variation in trophic availability even for the same metal...|$|R

Recent studies have been made upon the isotopic signature analysis of Δ13C and Nitrogen-15 in their bone collagen and hair keratin and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. Using realistic assumptions on the consumable tissue per victim, lion energetic needs, and their <b>assimilation</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> researchers compared the man-eaters' Δ13C signatures to various reference standards: Tsavo lions with normal (wildlife) diets, grazers and browsers from Tsavo East and Tsavo West, and the skeletal remains of Taita people from the early 20th century.
