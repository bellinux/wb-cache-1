40|$|Fish {{growth is}} {{commonly}} estimated from length-at-age {{data obtained from}} otoliths. There are several techniques for estimating length-at-age from otoliths including 1) direct observed counts of annual increments; 2) age adjustment based on a categorization of otolith margins; 3) age adjustment based on known periods of spawning and annuli formation; 4) back-calculation to all annuli, and 5) back-calculation to the last annulus only. In this study we compared growth estimates (von Bertalanffy growth functions) obtained from the above five methods for estimating length-at-age from otoliths for two large scombrids: narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) and broad-barred king mackerel (Scomberomorus semifasciatus). Likelihood ratio tests revealed that the largest differences in growth occurred between the back-calculation methods and the observed and <b>adjusted</b> <b>methods</b> for both species of mackerel. The pattern, however, was more pronounced for S. commerson than for S. semifasciatus, because of the pronounced effect of gear selectivity demonstrated for S. commerson. We propose a method of substituting length-at-age data from observed or <b>adjusted</b> <b>methods</b> with back-calculated length-at-age data to provide more appropriate estimates of population growth than those obtained with the individual methods alone, particularly when faster growing young fish are disproportionately selected for. Substitution of observed or adjusted length-at-age data with back-calculated length-at-age data provided more realistic estimates of length for younger ages than observed or <b>adjusted</b> <b>methods</b> {{as well as more}} realistic estimates of mean maximum length than those derived from backcalculation methods alone...|$|R

40|$|The {{before-after study}} {{is still the}} most popular method used by traffic {{engineers}} and transportation safety analysts for evaluating the effects of an intervention. However, this kind of study may be plagued by important methodological limitations, which could significantly alter the study outcome. They include the regression-to-the-mean (RTM) and site-selection effects. So far, most of the research on these biases has focused on the RTM. Hence, the primary objective of this study consists of presenting a method that can reduce the site-selection bias when an entry criterion is used in before-after studies for continuous (e. g. speed, reaction times, etc.) and count data (e. g. number of crashes, number of fatalities, etc.). The proposed method documented in this research provides a way to adjust the Naive estimator by using the sample data and without relying on the data collected from the control group, since finding enough appropriate sites for the control group is much harder in traffic-safety analyses. In this study, the proposed method, a. k. a. <b>Adjusted</b> <b>method,</b> was compared to commonly used methods in before-after studies. The study results showed that among all methods evaluated, the Naive is the most significantly affected by the selection bias. Using the CG, the ANCOVA, or the EB method based on a control group (EBCG) method can eliminate the site-selection bias, as long as the characteristics of the control group are exactly the same as those for the treatment group. However, control group data that have same characteristics based on a truncated distribution or sample may not be available in practice. Moreover, site-selection bias generated by using a dissimilar control group might be even higher than with using the Naive <b>method.</b> The <b>Adjusted</b> <b>method</b> can partially eliminate site-selection bias even when biased estimators of the mean, variance, and correlation coefficient of a truncated normal distribution are used or are not known with certainty. In addition, three actual datasets were used to evaluate the accuracy of the <b>Adjusted</b> <b>method</b> for estimating site-selection biases for various types of data that have different mean and sample-size values...|$|R

40|$|When {{analyzing}} an I × J contingency table, {{there are}} situations where sampling {{is taken from}} a sampled population that differs from the target population. Clearly the resulting estimators are typically biased. In this dissertation, four <b>adjusting</b> <b>methods</b> for estimating the cell probabilities under inequality constrains, namely, raking (RAKE), maximum likelihood under random sampling (MLRS), minimum chi-squared (MCSQ), and least squares (LSQ) are developed for particular models relating the target and sampled populations. Considering the difficulty of solving primal problem due to large dimensions, we use the Khun-Tucker conditions to exploit the duality for each method. Extensive simulation is performed to provide a systematic comparison between <b>adjusting</b> <b>methods.</b> The comparisons are also made by using a measure of information loss because of biased sampling. We apply four methods to the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data under reasonable constraints. Not only the performance of four methods are compared in the example, but also how different constraints {{affect the quality of}} estimation is inspected. We emphasize that a sampling is taken from a sample population that differs from a target population. In the absence of knowledge of target population, a prior distribution can be considered as describing the initial knowledge about the target population.

Migdal cites Mexico's passing of Ley de desamortización in 1856 {{as an example}} of establishing property rights as a means to strengthen a government's capacity for rule by establishing order. This establishes a social structure to reduce citizen conflict within the state and a means to organize agricultural production for optimal output. <b>Adjusting</b> <b>methods</b> of taxation is another way to consolidate power in a weak state's government. This can be done through increasing government revenue through increased taxation and also formalizing tax collection by collecting taxes in cash instead of in kind. Migdal cites the example of 19th Century Egypt's declaration of cash taxes only as the reason for increased economic capacity as farmers were forced into more market relations, pushing them to produce crops for export to increase cash revenue. This gave the state more liquid income. Also, Migdal {{explains that}} new modes of transportation can strengthen a state's capacity through decreased isolation leading to increasing economic opportunity by regional trade, increased accessibility, and reduced cost of transporting goods.
