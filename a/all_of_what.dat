5|$|<b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now NY18F {{south of}} Youngstown was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY34 in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY34 became part of NY18, which was extended north to Youngstown and east to Rochester {{as part of the}} renumbering. NY18 was originally state-maintained from the village of Lewiston to Youngstown; however, the state of New York relinquished ownership and maintenance of NY18 between Center Street in Lewiston and the village of Youngstown on July24, 1947. The section within the village of Lewiston was transferred to village control, while the remainder of the route was given to Niagara County. In December 1947, Lewiston petitioned the county to also assume maintenance of the portion of NY18 within the village; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now NY31F was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} Route20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route20 entered the village of Macedon on modern NY31 and continued westward to Rochester on current NY96. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to utilize modern NY31 and NY250 between Macedon and Fairport. Although all of modern NY31F {{was part of a}} legislative route at one time and was state-maintained west of Fairport and from Macedon Center to Macedon by 1926, it was not assigned a posted route number until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to {{the late}} 1930s, modern NY15 was part of NY2. As a result, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now NY15A was {{originally}} designated as New York State Route2A {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Two parts of the route were sub-standard at the time; however, those sections were rebuilt in the early and mid-1930s. NY2 was supplanted by an extended US15 in April1939, at which time NY2A was renumbered to NY15A to match its parent's new designation.|$|E

5|$|In February 1926 William Matheson {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with D. P. Davis (a land developer, not related to Waters Davis) to develop and re-sell the northern half of Key Biscayne, including <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now Crandon Park and about half the present Village of Key Biscayne. Davis had experience with turning submerged or partially submerged land into prime real estate, having created the Davis Islands in Tampa and Davis Shores near St. Augustine. Later in 1926, the City of Coral Gables incorporated with Key Biscayne, which was included in its boundaries. There were dreams of a bridge to the island, making Key Biscayne the seaside resort for Coral Gables, as Miami Beach had become for Miami.|$|E
5|$|What is now NY15 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY4 when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. The route was renumbered to NY2 in 1927 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US4 in eastern New York. Modern NY15A, meanwhile, was only partially state-maintained by the mid-1920s. In 1926, only two sections of the route were state-owned: from Monroe Street west of Honeoye Falls north to Rochester, and the segment of highway in Livonia that modern NY15A shares with US20A. In spite of this fact, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now NY15A was designated as NY2A, an alternate route of NY2 between Springwater and Rochester, in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is K-383 {{became part of}} US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E

5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls while <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic circle with NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E
