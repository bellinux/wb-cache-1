50|$|Universal Avometer Model 40 1939 to c. 1986. A {{development}} of the 36-range Universal Avometer incorporating <b>automatic</b> <b>cut-out</b> and internal construction similar to the Model 7 (Basic ranges to 12A and 1200V, the former extendable with accessory current shunts). 167 ohms/volt.|$|E
50|$|The fuel {{injection}} system has a throttle position sensor on the throttle body; O2 sensor {{in the top of}} the exhaust header-pipe; temperature sensor; thermo unit at the upper rear of the cylinder head; and a lean angle sensor to interrupt the {{fuel injection}} pump — should, for example, the bike be on its side. The air filter is a disposable oil-coated paper type held in place by the airbox cover. The electrical system had an <b>automatic</b> <b>cut-out</b> to stop the engine when left idling longer than 20 minutes. The exhaust system has an exhaust pipe coated with a nano-film to prevent discoloration and includes a 3-way honeycomb-type catalytic converter to meet EU and US (50 state) emission requirements.|$|E
40|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>cut-out</b> device {{provides}} disconnection of {{the radiation}} source (28) {{in response to}} an unacceptable radiation level, detected by a mobile unit (10) attached to the body of an operator. The mobile unit transmits a signal representing the detected radiation level to a stationary unit (30) associated with the radiation source, initiating the <b>automatic</b> <b>cut-out</b> when a given signal level is exceeded. USE - E. g. in medicine to protect patient ADVANTAGE - Reliable protection of operator from damaging radiation level...|$|E
5000|$|In Europe and {{elsewhere}} where the normal domestic voltage is around 230 V {{there may be}} less risk of causing fire through overheating of cables for any given power due to the lower current. However most European extension reel cables now include an <b>automatic</b> current <b>cut-out</b> to avoid misuse of the cable. This requires manual resetting if excess current is drawn through the cable. (American multi-plug cords also include such a device, but single- or triple-outlet cords do not.) ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{slow speed}} pump unit, an {{electric}} motor that drives the pumping unit, Santa Fe Springs Oil Field, ca. 1931. A vertical metal coil {{can be seen at}} center in front of a small metal barrel-shaped object above it. A chain is visible to the right, while, " 842806 - 1. Ideal. <b>Automatic.</b> <b>Cut-Out.</b> Switch. NSCO" can be seen written on a small placard at the bottom left portion of the machine. Tubes and wooden planks are visible at right, while {{what appears to be a}} barrel and walls can be seen in the background...|$|E
40|$|OK, so you're a knob-twiddler After all, you're only human, {{and those}} two big knobs on the Model 8 Avometer are terribly tempting. Just by {{twiddling}} them, {{you can have}} over 30 calibrated ranges at your command- 11 current, 15 voltage, 5 resistance, and a 30 dB power scale. Twiddle yourself a good combination of accuracy (1 %fsd /dcA, 2 %fsd /dcV, 2 á %fsd /ac) and sensitivity (20 k 0 /Vdc, 1 k 0 /Vac, except 2. 5 Vac scale 1000 /V). Plus <b>automatic</b> <b>cut-out,</b> fused ohms circuit, trio of ohms zero-adjustments, reverse-polarity button and anti-parallax mirror. No wonder the Model 8 is {{the first choice of}} electronic, radio and TV engineers everywhere. Get yours from your local dealer o...|$|E
40|$|Produced in {{response}} to a demand for a high sensitivity version of the world-famous Universal AvoMeter, this model incorporates the traditional design features of its predecessors, so highly valued for simplicity of operation and compact port-ability. It has a sensitivity of 20, 000 ohms per volt on all D. C. voltage ranges and 1, 000 ohms per volt on A. C. ranges from 100 V. upwards. A decibel scale is provided for audio frequency tests. In addition, a press button has been incorporated which reverses the direction of current through the moving coil, and thus obviates the inconvenience of changing over test leads when the current direction reverses. It also simplifies the testing of potentials, both positive and negative, about a common reference point. A wide range of resistance measurements can be made using internal batteries, separate zero adjustment being provided for each range. It is of importance to note that this model incorporates the " AVO " <b>automatic</b> <b>cut-out</b> for protection against inadvertent overloads...|$|E
