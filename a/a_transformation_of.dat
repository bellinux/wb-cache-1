5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E
5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-18th century, Catholicism {{had been}} reduced to the fringes of the country, {{particularly}} the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite risings and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. However, Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> its fortunes. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland. Also important was Episcopalianism, which had retained supporters through the civil wars and changes of regime in the 17th century. Since most Episcopalians had given their support to the Jacobite risings in the early 18th century they suffered a decline in fortunes, but revived in the 19th as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the Episcopal Church in Scotland in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in communion with the Church of England. Baptist, Congregationalist and Methodist churches also appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century, partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches. From 1879 they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the Salvation Army, which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres.|$|E
5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E

5|$|On 27 July 2007, Burnley {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a £20 million redevelopment of Turf Moor. The plans also included {{the creation of a}} youth academy at the club's training facility at Gawthorpe Hall in nearby Padiham. The plans were detailed in six phases. In the first phase it was planned to move the changing rooms to the corner between the James Hargreaves Stand and the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. The second phase included the demolition of the Cricket Field Stand, a new stand to be built at that end of the ground that would incorporate a hotel, a restaurant and a newly constructed cricket pavilion, and would be able to accommodate 2,500 fans. The redevelopments also included the construction of a multi-storey car park adjacent to the stadium. Other planned improvements include a new club superstore and other retail outlets, and new business offices {{on the site of the}} current club shop. Revealed in the fifth phase was <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the Bob Lord Stand, which will eventually house a multi-screen cinema. The development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was later revealed by Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher, taking the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor to 28,000 spectators.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{interpretation}} of the Fourier transform is as <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the {{interpretation of}} the inverse Fourier transform is as <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a frequency domain signal into a time domain signal. Apparently, fractional Fourier transforms can transform a signal (either in the time domain or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time-frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time-frequency domain other than rotation.|$|E

25|$|Another view held by many Protestants is sola fide ("by faith alone"): {{that faith}} alone, apart from any action, is what {{achieves}} salvation, and that good works are merely {{evidence of that}} faith. Justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, {{not the result of}} <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> character. However, most Protestants teach that <b>a</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> character naturally follows the salvation experience. Instead of distinguishing between mortal and venial sins, Protestants believe that one's faith dictates one's state of salvation and one's place in the afterlife. Those who have been saved by God are destined for heaven, while those have not been saved will be excluded from heaven. Accordingly, they reject any notion of a provisional or temporary afterlife state such as purgatory.|$|E
