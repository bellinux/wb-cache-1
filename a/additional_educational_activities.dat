40|$|Practical on-street {{pedestrian}} {{training is}} {{one form of}} education designed to promote safe roadside behavior amongst young road users {{with the intention of}} reducing their potential of involvement in road traffic collisions. While many local authorities in the United Kingdom operate pedestrian training, a number are reducing the amount of on-street training on offer as a result of financial and time constraints. This reduction in practical training puts more emphasis on paper-based classroom activities which increase knowledge acquisition but are generally not as effective in improving practical skills. Interactive videos may prove to be an effective complementary activity alongside pedestrian training as it is suggested that they can more effectively target hard skills compared to paper-based activities. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of an interactive road safety video designed to improve children’s crossing skills between parked cars when no other alternative safer route is available. The paper finds that interactive video shows the potential to improve the crossing behavior of children and that it therefore may make a useful <b>additional</b> <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> alongside pedestrian training...|$|R

40|$|After the {{adoption}} of a unified clinical pathway for diabetes mellitus type 2 care in 2012 in Ukraine it is relevant to analyze the results of its implementation and the quality of diabetes care. The aim is to analyze the quality of diabetes care and results of implementation of unified clinical pathway for caring diabetic type 2 patients in Ukraine and Kyiv region for 2003 – 2012 – 2014 years (Order of MH of Ukraine № 1118, d/d December, 21, 2012). Materials and methods. We developed a methodology that includes monitoring quality indicators, statistical analysis of reports of medical establishments, that were complemented by survey of 543 doctors and 92 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and analysis of outpatient records. Results. The quality of diabetes care on the early stages of pathway implementation is improper. The recommended annual monitoring is incomplete. It does not cover all recommended parameters and all patients. In addition, insufficient preventive measures are used and not all patients achieve target levels as a result. This led to increasing hospitalizations and reducing primary diseases incidence caused by both a lack of physicians commitment and a lack of patients adherence to treatment and the impact of socio-economic aspects of life in Ukraine nowadays. Our data are similar to European experience in implementation of a clinical pathway for diabetes mellitus care. Due to the growing prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the burden on endocrinologists continues to increase. In order to optimize the quality of diabetes mellitus care it is necessary to ensure the availability of laboratory tests and more active involvement of general practitioners. For this purpose we have developed and implemented a typical local protocol, form of monitoring the quality of diabetes mellitus care, conducted the <b>additional</b> <b>educational</b> <b>activities</b> (lectures, seminars, workshops, thematic improvement cycles) for physicians, nurses and patients. Conclusions. The quality of diabetes mellitus care on the early stage is insufficient.

The objectives of the program were to increase the awareness among physicians of occupational disease in their practice, assist physicians in the diagnosis and management of the cases, and to provide a mechanism for public health intervention in hazardous working conditions. After discussions with leaders in the medical community, the program was initiated by a letter from the State Health Commissioner to physicians in the pilot county. A single-page reporting form was included with the letter. A bimonthly newsletter to primary care physicians was also begun. <b>Additional</b> <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> included presentation of grand rounds and a one-day medical conference on the recognition of occupational disease at the single hospital in the county. All physicians reporting occupational disease received copies of all industrial hygiene reports as well as relevant medical literature from the industrial hygienist assigned to investigate all reports by physicians.

40|$|MastersBackground and aim: Pain {{has been}} defined as the fifth vital sign due to its {{importance}} in nursing practice. Knowledge deficit and untoward attitude are major contributing factors in the under assessment of pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the level of theoretical and applied knowledge as well as the attitude regarding pain assessment among nursing students. Subjects and methods: The study was carried out in Nursing College King Saud University, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, at the beginning of the first semester 1430 / 1431 H (2009 / 2010), using an exploratory descriptive design. The study sample included 119 nursing students in the baccalaureate nursing program at the 5 th to the 8 th levels. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire assessing theoretical and applied knowledge and attitude towards pain assessment. Results: The response rate was 91. 6 %. Students were all females with age ranging between 19 and 27 years. Major deficiencies were found in students' theoretical and applied knowledge, with only 7. 3 % of them having total satisfactory knowledge, and 19. 3 % having positive attitude. <b>Additional</b> <b>educational</b> <b>activities</b> dealing with pain have negative effects on students' knowledge. Theoretical knowledge decreased with increasing educational levels, while attitude increased. GPA had a negative effect on applied knowledge, but a positive effect on attitude. Conclusion: It is concluded that nursing students in the Faculty of nursing at KSU have a major deficiency in their knowledge regarding assessment of pain. The deficiency is more marked in applied knowledge. Additionally, the majority of the students have negative attitudes towards pain assessment. The results consistent with other published research, and raise implications for nursing education, at the undergraduate level within nursing practice, and highlight areas for further research. Recommendations: Construct and implement several strategies to enhance student understanding and application of relevant knowledge and practice by: a. Considering that pain is a serious problem; b. Pressing information about pain throughout curriculum; c. Developing an integrated approach to teach students about the experiences of pain; d. Providing students with the opportunity to appreciate the perspectives of patients; e. Taking successive pain courses and implement reflective learning intervention...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. There are no {{accepted}} and practical {{measures of the}} relative clinical and <b>educational</b> <b>activities</b> of pediatricians who work in an academic health science center. Such measures are necessary for justification of existing and future human resource plans and evaluation of the activities and performance of physicians. The limited literature on the measurement of physician workload usually focuses on a specific subspecialty group and {{does not account for}} such issues as indirect patient care, such as telephone calls or e-mail consultations; variables that affect the delivery of clinical care, including patient acuity and complexity; and the presence of students during the patient care activities. After completing a pilot study that assessed the educational workload of faculty members, we adapted existing personal digital assistant technology and software to document clinical and <b>educational</b> <b>activities.</b> METHODS. Twenty full-time physicians from 4 subspecialty pediatric divisions participated in a 2 -week evaluation project in May through June 2005. Clinical activities, with and without trainees, and <b>educational</b> <b>activities</b> were collected with the use of personal digital assistants. Software allowed an individualized division-specific drop-down menu. Information that was collected included clinical (location of activity, diagnosis, and time requirement) and <b>educational</b> <b>activities.</b> After completion of a 2 -week data collection period, each physician was asked to complete a 5 -question evaluation form. RESULTS. The project was completed successfully with capture of <b>additional</b> clinical and <b>educational</b> <b>activities.</b> A 5 -question evaluation form was completed by 70 % of the participants {{at the end of the}} 2 -week data collection.
