40|$|Perceptions {{of crime}} {{seriousness}} {{have been studied}} since the 1960 s. Characteristics of acts affecting these perceptions have been identified, {{and the degree of}} agreement in seriousness judgments has been examined for a variety of behaviors. The present study extends this inquiry by investigating how <b>perceptions</b> of self-harm <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of immorality shape attitudes toward the control of drug use. These attitudes <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> were measured for six widely known drugs – alcohol, cigarettes, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana – using an electronic mail survey of university students. Univariate analysis shows dissensus rather than consensus in attitudes <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> that, with the exception of marijuana, control attitudes toward drug use reflect the existing legal code. Multivariate analysis shows that <b>perceptions</b> of self-harm <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of immorality are moderately to highly correlated and that control attitudes are strongly affected by <b>perceptions</b> of self-harm <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of immorality...|$|R

In attempting to answer this question my focus is on what I call college-encouraging preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions,</b> which are preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> that make adolescents more likely to pursue college. The model I develop engages the rational choice literature in both economics and sociology, but it deals primarily with considerations outside the scope of traditional rational choice models. I deal with preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> but not only those relating to pecuniary costs and benefits. Also, unlike most rational choice perspectives, I focus on interpersonal variation in preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> how this variation affects college entry decisions. I analyze two preferences and two perceptions: preferences for academic activities, preferences for various labor-market outcomes, perceptions of the ability to complete college, <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the effect of education on labor-market outcomes. Using both propensity-score matching and regression estimators, I find that preferences for academic activities increase educational expectations, preferences fo...|$|R
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E

In attempting to answer this question my focus is on what I call college-encouraging preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions,</b> which are preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> that make adolescents more likely to pursue college. The model I develop engages the rational choice literature in both economics and sociology, but it deals primarily with considerations outside the scope of traditional rational choice models. I deal with preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> but not only those relating to pecuniary costs and benefits. Also, unlike most rational choice perspectives, I focus on interpersonal variation in preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> how this variation affects college entry decisions. 	I analyze two preferences and two perceptions: preferences for academic activities, preferences for various labor-market outcomes, perceptions of the ability to complete college, <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the effect of education on labor-market outcomes. Using both propensity-score matching and regression estimators, I find that preferences for academic activities increase educational expectations, preferences for labor-market outcomes that education improves increase educational expectations and college entry, and that the subjective probability of college completion conditional upon college entry increases college entry. 	Regarding perceptions of the effect of education on labor-market outcomes, I turn away from the maximization assumption of traditional human capital approaches and develop a simple satisficing model. Consistent with predictions of the model, results show that the more education an adolescent believes is required to enter the occupation they expect, {{the more likely they are}} to enter college. Examination of reverse causality (i. e., educational decisions affect occupational decisions) found only weak effects. 	Analysis of the determinants of preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> shows that cognitive skill and parental education are both positively related to most college-encouraging preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Blacks, Hispanics, <b>and</b> Asians have more college-encouraging preferences <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> than whites of comparable cognitive skill and family background.

He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images.

5|$|Whorf and Sapir both drew {{explicitly}} on Albert Einstein's {{principle of}} general relativity; hence linguistic relativity {{refers to the}} concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying phoneme and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation {{is an example of how}} various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention <b>and</b> <b>perception.</b>|$|E
5|$|Monet's use {{of colored}} shadows arose from color {{theories}} that were {{popular in the}} 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832) published {{one of the first}} modern descriptions of colored shadows in his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (16431727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory <b>and</b> <b>perception,</b> but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (17861889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839). Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work. Georges Seurat (18591891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (18311902).|$|E

5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

The {{aim is to}} analyze and research {{about the role of}} service quality for creating customer satisfaction and we want to find out the gap between expectations <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> through the customers point of view. The difference between expectations <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> can be described as satisfaction or lack of satisfaction. The specific questions that are researched in this thesis are: What expectations does customer have on Destination Gotland’s service quality to become satisfied? What perceptions does customer have about the service quality at Destination Gotland? What are the differences between expectations <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> (gap 5 in the SERVQUAL-model) ? The survey is constructed as a case-study and is based on the quantitative method. The results from the different dimensions show that there is a gap between expectations <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> which means that the customers are not fully satisfied about the service quality at Destination Gotland. On the other hand, the main respondents said yes on the question if they think the service meet their expectations. From the overall result in the statements we can see that there are several gaps between expectations <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> which means that the service quality do not fully meet the expectations.
