There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.|$|E
5|$|The telethon's {{talent pool}} becomes {{so low that}} Leslie is forced to flip a coin {{in front of the}} camera and talk about her {{favorite}} episodes of Friends. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so they could talk about Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E

Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars to stay <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E

25|$|During a night's sleep, a {{small portion}} is usually spent in a waking state. As {{measured}} by electroencephalography, young females are <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> 0–1% of the larger sleeping period; young males are <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> 0–2%. In adults, wakefulness increases, especially in later cycles. One study found 3% awake time in the first ninety-minute sleep cycle, 8% in the second, 10% in the third, 12% in the fourth, and 13–14% in the fifth. Most of this awake time occurred shortly after REM sleep.|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{has also}} been cited as a contributing factor in medical errors. One study found that being <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> over 24 hours caused medical interns to double or triple the number of preventable medical errors, including those that resulted in injury or death. The risk of car crash after these shifts increased by 168%, {{and the risk of}} near miss by 460%. Interns admitted falling asleep during lectures, during rounds, and even during surgeries. Night shifts are associated with worse surgeon performance during laparoscopic surgeries.|$|E

While being driven back from a briefing in Berlin, he took over driving from his driver (who had been on duty and <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> 48 hours) and then himself fell asleep at the wheel. He was replaced by Hans Krebs, but command initiative had already been lost. Later that day, Zhukov threw the 3rd Shock Army, which had redeployed from the area of Jastrow, into a counter-attack and the German offensive stalled.|$|E

25|$|Other minor sects in India carry no {{specific}} name, {{but they are}} uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition {{was derived from the}} concept of Rahukaalam, in which Hindus believe that a specific time period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have {{led to the development of}} a more constrained religious hierarchy. Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> long periods of time after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include Gudivada, Padalapalli, Pantham, and Kashyap.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{credible evidence}} of coffee-drinking or {{knowledge of the}} coffee tree appears {{in the middle of}} the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin of coffee (seeds) prior to its appearance in Yemen. One account credits Muhammad ben Said for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast. Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia. According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401. Famous 16th century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings of a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in the Zeila region.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles's {{introduction}} to [...] "Prellies" [...] (Preludin) was in Hamburg. As {{the group had}} to play for hours, Sheridan offered them Preludin, saying: [...] "Here's something to keep you awake." [...] Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin, which when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. Looking back, Harrison said that the whole group would be [...] "frothing at the mouth" [...] and would sometimes stay <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> days. Lennon recalled, [...] "The waiters always had these pills , so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink, they'd give you the pill. You could work almost endlessly until the pill wore off, and then you'd have another." [...] McCartney said that he would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five.|$|E
500|$|The Coens {{wrote with}} Odets in mind; they {{imagined}} Barton Fink as [...] "a serious dramatist, honest, politically engaged, and rather naive". As Ethan said in 1991: [...] "It seemed natural that {{he comes from}} Group Theater and {{the decade of the}} thirties." [...] Like Odets, Barton believes that the theatre should celebrate the trials and triumphs of everyday people; like Barton, Odets was highly egotistical. In the movie, a review of Barton's play Bare Ruined Choirs indicates that his characters face a [...] "brute struggle for existence... in the most squalid corners". This wording is similar to the comment of biographer Gerald Weales that Odets' characters [...] "struggle for life amidst petty conditions". Lines of dialogue from Barton's work are reminiscent of Odets' play Awake and Sing!. For example, one character declares: [...] "I'm awake now, <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> the first time". Another says: [...] "Take that ruined choir. Make it sing".|$|E
500|$|By 1969, Hendrix was the world's highest-paid rock musician. In August, he headlined the Woodstock Music and Art Fair that {{included}} {{many of the}} most popular bands of the time. For the concert, he added rhythm guitarist Larry Lee and conga players Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez. The band rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance, and according to Mitchell, they never connected musically. Before arriving at the engagement, Hendrix heard reports that the size of the audience had grown to epic proportions, which gave him cause for concern as he did not enjoy performing for large crowds. He was an important draw for the event, and although he accepted substantially less money for the appearance than his usual fee, he was the festival's highest-paid performer. As his scheduled time slot of midnight on Sunday drew closer, he indicated that he preferred to wait and close the show in the morning; the band took the stage around 8:00a.m. on Monday. By the time of their set, Hendrix had been <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> more than three days. The audience, which peaked at an estimated 400,000 people, was now reduced to 30–40,000, many of whom had waited {{to catch a glimpse of}} Hendrix before leaving during his performance. [...] The festival MC, Chip Monck, introduced the group as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but Hendrix clarified: [...] "We decided to change the whole thing around and call it Gypsy Sun and Rainbows. For short, it's nothin' but a Band of Gypsys".|$|E

500|$|Bobby {{explains}} {{that the man who}} attacked Sam is Jeremy Frost; he was unable to dream because his father brutally hit him {{in the head with a}} baseball bat. The target's DNA is a required ingredient for the dream-root tea, and Jeremy acquired Bobby's by offering him a beer. Dean realizes that he made the same mistake. Vulnerable to Jeremy, they both stay <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> two days while attempting to track him down. Unable to endure it any longer, Dean goes to sleep to face Jeremy, and Sam uses the dream root to enter his dream. The brothers encounter a dream version of Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson)Dean's former love interestoutside on a blanket with a picnic basket. She invites Dean to join her, and tells him that she loves him before disappearing. Though Dean denies ever having that dream before, it is an obvious lie. Sam then sees Jeremy nearby and chases after him, and Dean finds himself in a long hallway. He enters his motel room, and comes face-to-face with a dream version of him; he is his own worst nightmare. The Dream Dean comments on the real Dean's feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing; he also deems Dean to be as [...] "mindless and obedient as an attack dog", noting that his possessions, personality, and motives all stem from his father. When the Dream Dean calls him a [...] "good soldier and nothing else", the real Dean reacts violently and exclaims that he did not deserve the burdens that his father put onto him and that he does not deserve to go to Hell. The real Dean shoots his doppelganger with a shotgun, but he returns to life as a demon. The Dream Dean taunts him that he cannot escape his fate, and reminds him that exposure to Hell will transform him into a demon.|$|E
2500|$|Results {{indicate}} that, on average, {{performance with}} a {{blood alcohol level}} of 0.05% remained equivalent to performance after being <b>awake</b> <b>for</b> 16.9 to 18.6 hours.

Similar studies that compare performance after a time of sleep deprivation to performance with elevated blood alcohol level have confirmed these results.
