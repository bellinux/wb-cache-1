The series {{centers on a}} family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle.

The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> the show can comment {{on the state of the}} environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.|$|E

25|$|The {{birth of}} the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in California {{can be traced to}} controversy over Pacific Gas & Electric's attempt to build the nation's first commercially viable nuclear power plant in Bodega Bay.

50|$|Because of {{the large}} capital costs for the initial <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> built {{as part of a}} {{sustained}} build program, and the relatively long construction period before revenue is returned, servicing the capital costs of first few <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> can be the most important factor determining the economic competitiveness of nuclear energy. The investment can contribute about 70% to 80% of the costs of electricity. The discount rate chosen to cost <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant's</b> capital over its lifetime is arguably the most sensitive parameter to overall costs.

25|$|An {{assessment}} of permanent or temporary changes in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is performed to evaluate if such changes are within risk criteria.

Risk measures, such as core damage frequency and large early release frequency (LERF), determine the risk criteria for such changes.|$|E
