40|$|In {{assessing}} {{the effects of}} transformation {{and the impact of}} institutional changes on human capital of businesses in Ukraine, it should be admitted that at the present stage it is difficult to find signs of the formation of industries and economic sectors where intellectual work acts as a dominant factor in economic activity obtaining economic effects and critically determines their existence. The competitiveness of business structures' human capital is formed in the system of coordinates "recruiting-operation. " The current system of recruitment for modern domestic enterprises is reduced to recruiting and is tracked by traditionally <b>applicable</b> <b>turnover</b> of stuff indices, which to some extent follow the trend of development in the last period. The key trend is the high stuff turnover caused by:inefficiency of the existing personnel management system of enterprises;loss of human capital {{in the absence of a}} rational system of personnel management and work organization, formal human resource management;minor role of material factors in the system of motivation of human capital carriers;inefficiency of involving human potential and its conversion into human capital in the absence of recruitment system;ability to satisfy the needs of businesses in personnel solely through favorable labor market conditions – "the employers' labor market";lack of human capital at the beginning of economic growth and its development into the sustainable growth, non-performance of production and commercial programs under labor market changing conditions into the "employee's market" domination due to lack of adequate recruitment system, personnel management and human resources management...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for labeling plasma lipoprotein with radio-cholesterol. Almost {{all of the}} label is associated with high density lipoprotein as the free form. Lipoproteins labeled in this manner were injected intravenously into rats, {{and the distribution of}} cholesterol- 4 -C^ 14 was analyzed from a 24 to 48 hour study of plasmatic radioactivity, assuming a 4 -compartment mammillary system. The venous disappearance curve of the radioactive cholesterol was physiological and was the type expected for free cholesterol in lipoproteins. The plasma cholesterol ester fraction was equilibrated within 12 hours after the intravenous administration of the label, and red blood cell cholesterol within 6 hours, with free cholesterol. It is indicated that the preparation prepared here can be <b>applicable</b> for the <b>turnover</b> study of cholesterol, particularly of the esterified form, in the blood-liver system. リポ蛋白質態遊離コレステロール- 4 -C^ 14 の調製法について記した. この標品をラットに静注した場合,血漿からのC^ 14 の消失は注射直後より生理的曲線を画く. 注射 48 時間後までの消失曲線はMatthewsにより解析された 2 ̆ 24 -compartment system 2 ̆ 2 に相当した. エステル型コレステロールは静注 12 時間後で,また赤血球コレステロール(約 99...|$|R
40|$|Radiophosphate was {{injected}} into the left jugular vein of dairy cows. Blood samples were taken frequently from the right jugular vein during the first hour after injection. Between 20 minutes and 1 hour after injection, the decrease in plasma radioactivity could be formulated as a first order process, designated as "process 3," with a turnover time of 50 minutes. From 5 to 20 minutes after injection the decrease in plasma activity {{could be interpreted as}} the result of mixing plasma phosphate with another phosphate pool, designated as the second pool. The capacity of this second pool was derived as a constant in a kinetic equation, so chosen that the resulting mixing rates were independent of time. For two cows the capacity of the second pool was 5 and 8 times, respectively. the phosphate content of the plasma. This result led to the working hypothesis that the major part of the second pool was the phosphate in the interstitial tissue fluid. The turnover time of the plasma phosphate in the mixing process with the second pool amounted to an average of 14 minutes for 5 lactating cows, and an average of 21 minutes for 2 dry cows. This result was obtained under the assumption that the slow first order process 3 is parallel to the mixing process. The assumption that the slower first order process is in series with the mixing process reduces the resulting mixing time to about four-fifths of that reported above. The calculation of process 2 which deviates from first order may be <b>applicable</b> to numerous <b>turnover</b> processes in which both exchange pools have a limited capacity...|$|R
