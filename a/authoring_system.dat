40|$|A new ANN-based {{approach}} to adaptive noise cancelling and separating slow-varying signals is introduced. The network's weights are continuously modified using a fast unsupervised competitive learning rule, called fast boundary adaptation rule (FBAR), performing adaptive scalar quantization of the input signal. The rule maximizes information-theoretic entropy and yields a non-parametric {{model of the}} input probability density function. Contrary to classic unsupervised competitive learning, the <b>author's</b> <b>system</b> adapts its own learning rate, and hence {{does not require a}} `cooling scheme'. Furthermore, contrary to most of the other noise cancelling approaches, the <b>author's</b> <b>system</b> does not require a priori knowledge or an explicit model of the joint noise and signal characteristicsstatus: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although {{artificial}} intelligence {{has been successfully}} introduced to enhance Education through technologies {{in the past few}} years, major challenges still remain. One of them is how to represent the “knowledge ” of intelligent <b>authoring</b> <b>systems.</b> To represent the knowledge of <b>authoring</b> <b>systems</b> to support collaborative learning is particularly challenging because it is based on various learning theories and given the complexity of group learning where the synergy among learner’s interactions affects the learning processes and hence learning outcome. The main objective of this work is to introduce an ontological infrastructure on which we can build a model that describes learning theories and to show how we can use them to develop programs that provide a graphical visualization of learning theories and intelligent guidance for an effective design of group activities...|$|R
