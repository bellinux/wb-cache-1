5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and <b>autochthonous</b> cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the <b>autochthonous</b> (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|There are two theories– the <b>autochthonous</b> (in situ) {{theory and}} the {{allochthonous}} (drift) theory– that attempt to explain the formation of coal balls, although the subject is mostly speculation.|$|E
5|$|Khmer is {{a member}} of the Austroasiatic {{language}} family, the <b>autochthonous</b> family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India. Austroasiatic, which also includes Mon, Vietnamese and Munda, has been studied since 1856 and was first proposed as a language family in 1907. Despite the amount of research, there is still doubt about the internal relationship of the languages of Austroasiatic. Diffloth places Khmer in an eastern branch of the Mon-Khmer languages. In these classification schemes Khmer's closest genetic relatives are the Bahnaric and Pearic languages. More recent classifications doubt the validity of the Mon-Khmer sub-grouping and place the Khmer language as its own branch of Austroasiatic equidistant from the other 12 branches of the family.|$|E
5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered <b>autochthonous,</b> meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and <b>autochthonous</b> in nature.|$|E
5|$|The first Celtic people {{arrived in}} Poland, coming from Bohemia and Moravia, around or after 400 BC, {{just a few}} decades after their La Tène culture was born. They formed several {{enclaves}} mostly {{in the southern part}} of the country, within the Pomeranian or Lusatian populations or in areas abandoned by those people. The cultures or groups that were Celtic, or had a Celtic element in them (mixed Celtic and <b>autochthonous),</b> lasted at their furthest extent to 170 AD (the Púchov culture). After the Celts moved in, and during their tenure (they had always remained only a small minority), the bulk of the population had begun acquiring the traits of archaeological cultures with a dominant Proto-Germanic or Germanic component. In Europe the expansion of Rome and the Germanic pressure checked and reversed the Celtic expansion.|$|E

25|$|The Lumad (<b>autochthonous</b> {{groups of}} inland Mindanao) {{were known to}} have been headed by the Datu.|$|E
25|$|Another {{relevant}} game is {{the pigeon}} sport, with an <b>autochthonous</b> dove race being trained, the gavatxut valencià.|$|E
25|$|According to the <b>autochthonous</b> model, the Slavs {{homeland}} was in {{the area}} of former Yugoslavia, and they spread northwards and westwards {{rather than the other way}} round. A revision of the theory, developed by Ivan Mužić, argues that Slavic migration from the north did happen, but the actual number of Slavic settlers was small and that the <b>autochthonous</b> ethnic substratum was prevalent in the formation of the Croats, but that contradicts and doesn't answer the presence of predominant Slavic language.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{defending}} {{the rights of}} ethnic Hungarians living outside Hungary, Jobbik actively supports the cultural autonomy and language rights of the <b>autochthonous</b> ethnic minorities living in Hungary.|$|E
25|$|The <b>autochthonous</b> Slovene {{minority}} in Italy {{is estimated at}} 83,000 to 100,000, the Slovene {{minority in}} southern Austria at 24,855, in Croatia at 13,200, and in Hungary at 3,180.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{pretext for}} the Dutch to attack Klunkung would appear later, and {{materialize}} in the 1908 Dutch intervention in Bali, which {{would put a}} final end to <b>autochthonous</b> rule in Bali.|$|E
25|$|This genetic {{admixture}} {{appears to}} be gender-biased. A majority of maternal genetic material is Khoisan. The Coloured population is descended predominantly from unions of European and European-African males with <b>autochthonous</b> Khoisan females.|$|E
25|$|Pike Perch causes clearly visible, {{negative}} effects on the <b>autochthonous</b> species in Jablaničko Lake. In Salakovačko Lake these effects are in progress, although less visible, while in Grabovičko Lake {{it is not yet}} clearly visible.|$|E
25|$|In {{parts of}} the Arabian {{peninsula}} and Socotra, there exist a number of indigenous populations with deeply pigmented complexions. Among these dark brown-skinned <b>autochthonous</b> groups are the Mahra, Soqotri, Qara and Janaba, who speak south Semitic languages.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Roman {{military}} presence in the south and east of the Iberian Peninsula since the 2nd century BC would have reinforced the role of the <b>autochthonous</b> warrior elites, with better access to local prestige items and importations.|$|E
25|$|Historically the {{ethnicity}} of the Italian {{people was}} mainly made of romanized <b>autochthonous</b> Italics and Gauls, with additions of Germanic populations (like Longobards) and -in very small amounts- of other bordering people (like Slovenes, Austrians, Albanians, etc..).|$|E
25|$|Jaspers {{thought that}} psychiatrists could {{diagnose}} delusions {{in the same}} way. He argued that clinicians should not consider a belief delusional based {{on the content of}} the belief, but only based on the way in which a patient holds such a belief. (See delusion for further discussion.) Jaspers also distinguished between primary and secondary delusions. He defined primary delusions as <b>autochthonous,</b> meaning that they arise without apparent cause, appearing incomprehensible in terms of a normal mental process. (This is a slightly different use of the word <b>autochthonous</b> than the ordinary medical or sociological use as a synonym for indigenous.) Secondary delusions, on the other hand, he defined as those influenced by the person's background, current situation or mental state.|$|E
25|$|By this token a {{theoretical}} dichotomy exists between advocates of <b>autochthonous</b> developments, that is, developments occurring from internal - often functionalist - processes, and those proposing that more fundamental {{in the creation}} of History have been native genius, diffusion, migrations, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|In the Bronze and Iron Ages {{the region}} was home {{to a series of}} <b>autochthonous</b> {{cultures}} occupying roughly the area of the later county of Tyrol. The most prominent are the late Bronze Age Laugen-Melaun culture and Iron Age Fritzens-Sanzeno culture cultures.|$|E
25|$|The pre-Christian Armenians had Aramazd as an {{important}} deity in their pantheon of gods. He {{is thought to be}} a syncretic deity, a combination of the <b>autochthonous</b> Urartian figure Ara and the Iranian Ahura Mazda. In modern-day Armenia, Aramazd is a male first name.|$|E
25|$|Extravascular or <b>autochthonous</b> bubbles usually form in slow tissues such as joints, tendons {{and muscle}} sheaths. Direct {{expansion}} causes tissue damage, {{with the release}} of histamines and their associated affects. Biochemical damage may be as important as, or more important than mechanical effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{well known}} Son de la Ma Teodora, an ancient Cuban song, {{as well as}} the first Cuban <b>autochthonous</b> genres, Punto and Zapateo, show the Sesquiáltera rhythm on their accompaniment, which greatly {{associate}} those genres to the Spanish song-dances from the 16th to the 18th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife in {{the lake}} mostly {{consists}} of the fish species which were introduced since the 1950s. The most common fish {{in the lake}} are the introduced silver carp and grass carp, but large <b>autochthonous</b> wels catfish, weighting over , can also be found, causing concern among the swimmers so the authorities issued a statement that they are harmless.|$|E
25|$|Manx is a Goidelic Celtic {{language}} {{and is one}} of a number of insular Celtic languages spoken in the British Isles. Manx has been officially recognised as a legitimate <b>autochthonous</b> regional language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ratified by the United Kingdom on 27 March 2001 on behalf of the Isle of Man government.|$|E
25|$|The {{colonisation}} with Roman or Romanized elements, {{the use of}} the Latin {{language and}} the assimilation of Roman civilisation as well as the intense development of urban centres led to the Romanization of part of the <b>autochthonous</b> population in Dacia. This process was probably concluded by the 10th century when the assimilation of the Slavs by the Daco-Romanians was completed.|$|E
25|$|Anthropological {{research}} in 1982 on skeletons from 108 stećak graves (13-14th century) from Raška Gora near Mostar, as well some from Grborezi near Livno, shown homogeneity of the serials with clean Dinaric anthropological type, without other admixtures, indicating non-Slavic origin, yet <b>autochthonous</b> Vlachian population. The research of 11 skeletons from necropolis at Pavlovac near Prača, often {{attributed to the}} Pavlović noble family, also shown clean Dinaric type, indicating Vlachian origin, although historical sources don't call Pavlovići as Vlachs. The anthropological {{research in}} 1991 on the 40 skeletons from 28 burials (dated 1440-1450s) beneath stećci at plateau Poljanice {{near the village of}} Bisko showed {{that the vast majority of}} the population belonged to the <b>autochthonous</b> Dinaric type, concluding they were anthropologically of non-Slavic origin. 21 skeleton belonged to child burial, while of 19 adult burials 13 belonged to males. The quarry for stećci was found in the Northwestern part of the plateau, with one ridge as semi-finished work without any ornament.|$|E
25|$|The ancient {{population}} of the region consisted of various <b>autochthonous</b> local and migrant tribes who were mostly non-Indo-Europeans. According to the prevailing western theory, these natives intermarried with Armenians {{who came to the}} region after its inclusion into Armenia in the 2nd or, possibly earlier, in 4th century BC. Other scholars suggest that the Armenians settled in the region as early as in the 7th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Like most native Caucasian peoples, the Georgians do not {{fit into}} any of the main ethnic {{categories}} of Europe or Asia. The Georgian language, the most pervasive of the Kartvelian languages, is neither Indo-European, Turkic nor Semitic. The present day Georgian or Kartvelian nation is thought to have resulted from the fusion of aboriginal, <b>autochthonous</b> inhabitants with immigrants who moved into South Caucasus from the direction of Anatolia in remote antiquity.|$|E
25|$|More {{numerous}} are the votive inscriptions {{dedicated to}} the <b>autochthonous</b> Cosus, Bandua, Nabia, and Reue. Hundreds of Latin inscriptions have survived with dedications to gods and goddesses. Archaeological finds such as ceremonial axes decorated with animal sacrificial scenes, together with the severed head sculptures and the testimonies of classical authors, confirms the ceremonial sacrifice of animals, and probably including human sacrifice as well, as among Lusitanians and Gauls.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{can also}} be indirect, via another organism, either a vector (e.g. a {{mosquito}} or fly) or an intermediate host (e.g. tapeworm in pigs can be transmitted to humans who ingest improperly cooked pork). Indirect transmission could involve zoonoses or, more typically, larger pathogens like macroparasites with more complex life cycles. Transmissions can be <b>autochthonous</b> (i.e. between two individuals in the same place) or may involve travel of the microorganism or the affected hosts.|$|E
25|$|Sitting statues: They usually depicts what is {{considered}} to be a god sitting on a decorated throne, wearing viriae or bracelets, and holding a cup or pot. Although the motives are <b>autochthonous,</b> their model are clearly Mediterranean; nevertheless, unlike the Gallaecian ones, the Iberian sitting statues usually depicts goddesses. Some few statues of feminine divinities are also known representing a standing nude woman only wearing a torc, as the male warrior statues.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{geographic}} influences, the genetic profile of the Moroccan population is a complex mosaic of <b>autochthonous</b> Maghrebi lineages, as well as Northeast African, European, West Asian and West African elements in variable degrees. Though Northwest Africa has experienced gene flow from the surrounding regions, it has also undergone long periods of genetic isolation in some parts. This has allowed distinctive genetic markers to evolve in some Maghrebi populations, especially in certain isolated Berber-speaking groups.|$|E
25|$|The Illyrian descent theory {{soon became}} one of the pillars of Albanian nationalism, {{especially}} because it could provide some evidence of continuity of an Albanian presence both in Kosovo and in southern Albania, i.e., areas that were subject to ethnic conflicts between Albanians, Serbs and Greeks. Under the government of Enver Hoxha, an <b>autochthonous</b> ethnogenesis was promoted and physical anthropologists tried to demonstrate that Albanians were different from any other Indo-European populations, a theory now disproved.|$|E
25|$|Expansion {{evolved into}} a general {{complacency}} as the 20th century progressed. During {{the early part of}} this period, the ACC reinforced its traditional role as the establishment church, although influences from the <b>autochthonous</b> Protestant social gospel movement, and the Christian socialism of elements in the Church of England increasingly were felt. This influence would eventually result in the creation of what would come to be known as the Primate's World Relief and Development Fund, in 1958.|$|E
