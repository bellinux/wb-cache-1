40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{the requirements of the}} Bachelor of Laws Degree, Strathmore University Law SchoolThe Constitution of Kenya provides that every citizen has the right to property. The provision ensures that an individual or group of people that acquire land have the protection to own this property if <b>acquired</b> <b>lawfully.</b> Individuals living in informal settlements then have a right to have property when acquired through proper means. Even though there are processes in progress {{to address the issue of}} securing tenure rights in informal settlements by the government. It is insufficient as there is a shift from many land laws to a more harmonized legal framework there is still a gap on addressing issues on informal settlements. The lack of security of tenure - in law and practice - makes protection against forced eviction very difficult, leaving the most vulnerable, such as inhabitants of informal settlements, at risk of a range of human rights violations. Therefore, this paper seeks to address how informal settlements can acquire security of land tenure through being categorized as a community. It analyses the theory of the tragedy of the commons and social contracts in relation to informal settlements. Finally, it establishes whether the community land act of 2016 shall be able to accommodate informal settlements to resolve the issue of land tenur...|$|R

50|$|Using a trick, such as lying, to get {{possession}} of property is larceny. Larceny by trick is descriptive {{of the method}} used to obtain possession. The concept arose from Pear’s Case decided in 1779. The issue was whether {{a person who had}} fraudulently obtained {{possession of}} personal property (a horse) could be convicted of larceny. The chief impediment to conviction was the doctrine of possessorial immunity which said that a person who had <b>acquired</b> possession <b>lawfully,</b> that is with the consent of the owner, could not be prosecuted for larceny. Clearly the owner of the horse had given the defendant possession of the animal - he had agreed that the defendant could borrow the horse to ride to Surrey. The case would seem to have been cut and dried - the doctrine of possessorial immunity applied and the defendant was therefore not guilty of larceny. The court held that consent induced by fraud was not consent {{in the eyes of the}} law. The fraudulent act that induced the owner to transfer possession “vitiated” the consent. This concept of consent broadened the scope of larceny. Before, consent meant the voluntary relinquishment of possession and thus property was wrongfully taken only if the defendant acquired possession by stealth, force or threat of force.|$|R

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} Section 109 of the Copyright Act, {{the first}} sale doctrine, {{in the context}} of digital media and internet-based storage. Traditionally, the first sale doctrine served as an important limitation on the exclusive rights of copyright owners, allowing copies of lawfully obtained works to be resold without interference from the copyright owner. As a result of this limitation, physical media remains freely alienable after the first sale, providing secondary markets for used copies and more consumer choice. However, {{due to the nature of}} digital media and the recent market shift among media distributors, first sale doctrine has become ambiguous and inconsistently applied. This Article argues that Section 109 of the Copyright Act should be amended to allow consumers to resell their <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquired</b> digital media. By amending the Copyright Act for the digital media age, copyright holders will benefit from the increased clarity of the extent of their rights, while consumers will benefit from greater choice and competition in the market. Alternatively, this Article argues that reinterpreting the first sale doctrine using the common law principle of copyright exhaustion is necessary to restore the balance between the ability of copyright holders to exploit their works and the ability of consumers to alienate and resell their property...|$|R
40|$|There are {{increasing}} {{tensions between the}} First Amendment and the common law torts of intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, and privacy. This Article discusses the conflicting interactions among the three models that are competing for primacy as the tort law governing expressive activities evolves to accommodate {{the requirements of the}} First Amendment. At one extreme there is the model that expression containing information which has been lawfully obtained that contains neither intentional falsehoods nor incitements to immediate violence can only be sanctioned in narrowly defined exceptional circumstances, even if that expression involves matters that are universally regarded as being of no public interest. At the other extreme is the model that some expression which, though lawfully obtained, reveals to a wider audience intimate private information about another should be subject to sanction, as should verbal abuse of a private figure even if there is no implicit threat of physical violence. Some provisions of the American Restatement adopted with scant attention to constitutional developments have taken, and to some extent continue to take, that position. Finally, there is an intermediate model—now gaining wide-spread support in Europe and to some extent in America, even among some members of the United States Supreme Court—that expression which does not concern matters of “public concern” can be subject to public sanction even if it has been <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquired</b> and involves no threats of physical aggression against others.

50|$|After these {{arguments}} were given, {{the court of}} appeal indicated they did not need further submissions on the wager or insurance point (they did not think the arguments were very good at all). Dickens QC and Wilfred Baugh Allen appeared for Mrs Carlill. They argued the advertisement was clearly an advertisement {{that looked like it}} should be acted on, and it was rich for the company to then say it was an empty boast. The advert was to the whole public, and a contract arose whenever the conditions in the ad were acted on. There needed to be no direct communication, because conduct in accordance with terms of an agreement can constitute acceptance. When an offer is made to all the world, nothing can be imported beyond the conditions initially stated, nor can notice before the event be required. The promise is to those who do the required acts, not to those who say and then do the act. The terms were not uncertain, nor were the parties uncertain, and it should be clear that people who <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquired</b> a smokeball could benefit. There would be no reason for a limitation to people who got the smokeball as a gift, because an increased sale being a benefit to the defendants, though effected through a middleman, {{and the use of the}} balls must be presumed to serve as an advertisement and increase the sale. The amount of time the smokeball should last (and the company be bound by) was a matter of construction, of which several were possible (a fortnight, till the flu epidemic ends). The best would be a reasonable period of a fortnight. The consideration was good and the case of Gerhard v. Bates did not undermine it.|$|R

5000|$|Though women possess {{significant}} {{property rights}} under the current Brazilian Constitution, de facto inheritance and land reform regimes undermine women's ability to acquire and retain property in Brazil. Under the Civil Code of Brazil, married women could not <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquire</b> or possess their own property until 1962. The inheritance law differs based on matrimonial regimes, {{of which there are}} four: Partial Property Ruling (Comunhão Parcial), Community Property Ruling (Comunhão de Bens), Separate Property Ruling (Separação de Bens), Final Partition of Acquisitions (Participação Final dos Aqüestos).These were unfavorable to women, although they have been reformed in the 21st century. The regimes have been criticized as positioning widows as mere custodians of property for children, rather than legitimate property owners. Indeed, studies show that a woman's ability to exercise her right to inherited property is largely influenced by whether she is viewed as a potential agriculturalist. Women are often denied access to inherited property because they do not inherit from their fathers and are not recognized as worthy heads of productive units. Though consensual unions were recognized by the 1988 Constitution, women in consensual unions were not endowed with the same inheritance rights as married women until 1994. With the return to civilian rule in 1985, President José Sarney made the more equitable distribution of land one of his attested objectives, issuing a directive to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform and Land Development in 1986 urging that beneficiaries of land be chose [...] "independently of sex." [...] In conjunction with the democratic opening of the 1980s, a rural women's movement emerged with calls for inclusion of women in rural unions and guarantee of social security benefits, such as paid maternity leave and retirement pensions, for rural women. The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), which is the largest organization of agricultural workers in Brazil, tackled women's rights for the first time during its fourth congress in 1985, when it decided to extend membership to more women and actively work to end gender discrimination. Demands for more equitable agrarian property rights, championed by organizations such as the Central Workers' Union, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Women's Council led to agrarian reform measures in the 1988 Constitution. Grievances regarding equal land distribution in Brazil continued, evident in the Marcha da Margaridas of 2000, in which over fifteen thousand women marched on the capital to demand joint allocation of land to couples, rather than just men.The 2003 Civil Code improved women's rights, providing for gender equality in the acquisition, management, and administration of property brought into the union or acquired after marriage. However customary rules continue to be applied in practice, especially in rural areas, undermining women's property rights.|$|R
