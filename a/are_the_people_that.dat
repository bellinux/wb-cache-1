500|$|Durst {{named the}} band Limp Bizkit, {{because he wanted}} a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, [...] "The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> we don't even want {{listening}} to our music." [...] Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed {{an interest in the}} band pressured its members to change its name.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Shankly wrote: [...] "Right {{from the}} start as a manager (i.e., {{when he was at}} Carlisle) I tried to show that the fans <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> matter. You've got to know how to treat them (and) have them on your side". This was {{particularly}} true at Liverpool and Shankly said he was [...] "made for Liverpool (where) the people that matter most are the ones who come through the turnstiles". He added that [...] "a manager has got to identify himself with the people (because) football is their whole life". In return, he said, the support of the Liverpool fans for their team had been [...] "incredible".|$|E

500|$|The song {{is carried}} by an [...] "anthemic" [...] {{sound and the}} [...] "riveting vocals" [...] of lead vocalist Dawn Michele. Bassist Wendy Drennen said that [...] "Unbreakable" [...] was about [...] "overcoming a {{defeated}} mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, [...] "Where <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> accused me?" [...] Richardson said, [...] "The people in charge were ready to kill her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and makes them feel ashamed for accusing her ... She knows she’s guilty, and yet she’s suddenly free and given a second chance." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{promoting}} an October 28, 2010 Detroit gig by the Pointer Sisters - then comprising Anita and Ruth Pointer and Sadako Johnson - Ruth Pointer, asked [...] "Do you [...] plan on recording {{an album}} with Sadako?", replied: [...] "Hmm...not really. We {{talk about it}} from time to time, but the business has changed so much. It's not {{like the old days}} when you just have a record deal and go in the studio and record with a producer and then start promoting." [...] In the same interview Ruth Pointer commented on the Pointer Sister's profile having dropped in recent years: [...] "We've performed a lot in Europe and Asia and Australia, and it's just that we haven't been very visible publicly in the [...] We still do a lot of corporate parties and private parties because I mean, let's face it, those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are in our own age group and know our songs." ...|$|E

60|$|About {{the year}} 1763, when Florida was ceded by the Spaniards to the English, {{we are told}} that the Indians {{generally}} retired from the towns and the neighborhood of the whites, and burying themselves in the deep forests, intricate swamps and hommocks, and vast savannas of the interior, devoted themselves to a pastoral life, and the rearing of horses and cattle.

Every day is interesting and a challenge in its' own way, but I get to go to interesting places and see interesting things and meet interesting people--people like Tony Ratte. It is my privilege and an honour to call you my colleague, but most important to me is to call you my friend.|$|R
60|$|As to the {{travellers}} {{that have}} been quoted, absurd {{as they are in}} the ground of their argument, they are not less absurd in their reasonings. For, having first laid it down that there is no property, and that the government is the proprietor of everything, they argue, inferentially, that they have no laws. But if ever there were a people that seem to be protected with care and circumspection from all arbitrary power, both in the executive and judicial department, these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> seem to be so protected.|$|E
60|$|I {{shall not}} give you the address of Johnny Upright. Let it suffice that {{he lives in the}} most respectable street in the East End--a street that would be {{considered}} very mean in America, but a veritable oasis in the desert of East London. It is surrounded on every side by close-packed squalor and streets jammed by a young and vile and dirty generation; but its own pavements are comparatively bare of the children who have no other place to play, while it has an air of desertion, so few <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> come and go.|$|E

He found me when I was so miserable--I was going to drown myself; I looked so poor and forsaken; {{you would have thought}} I was a beggar by the wayside. And he treated me as if I had been a king's daughter. He took me to the best of women. He found my brother for me. And he honors my brother--though he too was poor--oh, almost as poor as he could be. And my brother honors him. That is no light thing to say"--here Mirah's tone changed to one of {{profound}} emphasis, and she shook her head backward: [...] "for my brother is very learned and great-minded. And Mr. Deronda says there are few men equal to him." [...] Some Jewish defiance had flamed into her indignant gratitude and her anger could not help including Gwendolen since she seemed to have doubted Deronda's goodness.|$|E
60|$|That {{was what}} the guide asked when we were {{looking up at the}} bronze horses on the Arch of Peace. It meant, do you wish to go up there? I give it as a {{specimen}} of guide-English. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> make life a burthen to the tourist. Their tongues are never still. They talk forever and forever, and {{that is the kind of}} billingsgate they use. Inspiration itself could hardly comprehend them. If they would only show you a masterpiece of art, or a venerable tomb, or a prison-house, or a battle-field, hallowed by touching memories or historical reminiscences, or grand traditions, and then step aside and hold still for ten minutes and let you think, it would not be so bad. But they interrupt every dream, every pleasant train of thought, with their tiresome cackling. Sometimes when I have been standing before some cherished old idol of mine that I remembered years and years ago in pictures in the geography at school, I have thought I would give a whole world if the human parrot at my side would suddenly perish where he stood and leave me to gaze, and ponder, and worship.|$|E
6000|$|This is a deplorable {{condition}} of things, {{and perhaps not}} quite without example at home, where, however, many people still intend to read books, and order them at the libraries, though they never really carry out intentions which, like those of Wilkins Micawber the younger, are excellent. To persons conscious of mental debility and incapable of grappling even with a short shilling novel, a brief and easy form of reading may be recommended. They may study catalogues; they may peruse the lists of their wares which secondhand booksellers and dealers {{in all kinds of}} curiosities circulate gratis. This is the only kind of circular which should not go straight to its long home in the waste-paper basket. A catalogue is full of information. It is so exceedingly inconsecutive that even the most successful barrister, or doctor, or stockbroker (they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> read least) need not be fatigued by its contents. The catalogue skips from gay to grave, from Tupper to Aretino, from Dickens to [...] "Drelincourt on Death." [...] You can pick it up where you like, and lay it down when your poor fagged attention is distracted by a cab in the street, or a bird in the branches. Then there is the pleasure of marking with a pencil the articles which you would buy if you could--the Nankin double bottle, the old novel bound in the arms of the Comtesse de Verrue, the picture ascribed to the school of Potto Pottoboileri. Of course, in these bad times, such purchases are out of the question, but the taste and judgment are gratified by [...] "marking them down," [...] like partridges in September.|$|E

6000|$|Third. Not only thus, but, 1. God hath begotten believers {{again to}} Himself, to be His adopted and {{accepted}} children, {{in and through}} the Lord Jesus (1 Peter 1:3). 2. God hath prepared a kingdom for them before {{the foundation of the}} world, through Jesus Christ (Matt 25:34). 3. He hath given them an earnest of their happiness while they live here in this world. [...] "After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory," [...] and that through this Jesus (Eph 1:13,14). [These things are more fully laid down {{in that part of the}} book which containeth the discourse of the privileges of the new covenant]. 4. If His children sin through weakness, or by sudden temptation, they confessing of it, He willingly forgives, and heals all their wounds, reneweth His love towards them, waits to do them good, casteth their sins into the depths of the sea, and all this freely, without any work done by men as men--Not for your own sakes do I do this, O house of Israel, be it known unto you, saith the Lord, but wholly and alone by the blood of Jesus (Eze 36:23,23). 5. In a word, if you would see it altogether, God's love was the cause why Jesus Christ was sent to bleed for sinners. Jesus Christ's bleeding stops the cries of Divine justice; God looks upon them as complete in Him, gives them to Him as His by right of purchase. Jesus ever lives to pray for them that are thus given unto Him. God sends His Holy Spirit into them to reveal this to them, sends His angels to minister for them; and all this by virtue of an Everlasting Covenant between the Father and the Son. Thrice happy <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are in such a case! ...|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} Hudson River was {{inhabited}} by indigenous peoples ages before Europeans arrived.

In fact, <b>the</b> Lenape Indians <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> waited for <b>the</b> explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano onshore, traded with Henry Hudson, and sold the island of Manhattan. Further north, the Wappingers lived from Manhattan Island up to Poughkeepsie. They lived a similar lifestyle to the Lenape, residing in various villages along the river. They traded with both the Lenape {{to the south and}} the Mahicans to the north. The Mahicans lived in the northern valley from present-day Kingston to Lake Champlain, with their capital located near present-day Albany.|$|R
