25|$|For {{many years}} African-American culture {{developed}} separately from European-American culture, {{both because of}} slavery and the persistence of racial discrimination in America, as well as African-American slave descendants' desire to create and maintain their own traditions.

25|$|The {{publication}} of the book brought some literary fame to Goyen, both in New York and in Texas. He would later recall that he felt that “everyone he met in the literary world wanted a piece of him, wanted to admire him as the moment’s fashion, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time he felt that others were angry at him for his moment of public recognition.” He would also recall later that he was “just about disinherited” by his family after the book’s publication, and “fell out of favor with many people” in his home town.|$|E
500|$|On the {{original}} LP's third disc, entitled Apple Jam, {{four of the}} five tracks – [...] "Out of the Blue", [...] "Plug Me In", [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] – are improvised instrumentals built around minimal chord changes, {{or in the case of}} [...] "Out of the Blue", a single-chord riff. The title for [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] originated from the name of Clapton's dog, Jeep, and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album. In a December 2000 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison explained: [...] "For the jams, I didn't want to just throw [...] in the cupboard, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time it wasn't part of the record; that's why I put it on a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus." ...|$|E
500|$|Vincent D'Onofrio's {{character}} in [...] "Subway" [...] partially inspired {{the creation of}} the antagonist played by Bryan Cranston in [...] "Drive", a sixth season episode of The X-Files, which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant thing they did in this episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end (you) still feel his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, the {{executive}} producers of [...] It was directed by Mike Vejar, his sixth episode of the series. He previously directed episodes for three other Star Trek series. When asked {{about the use of}} time travel stories in Star Trek in relation to [...] "Carpenter Street", Scott Bakula said that [...] "Obviously it's something you want to be careful of, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time I'm told that the fans love the time travel episodes, and there's certainly an effort on Rick and Brannon's part to write things that they hope the fans will love. This particular journey back in time is very grounded in story." [...] He added that he believed that the setting for the episode was chosen because the production values were [...] "easily accomplished" [...] and that [...] "because the episode deals with germ warfare, and that certainly is a relevant topic today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Jesper W. Nielsen {{said the}} series is [...] "About how one woman's search for a lost child opens Pandora's box; {{revealing}} the terrible lies and secrets in the little village of Redwater" [...] and [...] "about how the strong bonds of love in a family can hold everything together, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time—destroy everything. It has echoes of a Shakespearean drama, told in a rich cinematic style, loaded with humour and suspense." [...] Editor Celia Haining said that Kat and Alfie [...] "end up becoming entangled with four generations of an Irish family who all have their own mysterious secrets about the past". Richie confirmed that Alfie's brain tumour {{would be part of}} the story, and that Kat and Alfie's storylines are [...] "part of a large tapestry of other stories that are happening in Redwater." [...] Ian McElhinney, who plays Lance Byrne in the series, described the village of Redwater as a [...] "small community" [...] that is dominated by the Byrne family, who are connected to everyone else. The series also revolves around a family tragedy that happened 21 years previously. Fionnula Flanagan, who plays Agnes Byrne in the series, confirmed that it is about [...] "the suppressed whisperings and shoulder nudges that were for decades a feature of Irish rural life".|$|E

25|$|While the Jews were {{suffering}} persecution, one group that probably experienced increased empowerment in the Late Middle Ages was women.

50|$|The winter {{designer}} garbs {{were described}} as having an air of casual elegance that was distinctive <b>and</b> sophisticated, <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time, fun.
