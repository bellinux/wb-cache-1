40|$|Data {{on recent}} and {{historic}} pesticide use, pesticide application methods, and farm characteristics {{were collected from}} 35, 879 restricted-use pesticide <b>applicators</b> in the first 2 years of the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective study of a large cohort of private and commercial licensed pesticide <b>applicators</b> that is being conducted in Iowa and North Carolina. (In Iowa, <b>applicators</b> are actually “certified,” while in North Carolina they are “licensed”; for ease of reference the term license {{will be used for}} both states in this paper.) Commercial <b>applicators</b> (studied in Iowa only) apply pesticides more days per year than private <b>applicators</b> in either state. When the types of pesticides being used by different groups are compared using the Spearman coefficient of determination (r 2), we find that Iowa private and Iowa commercial <b>applicators</b> tend to use the same type of pesticides (r 2 = 0. 88). White and nonwhite private <b>applicators</b> tended to use the same type of pesticides (North Carolinar 2 = 0. 89), as did male and female private <b>applicators</b> (Iowar 2 = 0. 85 and North Carolinar 2 = 0. 84). There was less similarity (r 2 = 0. 50) between the types of pesticides being used by Iowa and North Carolina private <b>applicators.</b> A greater portion of Iowa private <b>applicators</b> use personal protective equipment than do North Carolina private <b>applicators,</b> and pesticide application methods varied by state.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cyanazine is {{a common}} {{pesticide}} used frequently in the United States during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Animal and human {{studies have suggested that}} triazines may be carcinogenic, but results have been mixed. We evaluated cancer incidence in cyanazine-exposed pesticide <b>applicators</b> among the 57, 311 licensed pesticide <b>applicators</b> in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). METHODS: We obtained detailed pesticide exposure information from a self-administered questionnaire completed at enrollment (1993 – 1997). Cancer incidence was followed through January 2002. Over half of cyanazine-exposed <b>applicators</b> had ≥ 6 years of exposure at enrollment, and approximately 85 % had begun using cyanazine before the 1990 s. We used adjusted Poisson regression to calculate rate ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of multiple cancer sites among cyanazine-exposed <b>applicators.</b> We calculated ptrend values, and all statistical tests were twosided. Two exposure metrics were used: tertiles of lifetime days of exposure (LD) and intensityweighted LD. RESULTS: A total of 20, 824 cancer-free AHS <b>applicators</b> reported ever using cyanazine at enrollment. Cancer incidence comparisons between <b>applicators</b> with the lowest cyanazine exposure an...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Poor and {{inconsistent}} use of study products has hindered clinical HIV prevention studies. It {{is important to}} be able to monitor product adherence and protocol compliance in order to determine microbicide efficacy and safety more accurately. Current methods for monitoring adherence are subjective, non-specific, or invasive. Herein, we present a composite, objective measure of product adherence and protocol compliance to assess vaginal insertion, semen exposure and drug expulsion utilizing DNA, protein, and drug isolated directly from returned, vaginally used gel <b>applicators.</b> METHODS: DNA, vaginal cells, and residual tenofovir were isolated from vaginally inserted <b>applicators.</b> Vaginal and semen biomarkers were amplified using a multiplex PCR to determine vaginal insertion. Vaginal cells were fixed followed by cytokeratin 4 immunocytochemistry to confirm DNA assessment of vaginal insertion. Tenofovir was extracted and quantitated through LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: DNA isolated from vaginally inserted <b>applicators</b> were positive for vaginal bacteria DNA and the control eukaryotic gene, amelogenin, while manually handled, "sham", <b>applicators</b> were negative for both. Semen exposure was independently determined by simultaneous amplification of one or both Y-chromosomal genes, SRY and TSPY 4. Vaginal insertion determination by DNA analysis was further confirmed by positive cytokeratin 4 (CK 4) immunocytochemistry of vaginal cells remaining on the gel <b>applicators.</b> On the contrary, sham <b>applicators</b> provided very few cells when swabbed, and they were all negative for CK 4. CK 4 was not found in epidermal cells from the hand. Drug expulsion was detected through quantitation of residual gel present on the surface of returned <b>applicators.</b> Sham <b>applicators</b> had no detectable tenofovir. CONCLUSION: Utilizing a composite, triple marker based panel of DNA, protein, and drug present on the surface of returned vaginal gel <b>applicators,</b> it is possible to determine, objectively and non-invasively, product adherence, protocol compliance, and semen exposure in microbicide trials...|$|R

5|$|Using this information, {{a plan of}} {{the optimal}} {{distribution}} of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the treatment site, should be placed and positioned. Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles or plastic catheters. The specific type of <b>applicator</b> used {{will depend on the}} type of cancer being treated and the characteristics of the target tumour.|$|E
5|$|Remote afterloading systems provide {{protection}} from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they {{are connected to}} an ‘afterloader’ machine (containing the radioactive sources) {{through a series of}} connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the <b>applicator.</b> This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the three}} main {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate {{to the position of}} the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or <b>applicator</b> is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the <b>applicator</b> after the <b>applicator</b> is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the dosimetric {{properties}} of small field electron beams shaped by circular Cerrobend blocks and stainless steel tubular <b>applicators.</b> Percentage depth dose curves, beam profiles, and output factors of small-size circular fields from 2 to 5 cm diameter, obtained either by tubular <b>applicators</b> and Cerrobend blocks, were measured for 6, 10, and 15 MeV electron beam energies. All measurements were performed using a PTW microDiamond 60019 premarket prototype. An overall similar behavior between the two collimating systems can be observed in terms of PDD and beam profiles. However, Cerrobend collimators produce a higher bremsstrahlung background under irradiation with high-energy electrons. In such irradiation condition, larger output factors are observed for tubular <b>applicators.</b> Similar dosimetric properties are observed using circular Cerrobend blocks and stainless steel tubular <b>applicators</b> at lower beam energies. However, Cerrobend collimators allow the delivery of specific beam shapes, conformed to the target area. On the other hand, in high-energy irradiation conditions, tubular <b>applicators</b> produce a lower bremsstrahlung contribution, leading to lower doses outside the target volume. In addition, the higher output factors observed at high energies for tubular <b>applicators</b> lead to reduced treatment times...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of any treatment of cancer is to maximize the likelihood of killing the tumor while minimizing the chance of damaging healthy tissues. One {{of the most effective}} ways to accomplish this is through radiation therapy, which must be able to target the tumor volume with a high accuracy while minimizing the dose delivered to healthy tissues. A successful method of accomplishing this is brachytherapy which works by placing the radiation source in very close proximity to the tumor. However, most current applications of brachytherapy rely mostly on the geometric manipulation of isotropic sources, which limits the ability to specifically target the tumor. The purpose of this work is to introduce several types of shielded brachytherapy <b>applicators</b> which are capable of targeting tumors with much greater accuracy than existing technologies. These <b>applicators</b> rely on the modulation of the dose profile through a high-density tungsten alloy shields to create anisotropic dose distributions. Two classes of <b>applicators</b> have been developed in this work. The first relies on the active motion of the shield, to aim a highly directional radiation profile. This allows for very precise control of the dose distribution for treatment, achieving unparalleled dose coverage to the tumor while sparing healthy tissues. This technique has been given the moniker of Dynamic Modulated Brachytherapy (DMBT). The second class of <b>applicators,</b> designed to reduce treatment complexity uses static <b>applicators.</b> These <b>applicators</b> retain the use of the tungsten shield, but the shield is motionless during treatment. By intelligently designing the shield, significant improvements over current methods have been demonstrated. Although these static <b>applicators</b> fail to match the dosimetric quality of DMBT <b>applicators</b> the simplified setup and treatment procedure gives them significant appeal. The focus of this work has been to optimize these shield designs, specifically for the treatment of rectal and breast carcinomas. The use of Monte Carlo methods and development of optimization algorithms have played a prominent role in accomplishing this. The use of shielded <b>applicators,</b> such as the ones described here, is the next logical step in the rapidly evolving field of brachytherap...|$|R

25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on <b>applicator</b> along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
