25|$|The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Gas-cooled</b> <b>Reactor</b> (AGR) {{is a type}} {{of nuclear}} reactor {{designed}} and operated in the United Kingdom. These are the second generation of British gas-cooled reactors, using graphite as the neutron moderator and carbon dioxide as coolant.

50|$|Nuclear {{power in}} the United Kingdom generates around one sixth (18.5% in 2012) of the country's electricity. The UK has 15 {{operational}} nuclear reactors at seven plants (14 <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactors</b> (AGR) and one pressurised water reactor (PWR)), {{as well as a}} nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield.|$|R
25|$|Currently most of {{the nuclear}} power {{stations}} must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal-fired plants do, {{in order to provide}} more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel rods. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 30–32%. Some advanced reactor designs being studied, such as the very high temperature reactor, <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactor</b> and supercritical water reactor, would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants, producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Dungeness B is an <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactor</b> (AGR) {{power station}} {{consisting}} of two 615 MW reactors, which began operation in 1983 and 1985 respectively. Dungeness B was the first commercial scale AGR power station to be constructed; its design {{was based on the}} much smaller Windscale AGR prototype: the WAGR. The £89 million contract was awarded in August 1965 to Atomic Power Construction ('APC'), a consortium backed by Crompton Parkinson, Fairey Engineering, International Combustion and Richardsons Westgarth. The completion date was set as 1970.|$|E
25|$|The Windscale Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (WAGR) was a {{prototype}} for the UK's {{second generation of}} reactors, the <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactor</b> or AGR, which followed on from the Magnox stations. The WAGR golfball is, along with the pile chimneys, one of the iconic buildings on the Windscale site (Windscale being an independent site within the Sellafield complex).

2500|$|Cook was {{responsible}} for the four magnox reactors at Calder Hall, the four reactors under construction at Chapel Cross, and the uranium enrichment plant at Capenhurst. From Hinton he had inherited a conflict of responsibilities for reactor development between the Industry Group and Cockcroft's Research Group [...] Cockcroft wanted it in the Research Group, and proposed building a research centre in Winfrith with low-powered research reactors for testing various combinations of coolants, neutron moderators and nuclear fuels. In the end, Cockcroft prevailed and Winfrith was built. Cook mainly dealt with the development of new reactors. A number of types were developed, including the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Gas-Cooled</b> <b>Reactor</b> (AGR) at Windscale, considered a natural successor to the Magnox reactors; the Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) at Dounreay; the high-temperature Dragon reactor at Winfrith. In addition, under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the Royal Navy received access to Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) technology used in US nuclear submarines. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1962.|$|E
50|$|Torness was {{the last}} of the United Kingdom’s second {{generation}} nuclear power plants to be commissioned (25 May 1988).The station consists of two <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactors</b> (AGR) capable of producing a peak rating of 1364 MWe. Upon deregulation of the United Kingdom’s electricity generation market it passed to the state-owned Scottish Nuclear, privatised as part of British Energy which was sold to the French company EDF in January 2009, and incorporated in the latter's UK subsidiary EDF Energy. It is expected to operate until 2030.|$|R
5000|$|Magnox <b>reactors,</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactors</b> and {{pebble bed}} <b>reactors</b> are <b>gas-cooled</b> and so void {{coefficients}} {{are not an}} issue. In fact, some can be designed so that total loss of coolant does not cause core meltdown {{even in the absence}} of active control systems. As with any reactor design, loss of coolant is only one of many possible failures that could potentially lead to an accident. In case of accidental ingress of liquid water into the core of pebble bed reactors, a positive void coefficient may occur.|$|R

One design under consideration by the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) program is a modular, prismatic <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactor.</b> In this reactor, the lower plenum region may experience locally high temperatures that can adversely impact the plant’s structural integrity. Since existing system analysis codes cannot capture the complex flow effects occurring in the lower plenum, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes are being employed to model these flows [1].

2500|$|After the war, the Sellafield {{site was}} {{briefly in the}} {{ownership}} of Courtaulds for development as a factory, but was reacquired by the Ministry of Supply to adapt {{the site for the}} production of materials for nuclear weapons, principally plutonium, and construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947. The site was renamed Windscale Works (after Windscale Nook, a bluff on the north bank of the River Calder) to avoid confusion with the Springfields uranium processing factory near Preston. The building of the nuclear plants at Windscale Works was a huge construction project, requiring a peak of 5000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, graphite-moderated Windscale reactors (the [...] "Windscale Piles") constituted the first British weapons grade plutonium-239 production facility, built for the British nuclear weapons programme of the late 1940s and the 1950s. Windscale Pile No. 1 was operational in October 1950 (just over three years from the start of construction at Sellafield), and Pile No. 2 in June 1951. Windscale was later also the site of the prototype British <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E

50|$|With {{his service}} {{experience}} Moore was frequently {{chosen to be}} the public spokesman on atomic issues. When Georgi Malenkov, the Russian energy minister, was shown round the Calder Hall plant in 1956, it was Moore, by then chief design engineer, who assured the press that care had been taken not to tell him either the station's output or commercial value. After the construction of Calder Hall was completed, Moore became director of reactor design at the UK Atomic Energy Authority and {{managing director of the}} establishment's reactor group. As such, he was {{the driving force behind the}} <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactors,</b> which have led to today's more efficient nuclear power.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{details of}} flow and {{conjugate}} heat transfer in <b>Advanced</b> <b>Gas-cooled</b> <b>Reactors</b> are currently not completely understood {{because of the}} reactor complexity and the difficulty to examine the flow while the reactors are in operation. This paper proposes to simulate the flow using Large Eddy Simulation for the turbulence and to compute the conjugate heat transfer by coupling a multi-purpose CFD software with a transient thermal software dedicated to complex solid geometries. Two configurations are used, 1 / 8 th of the full reactor and the full reactor itself. It is shown that simulating 1 / 8 th of the domain only does not allow to reproduce the agitated patterns observed near {{the centre of the}} under-dome, where the temperature is the highest...|$|R

Concrete specimens were conditioned at temperatures of 105 °C and 250 °C, to simulate the maximum thermal load expected to occur during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). Following thermal treatment, these specimens along with an unconditioned control sample were characterised using micro-focus X-ray CT with a spatial resolution of 14. 6 microns. The results indicate that the air void pore structure of the specimens experienced significant volume changes {{as a result of the}} increasing temperature. The increase in the porous volume was more prevalent at 250 °C. Alterations in air void size distributions were characterized with respect to the unconditioned control specimen. These findings appear to correlate with changes in the uni-axial compressive strength of the conditioned concrete...|$|R
40|$|A multi-scale {{approach}} for fracture simulation, {{based on the}} Cellular Automata technique, has been developed and then applied to a nuclear graphite that is used in structural components of the UK <b>Advanced</b> <b>Gas-cooled</b> <b>Reactors</b> (AGR). High resolution X-ray computed tomographs of Gilsocarbon grade graphite, with up to 68 % weight loss by radiolytic oxidation, provide quantitative descriptions of the porosity within its constitutive filler particles and their surrounding matrix. The statistical distributions for tensile strength and elastic modulus obtained from small models of the filler and matrix are introduced to a large scale model of the heterogeneous microstructure. These microstructure-derived simulations achieve a good agreement with experimental data. The computationally efficient analysis is then used to investigate the stochastic effects on mechanical properties of possible variations in the microstructure between individual small test specimens. As these may represent material of nominally the same microstructure, there is an apparent increase in the variability of strength and modulus at high weight loss...|$|R
40|$|Investigations into {{potentially}} {{extending the}} lives of UK <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactors</b> have highlighted the need for improved understanding of the long-term oxidation and carburisation of 9 Cr ferritic steels. These steels were used in evaporators and primary superheaters and as these are to be used beyond their original design lives, {{it is necessary to}} ensure that these degradation routes remain within acceptable levels. A dimensional metrology technique has been applied to archived autoclave samples to measure such damage. These samples had previously been exposed to a range of temperatures, pressures and gas chemistries representative of those experienced by 9 Cr steels in CO 2 -rich AGR gases. Earlier sample assessments had focused on weight change measurements, but the dimensional technique enables measurement of duplex oxide thicknesses around samples and the extraction of related data from longer exposure times. These data also support estimation of the extent of both carbon and oxygen uptake...|$|R

The impact of the storage environment, particularly the effect of immersion in water compared to measurements in air, has also been investigated. A miniature EC probe was developed to induce eddy currents in a pin and to read out EC response. The transducer was robotically moved along the AGR pin and multi-frequency EC responses were acquired using a spectrum analyser. Main results of the experimental investigation are the following: even very small artificial defects such as short EDM notches of depth of 100 μm produce distinguishable EC response; localised clad thinning of depth of 100 μm and above produces considerable EC response levels; effect of water environment on the EC response is negligible; effect of anti-stacking grooves on the EC response is considerable...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of the study is}} the improvement of predictive methods for safety analyses and design of advanced reactors for higher efficiency and enhanced safety and for deployable reactors for electrical power generation, process heat utilization and hydrogen generation. While key applications would be <b>advanced</b> <b>gas-cooled</b> <b>reactors</b> (AGCRs) using the closed Brayton cycle (CBC) for higher efficiency (such as the proposed Gas Turbine - Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) of General Atomics [Neylan and Simon, 1996]), results of the proposed research should also be valuable in reactor systems with supercritical flow or superheated vapors, e. g., steam. Higher efficiency leads to lower cost/kwh and reduces life-cycle impacts of radioactive waste (by reducing waters/kwh). The outcome will also be useful for some space power and propulsion concepts and for some fusion reactor concepts as side benefits, but they are not the thrusts of the investigation.
