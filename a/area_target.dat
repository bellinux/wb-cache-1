25|$|The primary {{armament}} of the BMD-3 is the 30mm 2A42 autocannon in {{the form}} of the original BMP-2 turret. This autocannon is mounted on other vehicles, like the Ka-52 and Mi-28. The 2A42 autocannon is a dual selective feed cannon which is fitted with a distinct muzzle brake and manual weapons laying drives increasing accuracy and consistency. This muzzle brake reduces oscillation of the gun mount at the moment of a round being fired. The practical rate of fire is 200-300 rds/min (rounds per minute) while the cyclic rate of fire is over 550 rds/min. It fires rounds with a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. The BMD-3 has 500 rounds for the 30mm autocannon ready to be used with an additional 360 stowed inside. The maximum effective range when firing AP-T (armor-piercing-tracer) ammunition is 2000 m, and when firing HE-I (high-explosive-incendiary) ammunition is 4000 m against an <b>area</b> <b>target.</b> A 7.62×54mmR PKT machine gun is mounted coaxially on the right side of the main armament. This coaxial machine gun has a cyclic rate of fire of 800 rds/min and is also equipped with one belt of 2000 rounds. The KBP Instrument Design Bureau offers a drop-in one-man turret, called the Kliver turret, with a stabilized 2A72 30mm gun, four Kornet ATGM launchers, thermal sights, a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun, and an improved fire control system.|$|E

The main reason for this large scale price rise was the inventory build up by companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Calfrac Well Services, amidst the fear of shortage of guar gum for drilling due to ongoing drought in Rajasthan. 2013 was a strong year for guar sowing and production in India.

50|$|The maximum {{effective}} point target range of an M4 carbine with M855 rounds is 500 m, {{with a maximum}} effective <b>area</b> <b>target</b> range of 600 m. These mark the greatest distances the rounds {{can be expected to}} accurately hit the target, not the ranges that they have terminal effectiveness against them. Because the M855 is yaw dependent it requires instability in flight to deform upon hitting the target. It is the most stable in flight between 150 - 350 m, potentially lessening its effectiveness if it strikes an enemy between those distances. In addition to this, tests have shown that 5.56 mm bullets fragment most reliably when traveling faster than 2,500 ft/s. From full-length 20 in rifle and machine gun barrels, rounds exhibit velocities above 2,500 ft/s out to 200 m. An M855 fired from a shorter barreled M4 carbine exhibits a bullet velocity of 2,522 ft/s at 150 m range. Even if it impacts at optimum speeds, 70 percent of 5.56 mm bullets will not begin to yaw until 4.7 in of tissue penetration. 15 percent more begin to yaw after that distance, so up to 85 percent of rounds that hit do not start to fragment until nearly 5 in of penetration. Against small statured or thin combatants, the M855 has little chance of yawing before passing through cleanly and leaving a wound cavity no bigger than the bullet itself. The factors of impact angle and velocity, instability distance, and penetration before yaw reduce the round's predictable effectiveness considerably in combat situations.|$|E

One topic that Reardon discussed is that Lee {{came to the}} conclusion to attack in a reasonable way. He evaluate all his options compared them to his ultimate objective. Reardon explains that the first thing that Lee witnessed of day one of Gettysburg is the final attack of the day. It was an attack on open ground and it was a smaller scale of what were later be used at Pickett's Charge. Additionally, on the second day a small amount the Confederate forces were able to get close to the Union line. Ultimately, Reardon argued that Lee asked himself the question 'What can I do?' and then devised a logical plan for the third day. One issue Reardon explains {{is that it is not}} concretely known what was Lee's intention at Gettysburg because there are not a lot of primary sources. For example, there were no notes taken at the meeting between Jefferson Davis and Lee; thus, it is not known was discussed there. At the time of the Civil War, it was not required that there be a commander's intent. Reardon does discuss that the purpose for artillery bombardment was to destroy the Union's artillery in order to hit an <b>area</b> <b>target</b> of both Clump of Trees and Ziegler's Grove. Reardon also discussed how historians believe that Lee was aiming for the seam between two different Union groups.
