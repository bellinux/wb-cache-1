30|$|We added 200  mg of the TiO 2 sample {{material}} to 2  L growth medium {{under sterile conditions}} in a 2  L brown glass flask with a drain port. The preparation was stirred vigorously (700  rpm) {{at room temperature for}} 48  h. Non-dissolved solids were then removed by passing the dispersion through a 0.22  µm-filter (Millipore MCE-MF, cellulose nitrate and <b>acetyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> no. GSWP 04700) without pre-filtration. The clear filtrate, representing the highest test concentration, was diluted with growth medium to prepare further test concentrations differing by a separation factor of 2.|$|E
40|$|The chiroptical {{properties}} and transient rheological behavior of (<b>acetyl)</b> (ethyl) <b>cellulose</b> (AEC) m-cresol liquid crystalline solutions have been investigated. Chiroptical properties were manipulated through (i) increasing degree of acetylation of ethyl cellulose (EC), and (ii) blending AEC with EC. At the same average degree of acetylation (DA), the chiroptical properties of pure AEC {{were different from}} those of the EC/ AEC mixtures. However, at the same DA, the AEC and mixed AEC/EC solutions showed similar steady state flow and oscillatory behaviors, but the transient behaviors were different. At high flow rates the mixed AEC/EC solutions exhibited double recoil after cessation of steady-state flow, whereas the AEC solutions showed double recoil only in the high DA AEC solutions. All solutions, pure and mixed, had the same stress relaxation behavior. Both pitch and handedness affected the transient behavior. After cessation of high shear rate flow, the rate of modulus evolution decreased with increasing pitch, and was faster in right-handed mesophases than in left-handed ones at a similar pitch...|$|R
40|$|Lignocellulose is a {{promising}} and valuable alternative energy source. Native lignocellulosic biomass has limited accessibility to cellulase enzyme due to structural features; therefore, pretreatment {{is an essential}} prerequisite to make biomass accessible and reactive by altering its structural features. The effects of substrate concentration, addition of cellobiase, enzyme loading, and structural features on biomass digestibility were explored. The addition of supplemental cellobiase to the enzyme complex greatly increased the initial rate and ultimate extent of biomass hydrolysis by converting the strong inhibitor, cellobiose, to glucose. A low substrate concentration (10 g/L) was employed to prevent end-product inhibition by cellobiose and glucose. The rate and extent of biomass hydrolysis significantly depend on enzyme loading and structural features resulting from pretreatment, thus the hydrolysis and pretreatment processes are intimately coupled because of structural features. Model lignocelluloses with various structural features were hydrolyzed {{with a variety of}} cellulase loadings for 1, 6, and 72 h. Glucan, xylan, and total sugar conversions at 1, 6, and 72 h were linearly proportional to the logarithm of cellulase loadings from approximately 10 % to 90 % conversion, indicating that the simplified HCH- 1 model is valid for predicting lignocellulose digestibility. Carbohydrate conversions at a given time versus the natural logarithm of cellulase loadings were plotted to obtain the slopes and intercepts which were correlated to structural features (lignin content, <b>acetyl</b> content, <b>cellulose</b> crystallinity, and carbohydrate content) by both parametric and nonparametric regression models. The predictive ability of the models was evaluated by a variety of biomass (corn stover, bagasse, and rice straw) treated with lime, dilute acid, ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX), and aqueous ammonia. The measured slopes, intercepts, and carbohydrate conversions at 1, 6, and 72 h were compared to the values predicted by the parametric and nonparametric models. The smaller mean square error (MSE) in the parametric models indicates more satisfactorily predictive ability than the nonparametric models. The agreement between the measured and predicted values shows that lignin content, <b>acetyl</b> content, and <b>cellulose</b> crystallinity are key factors that determine biomass digestibility, and that biomass digestibility can be predicted over a wide range of cellulase loadings using the simplified HCH- 1 model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acetyl)</b> (ethyl) <b>cellulose</b> (AEC) {{polymers}} with an ethyl {{degree of}} substitution (DS) of 2. 5 and acetyl DS ranging from 0 to 0. 5 form chiral nematic liquid crystals in many organic solvents. The chiroptical properties of these lyotropic AEC mesophases are extremely {{sensitive to the}} acetyl DS of AEC {{and the nature of}} the solvents although the acetyl group and solvents are achiral and all the polymers share the same chiral cellulose backbone. As the acetyl DS increases from 0 to 0. 5, the pitch of AEC mesophases in a given solvent varies from a few nanometer to infinity and a reversal of handedness occurs as a compensated degree of acetylation (DA$ sp*$), where the corresponding mesophase is characterized by an infinite pitch and the absence of macroscopic chirality. The value of DA$ sp*$ and the sign of the temperature dependence of pitch depend on the solvent. Achiral dyes dissolved in these AEC mesophases display liquid crystal induced circular dichroism (LCICD), which results from the helicoidal orientation of the dyes by their chiral matrices. The sign and magnitude of the LCICD are correlated with the handedness and pitch of the AEC mesophases. The mechanism for the handedness inversion for lyotropic AEC mesophases with variation in acetyl DS is discussed...|$|R
