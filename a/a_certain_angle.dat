5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>angle.</b> Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>angle</b> to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E

25|$|The {{torsion balance}} {{consists}} of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak torsion spring. In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an insulating rod with a metal-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a silk thread. The ball was charged with a known charge of static electricity, and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>angle,</b> which could be read from a scale on the instrument. By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his inverse-square proportionality law.|$|E

This reconstruction problem occurs in many physical systems, where physical limitations prohibit the gathering of tomographic data <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>angles.</b> We begin by reviewing some of the classical work on singular value decompositions and POCS {{in the context of}} this problem. We then review some of the classical work by G. S'zego and others on finite Toeplitz operators. We consider the implications of this work toward a classical inversion of the problem. We then introduce an alternate inversion technique which utilizes multiresolution analysis, induced correlations caused by non-linear constraints, and non-linear filtering to mollify the reconstruction process. We show that the uncertainty principles generated in recent works of Donoho, Stark et al guarantee the invertibility but of this alternative inversion technique.

500|$|The ship's {{constant}} movement also impacted character animation. Once the ship's movement reached <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>angle,</b> Hansen {{and any other}} characters on deck start to slide, and have to compensate in whatever direction was necessary relative to their position. According to Levastre, this meant Hansen required nine times the animations usually seen in third-person games (center, front, back, left, right and four intermediary positions). Ultimately, Hansen had {{two hundred and fifty}} separate animations, and most of the non-player characters had one hundred and fifty. According to Antonin Delboy, lead animator on the game, [...] "all the technical decisions were taken in favor of animation, both in terms of quality and quantity, which is very rare on this kind of project." [...] Basic animation was produced with 3D Studio Max software. Inverse kinematics were then used to create the nine directional animations, with the engine calculating the level of character compensation depending on the angle of the ship. Each character movement is composed of basic animation and compensation animation, and Delboy says that in total, the game contains more than nine hundred animations, allowing for over five thousand possible movements. Levastre stated [...] "The interaction between the storm and the characters that are on the deck sometimes creates some really breathtaking moments. And on top of that, we managed to offer some really intense action sequences featuring far more enemies than in most horror games." ...|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the nature of glacial ice and pressure ridges, gouging events from these two types of ice are also different. In both cases, the ice-soil interface is expected to retain <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> equilibrium <b>angle,</b> called the attack angle, during which the gouging process achieves a steady state. Icebergs may adjust to this angle by rotation. Sea ice ridges may do so through the rearrangement of the rubble at the keel-seabed interface or through keel failure.|$|R

[...] Canutt and Wayne pioneered stunt and screen fighting techniques still in use. Much of Wayne's on-screen persona was copied from Canutt.

2500|$|In 1827, Hamilton {{presented}} {{a theory of}} a single function, now known as Hamilton's principal function, that brings together mechanics, optics, and mathematics, and which helped to establish the wave theory of light. He proposed it when he first predicted its existence in the third supplement to his [...] "Systems of Rays," [...] read in 1832. The Royal Irish Academy paper was finally entitled [...] "Theory of Systems of Rays," [...] (23 April 1827) and the first part was printed in 1828 in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.

[...] Along the Quarter Mile, between the academic and residence hall side are various administration and support buildings. On the academic side of the walkway is a courtyard, known as the Infinity Quad due to a striking polished stainless steel sculpture (by Jose' de Rivera, 1968, 19'×8'×2') of a continuous ribbon-like Möbius strip (commonly {{referred to as the}} infinity loop because if the sun hits the strip at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>angle</b> it will cast a shadow in the shape of an infinity symbol on the ground) in the middle of it; on the residence hall side is a sundial and a clock. These symbols represent time to infinity. The Quarter Mile is actually [...] long when measured between the mobius sculpture and the sundial. The name comes from a student fundraiser, where quarters were lined up from the sundial to the Infinity Sculpture. Standing near the Administration Building and the Student Alumni Union is The Sentinel, a steel structure created by the acclaimed metal sculptor, Albert Paley. Reaching 70 feet (21 m) high and weighing 110 tons, the sculpture is the largest on any American university campus.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dynamics}} of excitation transfer between two conjugated polyene molecules whose intermolecular separation {{is comparable to the}} molecular dimensions. We have employed a correlated electron model that includes both the charge-charge, charge-bond, and bond-bond intermolecular electron repulsion integrals. We have shown that the excitation transfer rate varies as inverse square of donor-acceptor separation R- 2 rather than as R- 6, suggested by the Foumlrster type of dipolar approximation. Our time-evolution study alsom shows that the orientational dependence on excitation transfer at a fixed short donor-acceptor separation cannot be explained by Foumlrster type of dipolar approximation beyond <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> orientational <b>angle</b> of rotation of an acceptor polyene with respect to the donor polyene. The actual excitation transfer rate beyond <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> orientational <b>angle</b> is faster than the Foumlrster type of dipolar approximation rate. We have also studied the excitation transfer process in a pair of push-pull polyenes for different push-pull strengths. We have seen that, depending on the push-pull strength, excitation transfer could occur to other dipole coupled states. Our study also allows for the excitation energy transfer to optically dark states which are excluded by Foumlrster theory since the one-photon transition intensity to these states (from the ground state) is zero...|$|R
2500|$|Wharton's {{family had}} long roots in Newport, Rhode Island and he summered {{there with his}} {{extended}} family at the family house on Washington Street for many decades. When his children were young, Wharton enjoyed taking them rowing and sailing about the harbor. Often they would sail across the bay to Conanicut Island to picnic and explore the cliffs and beaches. In 1882 Joseph Wharton, his brother Charles, and other friends purchased plots in Jamestown, Rhode Island, across the bay from Newport and built summer homes there. Wharton constructed Horsehead-Marbella, a large stone house with a prominent tower overlooking the entrance to Narragansett Bay. He named the house [...] "Marbella" [...] but it was later called [...] "Horsehead" [...] after a rock formation on the cliffs below that looked like {{the head of a}} horse from <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>angle.</b> The family was active in swimming and sailing, and the grandchildren enjoyed playing on the rocks and tidal pools below the house. Wharton and his wife Anna enjoyed socializing but preferred the company of a few selected people to many, and avoided balls and late hours. In the early 1890s, the government surveyed sites on Conanicut Island for a coastal fort that would command the entrance to the bay, and took some of Wharton's property along with other nearby summer estates, starting construction of nearby Fort Wetherill in 1896. The fort took several years to finish and during this time the Horsehead property continued to be threatened so Wharton purchased an additional [...] {{in the southern part of}} Jamestown including several farms, one at Beavertail in 1899.
