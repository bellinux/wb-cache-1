5|$|Over {{the course}} of 2014, the {{phenomenon}} of indie games produced several variations of the genre. The game Jungle Rumble uses <b>a</b> <b>mechanic</b> where players drum on a touch screen to control the game. Different rhythms correspond with different verbs to control entities in an RTS like environment. The game Crypt of the NecroDancer uses <b>a</b> <b>mechanic</b> where the player controls the main character {{in sync with the}} soundtrack's beat.|$|E

2500|$|A lien {{against a}} vehicle that is {{asserted}} by <b>an</b> auto <b>mechanic</b> is technically <b>an</b> [...] "artisan's lien" [...] rather than a [...] "mechanic's lien", but it operates {{in a similar fashion}} to <b>a</b> <b>mechanic's</b> lien. [...] <b>A</b> <b>mechanic's</b> lien can only arise against real property i.e., land or buildings.|$|R
25|$|In many states, the {{legislature}} has created extra procedures {{in order for}} <b>a</b> <b>mechanics</b> lien {{to be placed on}} residential property. In New Jersey, which enacted the strictest of these regulations, <b>a</b> <b>mechanics</b> lien can only be placed on residential property after a Notice of Unpaid Balance and Right to File Lien has been filed within 60 days of the lienor's last date of work and an arbitration award has been issued by an American Arbitration Association arbitrator permitting <b>a</b> <b>mechanics</b> lien to be filed.|$|R
50|$|In <b>Mechanics</b> lien law <b>a</b> Preliminary Notice (also {{known as}} a Notice to Owner, Materialmens Notice to Owner, Notice of Furnishing, Contractor/Subcontractors Notice to Owner, and others) is a notice sent by the general contractor, subcontractor, materialmen, {{equipment}} lessors or other parties to a construction project not to create <b>a</b> <b>Mechanics</b> lien but rather to establish the right to file <b>a</b> <b>Mechanics</b> lien {{in the event of}} nonpayment. The distinction is important. If the Preliminary Notice is sent but the claimant's bill is paid, the Preliminary Notice has no further legal effect. However, if the bill is not paid the claimant may now file <b>a</b> <b>Mechanics</b> lien on the owner's property. Most states do not allow the filing of <b>a</b> <b>Mechanics</b> lien without claimants being able to prove they first sent a Preliminary Notice.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of real estate, {{the most common form}} of secured debt is the lien. Liens may either be voluntarily created, as with a {{mortgage}}, or involuntarily created, such as <b>a</b> <b>mechanics</b> lien. <b>A</b> mortgage may only be created with the express consent of the title owner, without regard to other facts of the situation. In contrast, the primary condition required to create <b>a</b> <b>mechanics</b> lien is that real estate is somehow improved through the work or materials provided by the person filing <b>a</b> <b>mechanics</b> lien. Although the rules are complex, consent of the title owner to the mechanics lien itself is not required.|$|R
