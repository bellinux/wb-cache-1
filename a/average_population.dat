40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} <b>population</b> <b>averaging</b> as a preprocessing {{stage for}} linear FIR BMIs. <b>Population</b> <b>averaging</b> is a biologically-inspired technique based on spatial constraints and neuronal correlation. We achieve {{a statistically significant}} improvement in accuracy while substantially (45 %) reducing model parameters. Further analysis is performed to show that <b>population</b> <b>averaging</b> improves model accuracy by reducing variance in estimating the firing rate from spike bins. However, we find that <b>population</b> <b>averaging</b> provides a greater accuracy improvement than other groupings which also reduce firing rate variance.

According to a 2012 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.54 percent per year. Malaysia has an <b>average</b> <b>population</b> density of 96 people per km², ranking it 116th {{in the world for}} population density. People within the 15–64 age group constitute 69.5 percent of the total population; the 0–14 age group corresponds to 24.5 percent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 6.0 percent. In 1960, when the first official census was recorded in Malaysia, the {{population was}} 8.11 million. 91.8 per cent of the population are Malaysian citizens. Malaysian citizens are divided along ethnic lines, with 67.4 per cent considered bumiputera The largest group of bumiputera are Malays, who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. They play a dominant role politically. Bumiputera status is also accorded to certain non-Malay indigenous peoples, including ethnic Thais, Khmers, Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. Non-Malay bumiputera make up more than half of Sarawak's population and over two thirds of Sabah's population. There also exist aboriginal groups in much smaller numbers on the peninsula, where they are collectively known as the Orang Asli. Laws over who gets bumiputera status vary between states.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps 10 {{per cent}} of the {{population}} lived in the burghs that {{had grown up in}} the later medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. They perhaps had an <b>average</b> <b>population</b> of 2,000, but many were much smaller than 1,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} period. Edinburgh doubled in size in the century after 1540, particularly after the plague of 1580, with most of its population probably coming from a growing reservoir in the surrounding countryside. It also expanded beyond the city walls in suburbs at Cowgate, Bristo and Westport and by 1750, with its suburbs, it had reached a population of 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000. By 1600 Scotland had a higher proportion of its population living in larger towns than contemporaneous Scandinavia, Switzerland and most of Eastern Europe: by 1750 in Europe, only Italy, the Low Countries and England were more urbanised than Scotland.|$|E
