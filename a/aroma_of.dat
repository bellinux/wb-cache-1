5|$|The {{volatile}} chemicals {{responsible for}} the fruity <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom are known. The 12 compounds include eight-carbon derivatives such as 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-2-octenol, and (E)-1,3-octadiene.|$|E
5|$|Thelephoric acid {{is present}} in several Hydnellum species. This compound, derived metabolically from the shikimic acid pathway, {{inhibits}} the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase, which is involved in deteriorating certain neuropeptides that are believed to contribute to memory and learning. Hydnellum caeruleum and H.concrescens have several para-terphenyl derivatives named thelephantins (specifically, variants thelephantins I–N), some of which can inhibit the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. The compounds hydnellins A and B are terphenyls found in H. suaveolens and Hydnellum geogerirum. The chemicals responsible for the fragrant anise-like <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> H.suaveolens {{have been identified as}} coumarin and para-anisaldehyde.|$|E

5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} {{described as an}} animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary role}} of malolactic {{fermentation}} is to deacidify wine. It can also affect the sensory {{aspects of a}} wine, making the mouthfeel seem smoother and adding potential complexity in the flavor and <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wine. For these other reasons, most red wines throughout the world (as well as many sparkling wines and nearly 20% of the world's white wines) today go through malolactic fermentation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{strains of}} O. oeni can {{synthesize}} higher alcohols which {{can contribute to}} fruity notes in the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wine. Additionally, some strains of the bacterium have beta-glucosidase enzymes that can break down monoglucosides which are aroma compounds attached to a sugar molecule. When the sugar component is cleaved, {{the rest of the}} compound becomes volatilized, meaning it can potentially be detected in the aroma bouquet of the wine.|$|E
25|$|Chénas - Once {{contained}} many of {{the vineyards}} that are now sold under the Moulin-à-Vent designation. It is now the smallest Cru Beaujolais with wines that are noted for their <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> wild roses. In ideal vintages, a vin de garde is produced that is meant to age {{at least five years}} before consuming and last up to 15. The area named is derived from the forest of French oak trees (chêne) that used to dot the hillside.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{variation}} was to distill in {{the presence}} of sulphuric acid. Although the acid itself does not distil, it imparts the additional <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> diethyl ether to the resulting gin. Sulphuric acid subtracts one water molecule from two ethanol molecules to create diethyl ether, which also forms an azeotrope with ethanol, and therefore distils with it. The result is a sweeter spirit, and one that may have possessed additional analgesic or even intoxicating effects – see Paracelsus.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina, writer Alejandro Dolina, in {{his book}} Crónicas del Ángel Gris ("Chronicles of the Gray Angel"), tells the legend of a massive jacarandá tree planted in Plaza Flores (Flores Square) in Buenos Aires, which was able to whistle tango songs on demand. María Elena Walsh {{dedicated}} her Canción del Jacarandá song to the tree. Also Miguel Brascó's folk song Santafesino de veras mentions the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> jacarandá as {{a defining feature of}} the littoral Santa Fe Province (along with the willows growing by the rivers).|$|E
25|$|Among the {{winemaking}} decisions where a producer's style {{can come}} through is {{the decision of}} whether or not to destem the grapes prior to crushing and fermentation. The presence of stems provide channels for the juice to percolate through the mass of grape skins that will form the cap during fermentation. This cap needs to be managed well and kept in constant contact with the juice in order to extract the color and phenolic compounds that will affect the flavor and <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wine. While stems can help with this cap management, they also provide an additional source of tannins that may be extracted into the wine. The degree of tannin extraction desired will be up to the winemaker with some tannins adding to the mouthfeel and aging potential of the wine while too much can make the wine seem harsh, bitter and out of the balance. The length of maceration, whether or not the wine stays in contact with its skin throughout the entire fermentation period, as well as the temperature that the wine is kept at throughout that fermentation will have an influence on the extraction of the color, tannins and phenols. The temperature of fermentation will also affect the volatilizing of the compounds that contribute to the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wine.|$|E

50|$|According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, as a varietal, Uvalino {{tends to}} produce {{full-bodied}} wines with noticeable tannins and acidity levels with <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> sweet spices and red fruits.|$|R
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{fermentation}}, {{the wine}} may also have malolactic fermentation or FML. This second fermentation carried out by bacteria deacidifies the wine: it transforms the malic acid, which has two carboxyl groups, into lactic acid. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity of the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully preserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing <b>Aroma</b> <b>of</b> wine. During the fermentation of the grapes varietal aromas are reduced in favour {{of an increase in}} roundness and volume in the mouth of the wine during ageing in oak barrels. It gives a better biological stability in champagne wines.|$|E
25|$|When the casks used to age Pedro Ximenez Sherry are retired, {{they are}} often sent to Scotland and Ireland, where {{they are used to}} age fine whisky. Single malt whisky aged in sherry casks is {{regarded}} by some as a special category with its own aficionados. The sweet Pedro Ximenez wine infused in the wood of the casks imparts some of the flavor and <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wine to the whisky during the ageing process. In the whisky industry the taste of the Pedro Ximenez is very sweet. Most of the whiskies are just finished after maturation in other casks. The Pedro Ximenez sweetness is often combined with a smoky peat flavor.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{silicone}} rubber dildos became more popular, {{a trend that}} has continued as the prices have lowered. These are easier to clean {{and do not have}} the characteristic plastic <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> PVC. They were expensive when introduced but are now reasonably priced, making them an excellent choice for the first-time user. Silicone holds body heat well, and is an excellent conductor of vibrations, allowing users to hold a vibrator at one end. Silicone is also a robust material (especially when compared to the cheap, unsafe jelly rubber that many dildos are made of) that can be sterilized by boiling or bleaching (using a bleach solution, diluted: 10% bleach 90% water).|$|E

40|$|Coffee aroma, {{with more}} than 600 components, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most complex food aromas. Although electronic noses have been successfully used for objective analysis and differentiation <b>of</b> total coffee <b>aromas,</b> it is difficult to use them to describe the specific features <b>of</b> coffee <b>aroma</b> (i. e., the type of smell). This is because data obtained by electronic noses are generally based on electrical resistance/current and samples are distinguished by principal component analysis. In this paper, we present an electronic nose that is capable of learning the wine related aromas using the aroma kit “Le Nez du Vin,” and the potential to describe coffee aroma in a similar manner comparable to how wine experts describe wine <b>aroma.</b> The results <b>of</b> our investigation showed that the <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> three drip coffees were more similar to those of pine and honey in the aroma kit than to the <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> three canned coffees. Conversely, the <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> canned coffees were more similar to the kit coffee aroma. In addition, the aromatic patterns of coffees were different from those of green tea and red wine. Although further study is required to fit the data to human olfaction, the presented method and the use <b>of</b> vocabularies in <b>aroma</b> kits promise to enhance objective discrimination and description <b>of</b> <b>aromas</b> by electronic noses...|$|R
