5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write <b>about</b> <b>politics,</b> however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E
5|$|Fluent in Pashto, English, and Urdu, Yousafzai {{was educated}} mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, {{who is a}} poet, school owner, and an {{educational}} activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School. She once stated to an interviewer that {{she would like to}} become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> after her two brothers had been sent to bed.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916, Minton {{returned}} to New Albany, where {{he opened a}} law practice and renewed his relationship with Gurtz. He took several cases and gained experience working pro bono to assist the local county prosecutor. He joined the Chautauqua lecture circuit, and traveled to several cities to give speeches. During one lecture circuit, he met William Jennings Bryan. The three-time Presidential candidate advised the young Hoosier <b>about</b> <b>politics,</b> inspiring him to consider a career in public life.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} ambassador {{reported that}} {{in the presence of}} guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat <b>about</b> <b>politics,</b> or fondle her breasts. Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king {{to spend more time with}} Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.|$|E
5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E

Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

25|$|The Indonesian socialist {{literary}} critic Bakri Siregar wrote that Van der Wijck was Hamka's best work, noting with interest {{the way in}} which Zainuddin writes <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> after losing Hayati.

Reportedly, Murgescu's 1982 work on the Japanese economic miracle was a Romanian best-seller. Allegedly, Murgescu had come to believe that the Valev Plan was a consistent form of economic integration, and that national communism was essentially flawed.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged by Jessie, the Morse family held {{relatively}} formal nightly {{discussions about}} crops, animals, education, religion, and most frequently <b>about</b> <b>politics.</b> Like {{many of their}} neighbors, the family was Progressive and discussed ideas championed by Robert M. La Follette, Sr., {{a leader of the}} Progressive movement who served as Wisconsin's governor from 1900 to 1906 and thereafter {{as a member of the}} U.S. Senate. During these family discussions, Morse developed debating skills and strong opinions about political corruption, corporate domination, labor rights, women's suffrage, education, and, on a personal level, hard work and sobriety.|$|E
25|$|Daood Gilani {{was raised}} in a {{political}} environment steeped in Pakistani nationalism and Islamic conservatism, both of which were amplified by Pakistani tensions with India. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, stray bombs hit Gilani's elementary school in Karachi and killed two people; this event, along with Pakistan's defeat at the war's conclusion, is thought to have stoked Gilani's animus towards India. Gilani went on to attend the elite Cadet College Hasan Abdal, a boys' military prep school. Gilani remained in contact with classmates, and later engaged in impassioned debates with them <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> and Islam in e-mail correspondence.|$|E
