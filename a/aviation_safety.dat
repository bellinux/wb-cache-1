5|$|In {{response}} to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz's involvement, aviation authorities in some countries implemented new regulations that require the presence of two authorized personnel in the cockpit at all times. Three days after the incident, the European <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Agency issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure {{that at least two}} crew members—including at least one pilot—were in the cockpit during the entire duration of the flight. Several airlines announced that they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.|$|E

5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{concluded that}} the crash was attributable primarily to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} during the aircraft's final flight. The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments as a case study in teaching crew resource management.

5|$|According to the <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Network, Ethiopian Airlines records {{there have}} been 60 {{accidents}} and incidents since 1965, plus six more for Ethiopian Air Lines, the airline's former name. , these occurrences resulted in 337 deaths. One hijacking is the carrier's deadliest accident, when the plane plunged into the Indian Ocean due to fuel starvation in 1996. The second-deadliest accident occurred in 2010, when an aircraft crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, shortly after it departed Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport, killing all 90 people on board. The crash of a Boeing 737-200 in 1988 led to 35 fatalities and ranks as the third most deadly accident experienced by the company. Despite this, Ethiopian Airlines has a good safety record, in contrast to other African airlines.|$|E
5|$|Flying Blind, Flying Safe is a non-fiction {{book about}} the American airline {{industry}} and Federal Aviation Administration, written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand. The book {{was first published in}} March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books. An updated paperback edition was published on April 1, 1998. Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times. Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for six years, and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades. She became a whistleblower and was highly critical of the airline industry and its relationship with <b>aviation</b> <b>safety</b> agencies in the United States federal government.|$|E

5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model {{to emerge from the}} program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E
5|$|The Accident Investigation Board Norway was {{informed}} about the accident at 21:10. Four members of the investigation commission were appointed, consisting of leader Lieutenant General Wilhelm Mohr, Pilot Hallvard Vikholt, Lieutenant Colonel Asbjørn Stein and Chief-of-Police Arnstein Øverkil. Because of poor weather conditions, the commission was not assembled in Brønnøy until 15:00 on 7 May. The same day the National Criminal Investigation Service arrived to assist AIBN. Six people appointed by the Canadian <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board, including representatives from de Havilland Canada and Pratt & Whitney Canada, were sent to aid the investigation. Four representatives from Widerøe were available for consultation with the commission. The investigation commission was later supplemented by Psychologist Grethe Myhre and Øverkil replaced by Arne Huuse.|$|E
5|$|The French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> (BEA) {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the crash; it was joined by its German counterpart, the Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU), and was assisted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hours after the crash, the BEA sent seven investigators to the crash site; these were accompanied by representatives from Airbus and CFM International. The cockpit voice recorder, which was damaged but still usable, was recovered by rescue workers and was examined by the investigation team. The following week, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin announced that the flight data recorder, which was blackened by fire but still usable, had also been found. Investigators isolated 150 sets of DNA, which were compared with the DNA of the victims' families.|$|E

5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E
5|$|Created in February 1972, Biman enjoyed an {{internal}} monopoly in the aviation industry of Bangladesh until 1996. In the decades following its founding, the airline expanded its fleet and destinations {{but it was}} adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement. At its peak, Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations, extending from New York City {{in the west to}} Tokyo in the east. The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007, when it was transformed into the country's largest public limited company by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh. Since becoming a public limited company in 2007, the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernise its fleet. The airline has made a deal with Boeing for ten new aircraft along with options for ten more. Biman Bangladesh Airlines is certified as safe to fly in Europe by the European <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Agency and it also successfully passed the IATA Operational Safety Audit and since then, the airline has resumed flights to some of its previous destinations in Asia and Europe.|$|E
5|$|GA is {{regulated}} by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the European <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Agency (EASA). The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing, and {{the objective is to}} promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and gliding is in transition from a self-regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome-related environmental issues which, particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA.|$|E

5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK {{is defined}} by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the government can act in isolation.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 2006, Biman {{operated}} {{flights to}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels. New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses {{to maintain a}} landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community {{in the north of}} England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International <b>Aviation</b> <b>Safety</b> Assessment Program, which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing remarks about the CAAB in an opinion article in the Aviatour, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday. For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.|$|E
