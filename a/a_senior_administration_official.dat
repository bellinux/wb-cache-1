2500|$|The 2007 NIE report, contradicted the {{previous}} 2005 NIE conclusion which asserted that Iran had {{an active and}} on-going nuclear weapons program in 2005. According to <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official,</b> in a January 2008 conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Israeli and other foreign officials asked President Bush to explain the 2007 NIE. Bush [...] "told the Israelis that he can't control what the intelligence community says, but that (the NIE's) conclusions don't reflect his own views". After Bush seemed {{to distance himself from}} the report, the White House later said Bush endorses the [...] "full scope" [...] of the US intelligence findings on Iran.|$|E
2500|$|On October 20, 2010, the US State Department {{notified}} Congress of {{its intention}} to make the biggest arms sale in American history—an estimated $60.5 billion purchase by Saudi Arabia, trumping the former US-Saudi AWACS sale. The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed forces. Israel did not raise objections to the sale, {{except to say that}} it was [...] "not thrilled about it." [...] At the time, <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> stressed: [...] "This is a big development, because it's part of a larger regional strategy and the maintenance of a strong US presence in the region. We're paying attention to the needs of our allies and what everyone in the region believes is a flexing of muscles by a more aggressive Iran. One way to deal with that is to make our allies and friends strong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} the Israelis and the Palestinians were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. <b>A</b> <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> said: [...] "That is the price we pay. Our first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J.

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of bin Laden, former U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism Juan Zarate said that al-Zawahiri would [...] "clearly assume the mantle of leadership" [...] of al-Qaeda. But <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> U.S. <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> said that {{although}} al-Zawahiri {{was likely to be}} al-Qaeda's next leader, his authority was not [...] "universally accepted" [...] among al-Qaeda's followers, particularly in the Gulf region. Zarate said that al-Zawahiri was more controversial and less charismatic than bin Laden. Rashad Mohammad Ismail (AKA [...] "Abu Al-Fida"), a leading member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, stated that al-Zawahiri was the best candidate.|$|R
2500|$|On July 3, 2009, he {{reportedly}} traveled to Pakistan and {{is believed to}} have visited Peshawar, often a gateway for foreign visitors to join up with jihadist groups in the militant-occupied Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and stayed there from July 7 to July 22. Peshawar's legacy for blackmarket terror goes back to the Soviet–Afghan War when it was a center for the Mujahideen parties and their US & Gulf patrons. The Center for Strategic and International Studies describes the FATA as: [...] "ground zero in the U.S. Jihadist war, and home to many al-Qaeda operatives, especially the numerous foreigners from the Arab world, Central Asia Muslim areas of the Far East, and even Europe who flock to this war zone for training [...] indoctrination." [...] <b>A</b> <b>senior</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>official</b> said it appears he had an attack in mind when he went there, and he went there seeking help for the attack.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official,</b> I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E

25|$|On December 9, 2016, Obama {{ordered the}} U.S. Intelligence Community to {{investigate}} Russian {{interference in the}} election and report before he left office on January 20, 2017. U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study, and said foreign intrusion into a U.S. election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations. The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. CNN reported that <b>an</b> unnamed <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> {{told them that the}} White House was confident Russia interfered in the election. The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report, with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{allegations}} {{emerged that}} Shakir, as a senior-ranking al-Qaeda member, was {{an officer in}} Saddam Hussein’s private militia. Iraqi military documents named Lt. Col. Hikmat Shakir Ahmad {{as a member of}} Fedayeen Saddam. The Weekly Standard published an article which speculated that the al-Qaeda member was a member of Saddam Hussein’s militia. However, a 2004 article in the Washington Post quoted <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> Bush <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> who believed that names indicated two different individuals. The 9/11 Commission Report claimed that despite the confusion over Shakir’s identity, the al-Qaeda member was still in police custody in Qatar when the Iraqi Fedayeen colonel with a similar name was in Iraq.|$|R

5000|$|... 16 July:- At least 10 {{people were}} killed and 20 others were {{reportedly}} injured in a bomb explosion at a weekly market, which was selling second-hand cars within Pakistan's tribal region of Khyber, in north-western Pakistan. It was later reported that this bomb blast occurred inside a bazaar in the town of Kuki Khel within Tirah, which is in a region of the country near to the Afghan-Pakistan border. This bomb was also apparently a timed device and was planted inside a ditch near to the busy used car market, <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> local <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> later confirmed. It is also known that Pakistani security forces have conducted a number of operations against Taliban militants within this area of the Khyber region and that the town itself is on the NATO supply route into Afghanistan. There have reportedly been numerous attacks, which have been perpetuated by Taliban militants in the past, upon these NATO convoys within this particular tribal region of the country.|$|R
2500|$|Perp walks resumed, {{with many}} {{corporate}} executives {{charged in the}} scandals of the early 2000s, such as Andrew Fastow and John Rigas, subjected to them. In 2003, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq Joseph C. Wilson evoked the perp walk, and provided another term for it, when accusing <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> Bush <b>Administration</b> <b>official</b> of leaking {{the name of his}} wife, Valerie a spy, to the media as retaliation for a New York Times op-ed in which he had cast doubt on key aspects of the administration's claims in support of the Iraq War: [...] "It's of keen interest to me {{to see whether or not}} we can get Karl Rove [...] out of the White House in handcuffs." [...] Liberal critics of the administration created images of that occurring; in 2008 a Code Pink protester in San Francisco attempted to make a citizen's arrest of Rove, who had by then left the government. [...] It was found that Karl Rove was not involved in the release of her name.|$|R
40|$|More {{than fifteen}} {{years after its}} {{ratification}} of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and nearly a decade after its signing of the Kyoto Protocol, the American federal government has maintained its posture of disengagement on climate change policy. Congress rejected a series of legislative proposals in 2005 that would have established modest targets for containing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions from major sources. Even Congressional passage {{of one of these}} bills would likely have been blocked by a Presidential veto. At about the same time, President George W. Bush rejected strong overtures from his closest foreign ally, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, to take some new greenhouse gas initiatives as the G- 8 group of developed nations gave new attention to climate change. American federal intransigence on this issue was further illustrated when it was revealed in June 2005 that <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> Bush <b>Administration</b> <b>official</b> had quietly downplayed the severity of climate change through substantial modification of a major federal government report on the topic, only to resign shortly thereafter and assume <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> position with <b>a</b> major oil company known for its hostility to any early action to reduce greenhouse gases...|$|R

5000|$|The U-2s of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing {{were used}} in Operation Cedar Sweep to fly {{surveillance}} over Lebanon, relaying information about Hezbollah militants to Lebanese authorities, and in Operation Highland Warrior to fly surveillance over Turkey and northern Iraq to relay information to Turkish authorities. These flights were the topic of acrimonious diplomatic cables between British officials and the American embassy, later leaked by Wikileaks, with David Miliband saying that [...] "policymakers needed {{to get control of}} the military". The British were concerned that the flights over Lebanon were authorised by the Lebanese Ministry of Defence rather than the entire cabinet, and that the intelligence so gained could lead to the UK being complicit in the unlawful torture of detainees. After warnings that these issues [...] "could jeopardize future use of British territory", John Rood, <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> Bush <b>administration</b> <b>official,</b> and Mariot Leslie, the Foreign Office's director general for defence and intelligence, became involved. Leslie said that the U.S. was not actually expected to check on detained terrorists, but that future spy missions would require full written applications.Akrotiri is also the winter training grounds of the RAF display team, the Red Arrows.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2010, <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> Obama <b>administration</b> <b>official,</b> who {{declined}} to be named, referred to the shooting as [...] "an act of terrorism", however other <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> have not referred to the shootings as a terrorist event. Several people, including Senator Joe Lieberman and General Barry McCaffrey, have called the event a terrorist attack. The United States Department of Defense and federal law enforcement agencies had classified the shootings as an act of workplace violence. This was changed by the Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act which broadened the criteria for awarding the Purple Heart to include [...] "an attack by a foreign terrorist organization….if the attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization." [...] This allowed the Army to award the Purple Heart, and its civilian equivalent, The Defense of Freedom Medal, to victims of the attack.The U.S. government declined requests from survivors and family members of the slain to categorize the Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism, or motivated by militant Islamic religious convictions. In November 2011, a group of survivors and family members filed a lawsuit against the government for negligence in preventing the attack, and to force the government to classify the shootings as terrorism. The Pentagon argued that charging Hasan with terrorism was not possible within the military justice system and that such action could harm the military prosecutors' ability to sustain a guilty verdict against Hasan.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> have {{on political}} decisions at the municipal level in Denmark {{is the focus}} for this paper. The study is based on research on how three different dimensions - paradigms, the effects of governmental regulations {{and the relationship between}} <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> and politicians – affect the role and job of the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official.</b> The project concludes that three paradigms, Traditional Bureaucracy, New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Governance (NPG) is present and affects the municipal level but that the emergence of NPM and later NPG has increased the “zone” in which <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> and politicians both act. This has resulted in a bigger influence on the political level for the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official.</b> Furthermore, it’s concluded that the governmental regulations have more of an effect on the politicians than the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official; however, if any effect it’s to the benefit of the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> in the dialog with the politician. Lastly, it’s concluded that the politician appears more dependent on the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> than the reverse. In addition, any possibility of influence the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> may have on political decisions is mostly related {{to the way in which}} the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> recommends the decisions, and therefore, as an indirect power. Despite this fact, the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> seemingly attempts to recommend decisions in a way they believe corresponds to the wishes of the politicians. There are also indications, in some cases, that the official’s personal beliefs do play a role when recommending decisions. This indicates that the official do have significant influence on political decisions...|$|R
