5|$|Weaning: When young rats are weaning <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> solid {{foods for}} the first time, they use adult rats as guides. They forage where the adults are {{foraging}} or where adults have previously scent-marked.|$|E

5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: {{involuntary}} dance-like movements. In neuroacanthocytosis, this is particularly prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech <b>and</b> <b>eating.</b> These movements are usually abrupt and irregular and present during both rest and sleep.|$|E
5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting <b>and</b> <b>eating,</b> sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant {{leaves and}} spend {{practically}} {{all of their}} time searching for <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> with their fingers off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present telling stories and singing amongst themselves. Brass bands were sometimes hired.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{has also}} worked with Rethink Breast Cancer, a program that educates young women on {{nutrition}} and body image {{in order to promote}} healthy living. She has cited her own body image issues <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorder as her reason for getting involved with the organization.|$|E

30|$|After the intervention, {{intuitive}} <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> mindful <b>eating</b> {{scores were}} significantly higher than before the intervention, while emotional <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>eating</b> scores were lower. The results remained stable during the follow-up period, with minor fluctuations and small trends towards returning to baseline values for binge <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>eating.</b> Mindful eating partially mediated the improvements in all outcomes.|$|R

5|$|That night, Leslie and Tom don {{black and}} watch the pit from a van. Leslie {{eventually}} spots Ann and Mark leaving for their date, and starts snapping photos of them. Later, Leslie and Tom see Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt) in the pit. They assume he is the kingpin, but he insists he is actually living in the pit <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> the vegetables from the garden.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} diurnal, {{although it may}} call into the night, like some {{other members of the}} Artamidae. Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl. Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> house sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting. The Australian raven may take nestlings left unattended.|$|E
5|$|Treatment with nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once {{the acute}} attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes {{and in those}} with frequent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> a diet high in low fat dairy products may be preventive.|$|E

5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E

5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything with his left hand, including brushing his teeth <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E
5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> their faeces.|$|E
50|$|Insectivorous bats may {{occasionally}} catch {{an insect}} in mid-air with its mouth, <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> {{it in the}} air. However, more often than not, bats use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect. Then, the bat takes the insect back to its roost <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> it there.|$|R
