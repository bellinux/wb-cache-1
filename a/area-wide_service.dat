40|$|Observational studies {{comparing}} {{groups or}} populations to evaluate services or interventions usually require case-mix adjustment {{to account for}} imbalances between the groups being compared. Simulation studies have, however, shown that case-mix adjustment can make any bias worse. One reason this can happen is if the risk factors used in the adjustment {{are related to the}} risk in different ways in the groups or populations being compared, and ignoring this commits the ‘‘constant risk fallacy’’. Case-mix adjustment is particularly prone to this problem when the adjustment uses factors that are proxies for the real risk factors. Interactions between risk factors and groups should always be examined before case-mix adjustment in observational studies. A ssessment of the effects of <b>area-wide</b> <b>service</b> or public health interventions, or the impact of technologies that are evolving over time, often involves non-randomised comparisons between populations in different places or measured at different times...|$|E
3000|$|To dissect {{the dynamic}} {{interaction}} {{of national and}} institution-specific settings, I have focused in this paper on Muslim chaplaincy in prisons in three German federal states (Länder). Balancing the normative requirements of both religious and public institutions (Sullivan, 2014), prison chaplaincies provide ‘a lens through which to explore critical questions relating to contemporary religion in public life’ (Gilliat-Ray, Ali, & Pattison, 2013). Germany constitutes a particularly interesting case for the research question at hand, since its Länder dispose of substantial autonomy in regulating religious diversity while sharing a similar constitutional framework. Allowing one to observe varying intra-national mechanisms while holding the institutional context constant, subnational comparison highlights the interplay between national legal frameworks, institutional settings, and subnational political dynamics. Examining the formalisation of Muslim prison chaplaincy in Lower Saxony, Berlin, and Hessen, I have focused on those subnational cases where this process appears most advanced to date. Formal establishment of Muslim chaplaincy in Germany seems particularly surprising, as, until recently, state actors argued that a formalised, <b>area-wide</b> <b>service</b> of Muslim care in prisons could not be provided given that Muslim communities had not yet fulfilled the mandatory legal requirements of the German state-church law. How then can we explain {{the emergence of an}} organised Muslim chaplaincy in the three aforementioned Länder? Moreover, how do national legal frameworks intersect with institutional practices and subnational configurations in the construction of Muslim chaplaincy? [...]...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} With development {{the technologies}} in the transportation systems, the distributed applications {{are more and}} more used. Because these systems needs to have Service Quality (SQ) expectations (delay, not comfortable transportation, etc.),a set of SQ oriented system aimed at aiding passengers to be more satisfied in their daily transport. Traditionally, SQ is measured by its inverse that is to say in terms of inconvenience, today it's became more and more important mainly in transportation system. If we look now at the DRT we found that it can have a middle SQ compared with other mode of transportation according to Raje et al (2003), when they defined the DRT as " services provide transport 'on demand' from passengers using fleets of vehicles scheduled to pick up and drop off people in accordance with their needs. DRT is an intermediate form of transport, somewhere between bus and taxi which covers a wide range of transport services ranging from less formal community transport through to <b>area-wide</b> <b>service</b> networks ".  Selecting the best routing with the best cost according to the application requirements and DRT contexts is a challenge if we want to provide enough SQ to the customer. For that we have the idea to make a new mathematical modeling for the Static DRTP totally based on SQ. Our modeling is different from those existing in literature in the way of integration of SQ as a penalty function in the objective function. If the customer reached late to his destination there is a penalty percentage will be added to the cost which must be minimized. So we have here a new variant of the SDRTP based on SQ with hard time windows called SDRTPSQHTW.  Second we are tried to solve this new variant of SDRTP with multi-vehicle in the case of One- to-One transportation type uses an exact method the Branch and Bound.  The Multi-Vehicle Demand Responsive Transport Problem Based on Service Quality in the case of One-to-One (MVSDRTPBSQHTW 1 -t- 1) under study presented this characteristic: each customer have his own origin and own destination. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find the best routing scheduled of all receipt requests with the respecting of hard Time Windows of each customer. The novelty of our paper is presented in the new manner of B&B algorithm application. However, we will trying to take the general architecture of Branch & Bound algorithm and using valuation rules in a different way which can adapted for such problem to find an optimal solution. The main idea is to applicants B&B in each vehicle such as we have a mono-vehicle problem but we are already testing all existing possible case to affect nodes to vehicles. It is very difficult to found an optimal solution to this problem since it is a NP hard mostly with using an exact methods,but finally, we are succeed to adapt B&B algorithm and found very interesting results. </p...|$|E

40|$|Metropolitan {{decision-making}} in flexible policy networks {{based on}} voluntary cooperation {{is present in}} most industrialised countries and a widely debated topic in governance research. The research focus primarily lies {{on the ability of}} metropolitan governance networks to organise <b>area-wide</b> public <b>service</b> provision efficiently and effectively – as opposed to hierarchical, bureaucratic policy-making. However, the inherent lack of input-orientated democratic legitimacy in governance institutions has only recently come to the forefront of research. In the present article, the democratic deficit of metropolitan governance is investigated with respect {{to the role of the}} municipal councillors and their inclusion in such institutions. The objects of study are local councillors in Swiss metropolitan areas, where regional cooperation is traditionally organised in functional associations that correspond to the flexible, informal logic of governance networks. The impact of metropolitan governance on the councillors’ political influence and on their behavioural patterns is assessed on the basis of large-scale survey data and comprehensive multilevel analyses accounting for the multilevel system of Swiss federalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergency}} medical services that are available, accessible, and used by the Northwest Indian Tribes of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington {{run the gamut from}} volunteer fire departments to paid county-wide paramedic services. The study was conducted in order to objectively describe the {{emergency medical}} services available to tribes of the Pacific Northwest and make recommendations regarding the training, funding, operation and governance of the emergency medical service programs and personnel. Narrative descriptions of the emergency medical service programs for each of the 34 Tribes are presented in a uniform format that discusses: description of {{emergency medical services}} used; problems or concerns documented; policy considerations; assessment of major components; and actions for improvement. Data collection, sampling, and data analysis procedures are not given. However, much of the information is related in narrative and table form. Based on fieldwork and information collected from all 34 federally-recognized Northwest Tribes, the study finds that emergency medical services are a major health need that, in many instances, is not being met. As many as twelve Northwest Reservations lack basic life support programs and {{there is a need to}} improve training and coordination of <b>services</b> <b>area-wide.</b> The following problems were noted Area-wide: 1) too few ambulance services available to ensure adequate coverage at all times; 2) county and local governments do not have the funding to pay for full-time ambulance personnel or procure equipment; 3) distance to in-patient facilities means the patient will often have to spend considerable time in transit; 4) emergency medical personnel receive few calls and are often unable to keep up their skills; and 5) there are shortages of medical personnel, including physicians. Consumer knowledge of emergency medical services on most Northwest Reservations is recognized as poor. Recommendations inlcude: 1) IHS should make funds available during fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to implement first response programs for the Hoh, Quileute, Muckleshoot, Chehalis, Umatilla, and Squaxin Island Tribes; 2) training of emergency medical service personnel must be a major priority of the Portland Area IHS over the next three years, with Community Health Representatives making up a major part of the needed manpower; 3) all Portland Area Service Units should have an appointed emergency medical service program officer to provide direct technical assistance to all Tribes in the unit; 4) tribal specific health plans regarding emergency medical services need to be updated, and emergency medical service planning must be a part of all future disaster planning efforts; 5) Congress should make funding available over the next three fiscal years for the development and improvement of emergency medical services...|$|R
