40|$|This paper proposes an {{emergency}} locking unit (ELU) for <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>retractor</b> which {{is mounted on}} the back frame of a vehicle seat. The proposed unit uses a recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor and solenoid mechanism. The seat has an upper frame supported to tilt on a lower frame. The retractor in belt in seat (BIS) system {{is supported by the}} upper frame. The proposed recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor comprises orientation means for maintaining a predetermined orientation of emergency relative to the lower frame independently of the force of gravity when the upper frame tilts on the lower frame. Experimental results show that the developed recliner sensor unit operates effectively with respect to rollover angles. Thus, the developed unit will have a considerable potential to offer a new design concept in BIS system...|$|E

40|$|<b>Seat</b> <b>belts</b> are <b>an</b> {{effective}} way of reducing the number or road deaths and severe road injuries in crashes. <b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminders warn car drivers and passengers if the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> is not fastened. This {{can be done by}} a visual signal or an acoustic signal or by a combination of the two. <b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminders {{are becoming more and more}} intelligent. Not only are they capable of ascertaining whether or not <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> is occupied, they now also take the driving speed and the distance travelled into account. The systems with a persistent and penetrating sound are most effective. On European level large safety gains could be achieved if all car occupants in all the Member States were to use <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> consistently. The EU has made it compulsory to install <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder for the driver seat of passenger cars.

50|$|<b>As</b> of 2016, <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws can {{be divided}} into two categories: primary and secondary. <b>A</b> primary <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law allows <b>an</b> officer to issue a {{citation}} for lack of seatbelt use without any other citation, whereas <b>a</b> secondary <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law allows <b>an</b> officer to issue <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> citation only {{in the presence of a}} different violation. In the United States, fifteen states enforce secondary laws, while 34 states, as well as the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, enforce primary <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain a more {{detailed}} understanding of the restraint usage rates, ‘appropriateness’ of restraint use, and the factors that influence appropriate restraint use for children in the booster seat age group. Six hundred and ninety nine parents from the States of New South Wales and Victoria completed a questionnaire regarding restraint use by their children aged 4 to 11 years. The findings revealed that only 24 percent of children aged between 4 and 11 years old were travelling in <b>a</b> booster <b>seat,</b> while the remaining 76 percent were travelling in <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> Children travelling in booster seats were significantly younger (5. 8 years vs. 8. 2 years), lighter in weight (21. 9 kg vs. 30. 3 kg) and shorter in height (115 cm vs. 131 cm) compared with children travelling in <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> Children travelling in <b>a</b> booster <b>seat</b> were also significantly more likely to be sitting in the front passenger position (for all vehicle types) (38 %) compared to children travelling in <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> (28 %). Appropriateness of restraint use was computed using height criteria of 100 - 140 cm for booster seats and greater than 140 cm for <b>seat</b> <b>belts.</b> Based on the height measurements provided by parents, children travelling in booster seats were found to be significantly more likely to be appropriately restrained (93 %) compared to children travelling in <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> (25 %). The likelihood of being appropriately restrained in <b>a</b> booster <b>seat</b> was greater for female children compared with males and greater amongst those who had a sibling in <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> compared with those who did not. Appropriate booster use was also influenced by parents’ knowledge about size thresholds for transition to <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> and there was a greater likelihood of appropriate use of boosters with increasing age and weight of the child. Amongst those children using <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt,</b> the mean age for their transition into <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> was 5. 6 years. The most important reason cited by parents for moving a child into <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> was that the child was too big for their forward facing child restraint/booster seat (69 %). Children who were appropriately restrained in <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> were more likely to be in a smaller vehicle than a larger vehicle and not have another sibling in <b>a</b> booster <b>seat</b> compared to those who did have a sibling in <b>a</b> booster <b>seat.</b> Additionally, the likelihood of appropriate <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use increased with greater weekly distance travelled and increased age and weight of the child. The findings highlighted the need to improve legislation on child restraint usage and to promote awareness amongst both parents and children of safety benefits associated with appropriate restraint use and seating position...|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to the Congressional action, NHTSA once again amended FMVSS 208, requiring vehicles to come with <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder system that gives an audible signal for 4 to 8 seconds and a warning light for at least 60 seconds after the ignition is turned on if the driver's <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> is not fastened. This is called <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder (SBR) system. In the mid-1990s, an insurance company from Sweden called Folksam worked with Saab and Ford to determine the requirements for the most efficient <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{persons who}} {{report that they}} never wear <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> while driving or as a {{passenger}} with those who do in a nationally representative sample in the United States. Our guiding hypothesis is that failure to wear <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> {{is part of an}} antisocial behavior spectrum. Methods: Using public-use data from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, this study employed binary logistic regression with adjustments for complex survey sampling to assess relationships between never wearing <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> and sociodemographic variables, antisocial behaviors, substance abuse and co-occurring problems, and criminal justice system contact. Results: Individuals who do not wear <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> are younger, more likely to be male, less likely to be African American or Hispanic, have incomes of less than $ 75, 000, and be a high school or college graduate. After controlling for the effects of age, gender, race, income, education, and population density, individuals reporting that they never wear <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> while driving or as a passenger are more likely to report using alcohol and drugs (adjusted odds, 1. 61 e 2. 56), committing antisocial behaviors including felony offenses (adjusted odds, 2. 13 e 3. 57), and possess a dual diagnosis (adjusted odds, 1. 62 e 1. 73). Conclusions: Findings indicate that non-seat belt use is convergent with a spectrum of serious antisocial behavior and comorbid psychological distress. Importantly, results suggest that standard <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use policies and campaigns may not be effective for non-seat belt using individuals and a targeted approach may be needed.
