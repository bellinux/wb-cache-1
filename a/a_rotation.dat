5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E
5|$|In a {{panoramic}} camera, the focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> of 180° of the lens itself. This model {{was the basis for}} the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured {{a panoramic}} view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} double rotations, which are {{combinations}} of {{left and right}} <b>rotations.</b> <b>A</b> double left <b>rotation</b> at X can be defined to be <b>a</b> right <b>rotation</b> at the right child of X followed by <b>a</b> left <b>rotation</b> at X; similarly, <b>a</b> double right <b>rotation</b> at X can be defined to be <b>a</b> left <b>rotation</b> at the left child of X followed by <b>a</b> right <b>rotation</b> at X.|$|R
50|$|In {{either the}} {{narrower}} or the wider senses, {{the composition of}} two improper <b>rotations</b> is <b>a</b> proper <b>rotation,</b> and the composition of an improper and <b>a</b> proper <b>rotation</b> is <b>an</b> improper <b>rotation.</b>|$|R

5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> is performed by multiplying position vectors by <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|An Army report {{released}} in 2001 blamed {{the breakdown of}} the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.|$|E
5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E

5|$|During the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, {{except in}} the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which {{resulted}} in a reshuffle in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although his average of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he batted in a variety of positions, as did all of the squad, because Bradman used <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> system to rest his team because many matches were played consecutively.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 2004, the ACC {{announced}} its new football structure with two divisions.

5|$|The {{investigators}} also {{requested that}} Fokker conduct {{a study of}} the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated the data from the tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of the proper rotation speed of 124 knots. The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> speed of 113 knots but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots. It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard.|$|E
5|$|As {{the matches}} were often played {{consecutively}} without a day between fixtures, Australia employed <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> policy, {{and as a}} result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures {{in which more than}} half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters, both on damp pitches before the First Test. Against Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after Sam Loxton succumbed to injury. In a later match against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} tour, but recovered to win by eight wickets.|$|E

50|$|In {{physics and}} mathematics, a pseudotensor {{is usually a}} {{quantity}} that transforms like a tensor under an orientation-preserving coordinate transformation (e.g., <b>a</b> proper <b>rotation),</b> but additionally changes sign under an orientation reversing coordinate transformation (e.g., <b>an</b> improper <b>rotation,</b> which is <b>a</b> transformation that can be expressed as <b>a</b> proper <b>rotation</b> followed by reflection).

5|$|Mathilde's orbit is eccentric, {{taking it}} to the outer reaches of the main belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does not cross the {{planetary}} orbits. It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroidsmost asteroids have <b>a</b> <b>rotation</b> period in the range of 224 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to photograph 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may be accounted for by a satellite orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none larger than 10km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of Mathilde.|$|E
5|$|Starting in January 1990, four WATCH instruments, {{designed}} by the Danish Space Research Institute, were in operation on the Granat observatory. The instruments could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180keV range to within 0.5° using <b>a</b> <b>Rotation</b> Modulation Collimator. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% FWHM at 60keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a time resolution of 1 second per 36 energy channels.|$|E
