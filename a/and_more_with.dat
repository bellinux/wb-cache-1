5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had {{less to do with}} the game itself <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|Surtsey, Iceland. The volcano built {{itself up}} from depth and emerged above the Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast}} of Iceland in 1963. Initial hydrovolcanics were highly explosive, but as the volcano grew out rising lava started to {{interact}} less with the water <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> the air, until finally Surtseyan activity waned and became more Strombolian in character.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E

5|$|This revival did {{not last}} long. Following the death of Charles of Anjou in 1285 {{and the end of}} the threat of an {{invasion}} from Italy, Michael's successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328) assumed that, by relying on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he could do without the maintenance of a fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was less concerned with the West <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships broken up or left to rot. The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation, while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the 1296–1302 war.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was fielded at the Boston College 13-yard line by the Eagles' Harris, who {{returned}} it to the Boston College 28-yard line, and the Eagles' offense began its second drive of the game. Eagles quarterback Dominique Davis completed his first pass of the game, a 19-yard catch by Brandon Robinson, who advanced {{the ball to the}} Boston College 47-yard line for a first down. Davis then scrambled for a four-yard gain, and Harris ran for nine yards on the next two plays, gaining the Eagles' second first down of the game. Once inside the Virginia Tech 40-yard line, however, the Hokies' defense stiffened. Davis was able to gain six yards on two running plays, but after an incomplete pass, the Eagles were forced to punt {{for the second time in}} the first quarter. The kick sailed into the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense began work at its 20-yard line. The Hokies' third drive of the quarter mirrored its first, however, as Virginia Tech went three and out and punted after failing to gain a first down. The Eagles recovered the ball with 1:32 remaining in the quarter and committed a five-yard false start penalty to begin their possession. On the first play after the penalty, Davis was sacked for a loss of two yards. Harris regained the lost yardage <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> a six-yard run, but after Davis threw an incomplete pass on third down, the Eagles were forced to punt again. Before they could kick the ball, however, the quarter came to an end. With three quarters remaining in the game, Virginia Tech held a 7–0 lead.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northern}} part of Puebla state, most notably in the municipalities of Aquixtla and Chignahuapan, Nahuatl-speaking indigenous peoples produce cooking utensils such as comals, pitchers, pots <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> a glazed finish. They use a Moorish kiln, which conserves fuel and heat. The distinguishing feature of this pottery is that it has stamped designs, usually flowers. These stamps are cut clay tablets, which are impressed onto the pottery pieces.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, his employer, Charles H. Kerr, {{who came into}} the socialist {{movement}} {{about the same time as}} Simons, was on an altogether different ideological trajectory. Kerr took less solace from the advances of the Socialist Party in the electoral realm, particularly among middle class intellectuals such as himself, and instead came to identify more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> the revolutionary industrial unionism of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), established in 1905.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the elements above, another important feature of SBML is that every entity can have machine-readable annotations attached to it. These annotations {{can be used to}} express relationships between the entities in a given model and entities in external resources such as databases. A good example of the value of this is in BioModels Database, where every model is annotated and linked to relevant data resources such as publications, databases of compounds and pathways, controlled vocabularies, <b>and</b> <b>more.</b> <b>With</b> annotations, a model becomes more than simply a rendition of a mathematical construct—it becomes a semantically-enriched framework for communicating knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he would}} {{continue}} to write short poems and prose works, notably the 1963 Bottom: On Shakespeare, the completion of A was to be the major concern of the remainder of Zukofsky's writing life. As the poem progressed, formal considerations tended to be foregrounded more <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>with</b> Zukofsky applying a wide range of devices and approaches, from the sonnet to aleatory or random composition. The final complete edition was going to press as the poet lay on his deathbed in 1978. His final written work was the index to this volume.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} {{tradition is}} Day of the Dead, celebrated throughout the borough but San Andrés Mixquic’s is particularly well known, attracting {{thousands of visitors}} from Mexico and abroad. The celebration generally lasts three days from October 31 to November 1 each day focusing on different groups, children, adults and saints. One local tradition related to the day is to hang a paper lantern often {{in the form of}} a star at the entrance to home as a way to greet the return of the souls of the dead. The Fiestas del Santo Jubileo is a custom observed on different days in the communities of the borough. It consists of a mass and exhibition of the Host on the main altar of the church for 40 hours, surrounded by flowers, sawdust carpets, live music, dances and fireworks. Carnival is important in San Francisco Tlaltenco and Santiago Zapotitlán, where dancers generally are chinelos and those in charro suits. These carnivals begin on the fourth Sunday of Lent. The tradition in San Francisco Tlaltenco goes back to the end of the 19th century. A reenactment of Palm Sunday has been held each year at San Pedro Tláhuac for over eighty years, with the procession winding its way through eight different neighborhoods. San Pedro Tláhuac is also the site of the Regional Fair of Tláhuac. It was first organized in 1956, with the goal so attracting tourism and encouraging youth to maintain traditions. It begins with a procession of the image of the patron saint, the Apostle Peter, in decorated trajinera boats in the chinampa areas of Lago de los Reyes Aztecas. Other events include the selection of a fair queen, conferences, cultural events, concerts, dances, fireworks <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>with</b> proceeds going to the restoration of the San Pedro Apostal Church.|$|E
500|$|The Justice Friends {{consists}} of Major Glory (voiced by Rob Paulsen), Valhallen (voiced by Tom Kenny), and the Infraggable Krunk (voiced by Frank Welker), three superheroes {{who are all}} roommates living in an apartment complex called Muscular Arms. Most of the trio's adventures deal less with their lives as superheroes <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> their inability to get along as roommates; it {{is presented as a}} sitcom, including a laugh track. Genndy Tartakovsky's inspiration for The Justice Friends came from reading Marvel Comics when he was learning how to speak English. Tartakovsky stated in an interview with IGN that he was somewhat disappointed with how The Justice Friends turned out, saying, [...] "it could have been funnier and the characters could have been fleshed out more." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} also {{received}} positive reviews, particularly the episodes following the winter finale when Quantico {{switched to a}} single timeline and began focusing on character development. Kelsey McKinney of New York magazine noted that the show had finally found its groove, writing [...] "For {{the first time since}} its first season, Quantico actually seems to know where it is headed. It’s quite a welcome development, and the newfound confidence ... makes Quantico a much more enjoyable show to watch." [...] In a five-star review of the sixteenth episode, Kelsey McKinney of New York wrote that [...] "the show is grappling more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> the emotions that make us all human, not just the ones that drive the story forward." [...] The series' plot lines, involving current political situations, were also praised.|$|E

500|$|The term brostep {{has been}} used by some as a slight pejorative {{descriptor}} for a style of popular Americanised dubstep. US and Canadian artists often drew inspiration from British brostep producers who tended to work less with sub-bass <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> mid-range sounds such as Caspa, Rusko, and Vex'd. Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that [...] "brostep is sort of my fault, but now I've started to hate it in a way... It's like someone screaming in your face... you don't want that." [...] According to a BBC review of his 2012 album Songs, the record was a muddled attempt by Rusko to realign his music with a [...] "Jamaican inheritance" [...] and distance it from the [...] "belching, aggressive, resolutely macho" [...] dubstep produced by his contemporaries.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} {{consists}} of five chapters {{and focuses on}} the rise, development, and fall of civilizations. Rifkin connects the qualitative changes in energy regimes and communication techniques with changes in how people understand and organize reality. Hunter-gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically-limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically {{in terms of that}} group. Spiritually, these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales. The development of writing, as well as hydraulics and irrigation, allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled. Hydraulic power was labour-intensive, requiring large populations of subservient people. With scripts, there was a shift from [...] a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness; individuals thought of themselves less in terms of a small, local group <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> a monotheistic religion which included a personal relationship with a god.|$|E

[...] Because of the impending WGA strike, Rosenberg worked full-time to finish the screenplay before October 31. In adapting the novel for the screen, she [...] "had to condense a great deal." [...] Some characters were left out, and others were combined.

500|$|The group {{worked on}} their sophomore record with {{producer}} Garth [...] "GGGarth" [...] Richardson. in Vancouver, BC. [...] Schwab wrote lyrics about {{a wider variety}} of issues, rather than just focusing on personal expression with their sophomore release: [...] "The new album deals a lot less with me, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> the world around us; Issues in people, society, culture". The sound was heavier and more progressive, with more hints of melody as well. [...] As soon as the album was finished it garnered interest from several major labels, and Atlantic records licensed the album for co-release with Tooth and Nail/BEC in March 2000. [...] Drawing Black Lines peaked at No.37 on Heatseekers, and was well received by critics. By this time, listeners in the band had begun to amass a sizable fanbase. Despite heavy reliance on tour dates and word of mouth to inform people of its release, the album experienced some commercial success when it eventually sold nearly 120,000 copies. The band added Cory Edelmann, previously of No Innocent Victim, after the album was finished. Project 86 traveled nationwide with P.O.D., Hed PE, and Linkin Park on the [...] "Kings of the Game" [...] tour in October 2000. They also played a string of shows with Queensrÿche.|$|E
