2500|$|Time Warner Cable {{was formed}} in 1992 by the merger of Time Inc.'s cable {{television}} company, American Television and Communications Corp. (service areas {{that had belonged to}} that company went under the Time Warner Communications name; since the 1990s, areas that had used that name have either been renamed to Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks, or have been given to other cable providers), and Warner Cable, a division of Warner Communications, {{as a result of a}} merger to form Time Warner; for the two years after the merger, the companies operated separately but under the umbrella name [...] "Time Warner Cable Group" [...] (primarily due to 18% of ATC having been publicly owned at the time); they merged into one entity in 1992. It also includes the remnants of the defunct QUBE interactive TV service. In 1995, the company launched the Southern Tier On-Line Community, <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> service later known as Road Runner High Speed Online. That year, talks began that would later result in Warner's acquisition of Paragon Cable. [...] Glenn Britt (1949–2014) was the CEO from 2001 until December 2013.|$|E

However, a route could conceivably pass through a single CMTS.|$|R

50|$|A DOCSIS {{architecture}} {{includes two}} primary components: <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> {{located at the}} customer premises, and <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> termination system located at the CATV headend. Cable systems supporting on-demand programming use a hybrid fiber-coaxial system.

5000|$|The {{original}} DOCSIS protocol supports {{only two}} way connectivity. <b>A</b> <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> that {{is unable to}} acquire an upstream channel will give up and resume scanning for new channels. Likewise, persistent upstream errors will cause <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> to [...] "reinitialize its MAC" [...] and scan for new downstream channels. This behavior is appropriate for traditional cable modems, but not for cable set-top boxes. A cable set-top box still needs to acquire its {{out of band data}} even if the upstream channel is impaired.|$|E
50|$|Broadband cable Internet access {{requires}} <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> at the customer's premises and <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> {{termination system}} (CMTS) at a cable operator facility, typically a cable television headend. The two are connected via coaxial cable or a Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC) plant. While access networks are {{sometimes referred to}} as last-mile technologies, cable Internet systems can typically operate where the distance between the modem and the termination system is up to 160 km. If the HFC network is large, the cable modem termination system can be grouped into hubs for efficient management.|$|E

40|$|The {{system of}} the present {{invention}} utilizes an interface unit and a controller located at <b>a</b> central <b>cable</b> station. The interface unit interfaces the controller with <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> connection, which connects the interface unit to <b>a</b> plurality of <b>cable</b> <b>modems</b> located at remote locations. The <b>cable</b> <b>modems</b> write transmission requests into slots that are defined by the controller as contention slots and that are communicated along a channel of the cable connection. The <b>cable</b> <b>modems</b> also write other data into slots that are defined by the controller as data slots and that are also communicated along the channel of the cable connection. The controller is configured to define certain ones of the slots communicated along the aforementioned channel as data slots and to allocate these data slots to particular ones of the <b>cable</b> <b>modems</b> in response to transmission requests received by the controller. The controller is preferably configured to define each slot not allocated to <b>a</b> particular <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> as <b>a</b> contention slot. Furthermore, the controller is also configured to preselect certain ones of the data slots as contention slots such that preselected ones of the data slots are automatically defined as contention slots.
