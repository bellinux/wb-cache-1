40|$|The {{chromosome}} complements of four {{males of}} Alouatta fusca clamitans, caught in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, {{were analyzed by}} G-, C-, and NOR-banding techniques. The diploid number found was 49 in all the specimens. The presence of a heteromorphic pair of submetacentric chromosomes in the analyzed specimens, not present in males and females with 2 n = 50 previously reported, and its G-banding pattern, led us to assume that this pair {{is involved in a}} Y-autosome translocation.

40|$|The family Ophichthidae {{comprises}} 52 genera {{and about}} 290 species of snake eels and worm eels. Among the nine species cytogenetically studied, the 2 n is comprised between 38 and 50; the karyotype structure is highly variable between an all acrocentric- and an all biarmed-chromosomes karyotype. Differentiated sex chromosomes, a ZZ/ZWand a multiple XXXX/XXXY system, {{have been described}} in two species. In this work, we deepened the karyotype characterization of O. serpens by replication banding that allowed to identify and characterize the chromosomal pairs; furthermore in this species it has been possible to obtain G-bands, hardly achievable in fishes. Heterochromatic C- and endonuclease-bandings allowed to localize and characterize the constitutive heterochromatin in all centromeres, in some paracentromeric regions and in the short <b>arm</b> of <b>pair</b> 19.

50|$|Megalocranchia fisheri is {{a species}} of glass squid. Its natural range covers at least the waters off Hawaii.

It inhabits surface and mid-depth waters of open ocean. Juveniles live near the surface, while adults occupy mesopelagic depths during the day and migrate to near-surface waters at night. M. fisheri possesses two large light organs in the gill cavity.

5000|$|Argonauta argo, {{also known}} as the greater argonaut, is a species of pelagic octopus {{belonging}} to the genus Argonauta. The female of the species, like all argonauts, creates a paper-thin eggcase that coils around the octopus much like the way a nautilus lives in its shell, hence the name paper nautilus. The Chinese name for this species translates as [...] "white sea-horse's nest". A. argo was the first argonaut species to be described and is consequently the type species of the genus. A. argo is the largest species in the genus and also produces the largest eggcase. Live animals have a characteristic blue sheen on the first <b>arm</b> <b>pair</b> and around the eyes. The eggcase is characterised by two rows of small, sharp tubercles running along a narrow keel, smooth ribs across the walls of the shell, and a thickening along the shell aperture, which forms distinct protrusions or 'horns' on either side. Argonauta cygnus Monterosato, 1889 was described based on a shell which lacked these protrusions, although it is now considered a junior synonym of A. argo. The greatest recorded size of an A. argo eggcase is 300.0 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The family Cranchiidae {{comprises}} the approximately 60 species of glass squid, {{also known as}} cockatoo squid, cranchiid, cranch squid, or bathyscaphoid squid. Cranchiid squid occur in surface and midwater depths of open oceans around the world. They range in mantle length from 10 cm to over 3 m, {{in the case of}} the colossal squid. The common name, glass squid, derives from the transparent nature of most species. Cranchiid squid spend much of their lives in partially sunlit shallow waters, where their transparency provides camouflage. They are characterised by a swollen body and short arms, which bear two rows of suckers or hooks. The third <b>arm</b> <b>pair</b> is often enlarged. Many species are bioluminescent organisms and possess light organs on the undersides of their eyes, used to cancel their shadows. Eye morphology varies widely, ranging from large and circular to telescopic and stalked. A large, fluid-filled chamber containing ammonia solution is used to aid buoyancy. This buoyancy system is unique to the family and is the source of their common name [...] "bathyscaphoid squid", after their resemblance to a bathyscaphe. Often the only organ that is visible through the transparent tissues is a cigar-shaped digestive gland, which is the cephalopod equivalent of a mammalian liver. This is usually held in a vertical position to reduce its silhouette and a light organ is sometimes present on the lower tip to further minimise its appearance in the water.|$|E

40|$|In a wild {{population}} of the American newt Notophthalmus viridescens 15 females {{out of a total}} of 94 were found to be heterozygous for a paracentric inversion which includes almost the whole of the longer arm of the smallest chromosome (XI). The inversion was recognized in preparations of lampbrush chromosomes because it transfers the sequential loops, which normally lie close to the telomere, to a position neighbouring the centromere. Because of inversion the transcriptional polarity of the sequential loops is reversed vis-a-vis the chromo-some as a whole. In normal bivalents XI (both in male and female meiosis) each <b>arm</b> <b>pair</b> generally forms a single chiasma close to the telomeres (proterminal localization). In bivalents XI heterozygous for the inversion no chiasmata are formed between the mutually inverted longer arm pairs, presumably because they fail to synapse, but chiasma frequency in the non-inverted shorter arm pairs is increased, and the normal restraint on chiasma distribution in this <b>arm</b> <b>pair</b> is lifted. An explanation is offered in terms of the availability of recombination nodules, and the time of their association with the synaptonemal complex...|$|E

40|$|Adhesion in {{cephalopods}} {{is either}} mechanical, involving a reduced-pressure {{system of the}} arm and tentacle suckers, or is chemically mediated by special adhesive gland structures (as proposed for Euprymna, Idiosepius, and Nautilus). Four species of Sepia (S. typica, S. papillata, S. pulchra, and S. tuberculata) possess grooved structures on the ventral mantle surface and on the fourth <b>arm</b> <b>pair,</b> which are used to attach mechanically to the substratum. Because these areas are often partly covered with sand or debris, it has been hypothesized that chemical substances were involved in this attachment process.

Two specific glandular cells (Type 1 and Type 2) {{are present in the}} epithelium, which differ clearly in their granule size and cellular structure.

Silver nitrate staining of NORs (Ag-NORs) and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with a rDNA probe were used to investigate the chromosomal location of rDNA loci in two species. The karyotype of H. semilineatus and the Ag-NORs distribution of the four species are presented herein for the first time. After conventional staining, the four species presented very similar karyotypes with 2 n = 24, but Ag-NORs analyses revealed species-specific characteristics. H. albomarginatus, H. faber and H. semilineatus had one pair of interstitial Ag-NORs in the short <b>arm</b> of <b>pairs</b> 2, 11, and in the long <b>arm</b> of <b>pair</b> 7, respectively.
