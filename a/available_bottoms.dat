40|$|Observational {{surveys have}} shown {{significant}} oceanic bottom water warming, {{but they are}} too spatially and temporally sporadic to quantify the deep ocean contribution to the present-day sea level rise (SLR). In this study, altimetry sea surface height (SSH), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) ocean mass, and in situ upper ocean (0 - 700 m) steric height have been assessed for their seasonal variability and trend maps. It is shown that neither the global mean nor the regional trends of altimetry SLR {{can be explained by}} the upper ocean steric height plus the GRACE ocean mass. A non-Boussinesq ocean general circulation model (OGCM), allowing the sea level to rise as a direct response to the heat added into the ocean, is then used to diagnose the deep ocean steric height. Constrained by sea surface temperature data and the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiation measurements, the model reproduces the observed upper ocean heat content well. Combining the modeled deep ocean steric height with observational upper ocean data gives the full depth steric height. Adding a GRACE-estimated mass trend, the data-model combination explains not only the altimetry global mean SLR but also its regional trends fairly well. The deep ocean warming is mostly prevalent in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, and along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, suggesting a strong relation to the oceanic circulation and dynamics. Its comparison with <b>available</b> <b>bottom</b> water measurements shows reasonably good agreement, indicating that deep ocean warming below 700 m might have contributed 1. 1 mm/yr to the global mean SLR or one-third of the altimeter-observed rate of 3. 11 +/- 0. 6 mm/yr over 1993 - 2008...|$|R

40|$|With a multi-proxy approach, {{an attempt}} was made to {{constrain}} productivity and bottom-water redox conditions and their effects on the phosphorus accumulation rate at the Mohammed Plage section on the Tarfaya coast, Morocco, during the Cenomanian-Turonian Anoxic Event (OAE 2). A distinct δ 13 C org isotope excursion of + 2. 5 ‰ occurs close {{to the top of the}} section. The unusually abrupt shift of the isotope excursion and disappearance of several planktonic foraminiferal species (e. g. Rotalipora cushmani and Rotalipora greenhornensis) in this level suggests a hiatus of between 40 – 60 kyrs at the excursion onset. Nevertheless, it was possible to determine both the long-term environmental history as well as the processes that took place immediately prior to and during OAE 2. TOC% values increase gradually from the base of the section to the top (from ~ 2. 5 % to ~ 10 %). This is interpreted as the consequence of a long-term eustatic sea-level rise and subsidence causing the encroachment of less oxic waters into the Tarfaya Basin. Similarly a reduction in the mineralogically constructed ‘detrital index’ can be explained by the decrease in the continental flux of terrigenous material due to a relative sea-level rise. A speciation of phosphorus in the upper part of the section, which spans the start and mid-stages of OAE 2, shows overall higher abundances of P reactive mass accumulation rates before the isotope excursion onset and lower values during the plateau. Due to the probable short hiatus, the onset of the decrease in phosphorus content relative to the isotope excursion is uncertain, although the excursion plateau already contains lower concentrations. The C org /P total and V/Al ratios suggest that this reduction was mostly likely caused by a decrease in the <b>available</b> <b>bottom</b> oxygen content (probably as a result of higher productivity) and a corresponding fall in the phosphorus retention ability of the sediment. Productivity appears to have remained high during the isotope plateau possibly due to a combination of ocean-surface fertilisation via increased aridity (increased K/Al and Ti/Al ratios) and/or higher dissolved inorganic phosphorus content in the water column as a result of the decrease in sediment P retention. The evidence for decreased P-burial has been observed in many other palaeoenvironments during OAE 2. Tarfaya's unique upwelling paleosituation provides strong evidence that the nutrient recycling was a global phenomenon and therefore a critical factor in starting and sustaining OAE 2...|$|R
40|$|Principles of Quality Improvement (QI) and Patient Safety (PS) {{are often}} {{taught in the}} classroom, an arena {{far removed from the}} {{patients}} and care systems they are meant to impact. Didactic learning fails to reinforce the idea that QI and PS involve skills, which need to be practiced, not simply definitions that can be memorized and applied. Many educators feel uncomfortable with their own knowledge base in PS/QI, and lack a framework for incorporating these concepts into their daily practice. We plan to present a set of QI Tools, such as the 5 -Whys, Root Cause Analysis, Fishbone diagrams, and Lean Principles, that the typical clinician educator can easily integrate into their daily teaching, whether at the bedside, in the ambulatory setting or in small groups.

40|$|Substrate {{composition}} plays {{a critical}} role in determining the spawning success of Atlantic sturgeon. A benthic analysis of the tidal freshwater portion of the James River, Virginia, was performed to locate and protect remaining sturgeon spawning habitat within the James River system. I modeled structural habitat, substrate distribution, and river bathymetry from Richmond, Virginia to the Appomattox River confluence. A classification model was developed to describe the dominant substrate type (mud/silt, sand, gravel, bedrock) using side scan sonar data collected from August 2011 -Febuary 2012. River depth, bottom imagery, substrate density (hardness), and ground truth substrate samples were interpolated into a GIS model to spatially describe and quantify essential sturgeon spawning habitat. Finally, I attempted a change analysis of historical substrate composition throughout the study area. Gravel, cobble, and bedrock, swept clean of silt or mud, was deemed a hard bottom substrate suitable for spawning success. Mud and silt dominated the vast majority of river substrate, representing approximately 67 % of river bottom surveyed. Sand comprised 17 % of river bottom, gravel represented 11 % and bedrock represented 5 %. Sixteen percent of the reach was hard bottom habitat consisting of a bed substrate dominated by gravel, cobble, or bedrock. Regions of hard bottom habitat found at depths ≥ 10 m were selected to model essential sturgeon spawning habitat. The river bottom within the reach contained approximately 8 % essential spawning habitat. The majority of hard bottom habitat was located in major bends of the river where scouring occurs. The historical comparison of <b>available</b> hard <b>bottom</b> habitat identified a 28 % loss of hard bottom since 1853. The greatest losses in hard bottom occurred in the upper portions of the study area (55 % loss in hard bottom habitat). Hard bottom habitat lost in the lower portion of the study area was partially offset by the creation of new hard bottom habitat within the narrow channel cuts bypassing Jones Neck and Turkey Island. Historical comparison of the Hatcher Island, Turkey Island, and Jones Neck oxbows identified heavy siltation and reduced depths likely due to anthropogenic alterations in the meander bends linked to shipping channel creation. The altered flow regime has resulted in increased sedimentation and has drastically reduced <b>available</b> hard <b>bottom</b> substrate within the natural channel of Jones Neck and Turkey Island. The increased availability of hard bottom habitat {{within the confines of the}} shipping channel has indicated that the alteration of the river bottom, through flow modification and dredging practices, may have replaced a portion of lost historical spawning habitat. Fisheries managers could use the data from the substrate analysis to better understand and protect essential areas necessary for Atlantic sturgeon spawning success...|$|R
