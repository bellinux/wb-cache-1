5|$|Following his feat, Daphnomeles was {{appointed}} strategos of the thema of Dyrrhachium by <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> emperor, and given all of Ibatzes's movable wealth as a reward. In 1029, however, {{he was accused}} of conspiring with other prominent governors of the Balkans to overthrow Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028–34) in favour of doux Constantine Diogenes. The accused were then recalled to Constantinople, beaten, paraded through the Mese, and banished. Nothing further is known of him.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the men}} {{helps the}} girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is gone {{drifting}} upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. From a bird's-eye view, we see {{the shape of the}} car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass.|$|E

5000|$|On September 13, 2015 the {{unveiling}} of the memorial plaque {{took place on the}} former exit of the Kaserne. The Mayor of Ludwigsburg and many former US Soldiers were attending the ceremonial. The memorial plaque has the following engraving: „In honor <b>an</b> <b>grateful</b> remembrance of the soldiers of the United States Army who served at Flakkaserne, Ludwigsburg, from 1950 to 1991.“ ...|$|R
5|$|Rejewski {{maintained}} a lively correspondence with his wartime French host, General Gustave Bertrand, {{and at the}} General's bidding he began translating Bertrand's Enigma into Polish. In 1976, {{at the request of}} the Józef Piłsudski Institute of America, Rejewski broke enciphered correspondence of Józef Piłsudski and his fellow Polish Socialist conspirators from 1904. On 12 August 1978 he received from <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> Polish people the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.|$|E
5|$|Drug use {{is often}} portrayed in {{conjunction}} with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries. Jimbo and Cartman both use the term hippie pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should just go to <b>a</b> <b>Grateful</b> Dead concert, to which Mackey says he can't since Jerry Garcia is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching Teletubbies while high on marijuana or in rehab. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> Pope was thus denied.|$|E

"Upon my word, if you'll {{stick to}} me, you know, {{and see me}} through it, {{and all that kind}} of thing, you'll find in me <b>a</b> most <b>grateful</b> friend; indeed, <b>a</b> most <b>grateful</b> friend." [...] And Archie, as from his {{position}} he was debarred from attempting the smoothing process, began to work with his right forefinger under the glove on his left hand.|$|R

5|$|Robert Carradine, David Carradine's younger half-brother, {{assisted}} {{with the camera}} work. Greg Walker, former Kung Fu stunt coordinator, served as stunt coordinator and played one of the town's ruffians. Fran Ryan, whom Carradine met while they both worked on The Long Riders (1980), played a colonel in a scene that was shot several years after {{the main body of}} footage. Claire Townsend, a United Artists (UA) executive who had helped finance the film, played a lieutenant. Rick Van Ness, who had scouted the location, had a role as <b>a</b> <b>Grateful</b> Dead fan who gives the hero a ride. He also served as production manager.|$|E
5|$|The roof {{collapsed}} in 1924 and was rebuilt by 1926. Among {{people who were}} commemorated in the church windows were John Owens, and Sir Thomas Bazley. Another window was of some antiquity, originating from a convent in Rouen, France, and presented to the church by <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> French refugee priest. This Entry to Jerusalem window were moved in 1929 to the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Eccles and windows depicting St John, St Peter and St Matthew, dating from 1760 by William Peckitt, were at some time moved to St Ann's Church in the city.|$|E
5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. <b>A</b> <b>grateful</b> and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E

5|$|In 1672 Churchill {{was posted}} to sea again, and on 28 May {{fought against the}} Dutch navy in the Battle of Solebay (Southwold Bay), on the Suffolk coast. He was {{possibly}} aboard the Duke of York's flagship, the Prince, which was crippled in the action. Shortly thereafter, Churchill was promoted (above the resentful head of his lieutenant) to a captaincy in the Duke of York's Admiralty Regiment. The following year Churchill gained a commendation at the Siege of Maastricht when the young captain distinguished himself {{as part of the}} 30-man forlorn hope, successfully capturing and defending part of the fortress. During this incident Churchill is credited with saving the Duke of Monmouth's life, receiving a slight wound in the process but gaining further praise from <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> House of Stuart, as well as recognition from the House of Bourbon. King LouisXIV in person commended the deed, from which time forward bore Churchill an enviable reputation for physical courage, as well as earning the high regard of the common soldier.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry {{to do something about}} it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May 1702 (O.S.) England {{formally}} {{declared war}} on France. Marlborough was given command of the English, Dutch, and hired German forces, {{but he had not}} as yet commanded a large army in the field, and had far less experience than a dozen Dutch and German generals who must now work under him. His command had its limitations, however. As commander of Anglo-Dutch forces he had the power to give orders to Dutch generals only when their troops were in action with his own; at all other times he had to rely on his powers of tact and persuasion, and gain the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies or political representatives of the States General. Nevertheless, despite his Allies' initial lassitude the campaign in the Low Countries (the war's principal theatre) began well for Marlborough. After outmanoeuvring Marshal Boufflers, he captured Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert and Liège, for which in December <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a duke.|$|E

25|$|During the Bourbon Restoration, Tourzel {{was made}} a duchess by <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> King Charles X. She later {{published}} her memoirs, which are an invaluable historical account of {{the final days of}} the royal household. Her daughter, Pauline, became a lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette's only surviving child, Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte, Duchesse d'Angoulême.|$|E

He died at the same house in which he was born, on 28 February 1940, and the whole fortress mourned his loss. The centrally located John Mackintosh Square was later named after him by <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> public.|$|E
25|$|At <b>a</b> <b>Grateful</b> Dead concert {{soon after}} the death of {{promoter}} Bill Graham, Kesey delivered a eulogy, mentioning that Graham had donated $1,000 toward a memorial to Jed atop Mount Pisgah, near the Kesey home in Pleasant Hill. Ken Kesey donated $33,395 towards the purchase of a proper bus for the school's wrestling team to replace the chicken van that fell off a cliff.|$|E
25|$|It was on {{alliance}} with Prussia and its chancellor Bismarck that the newly appointed Russian chancellor, Alexander Gorchakov, depended. Russia consistently supported Prussia in her wars with Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1870). In March 1871, using the crushing French defeat {{and the support}} of <b>a</b> <b>grateful</b> Germany, Russia achieved international recognition of its earlier denouncement of Article 11 of the Paris Peace Treaty, thus enabling it to revive the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E
