The SVHC candidate list is part of the EU Regulations on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 2006 (REACH), and the addition was based on the revised classification of borax as toxic for reproduction category 1B under the CLP Regulations. Substances and mixtures imported into the EU which contain borax are now required to be labelled with the warnings [...] "May damage fertility" [...] and [...] "May damage the unborn child". [...] It was proposed for addition to REACH <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> by the ECHA on 1 July 2015. [...] If this recommendation is approved, all imports and uses of borax in the EU will have to be authorized by the ECHA. Review of the boron toxicity (as boric acid and borates) published 2012 in Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health concluded: [...] "It clearly appears that human B [...] exposures, even in the highest exposed cohorts, are too low to reach the blood (and target tissue) concentrations that would be required to exert adverse effects on reproductive functions." ...|$|E

The sunset date is the date after which the substance cannot be used or imported into the EU without authorisation from the ECHA, and the latest application date is the date by which any applications for use must be submitted to the ECHA.|$|E

50|$|If the {{production}} of an article may require an authorisation at some point, finished articles themselves do not require an authorisation {{to be put on}} the market, even though they still contain a substance subject to authorisation. Consequently, articles requiring the use of an <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> substance can still be produced outside the EU and then imported. In that particular case, future restrictions procedure could however limit the placing on the market of such articles if a risk remains (art. 58.6 of REACH).|$|E
50|$|Risk {{assessments}} {{have led}} to the classification of low molecular weight and labeling as Category 1B Reproductive agents. Three of these phthalates, DBP, BBP and DEHP were included on <b>annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the REACH regulation in February 2011 and will be phased out by the EU by February 2015 unless an application for authorisation is made before July 2013 and an authorisation granted. DIBP is still on the REACH Candidate List for Authorisation. Environmental Science & Technology, a peer reviewed journal published by the American Chemical Society states DEHP poses a serious risk to human health.|$|E
50|$|The low {{molecular}} weight products BBP, DEHP, DIBP, and DBP {{were added to the}} Candidate list of Substances for Authorisation under REACH in 2008-9, and added to the Authorisation list, <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV,</b> in 2012. This means that from February 2015 they are not allowed to be produced in the EU unless authorisation has been granted for a specific use, however they may still be imported in consumer products. The creation of an Annex XV dossier, which could ban the import of products containing these chemicals, is being jointly prepared by the ECHA and Danish authorities and is expected to be submitted by April 2016.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{substance}} has been listed as an SVHC, the Agency commissions a technical report {{from one or}} more national or private laboratories, which analyses the available information on manufacture, imports, uses and releases of the substance, as well as possible alternatives. On {{the basis of this}} technical report, the Agency decides whether to prioritise the substance, in effect, whether to make a recommendation to the European Commission to add the substance to <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the REACH Regulation, making its use subject to authorisation. The draft recommendations must be made public and opened for comment for three months before the final recommendations are sent to the Commission. The first draft recommendations were published on 14 January 2009, and new draft recommendations must be issued at least once every two years.|$|E
50|$|Concerns about {{chemicals}} ingested {{by children}} when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission {{to order a}} temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of {{which is based on}} an opinion by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) “in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children”. Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including Musk Xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015.|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 8.4 {{million tonnes}} of {{plasticizers}} are consumed globally every year, of which European consumption accounts for approximately 1.5 million metric tonnes. Approximately 70% of those totals are phthalates, down from about 88% in 2005. The remaining 30% are alternative chemistries. Plasticizers contribute 10-60% of total weight of plasticized products. More recently in Europe and the US, regulatory developments {{have resulted in}} a change in phthalate consumption, with the higher phthalates (DINP and DIDP) replacing DEHP as the general purpose plasticizer of choice because DIDP and DINP were not classified as hazardous. All of these mentioned phthalates are now regulated and restricted in many products. DEHP, although most applications are shown to pose no risk when studied using recognized methods of risk assessment, has been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin, [...] and is now on the <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the European Union's REACH legislation, which means that producers and users must submit authorization requests to the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki to continue to use DEHP. Analysis of such applications will involve studies on alternatives and, given the wide number of compounds that have been used as plasticizers, such evaluations are likely to be far-reaching.|$|E
5000|$|Borax {{was added}} to the Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) {{candidate}} list on 16 December 2010.

50|$|HBCD's {{toxicity}} and its harm to {{the environment}} are currently discussed. HBCD can be found in environmental samples such as birds, mammals, fish and other aquatic organisms as well as soil and sediment.On this basis, on 28 October 2008 the European Chemicals Agency decided to include HBCD in the SVHC list, Substances of Very High Concern, within the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals framework. On 18 February 2011, HBCD was listed in the <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of REACH and hence is subject to Authorisation. HBCD can be used until the so-called “sunset date” (21 August 2015). After that date, only authorised applications will be allowed in the EU. HBCD has been found widely present in biological samples from remote areas and supporting evidences for its classification as Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) and undergoes long-range environmental transportation.In July 2012, an EU harmonised classification and labelling for HBCD entered into force. HBCD has been classified as a category 2 for reproductive toxicity. Since August 2010 hexabromocyclododecanes are included in the EPA's List of Chemicals of Concern.On May 2013 the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) decided to include HBCD in the Convention’s Annex A for elimination, with specific exemptions for expanded and extruded polystyrene in buildings needed to give countries time to phase-in safer substitutes. HBCD is listed for elimination, but with a specific exemption for expanded polystyrene (EPS) and extruded polystyrene (XPS) in buildings. Countries may choose to use this exemption for up to five years after the request for exemption is submitted. Japan was the first country to implement a ban on the import and production of HBCD effective in May 2014.|$|E
30|$|A SVHC {{will become}} subject to {{authorisation}} by inclusion into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the Regulation. Responsible for the decision on inclusion in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> is the REACH committee of the European Commission. In advance of this decision, ECHA is requested to recommend which substances of the candidate list {{should be included in}} <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> with high priority. Once included in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV,</b> production and use of the substance in the EU is limited by a sunset date. From this date on, every single use needs to be assessed by ECHA and authorised by the European Commission for a limited period on request of manufactures or users.|$|E
30|$|By September 2012, 14 SVHC {{are already}} {{included}} in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV.</b> Among these substances are four phthalates and some lead pigments. For 11 of these substances, the last possibility {{to apply for}} an authorisation is in 2013 [17]. If no authorisations are applied for and granted, marketing and use of these SVHC will terminate between August 2014 and August 2015. In addition, ECHA suggested 10 substances to be prioritised for inclusion into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> in 2012.|$|E
30|$|For {{substances}} {{with certain}} properties {{of very high}} concern (SVHC), the REACH Regulation gives the option of inclusion in the candidate list and possibly in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> (list of substances subject to authorisation). This brings information requirements for manufacturers, importers and suppliers of articles. Furthermore, an application for authorisation must be made for substances listed in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the REACH regulation [8]. After a transitional period, substances included in this list can be used only for expressly authorised uses for limited time spans.|$|E
30|$|Eventually, the {{commission}} will {{decide on the}} inclusion in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> which prohibits all uses of the substance unless authorisation for a specific use is granted. An application date and the latest date of use (‘sunset date’) will be announced and industry can decide whether to apply for authorisation or switch to suitable alternatives. Taking account of ECHA's capacities and the undefined period of time for comitology to take place, {{only a limited number}} of SVHC can be included into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> at a time. The REACH legal text does not specify if and when prioritisation from the candidate list into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> will take place which causes great planning uncertainties for industry. Authorisation shall be granted if the risk to human health or the environment is demonstrated to be adequately controlled (article 60 (2)). If adequate control cannot be demonstrated, authorisation may only be granted if it is shown that socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks (article 60 (4)).|$|E
30|$|The {{authorisation}} requirement applies with {{effect of the}} sunset date stipulated in the specific <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> entry, while {{in the case of}} the restriction according to Article  69 (2) REACH ECHA starts to consider action only after such date.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} whether the domestic and the imported articles are ‘like products’ the following product pair has to be assessed: article A, produced in the EEA and not containing any SVHC, and a similar article B, produced in a third country and containing one or more <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> SVHC.|$|E

30|$|For {{substances}} registered under REACH, {{the revised}} Annex XIII [7] not only gives the criteria {{but also the}} information relevant for the screening and assessment of P, vP, B, vB and T properties. Also, ECHA provides extensive guidance on PBT/vPvB assessment [8, 9]. Substances of very high concern (SVHC) (e.g. PBT/vPvB) {{are included in the}} ‘candidate list’ for authorisation, based on the outcome of the scientific assessment of intrinsic properties. Substances on the ‘candidate list’ can then be prioritised for authorisation and finally listed in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the REACH regulation. Some substances may be listed with specific exemptions that do not require authorisation. For each substance included in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV,</b> a deadline will be set after which use of that substance in the EU must stop (known as the ‘sunset date’), unless authorized by the European Commission.|$|E
