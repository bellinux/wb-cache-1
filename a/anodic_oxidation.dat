25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of <b>anodic</b> <b>oxidation</b> and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E
25|$|Another price {{explosion}} for tantalum in 2000/2001 {{forced the}} development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002. Niobium is a sister metal to tantalum and serves as valve metal generating an oxide layer during <b>anodic</b> <b>oxidation.</b> Niobium as raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. It {{was a question of}} the availability of the base metal in the late 1960s which led to development and implementation of niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union instead of tantalum capacitors as in the West. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.|$|E
500|$|A typical implant {{consists}} of a titanium screw (resembling a tooth root) with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made out of commercially pure titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained. Cold work hardened CP4 (maximum impurity limits of N [...]05 percent, C [...]10 percent, H [...]015 percent, Fe [...]50 percent, and O [...]40 percent) is {{the most commonly used}} titanium for implants. Grade 5 titanium, Titanium 6AL-4V, (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments. Most modern dental implants also have a textured surface (through etching, <b>anodic</b> <b>oxidation</b> or various-media blasting) to increase the surface area and osseointegration potential of the implant.|$|E

This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} current density, anodizing voltage and time on the surface characteristics of titanium during <b>anodic</b> spark <b>oxidation.</b> <b>Anodic</b> spark <b>oxidation</b> was performed at different concentrations of electrolyte composed of DL-α-glycerophosphate (DL-α-GP) and calcium acetate (CA). The specimens were anodized at various conditions (current density, anodizing voltage, and duration) in a fixed electrolyte concentration. Anodized specimens were treated hydrothermally under high pressure steam using an autoclave. Homogeneous anodic oxide films were produced by <b>anodic</b> spark <b>oxidation</b> on the titanium surface with 1 ~ 4 µm diameter pores, and the breakdown voltage was changed by the electrolyte concentration. After the hydrothermal treatment, hydroxyapatite crystals formed as an enlarged polygonal shape in the higher concentration of DL-a-GP group and as thin needles in higher concentration of CA group. The bioactivity and osteoblast growth was good for the anodized surface at 340 V compared with the groups applied other parameters...|$|R

40|$|Biocathodic {{denitrification}} using bioelectrochemical systems (BES) {{have shown}} promise for both wastewater and groundwater treatment. Typically, these systems involve <b>anodic</b> carbon <b>oxidation</b> and cathodic denitrification catalyzed by two electroactive biofilms located separately at an anode and a cathode. However, process efficiencies are often limited by pH drifts in the respective electrode-biofilms: acidification (pH 8. 5) in the biocathode. Here, we describe {{for the first}} time a single electroactive biofilm that acts as a bioanode and a biocathode, alternately catalyzing <b>anodic</b> acetate <b>oxidation</b> (Coulombic efficiency (CE) 85. 3 %) and cathodic denitrification (CE 87. 3 %) (− 400 mV Ag/AgCl). Our results indicate that the ano-cathodophilic biofilm denitrified autotrophically using the electrode (− 200 to − 600 mV Ag/AgCl) as a direct electron donor. Further, the alkalinity produced from cathodic denitrification partially (19 %) neutralized the acidity of the anodic reaction. Switching the electrode potential to temporarily favor either an anodic or cathodic reaction may represent a unique method for removing carbon and nitrate from contaminated liquors. This study offers new insights into the development of sustainable BES-based nutrient removal processes...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the several}} factors which {{influence}} lectrocatalytic a tivity, particle size and structural effects are of crucial importance, but their effects and mechanism of interaction, vis-a-vis overall performance, have been, at best, vaguely understood. The situation is further aggravated {{by the use}} {{of a wide range of}} experimental conditions resulting in non-comparable data. This paper attempts ystematically to present the developments to date in the understanding of these structural interactions and to point out areas for future investigation. The entire content of this review has been examined from the context of the highly dispersed Pt electrocatalyst, primarily because it has been examined in the greatest detail.
