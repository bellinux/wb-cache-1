5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the robot to move close to the aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles <b>are</b> <b>moving.</b> <b>To</b> address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E

25|$|Track {{bicycles}} do {{not have}} brakes, because all riders ride {{in the same direction}} around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks <b>are</b> <b>moving.</b> <b>To</b> slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.|$|E

25|$|Under the Lebanese {{employment}} system, recruitment {{agencies are}} liable to provide a replacement within {{the first three months}} after a migrant domestic worker decides to discontinue work. These first three months are a preliminary “trial period”. In order to minimize having to do this, agencies advice employers to take measures to limit the freedom of the migrant domestic workers through the confiscation of their passport and restrict their communication with the outside world. Recruitment agencies have been known to encourage employers to place restrictions on migrant domestic workers which include the confiscation of their passport and confinement to the residence. Recruitment agencies in Lebanon receive very little state supervision. A Human Rights Watch report found that workers are often made false promises about the country they <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to,</b> as well as the work they will do, and the conditions expected in the workplace. They are also misled about the salaries they can expect to receive.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, The Deceiver and a {{detachment}} {{travel to}} Forest Heart {{to locate a}} fragment of the Tain, in which Alric believes The Summoner to be hiding. They successfully find the fragment, enter the Tain, and kill The Summoner, cutting off Soulblighter from the Myrkridia. Acting on his own authority, The Deceiver then attacks Soulblighter's camp, {{but he and his}} men are captured. However, Phelot, a shade in charge of the prison, is in the service of The Deceiver, and frees them. The Deceiver attacks Soulblighter, who turns into a murder of crows to escape. He succeeds, but The Deceiver kills one of the crows, preventing him from fleeing in this manner again. The detachment then meet a scouting party near Silvermines; Alric and The Legion <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> attack Soulblighter, but have been pinned down by Shiver, whom The Deceiver immediately heads to confront. He hunts her down, and Phelot destroys her army. The Deceiver then kills her, but her death triggers a magical energy backlash that also kills him.|$|E

500|$|Death Valley National Monument was {{designated}} a biosphere reserve in 1984. On October 31, 1994, the monument was expanded by 1.3 million acres (5,300km2) and re-designated {{as a national}} park, via congressional passage of the California Desert Protection Act (Public Law 103-433). Consequently, the elevated status for Death Valley made it the largest national park in the contiguous United States. Many of the larger cities and towns within the boundary of the regional ground water flow system that the park and its plants and animals rely upon are experiencing some of the fastest growth rates of any place in the United States. Notable examples within a [...] radius of Death Valley National Park include Las Vegas and Pahrump, Nevada. In the case of Las Vegas, the local Chamber of Commerce estimates that 6,000 people <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> the city every month.
