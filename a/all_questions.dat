5|$|Boyer and the University Press' {{credibility}} {{was severely}} damaged. In 2000 the University referred <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> to university lawyers who investigated {{some of the}} allegations about Boyer's work. Later that year the Press removed the book from their catalog. The book has been discredited as a fraud and a hoax that cannot be relied on.|$|E

Therefore, they should make arrangements to pay the agency where child support is owed before they submit their application for a Lebanese passport. <b>All</b> <b>questions</b> about their child support arrears or {{the status of a}} payment should be directed to the appropriate child support enforcement agency.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{generated}} in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39% from nuclear power, {{resulting in a}} nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed), and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000. However, {{as a reaction to}} the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed). The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> relating to energy supply and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). The agency is supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} points scheme, {{which was}} in operation from inception until 2001, consisted of three groups of ten questions. The first ten questions were worth three marks each, the next ten four marks each, and the last ten five marks each. Students were deducted {{a quarter of the}} marks for a given question if they answered incorrectly, so that a student randomly guessing the answers would gain no numerical benefit (on statistical average). Students started with 30 marks, so that a student who answered <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> incorrectly would record a total score of zero, while one who answered <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> correctly would record a score of 150.|$|E
25|$|<b>All</b> <b>questions</b> on {{each section}} of the SAT are {{weighted}} equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. No points are deducted for incorrect answers. The final score {{is derived from the}} raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.|$|E

25|$|In 1889 {{he became}} {{councillor}} {{in the ministry}} of finance in Vienna, and represented {{the government in the}} lower house on <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> of taxation. He drafted a proposal for direct-tax reform. The Austrian system at the time taxed production heavily, especially during wartime, providing massive disincentives to investment. Böhm-Bawerk's proposal called for a modern income tax, which was soon approved and met {{with a great deal of}} success in the next few years.|$|E

It also {{handles the}} related {{reservations}} for sports facilities, accommodations, seminar rooms, meals, bikes and other services. In Magglingen, clubs, families, schools and companies enjoy a professional infrastructure and sporty atmosphere. In addition, FOSPO handles <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> about planning, building and operating sports facilities. From outdoor facilities and gymnasiums to pools and skating rinks, the Federal Office of Sport (FOSPO) advises builders, architects, sports club heads and corporate representatives in all {{issues related to}} sports facilities.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Patrick left Texaco {{to become}} the Executive Vice-President, General Counsel and Secretary at The Coca-Cola Company. Patrick pushed for a {{thorough}} review of allegations that some workers at bottlers of Coke products in Colombia had been abused or even killed by paramilitary groups {{as a result of}} union organizing activity. Patrick concluded the allegations to be unsubstantiated and untrue, but counseled that the company allow an independent inquiry to lay <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> to rest. After initially supporting Patrick's view, then-CEO Douglas Daft changed his mind, precipitating Patrick's decision to leave Coke.|$|E
25|$|On the ACT, each {{question}} correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice {{part of the}} test. Therefore, a student can answer <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> without suffering a decrease in their score for questions they answer incorrectly. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.|$|E
25|$|Part III of the {{decision}} addressed Congress' power to prevent political strikes through the Commerce Clause, whether the remedy designed was reasonable, and whether {{the threat posed by}} the Communist Party was so unique in its use of political strikes and in advocacy of violence that Congress could single it out. Vinson answered <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> affirmatively. Citing In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561 (1945); Clarke v. Deckebach, 274 U.S. 392 (1927); and Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), among others, Vinson noted that the Constitution often permitted otherwise irrelevant beliefs, personal traits, or employment status to be infringed upon in certain, limited circumstances.|$|E

25|$|People who {{consent to}} a search, {{knowing full well}} that they possess contraband, {{generally}} consent because they are ignorant {{of the fact that they}} have the right to decline permission to search. Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required to disclose to suspects that they have the right to decline a search. Even when a suspect does not give permission to search, police are often known to state in arrest affidavits and even provide sworn testimony that the suspect consented to the search, secure in the knowledge that a judge will normally weigh <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> of credibility in favour of law enforcement and against the accused.|$|E
25|$|But this {{is subject}} to the {{substantial}} exceptions contained in Articles 3–6, the limitations on insurance actions in Articles 7–12, and consumer contracts in Articles 13–15. Article 16 also grants exclusive jurisdiction to specified jurisdictions as the lex situs of immovable property and a res, and for the status of companies, the validity of public registers with particular reference to the registration and validity of patents, and the enforcement of judgments. Subsequent articles allow forum selection clauses and other forms of agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a given forum. The Brussels Regime therefore represents a harmonised set of rules for the determination of <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> of jurisdiction throughout the EU and EFTA (but not Liechtenstein) excluding FNC.|$|E
25|$|However true, therefore, it may be, {{that the}} {{judicial}} department is, in <b>all</b> <b>questions</b> submitted {{to it by}} the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last {{in relation to the}} authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial, {{as well as the other}} departments, hold their delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power would annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very Constitution which all were instituted to preserve.|$|E
