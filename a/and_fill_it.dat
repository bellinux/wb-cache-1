25|$|After {{refusing to}} {{consider}} {{the thought of a}} surrender, Võ Tánh requested the Tây Sơn field commander Trần Quang Diệu to spare his men in exchange for Tanh's own life. Inside the citadel, Võ Tánh ordered his men to pile straw around a wooden tower <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> with gunpowder. Tánh then went in and blew himself up. Following Tánh's death, one of his generals, Ngô Tòng Châu, drank poisoned wine and another, Nguyễn Tấn Huyên, self-immolated. Afterwards, the citadel defenders surrendered to the Tây Sơn and Trần Quang Diệu spared all the Nguyễn captives. Moreover, Dieu ordered his men to build a tomb for Võ Tánh and his generals.|$|E

Angela says she would take The Bible, A Purpose Driven Life, and The Da Vinci Code, but only to burn the latter. Dwight notes {{that he would take}} the Physicians' Desk Reference, but hollow it out <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> with supplies; he also states we would bring Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in case he got bored. Meredith later reveals that she would bring Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blonde, The Bridges of Madison County, and [...] "just the pottery scene" [...] from Ghost to watch. Pam picks Fargo, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused, The Breakfast Club, and The Princess Bride. After asking what Dwight would bring, he says The Crow.|$|E
500|$|In a cold open scene, {{the parks}} {{department}} welcomes Ann (Rashida Jones) {{to her new}} office in city hall <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> with balloons, much {{to the chagrin of}} her cranky officemate Stuart (Jim Jansen). Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Ben (Adam Scott) are dating, but they are keeping their relationship a secret due to a no-dating policy at work. They are enjoying what Leslie calls [...] "the bubble", or the beginning of a relationship when everything is simple and fun. It is suddenly threatened, however, when Ben has a meeting with Leslie's mother Marlene (Pamela Reed), a notoriously tough politician in the Pawnee school system, who wants Ben to approve the purchase of four new school buses despite a difficult budget season. Afraid of ruining the bubble, Leslie initially tells Ben she is not related to Marlene. Right before Ben's meeting, however, Leslie admits Marlene is her mother, making him nervous and causing him to capitulate to all of her demands during the meeting. Marlene considers Ben weak, so Leslie becomes determined to prove that he is a tough boss to impress Marlene.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{series of}} works applied chance {{procedures}} to pre-existing music by other composers: Cheap Imitation (1969; based on Erik Satie), Some of [...] "The Harmony of Maine" [...] (1978; based on Belcher), and Hymns and Variations (1979). In these works, Cage would borrow the rhythmic {{structure of the}} originals <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> with pitches determined through chance procedures, or just replace some of the originals' pitches. Yet another series of works, the so-called Number Pieces, all completed during {{the last five years}} of the composer's life, make use of time brackets: the score consists of short fragments with indications of when to start and to end them (e.g. from anywhere between 1′15″ and 1′45″, and to anywhere from 2′00″ to 2′30″).|$|E
2500|$|On the {{southern}} breakwater, barge construction was used. [...] The southern side of Sebastos {{was much more}} exposed than the northern side, requiring sturdier breakwaters. [...] Instead of using the double planked method filled with rubble, the architects sank barges filled with layers of pozzolana concrete and lime sand mortar. [...] The barges were similar to boxes without lids, and were constructed using mortise and tenon joints, the same technique used in ancient boats, to ensure they remained watertight. [...] The barges were ballasted with 0.5 meters of pozzolana concrete and floated out to their position. [...] With alternating layers, pozzolana based and lime based concretes were hand placed inside the barge to sink it <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> up to the surface.|$|E

The factory modification is to cut a window in the keel <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> with a sand/resin mixture. Post delivery keel modifications have included shaving lead off the sides of the keel and then building it back up with micro-balloons. C made full size keel section drawings available to permit fairing the keel after modification. The C 37R Wave Train, hull number 14 in the 37R production run, was so extensively customised by the factory (waterproof crash bulkhead forward, all bulkheads tabbed to the deck, upgraded deck and bulkhead construction, custom Britt Chance aluminum & lead keel) for a customer named Watt W. Webb that construction drawings specific to this boat were produced.|$|E

2500|$|To {{protect against}} defilement from {{contact with the}} dead, they built courtyards over bedrock, and left beneath them a hollow to serve as {{protection}} against a grave in the depths. They used to bring pregnant women there to give birth and rear their children in this ritually pure place. They placed doors {{on the backs of}} oxen and placed the children upon them with stone cups in their hands. When the children reached the pool of Siloam, the children stepped down, filled the cups with water, and then climbed back up on the doors. Rabbi Jose said that each child used to let down his cup <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> from on top of the oxen. When the children arrived at the Temple Mount with the water, they got down. Beneath the Temple Mount and the Temple courtyards was a hollow, which protected against contamination from a grave in the depths. At the entrance of the court of the women, they kept a jar of the ashes of the sin-offerings. If they did not find the residue of the ashes of seven Red Cows, they performed the sprinkling with those of six, of five, of four, of three, of two or of one. They made a causeway from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives, arches above arches, each arch placed directly above each pier of the arch below, as a protection against a grave in the depths, on which the priest who was to burn the cow, the cow itself, and all who aided in its preparation went forth to the Mount of Olives. If the cow refused to go out, they did not take out with it a black cow, lest it be said that they killed a black cow instead of a Red Cow. Nor did they bring out another Red Cow, lest it be said that they killed two Red Cows. But Rabbi Jose said it was not for this reason, but because [...] says, [...] "And he shall bring her forth," [...] implying: by herself.|$|E
