5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric <b>action</b> which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the <b>action</b> indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} <b>action</b> is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the <b>action</b> directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric <b>action.</b> In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an <b>action</b> {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item.

Under this system, each character has an <b>action</b> bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's <b>action</b> bar is filled, the player may assign an <b>action.</b> In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability.
