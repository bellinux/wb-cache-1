40|$|Credit scoring is broadly {{applied in}} {{consumer}} lending especially in {{credit cards and}} mortgages. Credit scoring has not been widely used in business lending because business loan differ substantially across household borrowers, {{making it more difficult}} to build up an accurate scoring method. However, this has changed. The complexity and flexibility of statistical models and advanced computing technology have made such credit scoring possible in business lending. Thus, many banks are using credit scoring model to evaluate business loan applications, which is a cost effective credit management tool (Mester, 1997). Preceding credit scoring valuation is important against the increasing financial risk, and adopting credit risk analysis method to value the consumer credit is a necessary step to resist serious credit loss (Li and Zhang, 2003). It is important for banks to understand that every borrower is a potential lemon and the probability to default is high. This is evidenced in today’s U. S. subprime loan problems. In essence, a credit scoring model provides an objective estimate of a borrower’s credit risk. Since a lender can not observe the borrower’s probability to default, credit scoring models enable lending institutions to rank potential customers according to their default risk, and improve the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> resources. Similarly, as China becomes more consumer credit culture and people start to borrow money for homes and other investments, an international risk standard management framework becomes more important for Chinese domestic banks. The efficiency advantage of credit scoring models certainly will help the banks to meet the growth in Chinese consumer loans and mitigate default risk. The primary problem of any lender is to differentiate between "good" and "bad" debtors prior to granting credit. Such differentiation is possible by using a credit-scoring method. In this study, we examine how this inference problem impacts mortgage borrowers’ characteristics on the probability of loan default. This includes volume of loan granted and loan price which is the interest charged on loans. We use a credit scoring model to investigate the bank mortgage lending policy in China during the period 2004 to 2009. The results show Age group, Education level, Occupation type, and Region positively impact the amount of credit granted. Gender, Age group, Marital status, Annual income, Bank rating, Occupation type, Loan duration and Region have negative impacted on loan pricing. The findings also suggest {{that it is necessary to}} review the borrowers’ creditworthiness periodically, as the changes in economic condition could affect the loan performance. The results are generally consistent with the existing literature...|$|E

In this paper, the author studied the issues of formation of financial resources of the bank, analysis, structuring, effective management. The basis of the study was the work of Russian and foreign scientists and researchers groups. Total compare and analyze the essence of the definition of financial resources 9 scholars (groups of scientists), who were divided into three groups. The results of the study show that there is no single definition of the financial resources among the domestic and foreign scientists, but the interpretation of the concept of banking financial resources are very similar. The first group of scientists determines the bank resources as the total amount of funds available to the bank, which are used to carry out active operations. The second group of scientists gives a broader definition of the essence of banking resources. They believe that the bank is a collection of resources of their own and «foreign» (attracted) funds that are used to carry out active operations. The third group of scientists lead the most accurate, thorough and comprehensive definition of bank resources. According to them, banking resources - a combination of their own, attracted and borrowed funds, which are held by a bank and used to carry out banking activities. As a result of the study, the analysis of the three definitions given in three groups of authors, the rationale for <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> and deposit resources, {{due to the nature of}} attraction Srokowo, management and cost of resources by the author formed the following definition of the financial resources of the bank.

Empirical results suggest that the two largest lenders generally allocated loans according to their eligibility criteria, granting more loans to states with more income- and employment-eligible households and poorer quality housing. Tests for political manipulation suggest that more loans were, in fact, granted in federal election years and in states where the ruling party did not perform well in the previous election. However, the numbers lack statistical significance.

We test whether this divergence from international bank capital requirements had an impact on Japanese bank lending behavior. Because this natural experiment created an exogenous supply shock, we can utilize it to disentangle demand and supply effects in order to determine the impact on Japanese bank lending in both the U. S. and Japan. We find that the infusion of regulatory capital had no aggregate impact on Japanese bank lending in Japan, but it did change the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> Well-capitalized Japanese banks shifted their lending from low margin, less capital intensive mortgage lending toward higher yielding, more capital intensive commercial loans. Moreover, we find evidence consistent with a shifting of Japanese bank lending activity away from U. S. lending(which is predominately real estate based) to domestic lending to fund manufacturing. Thus, we find that divergences from international capital standards have significant allocative effects on lending, as well as on bank profitability. ...|$|R

Housing finance is a major factor determining the quality and tenure of housing consumption, the overall financial portfolio of the public and the stability and effectiveness of the financial system. In both developed and emerging economies, sovereign governments have intervened in the markets by setting up institutions characterised by a significant degree of regulation and segmentation {{from the rest of the}} financial markets and very often with governments providing subsidised housing finance. Attempts were made to develop an empirical model to reveal the underlying factors affecting housing finance in Nigeria.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{portfolio}} credit risk measurement has improved significantly. The current state-of-the-art models analyze {{the value of}} the portfolio at a certain risk horizon, e. g. one year. Most popular has become the Merton-type one-factor model of Vasicek, that builds the fundament of the new capital adequacy framework (Basel II) finally adopted by the Basel Committee On Banking Supervision in June 2004. Due to this approach credit risk only arises from defaults, and the model provides an analytical solution for the risk measures Value at Risk and Expected Loss. One of the less examined questions in this field of research is, how the time to maturity <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> affects the portfolio credit risk. In practice there is common agreement that credit risk rises with the maturity <b>of</b> a <b>loan,</b> but only few solutions considering different maturities are discussed.
