5|$|On June 24, Philadelphia {{played at}} home versus the New York Cosmos of the second-tier North American Soccer League {{in what was}} only Curtin's second game as head coach. Overtime was again needed as the teams ended {{regulation}} tied at one apiece before Sébastien Le Toux scored the game-winner in the 115th minute. Shortly after the goal, a melee erupted between the teams that resulted in two Cosmos players and one Union player being sent off for pushing <b>and</b> <b>shoving.</b> Two of New York's assistant coaches were also ejected for their parts in the disorder.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{started his}} new club season 2010–11 as a first-team regular, playing against Manchester United {{on the opening}} day. On Barton's and Newcastle's second match, he scored against Aston Villa in a 6–0 victory for Newcastle. Immediately after the match, Barton removed a {{moustache}} which he had pledged to not shave until Newcastle United had won a match in the new season. On 10 November, in a 2–1 defeat to Blackburn, Barton again acted violently, punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the chest. He was not punished during the match as the officials {{did not see the}} incident, but after reviewing the evidence, the FA again charged Barton with violent conduct. Barton apologised, accepted the charge, and was banned for three matches. Barton courted controversy once again during Newcastle's 3–1 win over Liverpool on 11 December 2010, when he appeared to direct homophobic remarks and a lewd gesture at Fernando Torres. Barton scored two penalties against Arsenal on 5 February 2011 as Newcastle came from a 4–0 deficit to draw 4–4. He was involved in an altercation with Abou Diaby, which led to a straight red card for Diaby. Diaby took offence to Barton's strong challenge and retaliated by grabbing Barton by the neck <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> him to the ground.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} game with the Raiders in Week 1, Lynch {{finished}} with 76 rushing yards along with one reception for 16 yards as the Raiders won by a score of 26–16 over the Tennessee Titans at Nissan Stadium. On September 14, Lynch was fined $12,000 for doing an obscene gesture. In Week 2, against the New York Jets, he had his first touchdown as a Raider, which was a two-yard rush in the second quarter, in the 45–20 victory. During Thursday Night Football against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7, Lynch was ejected for running onto the field <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> an official following a hit by Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters on Raiders quarterback Derek Carr. The very next day, the NFL suspended Lynch for one game. Lynch attempted to appeal, but the suspension remained upheld.|$|E
25|$|On Friday June 9, 2006, López Obrador {{promised to}} deliver {{documentation}} {{that would prove}} the allegations. Later that day, Claudia Sheinbaum from the López Obrador campaign arrived at Calderón campaign headquarters with three filing boxes. They were met outside by the vice-coordinator of Calderón's campaign, and by the press and a notary public who had been called by the Calderón campaign. The vice-coordinator of the campaign insisted that the boxes be opened and the contents catalogued and witnessed by the notary public before they were brought inside. A verbal confrontation ensued; during this confrontation, the boxes were opened and {{it was found that}} they were almost empty and contained only a handful of copies of documents the PRD had made public previously, and three CDs. Sheinbaum attempted to explain what the contents were, but a shouting <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> match began among PAN and PRD members present. The accusations against Zavala were discontinued after the confrontation, though they were never withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, April 23, {{the most}} complex and thorny issues were debated. The first {{contentious}} issue on the agenda dealt with natural resources industries, such as the oil, gas, and mines, as it became the centre of a major showdown between the Waffle and the labour movement forces. The Waffle faction wanted total nationalization and public ownership of resource industries. The party establishment, and Labour, being more moderate, wanted only to expand public and co-operative ownership. The hour-long debate, quickly transcended into raucous name-calling and physical pushing <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> at the microphone stands. Sidney Green, Manitoba’s Minister of Mines and Resources in the NDP provincial government, spoke in favour of the moderate resolutions committee motion. He was countered on the convention floor by university professor Peter Usher, a Waffle member from Ottawa, who moved to refer the committee’s motion back for redrafting to push for nationalization of all resource industries. After much heated debate, his motion was defeated in a standing-count vote by a three to one margin. The standing vote was needed because Waffle members challenged two previous voting attempts. Once defeated, the Unity Group, and its labour supporters, pressed for {{the adoption of the}} original eight-point resolution, which then passed easily with a five to one plurality. With the Waffle’s amendment defeated, it seemed unlikely that they could pass other motions that called for the nationalization of other economic sectors like manufacturing, financial, and transportation.|$|E

500|$|The protest was peaceful, {{with the}} {{exception}} of an incident in Murrow Park, {{across the street from the}} World Bank, where several demonstrators charged the line of police as a group of finance ministers arrived and crossed the police lines for mid-afternoon meetings.

500|$|In frogs, male {{territorial}} behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling {{is both an}} announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, {{and this may be}} sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a [...] "home advantage" [...] and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing <b>and</b> <b>shoving,</b> deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.|$|E

500|$|Let's Get It On {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Billboard called it [...] "fine {{in terms of}} vocal attack and material [...] touches on the excellent in terms of instrumental support", while citing the title track and [...] "Distant Lover" [...] as the album's best recordings. Jon Landau of Rolling Stone found Gaye's performance on-par with that of What's Going On and wrote that [...] "he continues to transmit that same degree of intensity, sending out near cosmic overtones while eloquently phrasing the sometimes simplistic lyrics". Although he viewed that it [...] "lacks that album's series of highpoints", Landau commented that [...] "it ebbs and flows, occasionally threatening to spend itself on an insufficiency of ideas, but always retrieved, just in time, by Gaye's performance. From first note to last, he keeps pushing <b>and</b> <b>shoving,</b> and if he sometimes takes one step back for every two ahead, he gets there just the same — and with style and spirit to spare". In Creem magazine, Robert Christgau called the record [...] "post-Al Green What's Going On, which means it's about fucking rather than the human condition, thank the wholly holey".|$|E
500|$|Due to {{rehabilitation}} {{from the}} shoulder surgery, Burrows {{missed the first}} ten games of the 2010–11 season. Continuing {{to play with the}} Sedins upon his return, he recorded 48 points (26 goals and 22 assists) in 72 games, sixth in team-scoring. Winning the Presidents' Trophy, the Canucks entered the 2011 playoffs as the first seed in the West and matched up against the Blackhawks for the third consecutive year. With a 3–0 lead in the series, the Canucks lost their next three games, resulting in a game seven. In the deciding game, Burrows scored two goals in a 2–1 overtime win, helping Vancouver eliminate Chicago. After defeating the Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in rounds two and three, the Canucks reached the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 17 years. Playing the Boston Bruins, Burrows received much attention of the series for allegedly biting opposing forward Patrice Bergeron during a scrum at the end of the first period in Game 1 of the series. While the two players were being held apart by a linesman, Burrows appears to be shown biting down on Bergeron's finger, while both players were pushing <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> at one another. The incident was reviewed by the league, but was ruled unsuspendable with [...] "no conclusive evidence that [...] intentionally bit [...] finger." [...] The following game, Burrows scored his second overtime-winner of the playoffs, part of a three-point effort (two goals and an assist). Occurring 11 seconds into the extra period, it was the second-fastest goal scored from the start of an overtime game in Stanley Cup Finals history (Montreal Canadiens forward Brian Skrudland scored nine seconds into overtime in Game 2 of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against the Calgary Flames). With two overtime goals in one playoff season, Burrows tied the NHL record, which was held by 28 other players. After leading two-games-to-none in the series, Vancouver went on to lose the Stanley Cup to Boston in seven contests. Burrows finished the post-season with 9 goals and 17 points over 25 games.|$|E

Special police units prevented their forceful entry and that of several hundred supporters of the MOC. There was some pushing <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> between the police, and the crowd which had intended to force its way into the monastery. Following this, members of the crowd shouted slogans such as [...] "this isn't Serbia", [...] "whose police are you?" [...] and [...] "Risto, Satan" [...] (a reference to Metropolitan Amfilohije of the SOC).|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{importance}} of leaf choice in their reproductive success, sugarbeet root aphid stem mothers are highly territorial and will compete with each other for the chance to form galls at the bases of the largest leaves. This competition usually takes the form of kicking <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> contests; two stem mothers will align rear-to-rear and push against the other forcefully using their hind legs. The winner of these contests then settles closest to the leaf base, and the loser settles more distally. If the basal stem mother dies or is removed, the distal stem mother often moves down {{to the base of the}} gall to replace her. These territorial contests are unusually long, and can span the course of several days. A side effect of this intense territorial competition is the creation of a [...] "floater population" [...] of unsettled stem mothers searching for unoccupied leaves.|$|E
2500|$|With {{its four}} leading scorers returning, Texas entered the 1978–79 {{season with a}} No. 6 ranking in the AP poll and as the near-unanimous {{favorite}} to win the SWC championship. The Longhorns struggled early, beginning the season 7–4 and {{falling out of the}} AP rankings after a 21-point road defeat to Bill Cartwright and the San Francisco Dons. After another blowout road loss to Texas Tech, Texas regrouped to win three straight road games and 12 of its next 13 games, including a three-point upset of 10th-ranked Arkansas in Fayetteville, a 23-point blowout of Shelby Metcalf's No. 15 Texas A Aggies in Austin, and an eight-point win over the 11th-ranked Aggies three weeks later in College Station. During the preceding thirty seasons, Texas had only managed a total of six wins against AP-ranked opponents, and never more than one such victory in a single year. A home loss to 14th-ranked Arkansas was the lone blemish during the 13-game stretch, a game that featured a shouting <b>and</b> <b>shoving</b> episode, famous in SWC lore, between Lemons and Eddie Sutton after Sutton had admonished Texas player Johnny Moore on the court. Police and assistant coaches intervened, but Lemons told the media following the game that if Sutton dared to address his players again, he would [...] "tear his Sunday clothes" [...] and [...] "liquidate his ass." [...] Struggling SMU dealt Texas a shocking defeat in the final game of the regular season, depriving the Longhorns of sole possession of the SWC crown and forcing them to share the conference championship with Arkansas for the second straight season. Following a 39–38 loss to the ninth-ranked Razorbacks in the SWC Tournament Final, Texas received a No. 4 seed and a bye to the second round in the 1979 NCAA Tournament. Texas fell to No. 5-seeded Oklahoma in the tournament to finish the season with a 21–8 overall record and a No. 15 final ranking in the UPI Coaches' Poll. The Longhorns drew an average of 15,886 fans per home game in 1978–79, a school and Erwin Center record that to this point has not been challenged.|$|E

2500|$|Push <b>and</b> <b>Shove</b> has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared it favorably to Stefani's solo albums, stating, [...] "hat's {{the interesting thing}} about Push <b>and</b> <b>Shove,</b> for as much as there are clever contemporary flourishes [...] this is a modest, mature comeback, highlighted by the band's keen awareness of their strengths and subtle, unstated acknowledgment of encroaching middle age." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz commented that on Push <b>and</b> <b>Shove,</b> Stefani [...] "pogos as hard as she did in her Anaheim-strip-mall ska days. But she's also just as neurotic, which adds depth to her love songs." [...] In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood opined, [...] "At its best, Push <b>and</b> <b>Shove</b> channels some of the infectiously restless energy of Rock Steady [...] And it further polishes a bold mix-and-match aesthetic that feels familiar today in part because of records such as Tragic Kingdom." ...|$|R
