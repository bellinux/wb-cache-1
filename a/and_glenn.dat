The lakes are now {{separated}} by an alluvial fan <b>and</b> <b>Glenns</b> flows into Cosley {{by way of}} a small stream. METHODS One core from GNP’s Cosley Lake and another core from Glenns Lake just downstream of Cosley were collected. The first core from Cosley is ~ 32. 0 cm long <b>and</b> <b>Glenns</b> is slightly shorter at 24. 0 cm. The cores were sampled at every 0. 5 cm and fossil diatom assemblages are being completed by Matthew Brindle. The dried samples were then passed on for geochemical analyses. Detailed phosphorus extractions have been started and completed for approximately a quarter of each core at 2 cm intervals. All detailed P geochemistry samples were analyzed using a UV-Visible Spectrophotometer. The CDB solution interferes with color development; therefore...|$|R

5|$|A tag team match {{followed}} in the fourth match, with Pat Kenney teaming with Johnny B. Badd to fight The New York Connection (Johnny Swinger <b>and</b> <b>Glenn</b> Gilbertti). Jacqueline was the special guest referee for the bout. Badd won the encounter after he lifted Gilberti up onto his shoulders, spun him around, and fell to his back to perform a move known as a TKO. Badd followed by covering Gilberti for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Segrè <b>and</b> <b>Glenn</b> Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg {{of plutonium}} in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, {{and found that}} it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but {{it was not possible to}} produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E
5|$|Estianty with Mey Chan made Duo Maia. Together they {{released}} the album Maia and Friends in 2008; {{the album was}} in direct competition with Jameela's album.

Recurring guest voice actor John G.

Minor appearances were made by writer and showrunner Steve Callaghan, actor Ralph Garman, writer and showrunner Mark Hentemann and writers Patrick Meighan, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin and John Viener.|$|E
5|$|In the town, Rick <b>and</b> <b>Glenn</b> find Hershel {{alone in}} a tavern, {{drinking}} and lamenting {{the loss of his}} family members. Rick eventually convinces Hershel to return, but as they are about to leave, two men from Philadelphia enter the bar—Dave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony (Aaron Munoz). They reveal that Rick's goal of Fort Benning may be overridden and try to goad where the group's farm is, looking for safe haven. Rick refuses to disclose the farm's location, and shoots them both before they fire back on him.|$|E

Verville also began reading stories about the Wright Brothers in newspapers and magazines with great interest. Later he even wrote to the Wrights <b>and</b> <b>Glenn</b> Curtiss and received responses.|$|E

5|$|Brooks {{collected}} a bronze in the medley relay after swimming the freestyle leg in the heats before {{being replaced by}} first-choice Stockwell in the final. Competing {{in the third and}} final heat, Australia and the United States were equal at the last change before Brooks posted the fastest freestyle leg in the heats, pulling out a 0.40s margin over Tom Jager. Australia again qualified fastest, but the Americans again had more in reserve, having rested all of their first-choice quartet in the heats. Stockwell combined with Kerry, Evans <b>and</b> <b>Glenn</b> Buchanan to finish behind the United States and Canada in the final, missing silver by just 0.02s. Australia improved on their qualifying time by only 0.68s, while the Americans sped up by 5.03s.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) <b>and</b> <b>Glenn</b> (Steven Yeun) {{report the}} death and {{reanimation}} of Randall to the others, but also that he turned without being bit. Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) begs Daryl {{to go out and}} search for Rick and Shane. However, they too soon see the walker horde and start arming themselves. While Rick's group is ready to abandon the farm, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) intends to protect his land with his own life, if needed. As the group starts to dispatch walkers, Rick and Carl are able to lure a number into the barn, and set it ablaze. Jimmy (James Allen McCune) drives the RV near the barn and allows Rick and Carl to safely escape the burning barn, but he is killed when the walkers overrun the RV.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers, such as plutonium-239, were fissile. Emilio Segrè <b>and</b> <b>Glenn</b> Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. While minute quantities of plutonium-239 could be created in cyclotrons, it was not feasible to produce a large quantity that way. Compton conferred with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber from the University of Illinois about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might then be chemically separated from uranium it was bred from.|$|E
