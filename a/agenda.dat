40|$|Despite {{the wide}} range of <b>agendas</b> used in {{legislative}} decision-making, the literature has focused almost exclusively on two stylized formats, the so-called Euro-Latin and Anglo-American <b>agendas.</b> As emphasized by Ordeshook and Schwartz [1987], this focus leaves a sizable gap in our understanding of the legislative process. To help address the deficiency, I first define a very broad class of <b>agendas</b> (called simple <b>agendas)</b> whose features are common among <b>agendas</b> used in legislative settings. I then characterize the sophisticated (Farquharson [1969]) voting outcomes implemented by <b>agendas</b> in this class. By establishing a clear connection between the structure of simple <b>agendas</b> and the outcomes associated with them, the characterization extends our understanding of legislative decision-making well beyond the very limited scope of Euro-Latin and Anglo-American <b>agendas...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{employed}} {{an analysis}} of the advocacy-related resources and materials available through the 50 NASW state chapter websites.

One third of the mission statements reviewed contained language indicating that advocacy was part of the chapter mission, while nearly as many included no content related to advocacy or social justice on their homepages. Nearly two thirds of the websites contained no resources, tools or links to help with advocacy practice, promotion or education. Thirteen advocacy themes emerged, which represented policy issues within the state advocacy <b>agendas.</b> Professional Self-Interest was the issue with the highest frequency (17 %) across the 2010 state chapter <b>agendas,</b> but the 12 other social justice issues combined dominated the legislative <b>agendas</b> (83 %). Professional selfinterest issues accounted for the highest rate of prevalence on state <b>agendas,</b> as it appeared on 86 % of the chapter <b>agendas</b> analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The {{new field}} of {{judgment}} aggregation aims to find collective judgments on logically interconnected propositions. Recent impossibility results establish limitations on the possibility to vote independently on the propositions. I show that, fortunately, the impossibility results {{do not apply to}} a wide class of realistic <b>agendas</b> once propositions like "if a then b" are adequately modelled, namely as subjunctive implications rather than material implications. For these <b>agendas,</b> consistent and complete collective judgments can be reached through appropriate quota rules (which decide propositions using acceptance thresholds). I characterise the class of these quota rules. I also prove an abstract result that characterises consistent aggregation for arbitrary <b>agendas</b> in a general logic.

40|$|One {{strand of}} agenda-setting {{research}} examines the news media's influence on citizens' cognitive <b>agendas.</b> A second strand of agenda-setting explores {{the hypothesis that}} media content may directly influence governmental decisions. Evidence for policy agenda-setting is mixed, {{with the results of}} some studies supporting the hypothesis, while others have found little or no support for it. Unfortunately, the existing research provides no clear guide to understanding why the media might influence policy in some cases, but not in others. The present article addresses that issue by suggesting that policy makers have two kinds of policy agendas— symbolic <b>agendas</b> and resource agendas—and by providing evidence about resource agenda-setting with respect to crime policy in seven American cities from 1950 through 1980. Symbolic <b>agendas</b> are those lists of issues that require visible, but not necessarily substantive, action on the part of policy makers (Edelman, 1964). Resource <b>agendas</b> are those lists of issues that require substantive action, including the possible allocation of resources. These two kinds of policy <b>agendas</b> are conceptually distinct; issues having...|$|R

5|$|During {{the period}} of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi {{political}} organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities {{before and during the}} war. The most significant were DeVlag, Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders as well as the Catholic Rex movement in Wallonia. Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies, their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers. These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army. Unlike the German-style National Socialist <b>agenda</b> of DeVlag, VNV appealed directly to a Flemish separatist <b>agenda,</b> though this message was never the main source of their popularity. Infighting between the groups, particularly VNV and DeVlag, was considerable.|$|E
