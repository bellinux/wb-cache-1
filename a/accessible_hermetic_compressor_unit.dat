50|$|Typically in hermetic, {{and most}} semi-hermetic {{compressors}} (sometimes known as <b>accessible</b> <b>hermetic</b> <b>compressors),</b> the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the refrigerant system.

On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the actual required refrigeration capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit.

40|$|The most {{important}} design parameters for hermetically sealed compressors used in domestic refrigerators are the Coefficient of Performance (COP); low manufacturing and operating costs; long operating life, low {{noise and vibration}} levels and to achieve environmentally friendly constructions. Positive displacement piston type compressors are used in refrigerators today due to their high capacity/volume ratios. Hence, the bearings of the <b>hermetic</b> <b>compressors</b> must also satisfy these design conditions. Investigation and optimization of crank shaft bearings in <b>hermetic</b> <b>compressor</b> applications are the main objectives of this study. The effect of crank shaft geometry, bearing clearance, lubricant viscosity, surface roughness and bearing location along the shaft on the friction losses were investigated and the new journal bearing designs were developed.

Measurement of the efficiency of the compressor with the improved bearing design showed 1. 3 % increase in the coefficient of performance (COP) with respect to the compressor with previous bearing design.

In the present paper the friction losses in the journal bearings of a <b>hermetic</b> reciprocating <b>compressor</b> are investigated using numerical methods. A dynamic model is set up to solve the Reynolds equation using a finite volume approach to calculate the pressure field in each journal bearing. The calculation of the fluid film thickness is accomplished with the formulas of the parallel gap. The resulting hydrodynamic forces are equated with forces obtained by a dynamic multibody model of the compressor crank drive to calculate the transient orbit movement of the bearing. Based on the movement of the crankshaft at steady-state conditions, the shear stresses in the gap between crankshaft and housing can be calculated. Thus the cycle averaged friction power loss can be determined. To consider effect such as surface roughness of the bearings or possible contacts between the solids, correlations found in the literature are implemented. The present method is used to assess the friction power loss of the journal bearings during the operation with different oil viscosities. The simulated data is verified with simple analytical friction loss calculations based on shear stresses in the Couette flow between bearing and housing...|$|R
