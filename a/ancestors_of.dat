5|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} {{are held}} to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> modern rhinos split from the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins {{seem to have}} been an ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the tetrapods evolved them further, while the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of darts in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, it seems likely that love darts appeared during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the Stylommatophora possessed darts already.|$|E
50|$|He was <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> {{the later}} medieval Mac Giolla Phádraig family, and the Icelandic Landnámabók (in {{which he is}} called Kjallakr Kjarvalson) names him as an <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> some of Iceland's early settlers.|$|R

5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E
5|$|It {{and similar}} animals may {{possibly}} be the common <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the broad swath of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The first well-preserved Tiktaalik fossils {{were found in}} 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> today's draught horses, were used, {{particularly in}} Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed {{to remain calm}} in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E

5|$|The 2002 study {{indicated}} that the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed {{at the base of}} a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.|$|E

5|$|The Cekaracecekaramalai written {{during the}} Aryacakravarti rule in Jaffna {{asserts that the}} direct <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the Kings belonged {{to a group of}} 512 Ariyar (a Brahmin priestly caste) of the Pasupata sect of the Rameswaram Hindu temple. The source also claims that two out of the 512 were {{selected}} as Kings of Ariyars. It also explains that a direct ancestor of the kings was a scribe in the Pandyan kingdom and was called during a war with other kingdoms to assist the king, and that the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the kings fought in wars against kings in the Hoysala and Karnataka.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{people used}} the {{turntable}} trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet.

5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E
