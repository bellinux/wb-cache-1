Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times. He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, new philosophies of child-rearing led to clothes that were thought {{especially}} suitable for children. Toddlers wore washable dresses called frocks of linen or cotton. British and <b>American</b> <b>boys</b> after perhaps three began to wear rather short pantaloons and short jackets, and for very young boys the skeleton suit was introduced. These gave {{the first real}} alternative to boys' dresses, and became fashionable across Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) {{was set up}} in 1842 with {{a mission}} to provide an {{education}} program and healthy sports to young men. The YMCA was responsible for providing swimming classes to countless numbers of <b>American</b> <b>boys</b> and teenagers. This included swimming in indoor pools. Swimming trunks were not permitted in their pools. In Lincoln, Nebraska in 1958, for example, learners were told just to bring a towel and not to bring trunks. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1954, the Recreation Department reported that 404 youngsters had attended an 11-day swimming course where the boys were unhampered by bathing suits. When the YMCA began to admit females in the early 1960s, the wearing of bathing suits became a requirement.|$|E

50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Boy</b> Scouts of Rhode Island {{was founded}} by Charles E. Mulhearn on August 29, 1910 with the meeting of an {{executive}} committee. The next day, the committee requested a charter from the New England Department Headquarters of the <b>American</b> <b>Boy</b> Scouts. At a September 8, 1910 executive committee meeting, the organization selected its first officers. On March 12, 1911, the organization voted {{to break away from}} the <b>American</b> <b>Boy</b> Scouts and was renamed as the Rhode Island Boy Scouts. The State issued a state charter to the RIBS as a state institution.|$|R

500|$|In {{recent years}} the number of LGBT {{characters}} in mainstream superhero comics has increased greatly. At first gay characters appeared in supporting roles, but their roles have become increasingly prominent. The trend has prompted both praise from the LGBT community and organizations like the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), and criticism from conservative groups. Critics have made accusations that comics are attempting to subvert readers into a [...] "gay lifestyle", trying to [...] "lure young <b>American</b> <b>boys</b> into the kinky web of homosexuality and AIDS".|$|E

It was {{replaced}} with a scene where Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack or not. In it, Truman asserts that dropping the bomb will shorten the war, and a [...] "year less of war will mean life for... from 300,000 to half a million of America's finest youth".|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2016 that Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler were working on a memoir titled The 15:17 to Paris, which would highlight {{the events of the}} 2015 Thalys train attack. Perseus Books Group, who will be publishing the book, described the memoir as “the gripping true story of a terrorist attack that would have killed more than 500 people if not for their actions, but it is also the story of three <b>American</b> <b>boys,</b> their friendship, and the values we hold dear.” Jeffrey E. Stern, an international journalist, will co-write the book. David Steinberger, {{president and chief executive of}} Perseus Books Group, said that he is “confident that this is going to be a film. It’s extremely cinematic, and there’s a lot of interest in the movie.” He further said that [...] "based on the material, that this was going to be an important book and one that readers were really going to respond to.” The memoir was made available to the public on August 23, 2016, almost a year after the 2015 Thalys train attack. In the acknowledgements, Stone stated that he [...] "give all the credit to God" [...] and made further acknowledgement of his family, friends, the United States Air Force, the citizens of Sacramento and the United States Armed Forces.|$|E

2500|$|While Mullan {{was with}} Colonel Wright during the Coeur d'Alene War, {{he became the}} {{informal}} guardian of an orphan Yakima boy. On August 24, while encamped at Fort Taylor on the Snake River, three young Native <b>American</b> <b>boys</b> were captured by Wright's pickets. The three claimed to be brothers, {{and said they were}} Yakimas whose father had been killed by the Spokans five years earlier. Since then, they had been enslaved by the Spokans. [...] Wright sent the two older boys to Fort Walla Walla. Mullan, however, persuaded Wright to let him take care of the youngest boy, who was about 14 years old. Wright agreed, and the boy accompanied Mullan {{for the rest of the}} military expedition. Mullan then left the boy, whom he named John in honor of an uncle, with his brother at Mullan's Walla Walla farm. This boy, who would have been John Mullan III, remained at the farm through 1864, until John Mullan, Jr. lost the farm. [...] The boy's whereabouts afterward are not known.|$|E

2500|$|Lone Scouts of America (LSA) was a Scouting {{organization}} for <b>American</b> <b>boys</b> that operated from 1915 until it {{merged with the}} Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1924. [...] The LSA was founded by W. D. Boyce, publisher of the Chicago Ledger and the Saturday Blade {{and one of the}} founders of the BSA. [...] Boyce felt that the program of the BSA did not help the rural boy who could not find enough other boys to form a troop or a patrol. [...] James E. West, the first Chief Scout Executive of the BSA, disagreed with Boyce's concept, believing that the 4-H program was fulfilling the role. [...] After Boyce left the BSA, he started the Lone Scouts of America and incorporated it on January 9, 1915. [...] Boyce became the executive officer or Chief Totem and Frank Allan Morgan became the editor of The Lone Scout. [...] In October 1915, Boyce appointed all of his paperboys as members of the LSA and published the first issue of The Lone Scout magazine.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the elite}} level, {{tolerance}} of Catholicism was more problematic. Henry A. Wallace, Roosevelt's vice-president in 1941-45, {{did not go}} public with his anti-Catholicism, but he often expounded it in his diary, especially during and after World War II. He briefly attended a Catholic church in the 1920s, and was disillusioned by what he {{perceived to be the}} intellectual straitjacket of Thomism. By the 1940s, he worried that certain [...] "bigoted Catholics" [...] were scheming {{to take control of the}} Democratic Party; indeed the Catholic big city bosses in 1944 played a major role in denying him renomination as vice present. He confided in his diary that it was [...] "increasingly clear" [...] that the State Department intended [...] "to save <b>American</b> <b>boys</b> lives by handing the world over to the Catholic Church and saving it from communism." [...] In 1949, Wallace opposed NATO, warning that [...] "certain elements in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church" [...] were involved in a pro-war hysteria. Defeated for the presidency in his third-party run in 1948, Wallace blamed Tory Britain, the Roman Catholic Church, Reactionary Capitalism, and various others for his overwhelming defeat.|$|E
