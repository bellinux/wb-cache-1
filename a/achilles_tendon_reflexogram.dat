40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review the}} current {{concepts}} on <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> involvement in various pathological conditions. METHOD: A literature search {{was conducted to}} trace relevant literature on <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> problems in general pathologies. RESULTS: The <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> can be involved in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, genetically determined collagen abnormalities, infectious diseases, tumours, and neurological conditions which are not of a primary surgical nature.

40|$|Musculoskeletal (MSK) {{models are}} used {{extensively}} {{in the study of}} human movement. The validity of a given MSK model is affected by the architectural features of the system. The <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment arm is one important architectural characteristic of lower extremity MSK models as it transforms ankle plantar flexion moment present during many functional weight-bearing activities to <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> force. Because the gastrocnemius muscle, which crosses both the knee and ankle joints, inserts to the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon,</b> the magnitude of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment arm affects knee-joint contact forces. However, current estimates of <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment arm vary widely and are apparently influenced by factors including ankle joint position, measurement technique, and muscle contraction level. For example, some estimates of <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment are a constant value while others vary as a function of ankle angle. Imaging techniques (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment arm tend to be larger than those using ultrasound (US) technology. Finally, estimates of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment arm while plantarflexor muscles are contracted tend to be larger than those measured during a state of rest. However, the effect of these varied estimates on knee joint contact and <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> forces during walking and running is unclear. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> force and knee-joint contact forces during walking and running using a musculoskeletal model and five different estimates of <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment arm (MRI/contracted, MRI/rest, US/contracted, US/rest, constant value). Three dimensional gait and ground reaction force data from 10 participants will be used as inputs to a knee-joint musculoskeletal model from which tibiofemoral joint, patellofemoral joint, and Achilles peak force and force*time impulse will be derived using 5 separate <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> moment arm estimates.

We report here the case of a subcutaneous <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture in an eighty-year-old, healthy female, who returned to her previous level of activity following surgical treatment.

30|$|Rupture of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> {{often leads}} to {{long-term}} morbidity, particularly calf weakness associated with tendon elongation.

40|$|Abstract Background The optimal {{management}} of chronic ruptures of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> is surgical reconstruction.

The right tendon mass was treated with a wide marginal excision and <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> reconstruction. The histology confirmed <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> xanthoma. Further metabolic investigation revealed the patient to have a rare autosomal recessive condition called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Her brother was also affected.

40|$|The <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> is {{the strongest}} tendon in the human body.

The most common clinical diagnosis of Achilles overuse injuries is tendinopathy. The basic etiology of the Achilles tendinopathy is known to be multi-factorial.

40|$|Background <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> {{pathology}} is a frequently occurring {{musculoskeletal disorder}} in runners. Foot orthoses {{have been shown}} to reduce the symptoms of pain in runners but their mechanical effects are still not well understood. Methods This study aimed to examine differences in <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> load when running with and without orthotic intervention. Twelve male runners ran at 4. 0 m·s− 1. Ankle joint moments and <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> forces were compared when running with and without orthotics. Findings The results indicate that running with foot orthotics was associated with significant reductions in <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> load compared to without orthotics.

40|$|Abstract Background Treatment of {{ruptured}} <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> currently constitutes {{of conservative}} early functional treatment or surgical treatment either by open or minimal invasive techniques. We hypothesize that an experimental <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> suture in an animal model significantly deteriorates <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> microcirculation immediately following suturing. Methods Fifteen <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> of eight male Wistar rats (275 – 325 g) were included. After {{preparation of the}} <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> with a medial paratendinous approach, <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> microcirculation was assessed using combined Laser-Doppler and spectrophotometry (Oxygen-to-see) regarding: - tendinous capillary blood flow [arbitrary units AU] - tendinous tissue oxygen saturation [%] - tendinous venous filling pressure [rAU] The {{main body of the}} <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> was measured {{in the center of the}} suture with 50 Hz. 10 minutes after <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> suture (6 - 0 Prolene), a second assessment of microcirculatory parameters was performed. Results <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> capillary blood flow decreased by 57 % following the suture (70 ± 30 AU vs. 31 ± 16 AU; p Conclusion <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> suture in anaesthetised rats causes an acute loss of capillary perfusion and increases postcapillary venous filling pressures indicating venous stasis. The primary hypothesis of this study was confirmed. In contrast, tendinous tissue oxygen saturation remains unchanged excluding acute intratendinous hypoxia within the first 10 minutes after suture. Further changes of oxygen saturation remain unclear. Furthermore, it remains to be determined to what extent reduced capillary blood flow as well as increased postcapillary stasis might influence tendon healing from a microcirculatory point of view in this animal setting. </p...|$|R

Purpose To evaluate effects of early mobilization versus traditional immobilization rehabilitation programs 2 years after surgical <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> repair, by comparing force-elongation and stress-strain relationships of the injured tendon {{to those of the}} uninjured tendon. Methods A group of males with previous <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture (n = 18) and a group of healthy male controls (n = 9) participated. <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture group consisted of patients that had received early mobilization (n = 9) and patients that had received traditional immobilization with a plaster cast (n = 9). Comparisons of tendon structural and mechanical properties were made between <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture and healthy control groups, and between the uninjured and injured sides of the two rehabilitation groups in <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture group. Ultrasound was used to determine bilaterally tendon cross-sectional area, tendon resting length, and tendon elongation as a function of torque during maximal voluntary plantar flexion. From these data, <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> force-elongation and stress-strain relationships were determined. Findings The <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture group uninjured side was not different from healthy control group. Structural and mechanical parameters of the injured side were not different between the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture early mobilization and the immobilization groups. Compared to the uninjured side, the injured side showed a reduction in stress at maximal voluntary force, in Young's modulus and in stiffness.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to measure and}} compare the thickness and cross-sectional area of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> between frequent- and infrequent-exercise subjects, and between the dominant and nondominant ankles in an asymptomatic Chinese population. Interobserver variability in the measurement {{of the size of}} <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> was also evaluated. High-resolution ultrasound (US) examination of <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> was performed in 40 healthy subjects (20 who frequently exercised, had exercise at least 3 days per week and at least 2 h per session; and 20 who infrequently exercised); their age range was 19 to 25 years. The thickness and cross-sectional area of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> were measured in a transverse scan at the level of medial malleolus. For each subject, the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> were measured by five operators to evaluate the interobserver variability in the measurements. The mean thickness and cross-sectional areas of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> in a healthy Chinese population are 5. 23 mm 2 and 56. 91 mm 22, respectively. The mean thickness of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> of frequent-exercise subjects (dominant ankle 5. 43 mm, nondominant ankle 5. 38 mm) was significantly greater than that of infrequent-exercise subjects (dominant ankle 5. 08 mm, nondominant ankle 5. 04 mm) (p 0. 05). In both frequent- and infrequent-exercise subjects, {{there was no significant difference}} in the mean thickness and cross-sectional area of <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> between dominant and nondominant ankles (p > 0. 05).

30|$|The {{model of}} <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> creep perhaps {{initially}} seems counterintuitive {{with respect to}} the mechanism of Botox®. However, Botox® causes reversible muscle paralysis of the gastrocsoleus, which removes the antagonistic contraction of the shortened muscle against the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon.</b> This enables the clubfoot to be manipulated and held through an extended range of dorsiflexion, which is sustained by casts, and the resultant tensile force is applied unobstructedly on the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon.</b> Therefore, the applied stretch is increased and consequently facilitates creep of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for the reconstruction of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> in chronic tears. In presence of a large gap (greater than 6 centimetres), tendon augmentation is required. Methods We present our method of minimally invasive semitendinosus reconstruction for the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> using one para-midline and one midline incision. Results The first incision is a 5 cm longitudinal incision, made 2 cm proximal and just medial to the palpable end of the residual tendon. The second incision is 3 cm long and is also longitudinal but is 2 cm distal and in the midline to the distal end of the tendon rupture. The distal and proximal <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> stumps are mobilised. After trying to reduce the gap of the ruptured <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon,</b> if the gap produced is greater than 6 cm despite maximal plantar flexion of the ankle and traction on the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> stumps, the ipsilateral semitendinosus tendon is harvested. The semitendinosus tendon is passed through small incisions in the substance of the proximal stump of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon,</b> and it is sutured to the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon.</b> It is then passed beneath the intact skin bridge into the distal incision, and passed from medial to lateral through a transverse tenotomy in the distal stump. With the ankle in maximal plantar flexion, the semitendinosus tendon is sutured to the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> at each entry and exit point Conclusion This minimally invasive technique allows reconstruction of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> using the tendon of semitendinosus preserving skin integrity over the site most prone to wound breakdown, and can be especially used to reconstruct the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> in the presence of large gap (greater than 6 centimetres). </p...|$|R

PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 31 year-old man operated for <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture. The Ethibond suture was used for primary repair. The patient attended to polyclinic with the complaints of swelling and discharge around the operation site four months after operation. A mass around distal portion of the <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> was detected. The granulomatous tissue was excised. Inside the mass Ethibond suture was detected. On histopathologic examination, typical findings of the foreign body reaction were observed. No microorganism was cultivated in the tissue culture.

In tendon repairs generally nonabsorbable sutures are used. The Ethibond is nonabsorbable, braided suture. In the literature, granuloma formations secondary to the suture materials such as polygylactine and braided polyethylen–polyester after <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> repair were reported but granuloma secondary to the Ethibond is very rare.

These results {{seem to support}} IHM as a valid option in <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture, though the clinical implications of the various repairs were not studied. Many minimally invasive approaches, including for the Kakiuchi technique, have been described in literature for <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> repair. IHM suture in vivo can also be performed minimally invasively.|$|R
