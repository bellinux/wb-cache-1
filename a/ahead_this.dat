5|$|Pellew too {{was on his}} {{way back}} to Brest in Indefatigable, {{accompanied}} by Amazon under the command of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds. While the rest of the Channel Fleet had been pursuing the French without success, Pellew had had his ships refitted and resupplied at Falmouth so that both frigates were at full complement, well armed and prepared for action. At 13:00 on 13January, the British ships were approaching the island of Ushant in a heavy fog when they spied another ship through the gloom <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> ship, clearly much larger than either of the British vessels, was the Droits de l'Homme. At the same time, lookouts on the French ship spotted the British, and Lacrosse was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to engage the enemy. He knew that his ship was far larger than either of his opponents, but had earlier spotted sails to westwards he believed to be British and thus considered himself outnumbered and possibly surrounded. British records show that no other British vessels were in the vicinity at the time and it is likely that Lacrosse had seen the French ships Révolution and Fraternité returning to Brest from Bantry Bay. In addition, Lacrosse was concerned by the increasing gale and rocky lee shoreline, which posed a considerable threat to his over-laden vessel, which was already damaged from its winter voyage and carried a demi-brigade of the French Army and Humbert, neither of which could be placed at risk in an inconsequential naval action.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel slowly {{moved up}} the field, running {{eleventh}} on lap 18, only to spin a lap later at turn seven, falling back to 16th. He subsequently complained about a flat spot on his tyre, but continued without pitting. On lap 20, Sergio Pérez made a pit stop for new tyres and a front wing adjustment. Since the stop took longer than expected, he rejoined just before Sainz, Jr., who used the momentum to pass Pérez into turn one. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Bottas were racing for sixth place. On lap 24, Bottas attacked around the outside into turn two, sticking to the inside line at the following corner, where Räikkönen did not back away {{and ran into the}} front-left of the Williams, breaking his own rear-right suspension and forcing him to retire on the spot, while Bottas was able to carry on. Rosberg came in for his scheduled pit stop on lap 27, while Hamilton waited two laps to follow suit, trying to get <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> proved unsuccessful, as he rejoined behind Rosberg after his stop on lap 29. On lap 35, Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Carlos Sainz Jr. for ninth, who ran wide and kept his position. After his team radio informed him that he had done so by going off track, he handed the position to Pérez. Sebastian Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 37 and rejoined in between the two Mercedes of Rosberg and Hamilton, albeit a lap down. He was told to let Hamilton go by as well some laps later.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} the ridge turns {{abruptly}} {{to the south of}} east and after losing roughly 66 feet (20m) again it rises to a broad, rounded, unnamed grassy swelling with a height of about 2,428 feet (740m). A north-east shoulder of this swelling ends with steeper gradients on all sides and a scattering of broken crags <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> shoulder was named Birkett Fell in 1963, but it has just 6½ feet (2m) prominence above the ridge it terminates.|$|E
25|$|The highly {{anticipated}} match {{took place}} on 4 July at Dalymount Park. The first half was an entertaining battle between both sides and in the 43rd minute, Dean Kelly scored to put Rovers ahead. Early on in the second half, Ryan McEvoy scored to level the tie. After many good chances from both sides, the match was forced to enter into Extra time. In the 124th minute of extra time, Kevin Feely got a goal to put Bohemians <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> goal was enough to separate the sides and thus, eliminated Shamrock Rovers from the competition.|$|E

25|$|The longest {{successful}} post-war breakaway by {{a single}} rider was by Albert Bourlon in the 1947 Tour de France. In the stage Carcassone-Luchon, he stayed away for 253km. It was one of seven breakaways longer than 200km, the last being Thierry Marie's 234km escape in 1991. Bourlon finished 16m 30s <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> {{is one of the}} biggest time gaps but not the greatest. That record belongs to José-Luis Viejo, who beat the peloton by 22m 50s in the 1976 stage Montgenèvre-Manosque. He was the fourth and most recent rider to win a stage by more than 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{well-documented}} attack {{happened in}} the Spring of 1867. Ranchers Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving, together with their cowboys, attempted to drive their livestock around Comancheria in the trail {{now known as the}} Goodnight–Loving Trail. During the journey, Loving had to separate from the group to scout <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> proved to be fatal as Loving and his ranch hand were soon attacked by 200 armed Comanche warriors patrolling the border. Loving made his last stand in the Pecos River to allow his cowboy to get help. Although Loving managed to escape the onslaught, he was mortally wounded and died soon after. Goodnight on the other hand, also had to face raids along the way, once being wounded during an attack together with another fellow cowboy. These attacks affected the booming Texas economy. By the end of the 1860s, the Comanches had driven much of the livestock businesses out of West Texas.|$|E
25|$|Celtic were 4–0 up away at St Mirren at half time {{in their}} final fixture. Thus the under-performing players in the Hearts {{dressing}} room at half time {{would have had the}} sobering news they would likely have to deliver a result at Dens Park. Substitute Albert Kidd forced Hearts to concede a corner kick with seven minutes remaining. The in-swinging corner was touched on and fell to Kidd who put Dundee <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> was the first goal Hearts had conceded from a corner all season. Hearts now needed an equaliser to win the title. However Kidd went on a run with the ball from the halfway line down the right wing beating two Hearts players. After then playing a one-two with a teammate {{on the edge of the}} Hearts box he finished emphatically to score a second with four minutes left. Dundee won 2–0. This combined with Celtic winning 5–0 against St Mirren meant the top two clubs finished the season on the same number of points. Hearts lost out to Celtic by a goal difference of three. Had goal difference been the rule in 1965 Hearts would have been champions; had goal average still applied in 1986, they would have won the league. Hearts lobbying after the league loss in 1965 cost them dear in 1986.|$|E

Evans and Aspinall's duties were to drive the van while on tour, and {{to set up and}} test the equipment. Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> was in winter, so the group had to lie {{one on top of the}} other in the back with a bottle of whisky and try to stay warm in the freezing temperatures; something McCartney later referred to as a [...] "Beatle sandwich".|$|E
500|$|On December 23, 1994, the Republic of Kiribati {{announced}} {{a change of}} time zone for the Line Islands, to take effect January 1, 1995.

Caroline Island now {{is at the same time}} as the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time Zone), but one day <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> move made Caroline Island both the easternmost land in the earliest time zone (by some definitions, the easternmost point on Earth), and one of the first points of land which would see sunrise on January 1, 2000 — at 5:43a.m., as measured by local time.|$|E

Etherington then won a bronze medal in the women's downhill skiing, and [...] silver in the slalom and the super combined. After winning a silver medal in the super-G visually impaired event on 14 March 2014, she and Powell became Great Britain's most successful female Winter Paralympians, and the first Britons to win four medals at one Paralympics. However, they pulled out of the giant slalom, which was {{on the day of the}} Sochi 2014 Closing Ceremony.

500|$|The British {{eventually}} {{caught up}} with the French ships at 10:00 the following morning, identifying them as the two large frigates [...] and , and the smaller [...] Persanne, fired the first shots at 12:30, off the coast of Pelagosa (Palagruža); an hour later Alceste and Pomone exchanged shots from their bow and stern guns respectively. Alceste began to overhaul Pomone at 13:40 and fired a broadside into her while simultaneously spreading more sail in the hope of catching Pauline, a little further <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> plan was thwarted though when a shot from Pomone brought down Alcestes main topmast, slowing her suddenly. When Active arrived at 14:00 and also started firing into Pomone, Pauline was obliged to come about to protect her now out-gunned colleague. Just after 15:00 the British sloop, Kingfisher appeared on the horizon and Pauline, now in danger of capture herself, disengaged and sailed off. Pomone struck shortly after. Unité which had set off in pursuit of Persanne, forced Persanne to surrender at 16:00 after a single exchange of broadsides.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first known}} idea {{to build a}} canal between the River Mersey and the River Trent was put forward in 1755, though no action was taken at that time.

If his plan had gone <b>ahead,</b> <b>this</b> would have been the first modern canal constructed in England.

2500|$|Tryon {{was placed}} on half pay after {{promotion}} to commander in October 1860. In June 1861 he was selected to become second in command of HMS Warrior, the world's first ocean-going iron-hulled armoured battleship. Warrior was still under construction, so temporarily he was appointed to Fisguard. Warrior's sister ship [...] was a year later in entering service, but in November 1862 the two ships carried out speed trials, where Warrior was deemed to be the faster. Although the ships' armour was considered impregnable {{at the time they}} were constructed, they immediately instigated an arms race between armour and gun designers which continued up to World War II, where each successive ship had to have more of each to remain <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> meant that despite her initial claim to invulnerability, she rapidly became obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|In Boston, Massachusetts, in September 2007, an {{outreach}} to homeless people {{was established in}} the Boston Common, after some arrests and shootings, and in anticipation of the cold winter <b>ahead.</b> <b>This</b> outreach targets homeless people who would normally spend their sleeping time on the Boston Common, and tries to get them into housing, trying to skip the step of an emergency shelter. Applications for Boston Housing Authority were being handed out and filled out and submitted. This is an attempt to enact by outreach the Housing First initiative, federally mandated. Boston's Mayor, Thomas Menino, was quoted as saying [...] "The solution to homelessness is permanent housing". Still, this is a very controversial strategy, especially if the people are not able to sustain a house with a proper community, health, substance counseling, and mental health supportive programs.|$|E
2500|$|All Nizārī Ismā'īlīs today accept His Highness Prince Shah Karim Al-Husayni, the Aga Khan IV {{as their}} Imām-i-Zaman (Imam of the Time).

Karim succeeded his grandfather Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah Aga Khan III as Imām in 1957, aged just 20, and still an undergraduate at Harvard University. He {{was referred to as}} [...] "the Imam of the Atomic Age". The period following his accession can be characterized as one of rapid political and economic change. Planning of programs and institutions became increasingly difficult due to the rapid changes in newly emerging post colonial nations where many of his followers resided.
