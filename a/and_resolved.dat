5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este. Paulucci met, {{during one of}} his Italian licence periods, Carlo Felice in Turin, <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to do whatever he can to help him. Paulucci's later efforts at the Russian court were indeed essential in stopping the Austrian ambitions at the Verona's congress. Memoring these good services, the King Carlo Felice invited Paulucci in Piedmont in 1829, and the two started a close friendship.|$|E
5|$|Congress tabled {{the draft}} of the {{declaration}} on Monday, July 1 <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> itself into a committee of the whole, with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence. John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the Articles of Confederation. John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.|$|E
5|$|Many Samians were {{appalled by}} the actions of their generals at Lade, <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces of Samos, {{returned}} to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily, and took with them the Milesians who had managed to escape from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Most of Caria now surrendered to the Persians, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.|$|E

5|$|Mayor McKune met on July 27 {{with representatives}} of the Brotherhood of Trainmen. Following a meeting of the railway strikers, the firemen and brakemen agreed to return to work at their {{previous}} wages. Shortly thereafter, the mill workers returned to work, with assurances from W. W. Scranton. The miners, however, denounced the concession <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to continue the strike.|$|E

The works opened on 1 May 1979. The Jubilee line platforms were closed on 20 November 1999, following the extension of the Jubilee line where it was diverted to Westminster and onwards south of the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{episode of}} the {{television}} series Veronica Mars premiered on UPN on September 22, 2004. It was written by series creator Rob Thomas, and directed by Mark Piznarski. Set in the fictional town of Neptune, the pilot introduces Kristen Bell as the title character, a high-school student moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father. Two separate mysteries are presented in the episode, which are explored throughout the season <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> in the final and penultimate episodes.|$|E
5|$|The war had {{shattered}} Pound's {{belief in}} modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own {{future as a}} poet. He had only the New Age to write for; his relationship with Poetry was finished, The Egoist was quickly {{running out of money}} because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's Ulysses, and the funds for The Little Review had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to move to Paris.|$|E

In terms of recovering a sense of agency (in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and military authorities alike), the desire to do (and be seen to do) something was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better.|$|E

Three of the regulars in the second season were written out of the series, two new characters were introduced and two others were upgraded from recurring roles. The third season received generally mixed critical reviews compared to previous seasons.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{his studies}} in 1793, Rowan moved to Lexington, Kentucky and read law under former Kentucky Attorney General George Nicholas. He was {{admitted}} to the bar in May 1795 and commenced practice in Louisville. Rowan struggled financially during his early years as a lawyer. Nelson County judge Atkinson Hill took an interest in Rowan, furnishing him with money to expand his law library and taking him as a business partner. In order to earn some money, Rowan accepted an appointment as a public prosecutor, but after securing a felony conviction against a young man in his first case, he was so troubled that he resigned the office <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> never again {{to play the role of}} prosecutor. For the remainder of his career, he always represented defendants. An advocate of education, Rowan allowed several prominent young law students to study in his office, including future U.S. Treasury Secretary James Guthrie, future Supreme Court Justice John McKinley, and future Kentucky Governor Lazarus W. Powell.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, Prescott {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} a legal career because of the continued deterioration of his eyesight, <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to devote himself to literature. Although he initially studied a wide range of subjects, including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, American history, classics and political philosophy, Prescott came to focus on Italian poetry. Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as Dante's Divine Comedy and Boccacio's Decameron. His first published works were two essays in the North American Review—both discussing Italian poetry. The first of these, published in 1824, was titled Italian Narrative Poetry, and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart's Don Giovanni. Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte's fifty-page argument in the North American Review of July 1825. Da Ponte published the criticisms as an appendix to his translation of Dodley's Economy of Human life, which resulted in Prescott noticing them rather late.|$|E
5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} the issue <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but {{should not be}} allowed to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E
5|$|Leopold's {{decision}} to surrender was seized {{on by the}} British and French press who blamed him for the military situation. The Belgian government met in Paris on 26 May and invoked Article 82 of the Constitution, declaring the monarch unable to reign (dans l'impossibilité de régner), <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to continue the fight against Germany. The following day, Pierlot held an important meeting with the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, in which the French premier called for the Belgian government to publicly denounce the King and his surrender. Following the meeting, Pierlot gave a radio speech denouncing the King whom he accused of acting unconstitutionally and in sympathy with the Germans. Before being broadcast, Pierlot's speech was heavily edited by the French minister Georges Mandel to ensure a position favorable to the French. The denunciation of the King, who was popular across most strata of Belgian society {{and supported by the}} church, led to a big loss of public support and alienated Pierlot from his supporters and party.|$|E

5|$|The Third Convention met on July 17, 1775, also at St. John's Church, after Lord Dunmore {{had fled}} the capital (following the {{rejection}} of North's resolution) and taken refuge on a British warship. Peyton Randolph continued {{to serve as the}} President of the Convention. The convention created a Committee of Safety to govern as an executive body {{in the absence of the}} royal governor (Dunmore). Members of the committee were Edmund Pendleton, George Mason, John Page, Richard Bland, Thomas Ludwell Lee, Paul Carrington, Dudley Digges, William Cabell, Carter Braxton, James Mercer, and John Tabb. The convention also divided Virginia into 16 military districts <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to raise regular regiments. The convention ended August 26, 1775, while the Committee of Safety would continue to meet and govern between Convention sessions.|$|E
5|$|The {{postwar period}} saw {{considerable}} deflation; {{the shortage of}} labor and materials during the war had led to much higher wages and prices, and in the postwar economic readjustment, wages were cut heavily. In Chicago, employers in the building trades attempted a 20%wage cut; when this {{was rejected by the}} unions, a lockout followed. Both sides agreed to submit the matter to a neutral arbitrator, and settled on Landis, who agreed to take the case in June 1921. By this time, Landis was Commissioner of Baseball, and still a federal judge. In September, Landis issued his report, cutting wages by an average of 12.5%. To improve productivity, he also struck restrictions on machinery which saved labor, established a standardized overtime rate, <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> jurisdictional conflicts between unions. The labor organizations were not completely satisfied, but Landis's reforms were adopted in many places across the country and were credited with reviving the building industry.|$|E
5|$|Under his uncle's guidance, O'Neill {{joined the}} St George Cricket Club, in the Sydney Grade competition. He {{steadily}} moved {{up through the}} grades and broke into the first grade side {{at the age of}} 16. Sensing his potential, the club's selectors informed him that regardless of form, he would play the full season, which allowed him to be uninhibited in his batting. He made 108 in seven innings. The next season, he was out 12 times leg before wicket in 15 innings, and run out in the other three. O'Neill attributed his failures to over-aggressiveness <b>and</b> <b>resolved</b> to improve his patience. In the second match of the new season, the 17-year-old O'Neill made his first century. With all five state selectors onlooking, he made 28 in the next match and was called into the state squad.|$|E
