The algorithm is extremely efficient so that computation of the induced surface currents via the physical optics approximation dominates the computer time required to compute a radiation pattern.

Rock voids are essentially small cracks, {{and serve as}} the location from which a crack can propagate if the rock is placed in tension. If ice accumulates in a pore asymmetrically, the ice will place the rock in tension in a plane perpendicular to the ice accumulation direction. Hence the rock will crack <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> perpendicular to the direction of ice accumulation, which is effectively parallel to the surface.|$|E

5000|$|In fluid dynamics, a gravity {{current is}} a {{primarily}} horizontal flow in a gravitational field that {{is driven by}} a density difference, hence gravity currents also sometimes being referred to as [...] "density currents". When a gravity current propagates <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> of neutral buoyancy within a stratified ambient fluid, it {{is known as a}} Gravity Current Intrusion. Typically, the density difference is small enough for the Boussinesq approximation to be valid. Gravity currents can be either finite in volume, such as the release from a dam break, or continuously supplied from a source, such as in doorway or lava flows.|$|E
50|$|A screw {{dislocation}} {{is much harder}} to visualize. Imagine cutting a crystal <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> and slipping one half across the other by a lattice vector, the halves fitting back together without leaving a defect.This {{is similar to the}} Riemann surface of the complex logarithm.If the cut only goes part way through the crystal, and then slipped, the boundary of the cut is a {{screw dislocation}}. It comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes in the crystal lattice (Figure C). Perhaps the closest analogy is a spiral-sliced ham. In pure screw dislocations, the Burgers vector is parallel to the line direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we apply}} a general {{framework}} for building complex whole-body control for highly redundant robot, and we propose {{to implement it}} for visually-guided grasping while walking on a humanoid robot. The key idea is to divide the control into several sensor-based control tasks that are simultaneously executed by a general structure called stack of tasks. This structure enables a very simple access for task sequencing, {{and can be used}} for task-level control. This framework was applied for a visual servoing task. The robot walks <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>planed</b> path, keeping the specified object in the middle of its field of view and finally, when it is close enough, the robot grasps the object while walking.

50|$|Dislocation creep {{takes place}} {{due to the}} {{movement}} of dislocations through a crystal lattice. Each time a dislocation moves through a crystal, part of the crystal moves one lattice point <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> relative {{to the rest of}} the crystal. The plane that separates both parts and along which the movement takes place is called a slip plane. To allow the movement, all ionic bonds along the plane have to be broken. If all bonds were broken at once, this would require so much energy that dislocation creep would only in theory be possible. When it is assumed that the movement takes place step by step, the breaking of bonds is immediately followed by the creation of new ones and the energy required is much lower. Calculations of molecular dynamics and analysis of deformed materials have shown that deformation creep can be an important factor in deformation processes, under certain circumstances.|$|E

In the course of disassembly, {{it was possible to}} observe breaks, cuttings, metal tenons, and dowel holes which suggested that in antiquity, a more compact, three-dimensional pyramidal grouping of the three figures had been used or at least contemplated. According to Seymour Howard, both the Vatican group and the Sperlonga sculptures [...] "show a similar taste for open and flexible pictorial organization that called for pyrotechnic piercing and lent itself to changes at the site, and in new situations". [...] The more open, planographic composition <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> used in the restoration of the Laocoön group, has been interpreted as [...] "apparently the result of serial reworkings by Roman Imperial as well as Renaissance and modern craftsmen".
