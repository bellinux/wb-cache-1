40|$|Introduction: Child {{abuse is}} a serious problem {{worldwide}} and can be difficult to detect. Although children who experience the consequences of abuse will probably be treated <b>at</b> an <b>emergency</b> <b>department,</b> detection rates of child abuse <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> remain low. OBJECTIVE: To identify effective interventions applied <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> that significantly increase the detection rate of confirmed cases of child abuse. DESIGN: This review was carried out according to the Cochrane Handbook. Two reviewers individually searched Pubmed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL for papers that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Fifteen papers describing interventions were selected and reviewed; four of these were finally included and assessed for quality. In these studies the intervention consisted of a checklist of indicators of risk for child abuse. After implementation, the rate of detected cases of suspected child abuse increased by 180 % (weighted mean in 3 studies). The number of confirmed cases of child abuse, reported in two out of four studies, showed no significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> to increase the detection rate of cases of confirmed child abuse are scarce in the literature. Past study numbers and methodology have been inadequate to show conclusive evidence on effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|As a {{significant}} number of patients diagnosed with transient ischemic attack (TIA) <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> are at risk to develop TIA or cerebral vascular accident (CVA), several {{attempts have been made to}} figure out a predictive method to detect those at higher risk of such attacks. We aimed to evaluate the role of ABCD 2 scoring which includes age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, diabetes mellitus, and duration of symptoms in predicting short term outcome of the patients presenting with TIA. One hundred consecutive patients visited between 2009 and 2010 in Hazrat Rasoul Akram Hospital and diagnosed with TIA were enrolled and their ABCD 2 scores were registered. The incidence of death, CVA, or TIA during the first week after the attack was recorded. Eleven patients suffered new TIA/CVA after 1 week. Sensitivity and specificity of ABCD 2 score for predicting CVA/TIA at cut-off point of 4 were 72. 7 % and 52. 8 %, respectively. At the same cut-off point for ABCD 2, positive and negative predictive values were 16 % and 94 %, respectively. Our results show that although patients with ABCD 2 score greater than 4 were more likely to develop recurrent TIA/CVA in short term, those with lesser score still harbour a considerable risk for TIA/CVA. Though ABCD 2 as an easily applicable tool is very helpful in management of TIA patients <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department,</b> but it should not be the only measure to rely on in our decision making...|$|E

40|$|This report {{finds that}} {{ambulances}} in New South Wales wait longer <b>at</b> hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> today {{than in previous}} years. Executive summaryBackgroundThe Ambulance Service of New South Wales {{plays an important role}} in our health system. Its paramedics provide frontline emergency care to the community. They treat sick and injured patients at the scene of an emergency, and if necessary, take them to hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>departments.</b> However ambulances sometimes get delayed at hospitals. Most often it is because paramedics are unable to move their patient into a bed in the <b>emergency</b> <b>department.</b> When this happens they wait with their patient on the ambulance stretcher until a bed becomes available. There are many causes of ambulance delays. Increasing demand for hospital services, both emergency and inpatient care, can limit hospital capacity and cause overcrowding in the <b>emergency</b> <b>department,</b> particularly during winter. The Ministry of Health reports that since 2005 - 06 <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> presentations have grown at almost three times the population rate. And ambulance arrivals have grown more, at over four times the population rate. Furthermore, there are often patients in the <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> who are waiting for beds to become available in hospital wards. This limits the number of beds in the <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> making it harder for paramedics to off-load their patients when they arrive. It is important that paramedics spend as little time as possible <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> so they can respond to other triple-zero calls in the community. Even a five minute delay might mean the difference between life and death for someone waiting for an ambulance. The Ministry of Health, Ambulance Service, and Local Health Districts acknowledge the problem and have put a number of strategies in place to reduce delays. A key aim of the Minister for Health’s 2012 ambulance reforms, Reform Plan for NSW Ambulance, is to release ambulances more promptly. NSW Health requires hospitals to off-stretcher or transfer 90 per cent of ambulance patients into their care within 30 minutes. The total time spent by ambulance crews <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> is called turnaround time, and also includes the time spent by paramedics getting ready to respond to the next job. This audit assessed whether there are effective strategies in place to reduce the time spent by ambulance crews <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments.</b> We answered the following questions:do NSW Health’s strategies to reduce ambulance delays <b>at</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> free up ambulances to respond to other incidents?do the Ambulance Service’s demand management strategies limit the number of patients it takes to emergency departments?To help us answer these questions we analysed key performance data and reviewed statewide policies and procedures relevant to this issue. We interviewed over 100 staff across six hospitals and five ambulance sector offices to get their views on ambulance delays and observe how strategies to reduce delays work in practice. We also examined approaches in other jurisdictions. ConclusionWe found that ambulances wait longer <b>at</b> hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> today than in previous years. Each day the Ambulance Service loses an average of 18 ambulances on the road due to hospital delays greater than 30 minutes, potentially costing $ 13. 6 million annually to replace. This is an increase from six ambulance crews seven years ago. NSW Health has never met its target to offload 90 per cent of ambulance patients in 30 minutes. Therefore initiatives to reduce delays have had limited impact statewide. However the results for individual hospitals varied. In 2011 - 12 just over a quarter of NSW hospitals met the off-stretcher target. Others did not meet the target, but recently improved performance. Therefore strategies put in place by some hospitals to reduce delays are working. We found that the Ambulance Service’s demand management strategies limit the number of patients transported to <b>emergency</b> <b>departments.</b> However these strategies are not used to their full potential. There is further scope for the Ambulance Service to reduce unnecessary transports to hospitals...|$|R
