In most developed countries that had raised their fund for ICT investment, it resulted that the productivity has increased within their construction industry. However, Malaysia is slowly adopting ICT in construction industry compare to the other countries. Therefore, this research is to study how the ICT assist in the construction industry and whether it can help in achieving project success. It’s also evaluate the factors of ICT applications to see what are the factors that influence ICT implementation. A construction company in Malaysia was chosen to be a case for study. There are totally eight interviewees selected from the high level management of the construction company. The research shows that the factors affecting the ICT implementation include individual, organizational, and technological level factors. Besides that, the result shows that the types of the ICT adopted by the company are covering the electronic communication system, documentation and <b>accounting,</b> <b>quantity</b> surveying, architectural/engineering design and drawing, and also project planning and tracking. The results also show that the ICT can assist in achieving construction project success by meeting the criteria, which are time, cost, quality, scope and customer satisfaction. As a conclusion, ICT is one of the key determinants of the project success. The possibility of the project success will increase if the ICT implementation practices are effective in the construction industry. This study can provide the baseline information for those who want to apply ICT in the construction industr...|$|E

However, production experienced {{a sharp drop}} in the 1970s, falling to 4,512 tons in 1980. In 2004, production was estimated at 2,400 tons. Coffee of comparatively poor quality is grown in northern Río Muni, along the Cameroon border. The preindependence production of 8,959 tons in 1967 fell to 500 tons in 1978; the decline was mainly caused by forcible transfer of coffee farmers to the Bioko cocoa plantations. Coffee production was an estimated 3,500 tons in 2004.

40|$|The Solvency II {{directive}} {{has introduced}} a specific so-called risk-neutral framework to valuate economic <b>accounting</b> <b>quantities</b> throughout European life insurance companies. The adaptation of this theoretical notion for regulatory purposes requires {{the addition of a}} specific criterion, namely the market-consistency, in order to objectify the choice of the valuation probability measure. This paper aims at pointing out and fixing some of the major risk sources embedded in the current regulatory life insurance valuation scheme. We compare actuarial and financial valuation schemes. We then address first operational issues and potential market manipulation sources in life insurance, induced by both theoretical and regulatory pitfalls. For example, we show that calibrating the interest rate model in October 2014 instead of December 31 st 2014 generates a 140 %-increase in the economic own funds of a representative French life insurance company. We propose various adaptations of the current implementations, including product-specific valuation scheme, to limit the impact of these market-inconsistencies...|$|R

This goal has been challenged by many factors inuencing energy prices and costs such as developments in global energy markets, the EU ETS and the promotion of renewables. Analysing energy costs (prices times quantity) instead of prices has the advantage of taking into <b>account</b> <b>quantity</b> adjustments. However, it does not allow for monitoring the burden which energy costs pose on firms. For this purpose, both the European Commission and the Energy Expert Commission of the German Government recommend using real unit energy costs, defined as energy costs as fraction of value added. We develop an input-output based (real unit) energy cost accounting framework and study the trends in Germany and the EU between 1995 and 2011. We find that many of the unveiled developments are not adequately represented in the political debate, especially with regard to indirect costs (via energy embodied in intermediate inputs), which are more diffcult to assess. Indirect energy costs are on the rise, are larger than direct costs in many industries, are increasingly imported and amplify the asymmetric impacts of legal exceptions available to energy-intensive industries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{selection}} of suppliers and the determination of order quantities to be placed with those suppliers are important decisions in a supply chain. In this research, a non-linear mixed integer programming model is presented to select suppliers and determine the order quantities. The model considers the purchasing cost which takes into <b>account</b> <b>quantity</b> discount, the cost of transportation, the fixed cost for establishing suppliers, the cost for holding inventory, {{and the cost of}} receiving poor quality parts. The capacity constraints for suppliers, quality and lead-time requirements for the parts are also taken into account in the model. Since the purchasing cost, which is a decreasing step function of order quantities, introduces discontinuities to the non-linear objective function, {{it is not easy to}} employ traditional optimization methods. Thus, a heuristic algorithm, called particle swarm optimization (PSO), is used to find the (near) optimal solution. However, PSO usually generates initial solutions randomly. To improve the PSO solution quality, a heuristic procedure is proposed to find an initial solution based on the average unit cost including transportation, purchasing, inventory, and poor quality part cost. The results show that PSO with the proposed initial solution heuristic provides better solutions than those with PSO algorithm only...|$|R

Not only are Bulgarian scientists improving the already existing models, but they also aim at developing their own original models {{as a result of the}} analysis of the development of the tourism sector under the present conditions in Bulgaria. The present article aims at drawing the attention of the readership to three Bulgarian models for competitiveness, which comprise the main sections of the analysis of competitiveness (model 1 : regional level, model 2 : municipal level, model 3 : fi rm level). The foregoing models involve either analysis of the quantity indicators, or analysis of the quality indicators or analysis of both the quantity and quality indicators. The application of the models results in defi ning general comparative indicators of competitiveness. The article is focused on the prospects for including the measurement of the weight of each of the quantity indicators through the application of the value-based method while measuring the general comparative indicators taking into <b>account</b> <b>quantity</b> indicators as well.
