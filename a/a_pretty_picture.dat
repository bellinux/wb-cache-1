60|$|Irene was {{standing}} by the piano; she had taken off her hat and a lace scarf she had been wearing, so that her gold-coloured hair was visible, and the pallor of her neck. In her grey frock she made <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>picture</b> for old Jolyon, against the rosewood of the piano.|$|E
60|$|When {{she reached}} Harding's camp, Hester sat sewing in the sun.

60|$|Laurie did {{not read}} all this while {{he watched her}} feed the peacocks, but he saw enough to satisfy and {{interest}} him, and carried away <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> little <b>picture</b> of <b>a</b> bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene.|$|R
60|$|Betty had {{not taken}} her eyes off him from his first word.

60|$|It was the mare.

60|$|All {{this was}} most sweet news to Mr. Caryll. He found that {{between himself and}} his {{half-brother}} there lay an even deeper debt than he had at first supposed, and already acknowledged. In the delicious contemplation of Hortensia in tears beside him stricken all but {{to the point of}} death, he forgot entirely his erstwhile scruples that being nameless he had no name to offer her. In imagination he conjured up the scene. It made, he found, <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>picture.</b> He would smoke upon it.|$|R

60|$|Not then, while I {{waited for}} her return with palpitating heart, but {{afterwards}} in calmer moments, and when Monica had become <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>picture</b> in the past, did I compose the following lines.

60|$|Eph kept up {{a glorious}} fire, and superintended the small boys, who popped corn and whittled boats on the hearth; while Roxy and Rhody dressed corn-cob dolls in the settle corner, and Bose, the brindled mastiff, lay on the braided mat, luxuriously warming his old legs. Thus employed, they made <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>picture,</b> these rosy boys and girls, in their {{homespun}} suits, with the rustic toys or tasks which most children nowadays would find very poor or tiresome.|$|E
60|$|That was her beginning; and {{the poor}} {{harebell}} was {{to get into a}} hot- house, where they wanted to turn her into a tall stately campanula, and she went through a great deal from the gardeners.

60|$|In {{the grand}} {{concluding}} scene she was, however, all {{that could be}} wished.
