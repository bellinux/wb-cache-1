50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1946 and was {{completed}} {{before the end}} of 1947 when the first families began to move in. The external construction utilized corrugated sheet steel for roofs and siding while the portions which contacted the ground were covered with an 3/16” thick <b>asbestos</b> <b>shingle</b> which measured 2’ x 4’. Provisions of the lease agreement between the housing authority and the forest preserve undoubtedly called for preservation of foliage and natural drainage patterns. No trees were allowed to be cut and the diagonal drainage swale ditch that divided the acreage was to remain unchanged.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hotel was}} {{originally}} known as [...] "Bucks Tavern" [...] {{which was a}} one-acre site where it was then changed to [...] "Rogers Tavern" [...] during the Revolutionary War.

Following 1919, it was used as apartment residences upstairs and various stores in the bottom part of the structure until it was abandoned in the late 1980s. Some of the types of commercial businesses were a bank, sweet shop and meat market. Following this time, the structure was unused until it was torn down over 10 years later. The hotel was torn down to make room for a parking lot for the Marlboro Township fire department.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Jesse Andrew Home is a two story Greek Revival {{structure}} {{located on}} the south side of West Lafayette, near the Purdue University campus. The home is basically an ell-shaped structure with a gable roof; a small, hip-roofed wing, possibly a later addition, projects from the rear facade. Constructed as a single-family residence in 1859, this structure was altered to provide two apartment units sometime in the 1930s. The main (east) facade of the home is a gable end wall three bays in width. On the ground floor level, the two southernmost bays contain two-over-two, double-hung windows with entablature hood molds. The third bay has been modified from the original configuration and now contains two separate entry doors, to provide private access to each of the apartments. A large wooden porch dating from the 1880s protects the ground floor level of this facade; this porch features square columns with molded capitals supporting a flat roof with a wide frieze decorated with dentils and a cyma recta cornice. The porch roof also serves as a deck for the second floor, and features a balustrade with simple square balusters and corner posts. On the second floor, the two exterior bays contain double-hung windows similar to those on the ground floor. The middle bay, located slightly south of center, originally contained a window, but was converted into a doorway in the 1880s to provide access to the porch roof deck. A raking cornice and frieze with returns decorates the gable area, and a triangular attic vent is located just below the gable peak. Window and cornice detailing throughout the rest of the house is similar to that employed on the main facade. The interior of the house was slightly modified when the house was divided into apartments in the 1930s. The walnut balustrade of the main stairway was removed and the stair enclosed with a partition wall in order to provide privacy for the upstairs apartment; the balustrade has been discovered in storage in the attic. The endwall fireplaces were also sealed at this time and remain inoperable. <b>Asbestos</b> <b>shingle</b> siding was applied to the exterior of the home sometime in the 1950s. The present owners, who purchased the home from the Andrew family in 1982, have recently completed a major renovation of the structure. Several termite-damaged structural members were replaced, and other floor joists were braced with concrete block piers. The roof decking was repaired and a new roof installed. Repairs were also made at this time to the porch, windows, side door, exterior moldings, and various other elements of the home." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Asbestos</b> <b>shingles</b> are roof or wall <b>shingles</b> {{made with}} <b>asbestos</b> cement board.
