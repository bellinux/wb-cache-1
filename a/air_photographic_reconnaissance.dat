[...] The next month it left Key Field for the New York Port of Embarkation and on 7 March sailed on the SS Marine Dragon. It landed at Le Havre, France, in the European Theater of Operations shortly before the surrender of Germany. The squadron joined Ninth Air Force in France.

2500|$|In August 1948, the United States Air Force (USAF) {{established}} the 32nd Composite Wing, which was activated by Far East Air Forces {{the same month}} at Kadena Field, Okinawa {{as part of the}} implementation of the Wing Base reorganization of the USAF, replacing the 316th Bombardment Wing and various support elements. In October, the wing also replaced the 71st Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, which had become a paper unit attached to the wing. [...] The wing had no operational group, but the 23d Reconnaissance Squadron of the 5th Reconnaissance Group and the 31st Reconnaissance Squadrons of the 71st Tactical Reconnaissance Group, both very long range <b>photographic</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> units, were attached to the wing for operations. [...] The wing mission was to provide the Thirteenth <b>Air</b> Force with <b>photographic</b> <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and search and rescue support. The wing, along with its 23d and 31st Reconnaissance Squadrons, used Boeing B/FB-17 Flying Fortresses, Boeing RB-29 Superfortresses, and Curtiss C-46 Commandos to accomplish this mission until the Air Force inactivated the wing in 1949 [...] and replaced it as the host wing at Kadena with the 6332nd Station Wing ...|$|R

50|$|Operating about 30 {{miles east}} of Saipan, Fanshaw Bay {{launched}} antisubmarine patrols, combat <b>air</b> patrol, and <b>photographic</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> flights as well as raids on Japanese positions {{to pave the way}} for the invasion on 15 June. During an attack by five enemy aircraft on that day, Fanshaw Bay saved herself from a torpedo by prompt maneuvering, but two days later in a melee of raids from all sides which included about 70 Japanese planes, Fanshaw Bay was struck by a bomb, after her antiaircraft guns and fighter planes had splashed many of the attackers. The bomb penetrated the after elevator and exploded in midair above the hangar deck, killing 14 and wounding 23. Fires broke out, and the fire main was ruptured, flooding several compartments aft. In just under an hour the damage was brought under control, but Fanshaw Bay listed 3° to port and settled 6 feet by the stern. She transferred Rear Admiral Bogan to a destroyer, and sailed for Pearl Harbor for battle damage repairs.|$|R
