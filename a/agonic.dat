50|$|Magnetic {{variation}} is different {{depending on the}} geographic position on the globe. The Magnetic North Pole is currently in Northern Canada and is moving generally South. A straight line {{can be drawn from}} the Geographic North Pole, down to the Magnetic North Pole and then drawn straight down to the equator. This line is known as the <b>agonic</b> line, and the line is also moving. In the year 1900, the <b>Agonic</b> line passed roughly through Detroit and then was East of Florida. It currently passes roughly west of Chicago, IL, and through New Orleans, LA. If a navigator is located on the <b>agonic</b> line, then Variation is zero. Magnetic North Pole and the Geographic North Pole appear to be directly in line with each other, while the navigator is located on the <b>Agonic</b> line. If a navigator is East of the <b>agonic</b> line, then the {{variation is}} westward. Magnetic North appears slightly west of the Geographic North Pole. If a navigator is West of the <b>Agonic</b> Line, then the Variation is Eastward. The magnetic North Pole appears to the East of the geographic North Pole. The further the navigator is from the <b>agonic</b> line, the greater the variation. The local magnetic variation is indicated on NOAA Nautical Charts {{at the center of the}} compass rose. The Magnetic Variation is indicated along with the year of that Variation. The annual increase or decrease of the Variation is also usually indicated. So that the Variation for the current year can be calculated.|$|E

50|$|In {{the study}} of the Earth's {{magnetic}} field, the term isogon or isogonic line refers to a line of constant magnetic declination, the variation of magnetic north from geographic north. An <b>agonic</b> line is drawn through points of zero magnetic declination. An isoporic line refers to a line of constant annual variation of magnetic declination.|$|E
50|$|By convention, {{declination}} {{is positive}} when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative {{when it is}} to the west. Isogonic lines are lines on the Earth's surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called <b>agonic</b> lines. The lowercase Greek letter δ (delta) is frequently used as the symbol for magnetic declination.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{declination}} {{has been}} measured in many countries, including the U.S. The line of zero declination (the <b>agonic</b> line) in North America {{runs from the}} North Magnetic Pole through Lake Superior and southward into the Gulf of Mexico. Along this line, true north {{is the same as}} magnetic north. West of the line of zero declination, a compass will give a reading that is east of true north. Conversely, east of the line of zero declination, a compass reading will be west of true north.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nano {{composites}} {{are widely}} used in medical sciences recently. Identification of chemical mutagens {{is an important issue}} in drug safety. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate mutagenicity and antibacterial activity of various generations of poly (amid amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers and <b>agonic</b> acid poly (amid amine) (PAMAM) Nano composite G 2 on enteric pathogenic bacteria. Materials and Methods: Disc diffusion method, MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) determination were performed for antibacterial activity survey. Mutagenic properties were determined by Ames assay. Results: Various dilutions of PAMAM generations (G 2, G 3, G 4 and G 5) and <b>agonic</b> acid PAMAM Nano composite G 2 had antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. In Ames assay, reverted colonies were increased by PAMAM generations increasing. Moreover, reverted colonies Ames assay were lower when Nano composite G 2 was applied. Conclusions: PAMAM generations and <b>agonic</b> acid PAMAM Nano composite G 2 contain compounds with therapeutic potential and antibacterial characteristics, which can be used in medicine. Because some chemicals have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties, identification of these chemical is of great importance...|$|E

Very long series of measurements therefore play an important role. Here, we provide an updated series of geomagnetic declination in Paris, shortly after a very special occasion: its value has reached zero after some 350  years of westerly values.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the general guidelines of our doctorate thesis whose object of analysis {{will be a}} Council Federation of Parents’ Associations. The theoretical background {{is based on the}} integration and promotion of parental participation as an instrument of the education policies and its implications as a specific way of converting the relation between the public and private spheres and between the State and the public. The growing role of parents’ associations, as well as the ambiguous and defensive effects that they cause in the educational system, derive from the development of internal processes of communication and construction of meaning, constituting themselves in an autonomous and self-referencing manner. However, the discourse, semantics and very agenda of the parental association movement shows a proactive and collaborative partnership with the needs emerging out of the political system, such as the needs of legitimisation and strategies of regulation of political decision makers.

40|$|Attachment theory, {{with its}} roots in ethology, has {{provided}} a powerful, biologically based map for understanding mother infant interactions and how they influence development across the lifespan. This paper draws on recent additions to other established, ethological theories of behavior, to propose an evolutionarily grounded model of psychological processes and behaviors in severely distressed relationships between mothers and their children (aged 3 - 12 years) where there is or has been maltreatment of the child by the mother. By exploring observed struggles for status, dominance and control as evolutionary adaptations {{to the problem of}} resource acquisition, these distressing relational patterns are seen as a vehicle to establish a form of stabilizing interpersonal equilibrium in fear based mother-child relationships. A particular focus is how the <b>agonic</b> mode of social relatedness (first recognised by Michael Chance in group-living primates) and the mammalian defensive strategy of appeasement can explain the complex and varied interactions documented between these mothers and their children. The implications for reconciling theoretical inconsistencies in the literature and for developing effective treatments for maltreating mothers and their children are discussed. We also note the potential role of the theoretical model in informing other clinical areas (such as working with domestic violence) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we explore the {{relationship}} between TWAIL scholarship and the universality of international law. In particular, we offer an account of this relation as the outcome of what we describe as TWAIL’s characteristic double engagement with the attitudes of both reform and revolution vis-à-vis international law and scholarship. In being thoroughly critical of the cornerstones of the established order, and yet engaged with the practice and operation of international law at the same time, TWAIL scholars have intimated {{in their search for}} justice, an idea of universality capable of accepting international law as an <b>agonic</b> project. To further its political engagement with the universal promise of international law, we suggest an explicit methodological turn for TWAIL scholarship that is attentive to international law as a material project. By paying attention to the daily operation of international law at the mundane, quotidian and material plane, we suggest that TWAIL can sharpen its analytical potential and generate at the same time, a ‘praxis of universality’. Such a praxis would be capable of troubling the constitution of places and subjects {{in the name of the}} international, whilst heightening our sensitivity to the numerous forms of resistance that are already at play as a particular normative project is being institutionalised and administered across the world...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the speech conditions constitutive for the staging of political disagreement (particularly as a means of understanding acts of protest). Rather than seeking to offer an explanation for various situations of protest, however, it aims to identify what, if anything, is unique or peculiar to such modes of address. Drawing on the resources of speech act theory, the chapter suggests a reading of ‘dissensual speech’ as a form of ‘unauthorised’ speech through which the ‘people’ appear, however, evanescently. It analyses the peculiarities of dissensual speech in the following ways: first, in terms of specifying its modes of utterance, which are identified with phatic and <b>agonic</b> modes of address and, second, in terms of its performative attitudes. In analysing the latter, I turn to Foucault’s notion of parrēsiastic speech in order to confront a paradox that arises with my reading of dissensual speech viewed in terms of ‘performatives’, since parrēsia—‘speaking truth to power’—is radically opposed to two fundamental rules that govern performatives and illocutionary forces: that they are conventional and that their enunciator must be authorised to use them. The chapter proposes a resolution to this contradiction by showing that an affinity exists between parrēsiastic speech and dissensual speech insofar as both entail ‘risk’ to the speaker in uttering a truth. The question then is whether it is possible to collectivise that risk, or whether parrēsia necessarily remains the speech of the individual martyr...|$|E

Abordaremos as implicações da questão judaica na teoria política arendtiana, na qual sobressai uma perspectiva agônica do poder, isto é, o poder não como lugar das forças anônimas, sistêmicas, reprodutoras do status quo, mas de fundação, resistência, civilidade e revelação dos homens como agentes.

40|$|Abstract: Canid {{herpesvirus}} 1 (CHV- 1) is {{a widespread}} pathogen of dogs and produces infertility, abortions and severe systemic disease in young puppies. Clinical data indicate the circulation of CHV- 1 among Brazilian dogs yet definitive diagnosis has rarely been accomplished. This article describes the clinicopathological findings of four independent cases/outbreaks of neonatal disease by CHV- 1 in Bulldog puppies followed by virus identification and genetic characterization. Three events occurred in a kennel holding dogs of different breeds at reproductive age (March 2013, October 2013 and April 2014). Puppies from three French or English Bulldog litters, aging 9 to 30 days were affected, presenting dyspnea, <b>agonic</b> breathing, pale mucous, abdominal pain and tension, evolving to death within about 24 hours. At necropsy, the puppies presented necrohemorrhagic hepatitis, multifocal and moderate necrohemorrhagic nephritis and fibrinonecrotic interstitial pneumonia. Virus isolation was positive in clinical specimens from one litter and CHV- 1 DNA was detected by PCR in tissues from all four cases. Virus-neutralizing assays with samples of the affected kennel revealed 9 / 12 adult animals with high antibody titers to CHV- 1. Nucleotide sequencing of glycoprotein B, C and D genes revealed 99 - 100 % of identity among the viruses and with CHV- 1 sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses of gC sequences showed a segregation of the samples, even among three isolates from the same kennel. These findings support CHV- 1 infection {{as the cause of}} disease and death in these dog litters, reinforcing the need for correct etiologic diagnosis, prevention and immunization against CHV- 1 in dogs from Southern Brazil...|$|E

For this purpose, 75 hamsters were inoculated with 0. 5 ml of virulent strain containing 30 - 40 leptospires by the microscopic field and the other 15 hamsters were held as the uninfected controls. Signs and symptoms (prostration, tachypnea, rufled hair, jaundice, and nasal, bucal and perineal hemorrage) were detected in all inoculated animals. The animals {{were killed in the}} <b>agonic</b> state of the illness, which were done through 4 th and 7 th day post inoculation.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test whether intraperitoneally injected sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) would mimic the pulmonary alterations induced by lethal peracute exposure to an atmosphere containing hydrogen sulfide. Groups of five Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to an atmosphere of either 2317. 6 +/- 547. 3 mg m- 3 H 2 S (H 2 S group) or no H 2 S (air group), or were injected intraperitoneally with a solution containing 30 mg kg- 1 sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS group) or saline solution (vehicle control). Rats of the air and saline groups were killed by cervical dislocation. All rats exposed to H 2 S or injected with NaHS died within 3 min; however, only rats exposed to H 2 S showed severe respiratory distress in the <b>agonic</b> phase preceding death. In addition, rats in the H 2 S group had a notable discharge of serous fluid from the mouth and nostrils. At necropsy, all rats in the H 2 S group had gross and histologic evidence of pulmonary edema characterized by massive extravasation of eosinophilic fluid into the bronchoalveolar space. In contrast, the lungs of rats injected with NaHS or saline or exposed to air were unaffected. It was concluded that the edematogenic effect of H 2 S in the lungs cannot be reproduced by injection of NaHS. The severity of lung edema induced by a peracute exposure to H 2 S was extensive enough to account for death.

40|$|Using the spherical {{harmonic}} coefficients {{defining the}} International Geomagnetic Reference Field Models for the 21 epochs 1900 to 2000, the geographic {{locations of the}} dip equator in different longitudes were computed. It is shown that the migratory trends in the dip equator are widely different in the American, African and Indian sectors. The largest change is seen over 30 °W to 40 °W while there is practically no secular movement over 100 years in the 30 °E longitude. It is seen that the geographic longitude of the dip equator farthest away from the geographic equator in the American sector shows a westward migration {{at the rate of}} ~ 0. 2 °/year which compares favorably with the average westward drift of the non-dipolar field discussed in the literature. The distance between the magnetic center of the eccentric dipole and the Earth’s center, the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly (SAGA) center and the migration of the local minimum of the dip equatorial longitude in the American center are all linearly related. In addition, the westward drift in the <b>agonic</b> line over the geographic equator in the American sector, indicative of the contributions from non-dipolar terms, is also linearly related to the three parameters. As the observed location of the dip equator in the American sector closely matches the model-based one, it is suggested that identification of the geographic longitude of the dip equator in the American zone based on a survey over a small area can provide useful information on several other parameters of the westward drift of the geomagnetic field...|$|E
30|$|Forecasting of {{magnetic}} field {{change has been}} attempted in many forms over the past 300 years since Halley’s observation of westward motion of the <b>agonic</b> line in the Atlantic hemisphere (Halley, 1692). Currently, a widely used forecast of the average secular variation (SV) is produced for the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model every five years. The IGRF models are an agreed set of field coefficients representing snapshots of the magnetic field at defined times {{and a set of}} coefficients forecasting the average SV for a period of five years into the future. The tenth generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field model (IGRF- 10) covered the period from 2005.0 to 2010.0 (Macmillan and Maus, 2005). For the IGRF- 10 SV model, the methods to estimate the average SV over its five year lifetime used a combination of polynomial extrapolation of satellite data and linear prediction filters applied to observatory data. However, these approaches do not invoke any particular physical arguments to support the assumption that the field coefficients will continue to change linearly (which, of course, they do not). Lowes (2000) succinctly outlines the issues faced in forecasting of SV, noting that an understanding of the fluid processes within the core might be useful in producing more accurate predictions. Since 2005, a number of forecasting techniques have been developed to incorporate physical approximations. For example, Sun et al. (2007) and Fournier et al. (2007) both outline frameworks in which observed magnetic field data can be assimilated into physical magnetohydrodynamic models. More recently, Kuang et al. (2009) have assimilated historical field data into numerical dynamo models to investigate if improvements can be made to forecast field models.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} {{reflection on}} the democratic relationship between corporeality, recognition, representation and democratic togetherness, this doctoral thesis follows {{in the tradition of}} practical philosophy (Iris Marion Young, Bonnie Honig, Philip Pettit, James Tully) to explore and deconstruct the contemporary challenges of late modern democracy in the face of demands by indigenous peoples, minority nations and various intra-national (nonterritorial) groups for effective enjoyment of democratic self-government. An underlying assumption of this thesis is that the emancipatory potential of liberal equality as a political ideal, although rhetorically onmipresent within Anglo-American democracies, has been exhausted and in fact redeployed in ways that diminish the capacity of minorized members of the political community to advocate for their liberty and to protect themselves against domination and oppression from within democratic institutions themselves. Cross-pollinating the insights of diversity feminism and republicanism, this thesis proposes alternative epistemological foundations of representative democracy to expose the political nature of various struggles of/over the interlocking conditions of late modern political corporealization. Specifically, it re-constructs a late modern convention of self-representation as co-authority that is grounded in an anti-essentialist and performative conception of political subjectivity (diversity feminism), and an <b>agonic</b> and institutional conception of political liberty and self-government (republican liberty). These alternative foundations (diversity, liberty, and co-authority) lay the nonnative groundwork for democratic institutional reforms aimed at the re-construction of a late modern praxis of radical representative democratic corporealpolitiks that presumes the necessity of heterogeneous institutional outlets of contestation that performatively politicize and democratize asymmetrical power relations between historically minorized/dominant corporealities. Positing the critical interdependence of personal freedom and collective freedom as realized democratically through free institutions and practices, the thesis advances a democratic defense of guaranteed thresholds of institutional self-representation for a broader diversity of late modern struggles of/over corporealization that liberalism has often excluded as apolitical or pre-political. Albeit in nonnative solidarity with inter-national struggles for democratic self-determination, it probes the specificities of intra-national minorities inflected by the corporealpolitiks of sex, gender, race, religion, ethnicity, mother tongue, and disability, given that their "right to exit" the political association is both epistemologically and practically absent...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenges}} {{presented to}} society by rapid urbanisation {{and climate change}} directly call for the broad synthetic spatial knowledge that lies {{in the province of}} architecture and urban design. Curiously, {{in the face of such}} challenges, the discipline of architecture seems to have entered a period of self-imposed myopia. In recent years, architecture has lost ground in many of those areas that once lay within the disciplinary realm. The societal value ascribed to the spatial imagination is diminishing, and with it the value of operating as a generalist. The familiar rise of international multidisciplinary firms illustrate a shift towards regarding planning and urban design as a problem-solving activity. The multidisciplinary model privileges the instrumental knowledge of engineering, and the managerial routines of traditional planning and project management. The model depends not on synthesising different sorts of knowledge from within the discipline, but rather the consensually mute operation of diverse specialists contributing to the demands of a particular project without overarching synthetic authorship. Furthermore, the closed system thinking of specialists maps very easily to the emergent tasks of late capitalist environments: the establishment of privatised and invisible infrastructures and controlled, risk-managed versions of the city, with many claims made upon it. If the model of multidisciplinary consultancy is a consequence of increasing corporate power, the weakening of the social contract matches the fragility of the concept of a vital civil society, the health of which would be indicated by participatory infrastructures and negotiative, <b>agonic</b> public space. From these observations the thesis argues for a generalist spatial design practice, supported by evidence of a particular and distinctive way of working. Holbrook&# 039;s work from the last two decades provide illustration of how the architectural imagination can engage positively with highly complex situations, and establish a bridge between the scales of strategy, planning and infrastructure and the concrete experience of the resulting environment.  Case studies are drawn primarily from the work of Holbrook&# 039;s practice 5 th Studio, working in East Anglia, England - one of the densest concentrations of overlaid infrastructure, historic and natural conservation anywhere. 5 th Studio has always regarded its approach as prospective and propositional and the research has validated and formalised its spatially entrepreneurial mode of inventing projects. The thesis concludes with an interview with the critic Ellis Woodman and a transcribed discussion with Shelley MacNamara of Grafton Architects...|$|E
40|$|In 1997 the Department of Health {{announced}} {{their intention to}} reform the Mental Health Act 1983. Since publishing the first Green Paper in 1999, the proposed reforms have received major criticisms from virtually all 'stakeholders' in mental health care. This PhD offers a genealogy of (bio) political action {{during the process of}} reforming the Act. The focus is on the period from August 2002 to September 2003, with particular reference to the activities of self proclaimed 'service users' and 'survivors' in two independent protest groups: 'NO Force' and. Protest Against the Bill'. The methodological premise (chapters two and three) is born from something of a lacuna in post-Foucauldian governmentality studies which, although well posited, offer {{little in the way of}} advancing a genealogy of governmental contestation. My focus is twofold. Firstly, by advancing a (post) Foucauldian understanding of resistance - which, with respect to power, 'always comes first' (Deleuze 1988) - I aim to develop the relationship between 'biosociality' or 'life politics' (Rabinow 1996, Rose 200 I) and mental health law. Secondly, I seek to draw on the correlate of governmentality: agonism, taking it into governmental contestations in broadly 'liberal democratic' societies by focusing on what Tully (1999) calls "the free <b>agonic</b> activities of participation" (171). Together these advance my focus on agonistic 'games of truth' enacted during the reform process. This general methodological premise underpins my three major fieldwork chapters. Chapter four focuses on agonism in actu through the process of demonstrating (in the form of a protest march undertaken by No Force). Beginning with, as Barry (200 I) notes, the techniques and technologies "of telling and witnessing the truth" (176), I move through, and beyond Foucault, with respect to the importance of mediatisation and circulation in agonistic truth telling today. Chapter five expands on my understanding of life politics to offer a genealogy of the imbrications between human rights (law) and mental health (law) during the reforms. Here recourse to (human) rights is posited neither simply as a (dangerous) 'empty category' nor exemplary of an expanding 'vital life' but having a distinct genealogy emerging from problematisations in mental health law. Finally, in chapter six, I tum to the use of testimony from 'psychiatric survivors'. This form of biopolitical truth speech is not only illuminating of agonistic games of truth but also of that which is other to it (those who do not speak) and that what falls at the limits ofbiopolitical truth speech (for those who cannot speak) ...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{study of}} the French anarchist's Pierre-Joseph Proudhon {{reflections}} (1809 - 1865) and of the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta (1853 - 1932) on the government's exercise using an approach of the governmentality studies that tries to demonstrate {{the existence of a}} problem "anarchy and governmentality" described as a positioning critical front to the power in which the government's analysis is taken starting from government's practices and in which the politician's intelligibility is analyzed in terms of relationships of force and the government in technology terms. Looks for not only to approximate the anarchical conception of the governmentality studies, but to point the possibility of an origin relationship among the governmentality studies and the anarchy sketched by Proudhon in the century XIX. Demonstrates as the notion of force had for the anarchy a breaking effect with the classic interpretations of the theory of the sovereignty right and with his operation in the political rationality of the century XVII and in the socialisms of the centuries XIX and XX. Retakes the inaugural configuration given by Proudhon in that it analyzes the government starting from the exercise of the government power, showing as his reflection took as larger problem, {{in the second half of}} the century XIX, the one of turning evident the rationality of the power and the practices of the authority beginning crystallized in domains of objects of the political economy. Retakes the reflection of Malatesta and the problem of the dominance, of the organization and of the government and affirms the need to move away his conception about the conceptions liberal's dominance and Marxist, noticing as, for Malatesta, the problem put in the end of the century XIX and beginning of the century XX was it of the beginning of the organization and of their connections with the dominance. It proposes another physiognomy to the revolution in the anarchism out of the model of the French Revolution. It approaches a dimension <b>agonic</b> in the anarchism that always does an activity of the government dangerous through which reverse-values some themes of the debate. It studies the propaganda by the deed, they evolution for the anarco-terrorism and the elaboration of Malatesta about the uses of the violence and his opposition to the terror as principle. It treats of the labor movement and of the syndicalism proposing the pauperism as reality on which rests the political subversion and the anarchy as tension element that impels the labor movement for the revolution. It retakes the problem of the fascism as inseparable to the problem of the First War, approaching the controversy that put in opposed fields Kropotkin and Malatesta. Studies the phenomenon of the fascism through the indistinguishable critic, of the analytical point of view, that Malatesta accomplished of the democracy and of the dictatorship, with which rejected the liberal strategy of checking assertiveness to the right State, it denounced in the dictatorship the effectiveness in waking up democracy desires, and he saw in the democracy the element that turned it more dangerous and more liberticidal than the dictatorship: it continues it capacity of strategic renewal of the authority beginning. Estudo das reflexões do anarquista francês Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809 - 1865) e do anarquista italiano Errico Malatesta (1853 - 1932) sobre o exercício do governo utilizando uma abordagem dos estudos em governamentalidade que procura demonstrar a existência de uma problemática "anarquia e governamentalidade" descrita como um posicionamento crítico frente ao poder no qual a análise do governo é tomada a partir das práticas de governo e no qual a inteligibilidade do político é analisada em termos de relações de força e o governo em termos de tecnologia. Busca não somente aproximar a concepção anárquica dos estudos em governamentalidade, mas apontar a possibilidade de uma relação de procedência entre os estudos em governamentalidade e a anarquia esboçada por Proudhon no século XIX. Demonstra como a noção de força teve para a anarquia um efeito de rompimento com as interpretações clássicas da teoria do direito de soberania e com o seu funcionamento na racionalidade política do século XVII e nos socialismos dos séculos XIX e XX. Retoma a configuração inaugural dada por Proudhon em que analisa o governo a partir do exercício do poder governamental, mostrando como sua reflexão tomou como problema maior, na segunda metade do século XIX, o de tornar evidente a racionalidade do poder e as práticas do princípio de autoridade cristalizados em domínios de objetos da economia política. Retoma a reflexão de Malatesta e o problema da dominação, da organização e do governo e afirma a necessidade de afastar sua concepção sobre a dominação das concepções liberal e marxista, percebendo como, para Malatesta, o problema colocado no final do século XIX e começo do século XX foi o do princípio da organização e de suas conexões com a dominação. Propõe uma outra fisionomia à revolução no anarquismo fora do modelo da Revolução Francesa. Aborda uma dimensão agônica no anarquismo, que faz do governo uma atividade sempre perigosa por meio da qual re-valoriza alguns temas do debate. Estuda a propaganda pelo fato, sua evolução para o anarco-terrorismo e a elaboração de Malatesta sobre os usos da violência e sua oposição ao terror como princípio. Trata do movimento operário e do sindicalismo, propondo o pauperismo como realidade sobre a qual repousa a subversão política e a anarquia como elemento de tensão que impulsiona o movimento operário para a revolução. Retoma o problema do fascismo como indissociável ao problema da Primeira Guerra, abordando a polêmica que colocou em campos opostos Kropotkin e Malatesta. Estuda o fenômeno do fascismo através da crítica indistinta, do ponto de vista analítico, que Malatesta realizou da democracia e da ditadura, com a qual rejeitou a estratégia liberal de conferir positividade ao Estado de direito, denunciou na ditadura a eficácia em despertar desejos de democracia, e viu na democracia o elemento que a tornava mais perigosa e mais liberticida que a ditadura: a contínua capacidade de renovação estratégica do princípio de autoridade...|$|E
