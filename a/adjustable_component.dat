40|$|Trace {{explosive}} detection is {{the primary}} way for quick and easy sampling of various surfaces in a check-point environment, e. g. an airport. The swabs used for commercial explosive detectors, such as ion mobility spectrometers, are made of various materials. The difficulty in collection and analysis of explosive traces is that the swabs must be effective at adsorbing as well as desorbing materials, i. e. pickup from the surface and release into the detection device. This dichotomy results in a tradeoff for development of new swabs. Generally, desorption {{is considered to be}} the more desirable property; therefore, Teflon is one choice for commercial swabs. It would be ideal to develop a swab with both enhanced adsorption and desorption. One way to accomplish this is to apply an electrostatic charge to commercial swabs. This enhances their attraction to explosive particles, but once the swab is placed in the inlet of commercial detection instrument, the charge is dissipated, and desorption of the particles into the instrument proceeds as usual. ^ Methods of generating electrostatically charge swabs was determined; triboelectric charging vs corona charging was compared examining magnitude of the charge, reproducibility and stability, and effects of humidity. The magnitude of charge necessary for enhanced collection of particles was evaluated using an electrostatic voltmeter to measure charge and various means to measure particle pickup. Corona charging was determined to be more effective. Enhancement of collection was judged by comparing results of corona charging swabs to those achieved by contact swabbing. Two variables were examined: the analyte and the substrate from which the analyte is removed. The swab material was Nomex. In each case but three, collection of an analyte by an electrostatically enhanced swab outperformed the traditional contact swabbing. Evaluation was determined by a rigorous quantification by mass spectrometry of the analyte picked up by the swab and the analyte remaining on the substrate after swabbing. When analytical protocol was not amenable to a particular analyte or substrate a commercial explosive trace detection instrument was used. It was found that the substrate morphology played a bigger role in pickup of analyte than the particular analyte. ^ In order to eliminate biological warfare agents, both heat and halides are used. Ideally, these agents would be destroyed without dispersing them. The approach to create a polymeric-sprayable matrix would allow dispersion of an iodine-producing pyrotechnic, without dispersing the biological weapon, and when initiated would produce both heat and iodine gas. This matrix will provide iodine vapor and a long-lasting flame, not an explosion, to control dispersion of the threat. ^ A two-part foam was formulated based on polyurethane chemistry, i. e. a diisocyanate combined with polyol to produce a urethane linkage. Each component of the foam (e. g. isocyanate, polyol, catalyst, blowing agent, surfactant) was experimentally adjusted to achieve the best foam based on expansion, structural integrity, and cell uniformity. Since the polyol is the most <b>adjustable</b> <b>component</b> in the foam, an investigation of commercial and synthesized energetic polyols was performed. The structures of the energetic polyols were verified by LC-MS and FTIR and characterized for heat flow by DSC. Once the structures of the energetic polyols had been proven, it was formulated into a polyurethane foam which was characterized for heat of decomposition, by SDT, for heat of combustion by bomb calorimetry, and structurally by FTIR. Documenting heat flow with SDT helped to determine that the structural modification increased heat release and lowered ignition temperature compared to the standard polyurethane foam. The formulated polyurethane foam was then tested for expansion against increased solids loading. When optimal solids loading was determined (3 Ì†e 70...|$|E

40|$|System {{adaptability}} is {{very important}} to current manufacturing practices due to frequent changes in the customer needs. Two basic concepts that can be employed to achieve system adaptability are flexible systems and modular systems. Flexible systems are fixed integral systems with some <b>adjustable</b> <b>components.</b> <b>Adjustable</b> <b>components</b> have limited ranges of parameter changes that can be made, thus restricting the adaptability of systems. Modular systems are composed of a set of pre-existing modules. Usually, the parameters of modules in modular systems are fixed, and thus increased system adaptability is realized only by increasing the number of modules. Increasing the number of modules could result in higher costs, poor positioning accuracy, and low system stiffness in the context of manufacturing applications. In this thesis, a new idea was formulated: a combination of the flexible system and modular system concepts. Systems developed based on this new idea are called adaptive systems. This thesis is focused on adaptive robot systems. An adaptive robot system is such that adaptive <b>components</b> or <b>adjustable</b> parameters are introduced upon the modular architecture of a robot system. This implies that there are two levels to achieve system adaptability: the level where a set of modules is appropriately assembled and the level where <b>adjustable</b> <b>components</b> or parameters are specified. Four main contributions were developed in this thesis study. First, a General Architecture of Modular Robots (GAMR) was developed. The starting point was to define the architecture of adaptive robot systems to have as many configuration variations as possible. A novel application of the Axiomatic Design Theory (ADT) was applied to GAMR development. It was found that GAMR was the one with the most coverage, and with a judicious definition of adjustable parameters. Second, a system called Automatic Kinematic and Dynamic Analysis (AKDA) was developed. This system was a foundation for synthesis of adaptive robot configurations. In comparison with the existing approach, the proposed approach has achieved systemization, generality, flexibility, and completeness. Third, this thesis research has developed a finding that in modular system design, simultaneous consideration of both kinematic and dynamic behaviors is a necessary step, owing to a strong coupling between design variables and system behaviors. Based on this finding, a method for simultaneous consideration of type synthesis, number synthesis, and dimension synthesis was developed. Fourth, an adaptive modular Parallel Kinematic Machine (PKM) was developed to demonstrate the benefits of adaptive robot systems in parallel kinematic machines, which have found many applications in machine tool industries. In this architecture, actuators and limbs were modularized, while the platforms were adjustable {{in such a way that}} both the joint positions and orientations on the platforms can be changed...|$|R

5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. <b>Adjustable</b> <b>components</b> are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|R

Knowledge based configuration methods support the composition of complex systems from a set of <b>adjustable</b> <b>components.</b> However, there are two important prerequisites for a successful application of knowledge-based configuration in practice: (a) expressive knowledge representation languages, which are able to capture the complexity of various models of configurable products and (b) powerful reasoning methods which are capable of providing services such as solution search, optimization, diagnosis, etc. The Configuration Workshop aims to bring together industry representatives and researchers from various areas of AI to identify important configuration scenarios found in practice, exchange ideas and experiences and present original methods developed to solve configuration problems. The workshop continues the series of successful Configuration Workshops started at the AAAIâ€™ 96 Fall Symposium and continued on IJCAI, AAAI, and ECAI since 1999. During this time the focus of the events broadened from configuration approaches applied to traditional products such as cars, digital cameras, PC, telecommunication switches or railway interlock systems to configuration of software and services available on the Web.

40|$|Spray drift {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{pesticide}} contamination. For this reason, an accurate understanding of this phenomenon is necessary in order to limit its effects. Nowadays, spray drift is usually studied by using in situ collectors which only allow time-integrated sampling of specific points of the pesticide clouds. Previous research has demonstrated that the light detection and ranging (lidar) technique can be an alternative for spray drift monitoring. This technique enables remote measurement of pesticide clouds with high temporal and distance resolution. Despite these advantages, the fact that no lidar instrument suitable for such an application is presently available has appreciably limited its practical use. This work presents the first eye-safe lidar system specifically designed for the monitoring of pesticide clouds. Parameter design of this system is carried out via signal-to-noise ratio simulations. The instrument is based on a 3 -mJ pulse-energy erbium-doped glass laser, an 80 -mm diameter telescope, an APD optoelectronic receiver and optomechanically <b>adjustable</b> <b>components.</b> In first test measurements, the lidar system has been able to measure a topographic target located over 2 km away.

A racing car is a complex machine, featuring many <b>adjustable</b> <b>components,</b> used to influence the car's performance and tune it to a circuit, the prevailing conditions and the driver's style. A race team must continually monitor the car's performance and a race engineer communicates with the driver to decide how best to optimise the car {{as well as how}} to extract most from the driver himself. Analysis of acquired vehicle performance data is an intrinsic part of this process. This thesis presents an investigation into methods to aid the motorsport user's assimilation of acquired vehicle performance data. The work was directly prompted by personal experience and published opinion. These both find that the full potential of acquired data in motorsport is seldom realised, primarily because of the time available to analyse data with the resources available to a racing team. A complete solution including data management methods and visualisation tools was conceived here as a means of addressing these issues. This work focuses on part of the overall solution concept; the development of a visualisation application giving the user a detailed and realistic three-dimensional replay of a data set. The vehicle s motion is recreated from acquired data through a kinematic vehicle model driven by measured damper and ride height data. Ground displacement is computed from wheel speed and accelerometer measurements as well as a new optical sensor approach aiming to achieve better accuracy. This implements a two dimensional auto-correlation of doubly exposed ground images, calibrated to distance on the basis of an integrated ride height measurement.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{focuses on}} a {{simulation}} concept to visualize and to analyze outfitting processes in building engineering. A constraint-based simulation model is used to specify dependencies between outfitting tasks, availability of resources and required work spaces. Further, the model is used to specify conditions of transport processes, delivery dates as well as time and cost restrictions. By using a constraint-based simulation model practicable schedules can be generated and visualized simultaneously. For example, execution conflicts such as restricted work spaces are highlighted. Afterwards, the simulated and visualized results can be evaluated in terms of work and material flow organization, utilization of space and workerâ€™s efficiency. This constraint-based simulation approach guarantees a high flexibility.

40|$|An SOI {{precision}} {{voltage reference}} {{has been developed}} and verified that provides a buffered, low-noise output well suited for general purpose high temperature and/or wide temperature range applications. The reference provides 0. 3 % accuracy from 25 Â°C to 225 Â°C, with rms output noise of less than 5 ÂµV at 225 Â°C. This reference was designed {{for use as a}} reference source for high-resolution A-to-D converter. The reference is buffered to provide up to 5 mA source/sink capability and is <b>adjustable</b> via external <b>components</b> and a feedback pin. Associated with the reference on the same die are bias and utility functions. These include Proportional to Absolute Temperature (PTAT) current-mode and voltage-mode thermometer outputs and reference current sources. A wide variety of applications and temperature compensation schemes can be supported by this combination of functions in a single component. The reference uses lateral bipolar transistors fabricated in an SOI CMOS using the standard CMOS layout layers. This work has been performed within the Department of Energy DeepTrek Program with the participation of industry partners in a Joint Industrial Participant (JIP) program...|$|R
