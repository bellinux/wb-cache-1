5|$|Gregory Hines plays Tyrone Pike, a jazz saxophonist and Laura's boyfriend. Hines {{also studied}} Wolff to imitate his ticcing {{and develop the}} character. During filming, Hines {{committed}} himself to spending <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> as a Touretter; after being stared at by a taxi driver, Hines reflected {{that he had not}} considered how embarrassing the disorder could be. He also studied tapes of Alex Foster to learn how to finger the saxophone.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Churches {{and their}} {{calendars}} had great influence on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden {{for a full}} third {{of the year for}} most Christians. All animal products, including eggs and dairy products (but not fish), were generally prohibited during Lent and fast. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the Eucharist. These fasts were occasionally for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> and required total abstinence.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{also had}} an {{economic}} impact. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (AMEX) closed {{as a result of}} the storm. It was the first time in history that the NYSE closed for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> due to the weather, and the first time since 1918 that AMEX had done so. All commodity exchanges in New York City and the National Association of Securities Dealers also closed.|$|E
5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> of pursuit, {{the leading}} French ships made {{an attempt to}} cut off , {{trailing}} in the British rear. Cornwallis dropped back to support Mars, while Captain Robert Stopford of HMS Phaeton began making signals implying a British fleet was in sight. When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a British fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of a convoy of British merchantmen.|$|E
5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, keeping this intensity for nearly <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> and with a pressure drop to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western Gulf of Mexico. Shortly before landfall, a dry air mass in the western Gulf of Mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1877, {{residents}} of Ridgefield have remembered {{the battle with}} some form of anniversary ceremony every twenty-five years. <b>A</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> tribute was hosted at former Connecticut Governor Phineas C. Lounsbury's Town Street mansion {{in conjunction with the}} town's bicentennial celebration in 1908. The 150th anniversary affair in 1927 featured the publication of George Lounsbury Rockwell's History of Ridgefield, and the 200th anniversary was held a year early to tie in with America's bicentennial celebration in 1976. The bicentennial and 225th anniversary celebrations included re-enactments of the battle, for which portions of Town Street (now Main Street) were covered with dirt for sake of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day.</b> Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, at {{the urging}} of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{traveled}} with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E

60|$|But {{except in}} cases of unusual laziness or {{eccentric}} ambition, most men would elect to do <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day's</b> work for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day's</b> pay. For these, who would form the immense majority, {{the important thing is}} that ordinary work should, as far as possible, afford interest and independence and scope for initiative. These things are more important than income, as soon as a certain minimum has been reached. They can be secured by gild socialism, by industrial self-government subject to state control as regards the relations of a trade to the rest of the community. So far as I know, they cannot be secured in any other way.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} hiking trails around the hill; their {{entrance}} is usually marked by signboards. There {{is also an}} accessible waterfall. Trails range from the Hemmant Trail, a short walk, to the Pine Tree Trail, <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day's</b> trek.|$|R
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party's leader, was <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were {{to be taken care of}} by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 31 May Howe's fleet {{closed with}} the French, making {{full use of}} the {{advantage}} of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted. During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more. Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.|$|E

5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} was already <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling {{he lost his}} edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August, Nelson sent Lieutenant Thomas Duval from Zealous with {{messages}} to the government in India. Duval travelled across the Middle East overland via camel train to Aleppo and took the East India Company ship Fly from Basra to Bombay, acquainting Governor-General of India Viscount Wellesley with the situation in Egypt. On 12 August the frigates HMS Emerald under Captain Thomas Moutray Waller and HMS Alcmene under Captain George Johnstone Hope, and the sloop HMS Bonne Citoyenne under Captain Robert Retalick, arrived off Alexandria. Initially the British mistook the frigate squadron for French warships and Swiftsure chased them away. They returned the following day once the error had been realised. The same day as the frigates arrived, Nelson sent Mutine to Britain with dispatches, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, who had replaced Hardy after the latter's promotion to captain of Vanguard. On 14 August, Nelson sent Orion, Majestic, Bellerophon, Minotaur, Defence, Audacious, Theseus, Franklin, Tonnant, Aquilon, Conquérant, Peuple Souverain, and Spartiate to sea under the command of Saumarez. Many ships had only jury masts and it took <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August. On 16 August the British burned and destroyed the grounded prize Heureux as no longer fit for service and on 18 August also burned Guerrier and Mercure. On 19 August, Nelson sailed for Naples with Vanguard, Culloden, and Alexander, leaving Hood in command of Zealous, Goliath, Swiftsure, and the recently joined frigates to watch over French activities at Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>day</b> of work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon {{the women of the}} house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

25|$|Dinosaur fossils {{have been}} found in regions that were close to the poles at the {{relevant}} times, notably in southeastern Australia, Antarctica and the North Slope of Alaska.
