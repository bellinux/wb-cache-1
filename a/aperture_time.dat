40|$|Abstract — A {{number of}} {{recently}} reported CMOS line re-ceivers and downconversion mixers {{are based on}} sampling. A key component in these designs is the NMOS sampling switch. It can sample a very high bandwidth signal, several GHz for a 0. 8 -m transistor. We present an expression for the <b>aperture</b> <b>time</b> for an NMOS switch when the input has low swing. The switch can, under this condition, be modeled as a device that determines a weighted average over time of the input signal. The weight function is derived. The <b>aperture</b> <b>time</b> function shows that the maximum theoretical time resolution for a switch in 0. 8 -m standard CMOS is 21 ps (48 Gb/s). SPICE simulations agree with the theory. Transient two-dimensional (2 -D) device simulations do not contradict the predicted results. Experiments on a switch made in a 0. 8 -m standard CMOS process show successful sampling of every thirty-second bit of a 5 -Gb/s data stream.

40|$|Mapping the Moon's {{topography}} using Earth based radar interferometric measurements by the Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) {{has been}} done several times since the mid 1990 s. In 2008 we reported at this conference the generation of lunar topographic maps having approximately 4 m height accuracy at a horizontal posting of 40 m. Since then GSSR radar has been improved to allow 40 MHz bandwidth imaging and consequently obtained images and interferograms with a resolution of about 4 m in range by 5 m in azimuth. The long synthetic <b>aperture</b> <b>times</b> of approximately 90 minutes in duration necessitated a migration from range/Doppler image formation techniques to spotlight mode processing and autofocusing methods.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{bistatic}} synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) signal processing in the spaceborne/airborne configuration. Due to the extreme differences in platform velocities and slant ranges, the airborne system operates in the inverse sliding spotlight mode, while the spaceborne system works in the sliding spotlight mode to achieve a tradeoff between the azimuth scene size and azimuth resolution. Such a mode is generally called double sliding spotlight mode. In this configuration, the echoed signal has two characteristics. Firstly, both transmitter and receiver have very short synthetic <b>aperture</b> <b>times.</b> Secondly, the airborne platform operates with wide squint difference, while the spaceborne platform works in the small squint case. According to these two features, we use different Taylor expansions to address the slant range histories of transmitter and receiver. Based on the presented model, a two-dimensional space-variant bistatic point target reference spectrum (BPTRS) is derived. Furthermore, we linearize the BPTRS to derive the transfer function of the baseband scene. From the transfer function, the signal features of the spaceborne/airborne configuration become very clear. Using the transfer function, the two-dimensional inverse scaled Fourier transform (ISFT) is used to focus the bistatic signal in the spaceborne/airborne configuration...|$|R

The optimized comparator is incorporated into {{the construction of a}} 4 -bit quantizer of an ADC. The Gray-code output is converted into binary using COSL gates.

The performance of the comparator and the 4 -bit ADC are also evaluated with thermal noise incorporated into simulations. Beat frequency simulations and Fourier spectra are also used in the evaluation of the ADC performance. A fully functional 4 -bit ADC, with a maximum input bandwidth of 10 GHz for a clock speed of 20 GHz, was achieved through simulations. Beat frequency simulations revealed that the comparators have an input bandwidth greater than 19 GHz with sufficient dynamic range for an ADC of greater than 6 bits of resolution.

40|$|This {{work has}} shown that by using simple {{analysis}} techniques, such as the average Q-factor, one may employ asynchronous histograms to derive information that would otherwise require a complete optical receiver {{as well as a}} BER counter to estimate. More complex techniques, such as the decomposition of asynchronous histograms, allow handling signals that suffer from distortion {{to the point where the}} original signal format is unrecognizable. In addition, it has been shown that histogram comparison techniques either using theoretical histograms or reference histograms can be used to extract information on the signal under analysis. Some practical aspects on the design of asynchronous sampling systems for the acquisition of asynchronous histograms have been considered. In particular, the most demanding aspect has been shown to be the sampling <b>aperture</b> <b>time.</b> It has been shown that the <b>aperture</b> <b>time</b> of the sampling system conditions the performed measurement by restricting the noise or distorting the signal under analysis. As a consequence, compensation methods have to be used either by adjusting the performed measurement or by using reference histograms. In summary, the analysis of asynchronous histograms has survived the evolution of optical communications systems as an effective proposal for advanced optical performance monitoring thanks to its remarkable flexibility. Asynchronous histogram acquisition systems can be easily designed for very wide ranges of bit rates and arbitrary signal formats. An extensive set of simple and robust methods to analyze asynchronous histograms has been developed over the years, and application to novel modulation formats can be carried out with relatively little effort...|$|E
