5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E

25|$|The line on {{the section}} between Nuremberg and Bamberg meets the {{requirements}} of high-speed traffic as it is largely straight. It runs in the Regnitz valley <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straight line, particularly between Erlangen and Bamberg, and with curves with very large radii and can already be run largely at 160km/h. Between Fürth and Erlangen, there are some sharper curves, mainly between Fürth and Fürth-Unterfarrnbach,and north of Vach station (the underpass of the A73), and the speed is limited to 140km/h.|$|E

25|$|The {{last two}} Scuticariaare {{isolated}} in forests of Peru and Ecuador and {{are similar to}} each other. They are different from all other because of the proportions of floral segments. The labellum is much larger when compared to their sepals and petals than it is on other species. Moreover, their petals are striped of brown and {{much smaller than the}} sepals, showing a greater difference than it is found on the other species. From each other, they can be separated mostly by the shape of the labellum. Scuticaria salesiana presents more rounded intermediate lobe, and Scuticaria peruviana has it more rectangular, with the apex truncated, <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straight line.|$|E
25|$|Buxton {{was the son}} of Edward North Buxton, the {{conservationist}} {{and some}} time Member of Parliament for Walthamstow. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Buxton was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He was in the Cambridge University cricket team for four years and won a Blue in each year by appearing in the annual University Match against Oxford University. He was captain of the Cambridge team in the rain-ruined and drawn 1888 University Match. Immediately after that game, he was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval, one of the Gentlemen's less distinguished performances, with the game lost <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single day.|$|E
25|$|On June 24, 1941, tank {{units of}} the Red Army in Jonava were ordered to retake Kaunas. The rebels radioed the Germans for assistance. The units were bombed by Luftwaffe and did not reach the city. It was the first coordinated Lithuanian–German action. The first German scouts, {{lieutenant}} Flohret and four privates, entered Kaunas on June 24 and found it in friendly hands. A day later the main forces marched into the city without obstruction and <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parade fashion. On June 26, German military command ordered to disband and disarm the rebel groups. Two days later Lithuanian guards and patrols were also relieved of their duties.|$|E

500|$|George Finlayson, a {{representative}} of the British government who visited Gia Định in 1822, described Duyệt as a man who liked to dress plainly, <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner similar to his peasant constituents. Finlayson said that Duyệt [...] "has an intelligent look, and may be esteemed to possess considerable activity both of mind and body: his face is round and soft, his features flabby and wrinkled; he has no beard, and bears considerable resemblance to an old woman: his voice, too, is shrill and feminine." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1674, Thomas Shadwell re-adapted Dryden and Davenant as {{an opera}} {{of the same}} name, usually meaning a play with {{sections}} that were to be sung or danced. Restoration playgoers appear to have regarded the Dryden/Davenant/Shadwell version as Shakespeare's: Samuel Pepys, for example, described it as [...] "an old play of Shakespeares" [...] in his diary. The opera was extremely popular, and [...] "full of so good variety, that I cannot be more pleased <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> comedy" [...] according to Pepys. Prospero in this version {{is very different from}} Shakespeare's: Eckhard Auberlen describes him as [...] "reduced to the status of a Polonius-like overbusy father, intent on protecting the chastity of his two sexually naive daughters while planning advantageous dynastic marriages for them." [...] The operatic Enchanted Island was successful enough to provoke a parody, The Mock Tempest, or The Enchanted Castle, written by Thomas Duffett for the King's Company in 1675. It opened with {{what appeared to be a}} tempest, but turns out to be a riot in a brothel. The Mock Tempest has been catalogued as by Duffet and Shadwell or by Duffet, Shadwell, Dryden, and Shakespeare.|$|E

500|$|Days {{before the}} battle a {{telegraph}} cable was laid between Fortress Monroe, which overlooked Hampton Roads, and Washington. Washington was immediately {{informed of the}} dire situation after the initial battle. [...] Many were now concerned Virginia would put to sea and begin bombarding cities such as New York while others feared she would ascend the Potomac River and attack Washington. In an emergency meeting among President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary Welles and other senior naval officers, inquiries were made about Monitors ability to stop Virginias prospect of further destruction. When the temperamental Stanton learned that Monitor had only two guns he expressed contempt and rage as he paced back and forth, further increasing the anxiety and despair {{among members of the}} meeting. Assurances from Admiral Dahlgren and other officers that Virginia was too massive to effectively approach Washington and that Monitor was capable of the challenge offered him no consolation. After further deliberations Lincoln was finally assured but Stanton remained <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of terror and sent telegrams to various governors and mayors of the coastal states warning them of the danger. Subsequently, Stanton approved a plan to load some sixty canal boats with stone and gravel and sink them in the Potomac, but Welles was able to convince Lincoln at the last moment that such a plan would only prevent Monitor and other Union ships from reaching Washington and that the barges should only be sunk if and when Virginia was able to make her way up the Potomac.|$|E
500|$|The {{two most}} overtly [...] "political" [...] tracks on Phantom Power are [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] and [...] "Liberty Belle". [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] is about [...] "societies {{torn apart by}} war and the waste of human life". The track uses the {{vocabulary}} of the Falklands War (Tumbledown, Skyhawks etc.) but Rhys claims it is applicable to any war. [...] "Liberty Belle" [...] {{tells the story of}} two cartoon characters devised by Rhys, 'Liberty Belle' and 'Memory Lane', the former representing the [...] "bells of freedom", specifically the American Dream, and the latter representing [...] "history's harsh lessons" [...] which Liberty Belle has failed to learn. The song is told {{from the perspective of a}} [...] "bird living <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parallel universe to humans, oblivious to the gravity of the games which are being played around us", something which Rhys admits to feeling himself much of the time. [...] "Venus and Serena" [...] uses a story of a child who talks to his pet tortoises, Venus and Serena, as he can't communicate with his elders to make a similar point: that people feel alienated from their elected leaders. Both [...] "Out of Control" [...] and [...] "Slow Life" [...] feature regurgitated media buzzwords, with [...] "Out of Control's" [...] "flippant" [...] lyrics designed to create the feel of [...] "an over-dramatic theme to a current affairs programme". [...] "Bleed Forever" [...] deals specifically with the nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl disaster which fell over North Wales, allegedly causing an increase in incidents of leukaemia among children in the area.|$|E
500|$|Ringo and Donna later {{get back}} {{together}} and {{to prove that he}} loves her, Ringo proposes. In June 2010, it was revealed that the 6000th episode celebrations would see the wedding of Donna and Ringo. News.com reported that producers hoped that the wedding would [...] "recreate the magic" [...] of Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell's (Kylie Minogue) 1987 wedding. Robbie said she had [...] "big shoes to fill", but she was honoured to be working on her biggest storyline since she arrived. Clark said that Donna and Ringo had made the decision {{that they are going to}} be with each other for life and that they are [...] "going to be solid from now on". On the wedding day, Donna's car breaks down and she is forced to ride in the back of Lucas Fitzgerald's (Scott Major) truck. Donna walks down the aisle to Ringo's version of [...] "Suddenly", the original song played at Scott and Charlene's wedding. Clark added [...] "It's a perfect day, but I can't promise they'll live happily ever after." [...] Donna and Ringo became the 36th couple to get married on the show. A month later, Ringo is knocked down by Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) motorcycle and he dies. Donna is devastated and she stays in her room. Steph comes to visit her and as she is apologising, Donna gets up and hugs her. Of Donna's reaction, Robbie said [...] "Donna is <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of confusion and insists that the whole thing was an accident.

Using our playing {{as though it was}} a living sample." [...] A heavy feature on Innerspeaker is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a synth. Parker mentioned this by saying [...] "I had a few obsessions when recording Innerspeaker. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|During this period, {{increasing}} numbers accepted race. German officials and colonists in Rwanda incorporated these theories into their native policies. [...] The Germans believed the Tutsi ruling class was racially {{superior to the}} other native peoples of Rwanda because of their alleged [...] "Hamitic" [...] origins on the Horn of Africa, which they believed made them more [...] "European" [...] than the Hutu. The colonists, including powerful Roman Catholic officials, favored the Tutsis because of their taller stature, more [...] "honorable and eloquent" [...] personalities, and willingness to convert to Roman Catholicism, the colonist. [...] The Germans favored Tutsi dominance over the farming Hutus (<b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> feudalistic manner) and granted them basic ruling position.

The {{rewriting}} of the song was prompted by a letter from Gilbert to Sullivan dated 23 January 1887: [...] "I can’t help thinking that the second act would be greatly improved if the recitation before Grossmith’s song were omitted and the song re-set to an air that would admit of his singing it desperately – <b>almost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> passion, the torrent of which would take him off the stage at the end.
