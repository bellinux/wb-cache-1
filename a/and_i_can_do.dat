500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the will}} of Heaven, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing about it. [...] A state can be {{established}} anywhere on earth where there are people. [...] It only depends on how I govern it, and I am not fearful that the people would die.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "face book" [...] is {{a student}} {{directory}} featuring photos and basic information. In 2003, there were no universal online facebooks at Harvard, with only paper sheets distributed and private online directories.

[...] I think it’s kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it in a week." [...] In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website, known as [...] "TheFacebook", with the inspiration coming from an editorial in the Crimson about Facemash, stating that [...] "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many."

2500|$|Behind Godfrey's on-air warmth was a {{volatile}} and controlling personality. [...] He insisted that his [...] "Little Godfreys" [...] attend dance and singing classes, believing all should be versatile performers {{regardless of whether}} they possessed the aptitude for those disciplines. In meetings with the cast and his staff, he could be abusive and intimidating. CBS historian Robert Metz, in CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye, quoted Godfrey as having once told cast and staffers, [...] "Remember that many of you are here over the bodies I have personally slain. I have done it before <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it again." [...] He also demanded, though there was no contractual requirement, that his cast members refrain from hiring personal managers or booking agents. [...] He insisted his staff could handle all that. [...] Given the rise of the [...] "Little Godfreys" [...] from total obscurity due to their exposure on Godfrey's programs, no one was inclined to challenge him. [...] Despite his ability to bring in profits, CBS executives who respected Godfrey professionally disliked him personally, since he often baited them on and off the air, occasionally by name. This included CBS chairman William S. Paley.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] said FitzHoward. [...] "Of course {{he has a}} good deal of family interest. My cousin is to come in for St. Bungay at the next election, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better than remain here." ...|$|R
