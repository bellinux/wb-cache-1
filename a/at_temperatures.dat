This research consisted of a preliminary research and main research. Premilinary research conducted to make soy yakult and determine the best of shelf life of soybean yakult on temperature storage 10 oC, 28 oc and 35 oC. The main research was conducted to determine {{a decrease in the}} quality and shelf life of soybean yakult with the quality parameters used were acid total and bacteria total by using Arrhenius method. Preliminary research results indicate that soybean yakults which stored at 35 oC in organoleptic can be stored for 48 hours, <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> of 28 oC can be stored for 120 hours and <b>at</b> a <b>temperature</b> of 10 oCcan be stored for 240 hours. The main results of the research showed that soybean yakult which stored with Arrhenius method has a different shelf life based on acid total and bacteria total. Based on the acid total, soybean yakult shelf life <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> 10 oC is 10 days, <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> 28 oC is 3 days and <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> 35 oC is 1, 5 days.

The conclusion of this research is the best storage temperature of soybean yakult that is 10 oC because in that temperature storage has a decrease in the quality of soybean yakult least that has longer shelf time than temperature storage 28 oC and 35 oC.

5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents <b>at</b> <b>temperatures</b> ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C.

The principle of detailed balance says that in thermodynamic equilibrium every elementary process works equally in its forward and backward sense. Prevost also showed that the emission from a body is logically determined solely by its own internal state. The causal effect of thermodynamic absorption on thermodynamic (spontaneous) emission is not direct, but is only indirect as it affects the internal state of the body. This means that at thermodynamic equilibrium the amount of every wavelength in every direction of thermal radiation emitted by a body <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> T, black or not, {{is equal to the}} corresponding amount that the body absorbs because it is surrounded by light <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> T.|$|R
