2500|$|Road {{transport}} grew rapidly {{during the}} 1920s, {{stimulated by the}} cheap sale of thousands of war-surplus vans and lorries and the subsidised construction of new roads, which was mainly funded by local authorities. The revenues of the railway companies suffered because {{of the loss of}} freight to road haulage in particular. This was largely because the Government would not release the railways from their obligations as 'common carriers', which had been brought in the 19th century. It obliged railway companies to carry any cargo offered to it at a nationally <b>agreed</b> <b>charge,</b> which was usually well below a rate necessary to make the operation profitable for the railways. The intention had been to stop railway companies [...] "cherry picking" [...] the most profitable freight whilst refusing to carry less profitable freight. This had been a necessary measure when railways had had an effective monopoly over land transport. But with road competition encroaching, it put the railways at a disadvantage, because they had to subsidise unprofitable freight operations with profitable ones, which drove up charges.|$|E

40|$|Land {{and land}} use {{attributes}} have been quantitatively recorded from existing map and statistic sources for the 2858 10 x 10 km grid squares (cells) of the Ordnance Survey National Grid which contain land in Great Britain. 126 attributes are grouped in categories of physiography; climate; geology; soils;topography; land use; agricultural land classification; and conservation status. They provide the initial major component of a computer-stored land data set appropriate to national and regional scales of ecological assessment and resource evaluation. Standard statistics outputs supply complete or partial data for individual cells, or total and average values of required attributes for any group of cells. Map outputs display, list, and summarise data for cells which meet specifications of individual or combined attributes, for Great Britain as a whole, or for required regions. Recording of the initial data, their computer input and editing, {{and the availability of}} analysis and retrieval programmes, have completed the first phase of this data bank. Intended developments that are outlined include land classifications based on the data, correlations of land characteristics or classes with biological distributions already available at this scale, and extension and upgrading of the initial data set. Information from the data set can be supplied at <b>agreed</b> <b>charge...</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{credit card}} is a payment card issued to users ({{cardholder}}s) {{to enable the}} cardholder to pay a merchant {{for goods and services}} based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other <b>agreed</b> <b>charges.</b> The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. [...] In other words, credit cards combine payment services with extensions of credit. [...] Complex fee structures in the credit card industry may limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and help maximize industry profits. [...] Because of this, legislatures have regulated credit card fees.|$|R
25|$|The JQC <b>agreed</b> to drop <b>charges</b> after Williams {{tendered}} her resignation. She {{also signed}} a consent order prohibiting her from seeking judicial office, effective immediately.|$|R
25|$|An {{offender}} {{is usually}} {{charged with the}} most serious offences that can be established on {{the facts of the}} case. On representations being made by the offender's lawyer to the prosecuting authority, the Prosecution may <b>agree</b> to <b>charge</b> the offender with lesser offences provided that he or she agrees to plead guilty to the reduced charges.|$|R
50|$|After {{choosing}} a setting, the creators needed {{to choose a}} location. Early discussions centered on Barstow, California, then Kansas City, Missouri. They eventually turned to the East Coast and finally Boston. The Bull & Finch Pub in Boston, which was the model for Cheers, was chosen from a phone book. When Glen Charles asked the bar's owner, Tom Kershaw, to shoot exterior and interior photos, he <b>agreed,</b> <b>charging</b> $1. Kershaw has since gone on to make millions, licensing the pub's image and selling a variety of Cheers memorabilia. The Bull & Finch became the 42nd busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997. During initial casting, Shelley Long, who was in Boston at the time filming A Small Circle of Friends, remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in the city, {{which turned out to}} be the Bull & Finch.|$|R

5000|$|The term {{originated}} in mid-19th century England and {{is believed to}} be a corruption of [...] "continuation", [...] "continue" [...] or [...] "contingent". In the past on the London Stock Exchange, contango was a fee paid by a buyer to a seller when the buyer wished to defer settlement of the trade they had <b>agreed.</b> The <b>charge</b> was based on the interest forgone by the seller not being paid.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{man is a}} robber," [...] he went on, {{indicating}} the boatman, who had now shoved his oars {{into the water and}} was pulling alongside.

Twenty dollars for a half-hour's work! Think of it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{investigators}} {{considered a}} variety of causes, including a fight among the soldiers, an attack by religious extremists, and an assault by smugglers. The main version, however, was bullying. The sole survivor, Vladislav Chelakh, was the only ethnic Russian stationed at the post and investigators eventually surmised that the 19-year-old soldier, had been subjected to hazing. Chelah confessed to the crime a few days later. He later rescinded his confession, claiming it had been obtained under pressure. Chelakh was eventually charged with murder, theft, illegally obtaining and distributing of state secrets; embezzlement or extortion of weapons, ammo, explosive devices; illegal acquisition, transfer, sale, storage, transfer or carrying of weapons and explosive devices; intentional destruction or damaging of military equipment; desertion, violation of the housing's inviolability. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} life in prison at a penal colony, although his appeals are on-going. Chelah's mother maintains that lawyers have refused to defend her son and those who <b>agree</b> <b>charge</b> $2,000 a month, so she is planning an appeal to International Court in Belgium.|$|R

2500|$|In 1792, traders formalized their {{association}} with the Buttonwood Agreement which was {{the origin of the}} New York Stock Exchange. The idea of the agreement was to make the market more [...] "structured" [...] and [...] "without the manipulative auctions", with a commission structure.

5000|$|After {{the federal}} {{government}} <b>agreed</b> to <b>charging</b> Epstein on one count under state law, the prosecution convened a grand jury. Former chief of Palm Beach police Michael Reiter later wrote to State Attorney Barry Krischer to complain of the state's [...] "highly unusual" [...] conduct {{and asked him to}} remove himself from the case. The grand jury returned a single charge of felony solicitation of prostitution, to which Epstein pleaded not guilty in August 2006.|$|R
50|$|When the {{prosecution}} called Marietta Duarte {{to testify at}} the preliminary hearing, the defense objected because her testimony was hearsay and because a spouse could not testify against her husband. The judge <b>agreed</b> and the <b>charges</b> were dismissed.|$|R

Schindler and Stern create [...] "Schindler's List" [...] – a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.|$|R

50|$|While French doctors only earn about 60% of what American doctors make, their {{expenses}} are reduced because they pay no tuition for medical school (cost {{for a year}} range from €200 to 500 but students get paid during their internships in hospitals) and malpractice insurance is less costly compared with the United States (as all doctors subscribe to the same fund). The French National Insurance system also pays for a part of social security taxes owed by doctors that <b>agree</b> to <b>charge</b> the government-approved fees.|$|R
