5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might suggest a possible resolution.|$|E
5|$|Baird was elected, {{defeating}} Liberal candidate Lee Farnworth {{by about}} 5,000 votes. The Ottawa Citizen endorsed Baird in this campaign, <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> his political judgment had improved considerably since {{his tenure as}} a Harris cabinet minister. In December 2006 Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs who voted against reopening the national debate on same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|Former {{president}} Dmitry Medvedev of Russia {{stated that}} both {{the positive and negative}} experiences of the European Union will be taken into account <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Eurasian Union will avoid the problems of economic gaps and disparity between countries, such as those found in the eurozone, since the member countries have a comparable level of economic development, as well as common history and values.|$|E
5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view {{is no different from}} the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} multilingualism {{from the}} point of view of language learning and teaching. We discuss the ‘monological’ thinking in linguistics and in the research of language learning <b>and</b> teaching <b>and</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the monological stand, more often than not, also embeds a monolingual bias. As an alternative to monologism, we discuss dialogical notion of language <b>and</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> this inherently involves a multilingual stand...|$|R

5|$|In 1992, the {{economist}} Harry Saunders dubbed {{the hypothesis that}} improvements in energy efficiency work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate, <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory (the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation, technological progress and long-run economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the neoclassical growth model under {{a wide range of}} assumptions.|$|E
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 that he should be awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} William Dakin in his 1941 book The Art of Camouflage followed Thayer {{in describing}} countershading in some detail, {{and the book}} was reprinted as a military handbook in 1942. Dakin photographed model birds, much as Thayer and Cott had done, <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the shoulders and arms of battledress should be countershaded.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|But they {{overlooked}} that inexpensive aspirin {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E

5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{argued for}} girls and boys to have equal {{recreational}} and educational opportunities and for women to have fair wages. Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. She believed that women {{had the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E
5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names for the southern painted turtle.|$|E

5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a tribune who opposes {{the will of the}} people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E
5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions <b>and</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
