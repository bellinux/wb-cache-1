Mulder and Scully {{head to the}} home where the alien gestated, finding an alien's nail in the wall. The Smoking Man arrives soon after with Gibson, who tells him that the alien is no longer there. At the nuclear power plant, the alien kills another person, but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley. Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside, who has escaped from The Smoking Man. Later that night, Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X-Files and is protecting his interest. Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her. Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat, {{which is why it}} is in the nuclear power plant. Inside they find organic material on the ground and cooling pipes.|$|E

However Inalchuq, {{the governor of}} the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, had the members of the caravan that came from Mongolia arrested, claiming that the caravan was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. It seems unlikely, however, that any members of the trade delegation were spies. Nor does it seem likely that Genghis was trying to initiate a conflict with the Khwarezmid Empire with the caravan, considering he was making steady progress against a faltering Jin empire in northern China <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> moment.|$|E

25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway opened officially on July 4, 1893. Folks amassed {{themselves}} at the remote Mountain Junction. Up to this point {{there was only one}} means of public transportation from the valleys below to the hillside community of Altadena. It was the Los Angeles Terminal Railway which by this time was running from Terminal Island in San Pedro to Mountain Junction. The trains ran twice a day and, <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> <b>very</b> irregularly, so the only sure means of getting to Altadena on time was by your own horse and buggy. This lack of transportation coupled with Lowe’s inability to establish any at all would be in part the downfall of the railway.|$|E

Once, while in his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but no one seemed to have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to have cared about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues and friends, who accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted to the challenge of improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E

[...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> moment."
