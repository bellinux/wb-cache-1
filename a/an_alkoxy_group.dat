5000|$|Estradiol was {{discovered}} in 1929, and beginning in 1936, a variety of estradiol esters, such as estradiol benzoate and estradiol dipropionate, were introduced for clinical use. Testosterone esters, such as testosterone propionate and testosterone phenylacetate, were also introduced around this time. In contrast to estradiol and testosterone, progesterone proved more difficult to esterify. In fact, esterification involves the replacement of a hydroxy group with <b>an</b> <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group,</b> and unlike estradiol and testosterone, progesterone does not possess any hydroxy groups, so it is actually not chemically possible to esterify progesterone itself.

50|$|The {{molecular}} structure of cephalosporin {{can be altered}} in various ways to improve in vitro stability, anti-bacterial activity and resistance against β-lactamases. In the acidic conditions of the stomach, in vitro stability can be enhanced {{by the addition of}} an amino and a hydrogen to positions α1 and α2 of the cephalosporin structure. This results in a basic compound, an ammonium ion that is protonated in said conditions, giving us a more stable β-lactam which leads to an orally active drug.Anti-bacterial activity can be enhanced if A2 is <b>an</b> <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> instead of a hydrogen. The 7-amino group is crucial for anti-bacterial activity. In some cases, adding a methoxy group in position A2, cephalosporin stability is enhanced toward β-lactamases.In position A1, sulfur and oxygen can be placed in the ring. Sulfur shows better anti-bacterial activity, but oxygen shows better stability towards β-lactamases.In position C6, hydrogen is crucial for biological activity.In position A3, anti-bacterial activity is greater when A3 is a 5-membered heterocycle instead of a 6-membered one.In position α1 and α2, the L-isomer is 30-40 times more stable towards β-lactamase than the D-isomer.

DANA is a pan-selective inhibitor for all hNEU isoenzymes, with a difference from 2 to 10 fold inhibition activity, most effective for hNEU3 and hNEU4. Several reports have tested DANA-derivatives as inhibitors for hNEU2 and hNEU3. Most derivatives showed reduced inhibition in vitro. However, N5-azidoacetate-C9-azido derivative of DANA showed improved inhibition for hNEU2 and hNEU3. These studies concluded that the active site in the enzymes could tolerate large modifications at C9 better than at N5. Testing of C9 amido derivatives of DANA showed hNEU1-selective inhibitors.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the concentration of acid sites for isobutane/n-butene alkylation on zeolite BEA {{with varying degrees of}} Na+ ion exchange is reported. All catalysts studied showed complete n-butene conversion over a significant time-on-stream. Isooctanes were the dominating products over H-BEA, while the importance of di- and multiple alkylation increased with increasing Na+ concentration in the zeolite. In parallel, the integral number of turnovers per catalytic site markedly decreased. The acid site deactivation is affiliated with blocking by hexadecane species. The higher rate of catalyst deactivation with increasing degree of Na+ exchange is thus attributed to the increase in the probability of having a further butene molecule added to <b>a</b> C 8 <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> in place of undergoing hydride transfer from isobutane to desorb as isooctane.
