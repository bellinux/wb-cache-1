5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local <b>Australian</b> <b>blackwood,</b> myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E

The plants and trees found on the bluff are common {{to the rest of}} the range however, unlike the rest of the range, Quamby Bluff's summit does not show evidence of burning or grazing damage. The mountain has a mixture of habitats including eucalypt forest, rainforest and subalpine vegetation. On the mountain's southern half there are some patches of callidendrous rainforest which are dominated by myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii) and sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum) trees with mother shield ferns (Polystichum proliferum), and tree ferns in the gullies. There are scattered king billy pines (Athrotaxis selaginoides) on southern slopes, indicating long periods between bushfires. Other rainforest sections contain some Stringybark trees (Eucalyptus delegatensis). These forests on the mountain were formerly of mixed eucalyptus. High altitude and loggingevidenced by remaining stumpshave changed its character. Other sections contain mixed forest containing stringybark, myrtle, sassafras and dogwood (Pomaderris apetala), with a silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) understorey. Sections have some treeferns, mother shield fern, bat's wing fern (Histiopteris incisa) and kangaroo fern (Microsorum pustulatum). In other areas there is a dryer forest dominated by eucalypts. Messmate Stringybark (eucalyptus obliqua) and stringybark grow over an understorey of silver wattle, dogwood, bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and fireweed. In these sections there is evidence in the flora's pattern of repeated burnings. Eucalyptus dalrympleana and some <b>Australian</b> <b>blackwood</b> (Acacia melanoxylon) occur higher up, with a mixed understorey. The summit is exposed and wind-swept.

5000|$|They were {{traditionally}} {{river and}} lake people, with Framlingham Forest, Lake Condah {{and the surrounding}} river systems being of great importance to them economically and spiritually. Numerous distinct structures, extending over 100 square kilometres of the landscape, were employed {{for the purpose of}} farming eels, the staple of the Gunditjmara diet. These include stone races; canals; traps; stone walls; stone house sites and stone cairns. A controversy exists concerning {{the extent to which these}} features are the results of natural environmental processes or cultural modifications of the landscape by indigenous people. Peter Coutts and others argued, in a work entitled Aboriginal Engineers of the Western District, Victoria, that numerous features shown the handiwork of aboriginal landscaping for economic purposes. This thesis was challenged as a mythical'romancing of the landscape' by Dr. Anne Clarke, on that confused natural processes with socially crafted infrastructure.Fresh archaeological work by Dr Heather Builth led to her contending that they had a sophisticated system of aquaculture and eel farming. They built stone dams to hold the water in these swampy volcanic areas, esp. the Budj Bim ('top of head sticking out') area, creating ponds and wetlands in which they harvested Short-finned eels (kuyang) from Vanuatu and New Caledonia and other fish. They also created channels linking these wetlands. These channels contained weirs with large woven baskets made by women to cull mature eels. Professor Peter Kershaw, a Monash University palynologist found evidence of a sudden change in vegetation consistent with an artificial ponding system, and initial radiocarbon dating of the soil samples suggest the ponds were created up to 8,000 years ago.

40|$|<b>Australian</b> <b>blackwood</b> (Acacia melanoxylon RBR) is a {{valuable}} commercial timber that since 1925 has been incriminated as being injurious to health. In addition to toxic effects numerous cases of allergic contact dermatitis and bronchial asthma have been observed in woodworkers. Several constituents {{have been identified in}} recent years, but none of them could be considered as aetiological factors. Sensitizing experiments performed with blackwood heartwood extracts corroborated the described sensitising properties. Chemical studies showed the occurrence of two or possibly three quinones that produced positive skin responses in the sensitised guinea pigs. The main contact allergens were isolated and identified by x-ray analysis. The first, a yellow quinone, was identified as 2, 6 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -benzoquinone while the second, a red quinone, has the structure of 6 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 3, 5 -dihydrobenzofurano- 4, 7 -dion and was named acamelin. Whereas 2, 6 -dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone is already known from natural sources, acamelin is new and belongs to the rate group of naturally occurring furanoquinones. Though the obtained sensitising capacity of A melanoxylon RBR in respect of its quinones is not high, it should be considered as a possible source of allergic contact dermatitis, especially as greater amounts of <b>Australian</b> <b>blackwood</b> may enter European countries in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Context <b>Australian</b> <b>blackwood</b> (Acacia melanoxylon), is a fast-growing, high-quality, appearance-grade timber species {{native to}} eastern Australia. Some of its key wood {{properties}} are percentage heartwood, heartwood colour, basic density, wood stiffness and green moisture content. Variation in these properties affects log value, processing and marketing. - Aims This study aims {{to understand how}} genetics and environment affect these wood properties. - Methods Stem cores were taken from 16 open-pollinated blackwood families from the island of Tasmania, Australia, which were planted across three 18 -year-old progeny trials. -Results Significant effects of genetics, environment and their interaction (GxE) were found {{for many of the}} wood properties examined. Both broad-scale and local environmental effects were apparent, with local effects associated with competition and/or allelopathy from a Eucalyptus globulus nurse crop present in one trial. No significant correlation of growth rate (i. e. stem diameter) with wood properties was detected at the family level apart from a positive relationship with heartwood width. At the phenotypic level, there were many significant correlations including growth rate with heartwood width, but not with basic density, or wood stiffness measured as standing tree time of flight. Faster growing trees had yellower heartwood while trees with higher basic and green densities tended to have darker, redder and less yellow heartwood. - Conclusion Both genetic and environment factors affect key wood properties of <b>Australian</b> <b>blackwood,</b> but in most cases these effects were independent of growth rate...|$|E
