The AC nickel slag is a liquid coproduct of nickel production that is solidified under ambient conditions. The laboratory evaluation program, which {{was carried out}} to determine {{the characteristics of the}} AC nickel slag, included physical and mechanical properties testing, petrographic examinations, and HMA mixture designs. Accelerated laboratory testing was completed on the mixtures by using an asphalt pavement analyzer to assess their performance characteristics. Additional testing included autoclave disruption tests for free lime and free magnesia, chemical and mineralogical analyses, polished stone value, and <b>aggregate</b> <b>abrasion</b> <b>value.</b> This study indicated that suitably processed nickel slag was environmentally, mineralogically, and physically stable.

This study also attempted to determine the correlation between vehicle crash and pavement surface friction, which {{makes it possible to}} quantitatively establish the so-called crash modification factors (CMFs) that are extremely useful in selecting a cost-effective solution to reduce wet pavement vehicle crashes. In-depth reviews were conducted to identify the aspects of the properties for aggregates used in HFST, including <b>aggregate</b> <b>abrasion</b> <b>value</b> (AAV), Los Angeles abrasion (LAA), Micro-Deval abrasion, and polished stone value (PSV). Extensive laboratory testing was conducted to examine the LAA, Micro-Deval abrasion, and PSV, and to provide first-hand data on the calcined bauxite and steel slag that may be used for HFST and friction surfacing in Indiana. Laboratory accelerating polishing was carried out {{to evaluate the}} effect of aggregate gradation and identify the HFST systems with satisfactory friction performance with respect to surface macro-texture and friction. Test strips were installed in the pavement on a real-world road to further evaluate the friction performances of the promising HFST systems under the true traffic polishing and assess the potential effect of winter and snow plough. Pull-off testing was also conducted to examine the bonding between the proposed HFST systems and the substrate surface. Field friction test data was utilized to evaluate the long-term friction performances of pavement preservation treatments, including chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding. Statewide vehicle crash data between 2010 and 2014 was examined to determine the crash statistics associated with pavement friction. The crash data was also matched to the annual pavement inventory friction data to quantify the probabilistic association between vehicle crash and pavement friction with respect to interstate, US, and state highways, respectively. Specification requirements were established for the properties of calcined bauxite and steel slag for HFST and friction surfacing with respect to LAA, Micro-Deval abrasion, PSV, Al 2 O 3 content, and fine aggregate angularity (FAA). Specification requirements were also developed for HFST aggregate gradation and surface friction performance. Regression models were developed for predicting the friction numbers of chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding over their service lives. Regression models were also provided to quantify the effectiveness of friction surfacing for interstate, US, and state highways, respectively...|$|E

Properties {{of the rocks}} tested included specific gravity, moisture absorption, Schmidt hammer rebound, point-load strength, unconfined compressive strength, Los Angeles <b>abrasion,</b> <b>aggregate</b> crushing <b>value,</b> sodium sulphate soundness, and ultrasound velocity. The thermal heat capacity and coefficient of expansion of the stones were also determined. The rocks had high specific gravity of over 2. 75, high compressive strength of 196 - 256 MPa, high point load index (Is 50) of 17 - 23 MPa and low porosity of 0. 27 - 0. 29 % required of good aggregates. However, the rather high moisture absorption and high magnesium sulphate loss of the rocks exceeded the 3 and 18 % considered as the upper limits for good aggregates. This raised concern as to the durability of the rocks under aggressive environment. Also, the ferromagnesian minerals of the dolerite are prone to deteriorate badly under harsh environment. The typically elongate and angular aggregate shape of dolerite aggregate meant poor mix workability and more cement requirement for a given strength than the less angular syenite aggregate...|$|R

40|$|The Los Angeles (LA) {{abrasion}} {{method is}} commonly used for determining the abrasion characteristics and classification of the granular materials used in road and pavement construction. The abrasion resistance of materials can significantly affect the service life of road pavements when exposed to long-term dynamic traffic loads.

40|$|Quarry {{industry}} is a growing industry {{because of the need}} of aggregates for the construction industry. One of the most widely used construction material is aggregate which is mined in quarry mines. Most frequently asked parameters for the quality of quarry aggregates are Loss Angeles <b>Abrasion</b> <b>Value</b> and <b>Aggregate</b> Impact Value, which are unpredictable at the initial stages of quarrying for the rock underneath the surface. Hence, the risk of running the quarry is always there. Therefore this article examines the variation of aggregate properties in quarry mining, based on exploratory core samples. The study is carried out by using core samples from a selected quarry in the western province, Srilanka. This research indicates the relationship between Uniaxial Compressive Strength (U. C.

The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relation between the petrographic characteristics of some volcanic and subvolcanic (silicate) rocks from Croatia, and the chrushing resistance of aggregates produced by their comminution. The aggregate resistance to chrusing was tested by means of the Los Angeles abrasion test. During this testing, an aggregate is subjected to dynamic load by impact and abrasion. The petrographic characteristics were examined with the petrographic and scanning electron microscope and by X-ray powder diffraction with CuKa (1, 54 A) radiation. In order to obtain the most correct evaluation of aggregates chrushing resistance, four different values had been used - the recrushing index (Ir), the reduction ratio (RR), the Los Angeles <b>abrasion</b> <b>value</b> (LA) and the Los Angeles <b>abrasion</b> <b>value</b> residue (LAr).

40|$|Stone Matrix Asphalt is a gap-graded hot-mix asphalt mixture {{composed}} of a coarse aggregate skeleton and a binder-rich mortar. The mixture type was first introduced to the United States in 1991, {{with one of the}} first test sections placed on I- 70 near Richmond, Indiana. To help control the selection of coarse aggregate, the Indiana Department of Transportation specified a maximum Los Angeles <b>Abrasion</b> loss <b>value</b> of 30 percent.

Soil confinement retains infill materials in three dimensions providing high tensile strength on each axis.

The high hoop strength of the cell walls, together with the passive earth and passive resistance of adjacent cells, also increases soil strength and stiffness. <b>Aggregate</b> <b>abrasion</b> is minimized by the cell confinement, thereby reducing attrition of the base material.

The crust abrasion coefficients varied from 0. 039 to 0. 123 m − 1. Hence, a crusted soil surface should abrade more easily than a well-aggregated soil. The loose erodible material on the crusts ranged from 0. 010 to 0. 068 kg m − 2 and varied directly with sand content and inversely with organic matter. The threshold friction velocities of organic soils were slightly higher than would be predicted for comparable mineral soils. From the results of this study, it is expected that for a given wind speed, a nearly equa...|$|R
40|$|Ballast {{consisting}} of large sized aggregate particles with uniform size distribution {{is an essential}} component of the track substructure, to facilitate load distribution and drainage. As freight tonnage accumulates with traffic, ballast will accumulate an increasing percentage of fines due to either aggregate breakdown or outside contamination such as subgrade soil intrusion and coal dust collection. According to the classical text by Selig and Waters [1], ballast degradation from traffic involves up to 76 % of all fouling cases; voids will be occupied by fines from the bottom of ballast layer gradually causing ballast clogging and losing its drainage ability. When moisture is trapped within ballast, especially fouled ballast, ballast layer stability is compromised. In the recent studies at the University of Illinois, the focus has been to evaluate behavior of fouled ballast due to aggregate degradation using large scale triaxial testing. To investigate the effects of moisture on degraded ballast, fouled ballast was generated in the laboratory through controlled Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests intended to mimic <b>aggregate</b> <b>abrasion</b> and breakdown and generate fouled ballast at compositions similar to those observed in the field due to repeated train loadings. Triaxial shear strength tests were performed on the fouled ballast at different moisture contents. Important findings of this preliminary study on characterizing wet fouled ballast are presented in this paper. Moisture was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the fouled ballast strength behavior. Adding a small amount of 3 % moisture (by weight of particles smaller than 3 / 8 in. size or smaller than 9. 5 mm) caused test specimens to indicate approximately 50 % decrease in shear strength of the dry fouled ballast. Wet fouled ballast samples peaked at significantly lower maximum deviator stress values at relatively smaller axial strains and remained at these low levels as the axial strain was increased...|$|R
40|$|Bentonites {{are used}} for various {{industrial}} applications. Their physicochemical properties depend on the mineralogical and chemical composition, the type of smectite, the grain size distribution, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), the dominant interlayer cation (Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +), and the layer charge density. All these parameters can be measured with acceptable precision. Nevertheless, {{the performance of a}} bentonite in a given application is often unpredictable. An additional relevant parameter is the "microfabric" describing the arrangement of minerals and/or the intergrowth of the minerals with glass. The microfabric is supposed to affect different bentonite properties such as swelling capacity and rheology. The present study focuses on the influence of different microfabrics on the abrasivity by bentonite dispersions. The abrasivity of bentonite dispersions mainly depended on two factors: 1) on the amount of hard and sharp accessory minerals and volcanic glass and 2) the grain size distribution, which was produced by different grinding techniques. The abrasivity increased with decreasing grain size, which was caused by breaking the hard components (minerals and glass) leading to an increased number of sharp edges. In addition, there was evidence for a subordinate influence of the type of exchangeable cations. This influence is explained by the different relative arrangements of smectite particles towards the surfaces of hard and sharp minerals. Na+ exchanged glass rich samples showed higher <b>abrasion</b> <b>values</b> than the Ca 2 + exchanged samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Unbound {{nature of}} {{railroad}} ballast <b>aggregates</b> causes <b>abrasion</b> and degrada-tion predicaments due to heavy train axle loads. Polyurethane reinforcement of ballast layer {{is a candidate}} solution to these problems. However, not many polyurethane reinforcement applications have been studied until the begin-ning of last decade. Therefore, the technology requires considerable research efforts to fully develop. As part of this thesis study research, direct shear testing was undertaken for two different railroad ballast aggregates, granite and limestone. Both aggregate materials satisfied the AREMA No. 24 railroad ballast gradation requirements. Although the unbound granite samples showed higher shear strength properties than the unbound limestone samples, polyurethane rein-forcement increased shear strengths of the limestone aggregate samples more than the granite aggregate samples in direct shear (shear box) tests. The granite samples had somewhat of a coarser gradation when compared to th...|$|R
40|$|The {{abrasive}} {{properties of}} tooth pastes are usually investigated by brushing natural teeth {{which have been}} activated by irradiation, and subsequently measuring the radioactivity of the abraded particles (RDA-, REA-values). The standard REA and RDA measurements using actual tooth material represent the practical situation very well, however, the measuring procedure is complicated and expensive. In addition, the measurement technique and the biological variation of individual teeth result in a large scatter of the obtained data. Therefore, another approach was chosen, simulating the tooth by a dental composite filling material and utilizing a test set-up which was developed earlier for measuring the abrasion behaviour of dental materials. This test {{is based on an}} arrangement of a brush and a specimen which rotate in opposite directions in a tooth paste slurry under loading conditions (force, velocity, etc.) which are close to tooth cleaning conditions. The material loss is measured by weighing the samples (at least 5) after a well defined cleaning and drying procedure. Various widely used commercial tooth pastes covering a broad spectrum of abrasion levels (i. e. RDA-values) were investigated. The results show a reasonably small scatter (typical standard deviations 10 %) and a high reproducibility of the <b>abrasion</b> <b>values.</b> The <b>abrasion</b> caused by mild and abrasive tooth pastes differs typically by a factor 5 - 10. The method seems to be more accurate, faster, easier to perform and less expensive than the abrasion test based on radioactive marking and thus can be a reliable alternative to differentiate between pastes with different abrasivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{concrete}} {{consisting of}} a hard, chemically inert particulate substance known as an aggregate (usually made from different types of sand and gravel), that is bonded together by cement and water. Aggregate can produced from any materials such as mining sand, offshore sand, pumice, scoria and etc. Offshore sand is a one of alternative for river sand usage in concrete. In this study, the coarse aggregates will be replaced with the synthetic lightweight coarse aggregate using offshore sand (SYLCAG) in concrete.

40|$|Construction {{material}} {{assessment is}} the {{crucial part of}} the hydroelectric power projects. The quality and quantity of the construction material is the major concern when exploring construction material. Four quarry sites (Q 1, Q 2, Q 3 and Q 4) were identified and assessed for both quantity and quality. Distribution of rock quarry sites was taken for quantitative assessment of reserves. The rock samples were obtained from the sites and were analysed for physical, mechanical and petrographic features. Rock types in quarry sites were schistose marble (in Q 1), augen gneiss (in Q 2), and banded gneisses (in Q 3 and Q 4). The analytical results showed that water absorption values were < 1 % in all the samples, but was the highest in Q 2 (0. 92 %). Contrarily, Q 2 possessed the least specific gravity among the samples. Sodium sulphate soundness values ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 77, which was the highest in Q 2. Samples Q 1, Q 3 and Q 4 yielded Los Angeles <b>Abrasion</b> <b>value</b> below 45 %, whereas Q 2 gave 57. 5 %. Similarly, Q 2 also yielded the least value (1. 82 MPa) of point-load strength index tested along the foliation. Augen gneiss (Q 2) showed the low abrasion resistance and soundness to freeze and thaw because of weak bonding between platy and other constituents of the rock, whereas schistose marble and banded gneisses yielded better resistance to abrasion and freeze and thaw, and possessed better strength perhaps due to well bonding among the mineralogical constituents due to the presence of appreciable amount of carbonate minerals. *Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{demolition}} waste as pavement base material is a promising but unproven technique for road rehabilitation and construction. A {{survey was conducted}} by Building Economics Department of University of Moratuwa found that {{demolition waste}} is infrequently used in this application due primarily {{to a lack of}} practical knowledge about the engineering properties of the material. Therefore, this research was aimed at evaluating the physical properties, strength parameters, and durability characteristics of demolition waste to use as pavement base material. The study included extensive laboratory and prototype model testing. Laboratory tests included flakiness index value, elongation index, aggregate impact <b>value,</b> Los Angeles <b>abrasion</b> <b>value</b> test, California bearing ratio, unconfined compressive strength and durability evaluations. Prototype modeling was utilized to compare demolition waste with respect to general base materials. It included a plate load test and dynamic cone penetrometer. The prototype model demonstrated that the demolition waste base layer was susceptible to stiffness changes due primarily to changes in moisture. Prototype model results have been verified using ‘Everstress’ back-calculation software and it can be shown that the layer coefficient of CCM is equivalent to 0. 134. And also this material shows a very high variability with respect to conventional base materials i. e. DGAB. Therefore it is recommended to use this material as a base material for a traffic load of 20 kN or less. And it will perform a strong correlation as given in design charts & tables. Finally it was possible to evaluate a structural capacity of demolition waste and develop a design chart to replace dense graded aggregate base course from demolition waste base layer for construction of roads. Therefore it is recommended to introduce demolition waste material instead of conventional base material based on the developed design guidelines...|$|R
