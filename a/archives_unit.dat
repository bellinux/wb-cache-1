With the usage of ERMS and its integration to the organizational structure, it has brought a transformation in human resources. The main objective {{of this study is}} that; to determine the system effects through human resources, what are the problems that the personnel of University of Marmara faced to and their effort to adopt the new and changing system, during the process of institutionilization of ERMS. The hypothesis of the study is; with the realization of ERMS at the University, it's been thought that the responsibility and the role of Directorate of Correspondence and <b>Archives</b> <b>Unit</b> would change and its importance would be understood within the other business processes of the University. Addition to this, there'll be a neccessity of change that the educational situation, skills, competeties and outlooks of Personnel of this Unit. However, with this case, the positive and negative feedback both the University personnel and the Unit personnel had performed, reasoned to select such a subject as well. The administrative personnel of University was included to this study by applying them questionaires and a method of survey. They were evaluated up to the dynamics of their educational situation, seniority, age and gender. The process of institutionilization of the ERMS after the beggining of the system by 2013 within the University is also included to the study. With this development, it's tought to be that the function and the role of Directorate of Correspondence and <b>Archives</b> <b>Unit</b> had changed and the job satisfaction and the competities and roles of personnel changed as well. According to our determination of the related nature, the education, experience, knowledge, attitude, viewpoint and skills of University Personnel underwent a change and they had to have an obligation to change and renew themselves. At the same time, the University needed a personnel open to changes, following up the developments, creating new information and able to work with others in colloboration. Briefly, it's projected that with the usage of ERMS, professional knowledge, skills and personal perfections will make a difference. In the first chapter of this study; generally concepts of change and organizational change had been analized, it's tried to perform the role of top management, the resistance to change and changes of human resources. In the second section, the definitions of records, document, electronic records were undertaken and also the meanings of electronic records system and their benefits were explained and the procedures and standarts up to related field were pointed out. In the third chapter, the process of projecting and application of ERMS, the possible problems the system will create and the ways of coping with were expressed. And in the forth chapter, how the ERMS was applied at the Directorate of Correspondence and <b>Archives</b> <b>Unit,</b> the role of related Unit Personnel, integration of the system to the Unit, problems during the implementation process and the specialities of personnel needed was tried to be explained.

40|$|Meeting {{regularly}} from January of 1942 to November of 1969, the Oxford University Socratic Club {{was one of}} {{the most}} significant academic organizations to affect mid-twentieth century Anglophilic letters. Although the Socratic Club is most often identified with its first faculty advisor and president, literary critic and novelist C. S.

The Boise State University Socratic Club Collection is a small start on the preservation of rare publications and pertinent documents that speak to the club’s historical significance. The collection features three original Socratic Digests (issues 2, 3, and 4) gifted by Oxonian moral philosopher Mary Midgley, who, along with her husband analytical philosopher Geoffrey Midgley, were active participants in club activities.

BUHK is chosen to research location because based on observations begin result, a lot of activities in each sub-division potentially create vital archives. This situation is not supported by good human resources and infrastructure. Method of this research is case study with qualitative approach. Data collection techniques that used in this research are documentation, interview and observation. Data validity is done by triangulation technique. Informants of this research are 6 sub-division chiefs, 10 stafs, service & information coordinator of <b>Archives</b> <b>Unit,</b> and Unnes archivist. The results of this research showed that BUHK UNNES has not identified vital archives yet. Based on law analysis and risk analysis, there are 38 types of archives included in the vital category, they are consisted of: 11 % of administrative archives, 21 % law archives, 8 % employment archives, 18 % household archives, 34 % archives of goods goverment own archieves, and 8 % leader activity archieves. Vital archives preservation is done by several staff whose duties are related with vital archives. BUHK has not had the procedure of prevention and recovery of vital archives pre-disaster. The conclusion of this research, BUHK is one of work units at UNNES that manages a lot of vital archives.

40|$|This {{study has}} been drawn up on {{the request of the}} European Parliament, Historical <b>Archives</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Directorate for the Library, Directorate General for Parliamentary Research Services (DG EPRS). The European cast iron ingot, marked “Europ”, was created on 30 April, 1953 at the Belval factory in Esch-sur-Alzette in Luxembourg. Made with {{materials}} from countries that had long been enemies but that had now decided to share their resources, it was the symbol of the construction of Europe introduced on 9 May, 1950 by the Schuman Declaration and inspired by Jean Monnet. Offered to Monnet, who was then president of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), it is held at the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe. This study, the first part of a wider analysis on the European Parliament's role in EU budgetary powers, traces the very first phase of interinstitutional relations in the framework of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). After a brief historical introduction, the study explains the structure, objectives and means of action of the ECSC. The ECSC Treaty had a number of original features. Among these was the establishment of a High Authority, an independent supranational executive with extensive powers including the capacity to raise funds via a tax (levy) on coal and steel production, to borrow on the capital markets, and to make loans to enterprises. The Treaty also defined the respective roles of the ECSC’s Council of Ministers, Common Assembly and Court of Justice. The ECSC Treaty did not foresee a budgetary procedure: all competences were concentrated in the High Authority, which presented an annual report on its activities to the Assembly. The High Authority was the motor for managing the production of coal and steel, which belonged to the ECSC and not to its member states, and for supporting the modernisation of the industry and of the social conditions of the workers. The present research will highlight a narrative differing in part from the theory of the rules of the ECSC Treaty, and we will discover numerous features which, in spite of the 60 -year gap, point up certain similarities with approaches and problems existing today. The autonomy of the High Authority was mitigated by constant consultation/prior agreement with the Council of Ministers. The Assembly gained influence over the years, in some case obliging the High Authority to modify decisions already taken, even without a specific role being defined in the Treaty. The High Authority introduced multiannual budgetary planning, which was more efficient than annual budgets, and exceptionally allowed a rebate on the levy for two countries. During the 1980 s, the member states increased their influence over the ECSC budget (with a direct contribution based on a mechanism similar to GNI). The High Authority, in view of the cost of production in some countries, decided to introduce a rebate on the levy. It was critical of the way the Assembly’s plenary was organised. The study concludes with an overview of the evolution of interinstitutional relations, with a focus on the budgetary domain and on the capacity of the institutions to adapt and evolve...|$|E
