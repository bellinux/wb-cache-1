25|$|The {{possibility}} of using water isotope depletion with elevation to reconstruct paleoaltimetry was demonstrated {{as early as}} the late 1960s, when Caltech geochemist Samuel Epstein tried to collect rainwater at different elevations in a single storm. The δ18O and δD lapse rates vary within -1 to -5‰/km and -10 to -40‰/km respectively, but can vary with locations and seasons, and are not exactly linear with altitude. One of the first studies in stable isotope paleoaltimetry demonstrated a meteoric water δD signature of -90 to -139‰ in fluid inclusions in quartz and <b>adularia</b> in an epithermal gold-silver deposit in Nevada, and suggested the applicability of stable isotopes in reconstruction of ancient topography in the Great Basin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of hydrous silicate minerals have since then been used to reconstruct topographic histories in mountain ranges across the world, including the North American Cordillera, the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, the European Alps, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. Lab experiments with clay minerals have shown that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions are relatively resistant to alteration at moderate temperature (<100nbsp&°C), and can preserve the original meteoric water signal. One important effect of mountain ranges on rainfall stable isotopes is the rain shadow effect, in which an isotopic depletion happens in precipitation on the leeward side compared to the windward side. A change in the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation on the two sides of a mountain can be used to infer the magnitude of the rain shadow effect. In one such study, an isotope enrichment was observed in smectite {{on the east side of}} the Sierra Nevada in California from mid-Miocene to late Pliocene, suggesting a decrease in elevation during this period. Another study found δD values around -140‰ in muscovite in the North America Cordillera during the early Eocene, which would suggest an elevation 1000m higher than today at the time. In addition to hydrous minerals, hydrogen isotopes in biomarkers such as leaf waxes have also been developed for paleoaltimetry studies. The δD lapse rate in leaf waxes (-21‰/km) falls in the range of meteoric water observations. As an example study, leaf wax δD data have been used to confirm hydrous mineral paleoaltimetry for the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada during the Eocene.|$|E

It is also a product of hydrothermal alteration of various minerals (feldspars, micas, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and others) composing igneous rocks. A rock composed of quartz and epidote is known as epidosite. Well-developed crystals are found at many localities: Knappenwand, near the Großvenediger in the Untersulzbachthal in Salzburg, as magnificent, dark green crystals of long prismatic habit in cavities in epidote schist, with asbestos, <b>adularia,</b> calcite, and apatite; the Ala valley and Traversella in Piedmont; Arendal in Norway; Le Bourg-d'Oisans in Dauphiné; Haddam in Connecticut; Prince of Wales Island in Alaska, here as large, dark green, tabular crystals with copper ores in metamorphosed limestone.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. Hydrothermal most pure {{potassium}} feldspar (<b>adularia)</b> forms incrustations on fissured wall {{rocks in}} an active geothermal environment. Measured max. temperature, 265 ~ and con-centration of K + and Na + cations in the geothermal fluid require K-feldspar and Na-feldspar to be deposited under equilibrium conditions.

The high grade skarn mineralization {{was found to be}} commonly controlled by individual layers within bedding planes that contain carbonate and are more chemically reactive under elevated temperatures. Skarn minerals found in the study area include diopside, epidote, <b>adularia,</b> chlorite, scapolite, hornblende, zoned garnet, calcite, quartz and specular hematite. Overall metamorphic history for the outcrop is complex, however, a clear progression of the timing of when individual minerals crystallized from protolith can be seen during different stages of cooling. Crystallization history was interpreted using the petrographic microscope and the peragenetic sequence is as follows: diopside, garnet, calcite, scapolite, hornblende, chlorite, and finally <b>adularia.</b> Minerals that are at equilibrium with one another as well as individual minerals can be used to acquire temperature data due to their chemical stabilities under specific temperatures and pressures. A lower maximum temperature threshold can be set at around 500 °C due to the formation temperature for diopside. Due to a previous study by Dr. David Gonzales, an upper maximum threshold has also been set at 650 °C {{due to the lack of}} reset detrital zircons. Simple lithostatic pressure calculation was completed for the outcrop, which falls within 0. 062 gpa- 0. 078 gpa. This indicates the rocks within the study area were buried no more than a few kilometers and were relatively shallow during magmatic emplacement. Whole rock analysis using X-ray fluorescence of metamorphic rocks compared to unmetamorphozed protolith indicates an enrichment in K and Na, which is indicative of alkali metasomatism and possible influence of magmatic fluids.

Principal absorption bands exhibited by <b>adularia</b> at wavenumbers of 362 and 345. 5 mm^(− 1) (corresponding to O-H stretching modes) are strongly dichroic, with maximum and minimum absorptivities measured for vibrations α (E at 5 ° to a) and β (E at 5 ° to c^∗), respectively, whereas bands at 328 and 309 mm^(− 1) are more nearly isotropic. Similarly, near-infrared bands at 525 and 513 mm^(− 1) (associated with combination H-OH bend, O-H stretch modes) exhibit maximum peak heights for α while a lesser band at 475 mm^(− 1) appears to be nearly isotropic. Comparison of fundamental and combination band intensities reveal that molecular water is the predominant hydrogen-bearing species, consistent with previous results for microcline and orthoclase crystals in which H_ 2 O substitutes for K. However, differences in magnitude of fundamental and combination band polarizations suggest multiple defect sites or potentially a secondary population of hydroxyl defects. Rates at which these defects can be eliminated from samples annealed in air at temperatures T from 500 ° to 900 °C are much faster than those predicted by oxygen mobilities, yielding diffusivities of D[/_s]= 6. 2 x 10 ^(- 4) exp (-l 72 ± 15 [^(kJ) /mol)) /RT indistinguishable from those reported for proton interstitials in quartz.

40|$|Most of the epithermal gold-silver ore {{deposits}} {{in the western}} zone of the Satsuma district were formed in the Pliocene age based on basis of measurements of K-Ar ages for <b>adularia</b> or alunite from these deposits. Those in the east zone were formed in the Pleistocene age. Both are paleo-geothermal systems. There are active geothermal systems around the recent volcanoes along the east rim of this district. The centers of the volcanic and hydrothermal activities seemed to have migrated from west to east east during several million years. Paleo-geothermal and active geothermal systems are distributed widely {{in the west and}} south rims of the Pacific...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Puy-les-Vignes deposit (Limousin, French Massif Central) {{represents}} an uncommon occurrence in the West European Variscan belt of a hydrothermal tungsten mineralization {{associated with a}} breccia pipe structure. A new study of this atypical quartz-wolframite-tourmaline deposit has been possible, allowing to revisit the mineral paragenesis and to identify four main successive stages of mineralization: (i) W-As -Nb±Ta stage corresponding to the historically economic mineralization hosted in quartz-wolframite-arsenopyrite veins; (ii) Fe-Cu-Zn±Mo stage represented by the deposition of base metal sulphides; (iii) Nb-Y-HREE stage associated with a late hydrothermal paragenesis in a tourmaline, <b>adularia</b> and chlorite matrix; (iv) Bi±Au-Ag stage, related to the late-Variscan regional metallogenic event in the Limousin...|$|E
