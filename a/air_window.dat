40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) receivers and focuses on the design of an efficient aperture. An <b>air</b> <b>window</b> is proposed for use as the aperture of a CSP molten salt receiver to mitigate efficiency losses due to heat and mass transfer. The current state of the art in CSP technology is outlined with emphasis on molten salt storage. An overview of the theory of <b>air</b> <b>window</b> devices is given, and a model is presented which can be used to predict the efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>window,</b> given by the ratio of prevented heat and mass transfer to aperture power consumption. A design for an experimental test cell is presented, including a method of molten salt simulation and vapor concentration measurement. The test cell demonstrated the ability to lower the mass fraction of vapor outside the aperture by 77. 8 % ± 6. 2 %. A high rate of cooling was observed in the test cell as the velocity of the <b>air</b> <b>window</b> was increased. by Adam Taylor Paxson. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|M. Ing. The {{characterisation}} of {{the flow}} field and thermal performance of supply air windows (airflow windows operating in supply mode) have been a topic of interest {{for at least two}} decades. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as well as other simulation methods have been used to model and characterise the flow field, temperature distributions and thermal performance of the supply <b>air</b> <b>window</b> in recent years. Where experimental validation of the velocity (only outlet velocity) and temperature predictions has been provided the error between experiment and CFD (and other forms of simulation) is in the order of 50 % and 3 ◦C (10 - 13 %), respectively. Furthermore, {{a large part of the}} literature does not have experimental validation of the simulation results. The significant error in many of the studies, that provide experimental val- idation of the velocity field, is attributed to inappropriate turbulence mod- els, unrealistic boundary conditions, neglecting significant three-dimensional effects, solar radiation effects not entirely accounted for, mesh sensitivity studies neglected and material properties of glass and air assumed constant. The aim of this research was to characterise a supply <b>air</b> <b>window</b> in terms of its velocity field, temperature distributions and thermal performance. This was done by mathematically modelling the fluid dynamics and heat trans- fer processes in a supply <b>air</b> <b>window</b> and solving the model in a commer- cial CFD code, namely ANSYS Fluent 12. 1. Furthermore, an experimental rig was designed, constructed and used to measure the flow field and tem- peratures with the aim of validating the CFD models. The CFD models incorporated appropriate turbulence models, realistic boundary conditions, three-dimensional effects, solar radiation, temperature dependent material properties and a mesh sensitivity study. The CFD models and experiments were setup for forced and natural flow conditions. Laser Doppler Velocimetry has not been used for velocity field measure- ments in an airflow window to date. The experimental setup made use of Laser Doppler Velocimetry to measure the velocity field and turbulence in- tensities. The Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) probe was positioned using a three axis computer controlled traversing mechanism. Furthermore, flow visualisation experiments were done to qualitatively capture the flow field. The results from the CFD are partially in good agreement with the exper- imental work. Qualitatively the flow field as predicted by CFD is in good agreement with the results from the flow visualisation experiments. Quan- titatively the results from the CFD are in good agreement with the tem- perature measurements, however, there is noticeable error between the LDV readings and the velocities as well as turbulence intensity values predicted by CFD. The error, with regards to velocity and turbulence intensity, may be attributed to the experimental error caused by problems with flow seeding as well as the isotropic turbulence assumption inherent in the turbulence model (SST k − ω) used...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{modeling the}} energy performance {{of an office}} equipped with a conventional insulated glazing unit with exterior shading and with three multiple-skin facade typologies (an airflow window, a supply <b>air</b> <b>window,</b> and a naturally ventilated window) under typical Belgian weather conditions. It is found that multiple-skin facades may improve the energy efficiency. However, the analysis shows that variants performing well in winter are not necessarily beneficial in summer. Combining typologies or changing the systems' settings according to the particular situation {{will be necessary to}} obtain an overall year-round improvement. The results further indicate that evaluating the energy efficiency of multiple-skin facades cannot be performed by solely analyzing the transmission losses and gains. It is imperative {{to take into account the}} enthalpy change of the cavity air and to perform a whole building energy analysis. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{currently}} unresolved {{problem in}} building design is the paradox between increasing demand for good thermal insulation, and {{the requirement for}} ample levels of ventilation, to maintain a healthy indoor environment. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is a supply air ‘ventilated ’ window. This utilises an airflow between panes to pre-heat ventilation air to the building, and to reduce thermal convection losses thus reducing the window U-Value. At the base of the window is a vent to the external environment, allowing air inflow. This relatively cold air is heated by convection/conduction from the warmer inner pane and will subsequently rise, or be drawn up, entering the room through venting {{at the top of the}} glazing. A 2 Dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, using a commercial package optimsed for modelling the built environment, has been constructed to model the performance of the window. This model is described and will be validated against ASHRAE standard U-Values for conventional windows, and against experimental measurements taken from a Supply <b>Air</b> <b>Window</b> test rig that we have constructed. The simulation achieves a good degree of accuracy for steady state conditions over a wide range of varying parameters; ventilation rate, indoor outdoor temperature differentials, glass type, and cavity, and proves itself to be a useful tool in the design of Supply Air ‘Ventilated’ windows...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in Solar Energy ([URL] the official refereed journal for the International Solar Energy Society. It was based on Southall’s experimental work carried out at the Energy Monitoring Company’s test cell at Cranfield University, UK, which was funded by McEvoy's EPSRC project. The paper brought together information from previous modelling and experimental work to describe in detail the solar gain factor and window pre-heat {{as a function of}} incident solar radiation, and the U-value and window pre-heat as a function of window size. An innovative research methodology was employed in this instance by installing a supply window <b>air</b> <b>window</b> in an advanced outside test cell, and exposing it to all environmental parameters. Also, the advanced nature of the test cell allowed indirect measurement of the window heat flows so no instrumentation on the window itself could disturb the air flow/heat transfer within the window. Experimentally this work was significant and original in two main ways: • The impact of size and aspect ratio of the window on performance was determined {{for the first time in}} an experimental set-up. • It was shown that when the solar gain factor was combined with the ventilation pre-heat the overall solar gain factor was significantly higher, more accurately demonstrating the energy benefits of the ventilated window. Theoretically the article was novel in that it provided for the first time mathematical descriptors for the relationship between U-Value/pre-heat and window area, allowing a simpler calculation route for the performance of the window...|$|E

40|$|Research is {{documented}} which {{makes use of}} a computer program called VISION, This computer program was developed specifically to provide {{a detailed analysis of}} heat transfer occurring in glazing systems. VISION was modified to perform an analysis of the energy flows in supply <b>air</b> <b>windows.</b> A model used to quantify heat transfer in the supply air flow is described. Ventilation air is brought in through supply <b>air</b> <b>windows</b> and the energy recovered by the preheat of the air flow is credited to the thermal performance of the window itself, Thus, the net energy flow between the conditioned space and the window was used to calculate an effective U-value and shading coefficient, The use of these "effective" window performance parameters permits the subsequent quantification of energy flows to or from the supply air glazing system without the necessity of modelling the detailed mechanisms of energy transport within the glazing system itself. A variety of glazing system designs are simulated. Indoor glazing temperature is reported for each system. In all cases the presence of preheat ventilation improved the effective shading coefficient moderately and increased the effective thermal resistance appreciably.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate sound insulation behavior of double windows, when windows, when a second window is placed upon a previous one, keeping an air layer between them. This was done through standard tests carried out at the insulation chamber of the Acoustics Laboratory of Federal University of Santa Maria in accordance with international norms ISO 10140 - 2 and ISO 717 - 1. First, low <b>air</b> hermetic <b>windows</b> were duplicated, each one having Rw = 18 dB. Second, good <b>air</b> hermetic <b>windows</b> were duplicated. The objective, through this technique, was to find out sound insulation improvement of double windows under the two mentioned circumstances. It was verified that low <b>air</b> hermetic double <b>window</b> obtained Rw = 26 dB, with an increase of 8 dB in relation to just one window of the same typology. In relation to good <b>air</b> hermetic double <b>window,</b> a Rw final of 37 dB was obtained, considering that the increase in sound insulation depends on the initial performance of the first installed window. The gain in insulation in the second instance was between 4 to 8 dB, mainly in relation to low and medium frequencies. Therefore, it was possible to quantify which sound insulation improvement could be done on faÃ§ades employing the technique of double windows in order to contribute to the improvement and quality of buildings in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{saving and}} Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in {{buildings}} are strongly affected by air leakages. Several studies {{reveal that the}} energy loss owing to leaky windows can account for up to 40 % of the total building energy demand. Furthermore, at the design stage, the possible infiltration of outdoor <b>air</b> through <b>windows</b> is not taken into account when determining the nominal outdoor airflow rate of the ventilation system. This practice may result in an oversizing of the ventilation system and consequent energy waste. Thus, the air-tightness class of a wall assembly should be assessed for each window component considering the type of material, {{the presence of the}} seal, the type of closure, the sealing and the maintenance condition. In this paper, the authors present the experimental results of air-tightness measurements carried out using the fan pressurization method in three residential buildings located in the Mediterranean region before and after a window retrofit. Two different window retrofits were investigated: the application of rubber seals on window frames and the substitution of existing windows with new certified high performance windows. The effectiveness of such retrofits was estimated also in terms of energy saving. Test results demonstrated a high variability of the building <b>air</b> tightness after <b>window</b> retrofits, despite the fact that <b>air</b> tight-certified <b>windows</b> were used...|$|R
