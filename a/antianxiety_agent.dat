40|$|Bone Marrow Transplantation is {{considered}} one of the main procedures used in the treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. Psychological factors after Bone Marrow Transplantation have an important role in the survival of the patients undergoing this procedure. In the present study, some parameters including depression, anxiety and cognition were assessed during both pre and post-transplantation in patients undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation. The evaluations were performed by utilizing several questionnaires including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Wechsler Memory Scale within 72 hours after hospitalization (pre-transplantation) and one month after transplantation (post-transplantation). All patients received intensive chemotherapy during the first 72 hours after hospitalization. Paired t test was used to compare pre and post values. SPSS (version 18) was used to analysis the data. The significance level was defined as p < 0. 05. Twenty one patients who were not receiving any <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agents</b> at least for two weeks prior to and during this study were included. It was noted that anxiety was significantly less at post-transplantation compared to its pre-transplantation level (P = 0. 008). However, no significant difference was found between pre and post-transplantation depression. Memory function was significantly improved at post-transplantation compared to pre-transplantation (P = 0. 001). The authors suggest that the improvement of anxiety and memory status of the patients one month after the bone marrow transplantation is expected even in the absence of consumption of any <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agents.</b> However, antidepressants may be needed to help those patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation...|$|R
50|$|An {{anxiolytic}} (also antipanic or <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agent)</b> is {{the medication}} or other intervention that inhibits anxiety.

40|$|While the {{prevalence}} of psychotropic drug use among older persons has been widely investigated, use of these agents in older persons with developmental disabilities has received little attention. We found this latter group to be prescribed more polypharmacy, antipsychotic, and <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agents</b> than were younger peers. Those who lived in more restricted residential settings (e. g., in skilled nursing facihties or in rural areas) had higher prevalence rates of antipsychotic drug use. In light of these findings, implications for policymakers are described. Measures to ensure {{the appropriateness of the}} prescription should be established. Better monitoring of polypharmacy and drug side effects should be initiated. Active programming should continue throughout the lifespan and training should be conducted for service providers. Our purpose is to describe issues and policy implications based on a study on {{the prevalence}} and patterns of psychotropic drug use among older persons with developmental disabilities. The prevalence of psychotropic medications among persons with developmental disabil-ities has been well documented. Lipman (1970) found that approximately 39. 2 % of clients in state or private institutions were prescribed a major tranquilizer. Subsequent studies report similar percentages (Intagliata & Rinck, 1985; Silva, 1979; Sprague, 1977). Surveys of drug use in community-placed clients indicate a lower prevalence.

40|$|The {{clinician}} {{is faced}} with a bewildering array of available sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers, as well as continuous pressure from patients, the popular media, and the pharmaceutical industry, encouraging and demanding {{the use of these}} drugs. Under these influences the rational use of sedatives and hypnotics is not easily achieved. Current evidence favors the benzodiazepine derivatives, although they are far from ideal. Flurazepam allows "physiologic " sleep and has a low potential for abuse. Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and oxazepam are effective <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agents.</b> Suicide is virtually impossible with the benzodiazepines, and these agents probably do not interact with oral anticoagulants. Obviously, sedatives and hypnotics are best reserved for situations in which the possible benefit for the patient outweighs the risk {{associated with the use of}} the drug. HYPNOTIC, sedative, soporific, and tranquilizer are terms used to characterize a large group of central nervous system-depressant drugs. The words them-selves have so often been interchangeably applied that many physicians now consider them synonymous.

25|$|<b>Antianxiety</b> <b>agents</b> (benzodiazepines): Use of benzodiazepines for panic {{disorder}} is controversial with opinion differing {{in the medical}} literature. The American Psychiatric Association states that benzodiazepines can be effective {{for the treatment of}} {{panic disorder}} and recommends that the choice of whether to use benzodiazepines, antidepressants with anti-panic properties or psychotherapy should be based on the individual patient's history and characteristics. Other experts believe that benzodiazepines are best avoided due to the risks of the development of tolerance and physical dependence. The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, say that benzodiazepines should not be used as a first-line treatment option but are an option for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder. Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety as recommended best practice, benzodiazepines have remained a commonly used medication for panic disorder. They reported that in their view there is insufficient evidence to recommend one treatment over another for panic disorder. The APA noted that while benzodiazepines have the advantage of a rapid onset of action, that this is offset by the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence came to a different conclusion, they pointed out the problems of using uncontrolled clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and based on placebo-controlled research they concluded that benzodiazepines were not effective in the long-term for panic disorder and recommended that benzodiazepines not be used for longer than 4 weeks for panic disorder. Instead NICE clinical guidelines recommend alternative pharmacotherapeutic or psychotherapeutic interventions.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role of maternal behavior on {{the long-term effects of}} postnatal manipulation (15 min of daily separation from the dam and exposure to clean bedding from Day 1 to Day 14 of postnatal life) on emotionality in the mouse. Mothers were treated with an <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agent</b> (Chlordiazepoxide: 5 mg/kg), daily upon removal of the litter from the nest. Emotionality in adult offspring was tested in the elevated plus maze. Mice manipulated during postnatal development were more explorative and less anxious than unhandled mice, but this effect was not observable in the offspring of Chlordiazepoxide-treated dams. No effect of maternal Chlordiazepoxide was observed in unhandled offspring. The pharmacological treatment of the mother did not affect either pups' ultrasonic calling during separation, or maternal behavior far apart from the daily manipulation sessions. By contrast, Chlordiazepoxide-treated dams were less responsive toward pups upon reunion following daily separation. This alteration of dams' behavior was not related to alterations in the amount of ultrasonic calls emitted by pups during reunion. Finally, when dams were daily injected with Chlordiazepoxide far apart from pups' removal, the pharmacological treatment was devoid of effects. These results support the view that the mother-infant interaction which follows separation {{plays a major role in}} determining the effects of postnatal manipulations on adult emotionality...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{the delta}} opioid {{receptor}} in regulating anxiety-like behavior in male Sprague–Dawley rats was examined. Using an elevated plus maze, {{the effects of the}} selective delta opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (1 or 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and agonist SNC 80 (1, 5 or 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) on anxiety-like behavior were measured. Anxiety was also measured following administration of diazepam (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and amphetamine (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and compared to the effects of SNC 80. Locomotor activity following administration of naltrindole, SNC 80, diazepam, and amphetamine was measured. Finally, the defensive burying paradigm was used to confirm the findings from the elevated plus maze. Results demonstrated that SNC 80 produced dose-dependent anxiolytic effects {{similar to that of the}} classical <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agent,</b> diazepam. Administration of naltrindole caused anxiogenic behavior in rats further supporting the involvement of the delta opioid receptor system in regulating anxiety. Naltrindole also blocked the anxiolytic effects of SNC 80. Amphetamine had no effect on anxiety-like behavior. SNC 80 induced hyperactivity similar to amphetamine at the doses tested, while naltrindole and diazepam did not significantly affect locomotor activity. Although SNC 80 can increase locomotor activity, control experiments reported herein indicate that hyperlocomotion is not sufficient to produce an anxiolytic response on the elevated plus maze. Together with the results from the defensive burying paradigm, this suggests that the effects of SNC 80 on reducing anxiety are independent of its effects on locomotion. Collectively these data show that the delta opioid receptor system can regulate anxiety-like behavior in an anxiolytic (agonist) and anxiogenic (antagonist) manner...|$|E

40|$|Chronic daily {{headache}} (CDH) affects approximately 4 %– 5 % of {{the population}} and encompasses a number of different diagnoses, including transformed migraine, chron-ic tension-type headache, new-onset daily persistent headache, and hemicrania continua [1]. The goals of pro-phylactic therapy in chronic headaches are (a) to reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of headache attacks; (b) to improve responsiveness to treatment of acute attacks; (c) to improve function; and (d) to reduce disability. Several phar-macologic treatment options for chronic headaches exist, including serotonin agonists, ergots, antidepressants, anti-convulsants, muscle relaxants, serotonin antagonists, <b>antianxiety</b> <b>agents,</b> and other miscellaneous drugs. Major depression and migraine are commonly comorbid and, therefore, antidepressants are often used to prevent chronic headache, but their effectiveness is uncertain. To evaluate the usefulness of antidepressants in the prophylactic treatment of chronic headaches, a meta-analysis of English-language, randomized placebo-con-trolled trials was recently performed [2]. Thirty-eight tri-als were included in the study. Twenty-five studies focused on migraines, 12 on tension headaches, and 1 on both entities. Of these studies, 19 used tricyclic antide-pressants, 18 serotonin antagonists, and 7 selective sero-tonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients receiving antidepres-sants were twice as likely to report headache reduction. The average amount of reduction was 0. 94 (95 % CI: 0. 65 – 1. 2), an effect considered large. Treated patients also consumed less analgesic medication. There were no dif-ferences in outcomes among the three classes of agents studied or among the type of headache (migraine vs. ten-sion), quality score, length of treatment, or percentage of patients lost to follow-up. Thus, the authors concluded that antidepressants are effective in preventing chronic headaches. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a mainstay in the prophylactic therapy of migraine and chronic tension-type headache. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, clomipramine, and doxepin have been the major agents for prophylactic treat-ment of migraine. Amitriptyline has been more frequentl...|$|R

It is used in the United States as an <b>antianxiety</b> and sedative <b>agent.</b> Case report. A previously healthy 14 -year-old female was admitted to the hospital with hepatic failure. Initial therapy, including plasmapheresis, was unsuccessful and she deteriorated. She ultimately required a liver transplant and now remains well. The liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis consistent with chemical hepatitis. A work-up for alternative causes of liver failure was negative. The patient gave a history of taking a kava kava–containing product for four months. The use of kava kava and liver failure, is supported by kava kava use, a negative work-up for alternative causes of liver failure, and histological changes in the liver. Conclusions. Health care professionals need to be aware of the possibility of kava kava– induced hepatotoxicity. The toxicity of these alternative remedies emphasizes the importance of surveillance programs and quality control in the manufacture of these products.

A novel series of Schiff bases based on of 4 -(benzylideneamino) - 5 -phenyl- 4 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 3 -thiol scaffold was prepared by heating thiocarbohydrazide and substituted benzoic acid and subsequently, treating with substituted benzaldehydes. Seventeen derivatives were synthesized and were biologically screened for antifungal and antibacterial activity. The newly synthesized derivatives of triazole showed antifungal activity against fungal species, Microsporum gypseum; and antibacterial activity against bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus. It was observed that none of the compounds tested showed positive results for fungi Candida albicans fungi Aspergillus niger, nor against bacterial strain Escherichia coli. Strong antifungal effects were obtained for the synthesized compounds against M. gypseum and were superior or comparable to standard drug ketoconazole. Similarly, all of the synthesized compounds exhibit strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus and were superior or comparable to standard drug streptomycin. It was found that among the triazole derivatives so synthesized, six of them, showed antifungal activity superior to ketoconazole while one of them, showed antibacterial activity superior to streptomycin.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Negative {{effects of}} {{restraint}} use have been well-documented. However, {{the prevalence of}} restraints use has been high in long-term care facilities in Hong Kong compared with other countries and this goes against {{the basic principles of}} ethical and compassionate care for older people. The present study aimed to review the change in the prevalence of physical and chemical restraint use in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) over a period of 11 years in Hong Kong and to identify the major factors associated with their use. METHODS: This is an observational study with data obtained from the Hong Kong Longitudinal Study on LTCF Residents between 2005 and 2015. Trained assessors (nurses, social workers, and therapists) used the Minimum Data Set Resident Assessment Instrument to collect the data from 10 residential LTCFs. Physical restraint was defined as the use of any of the following: full bedside rails on all open sides of bed, other types of bedside rails used, trunk restraint, limb restraint, or the use of chair to prevent rising during the past 7 days. Chemical restraint was defined as the use of any of the following medications: antipsychotic, <b>antianxiety,</b> or hypnotic <b>agents</b> during past 7 days, excluding elder residents with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness. OUTCOMES: Annual prevalence of restraint use over 11 years and factors that were {{associated with the use of}} physical and chemical restraints. RESULTS: We analyzed the data for 2896 older people (978 male individuals, mean age = 83. 3 years). Between 2005 and 2015, the prevalence of restraint use was as follows: physical restraint use increased from 52. 7 % to 70. 2 %; chemical restraint use increased from 15. 9 % to 21. 78 %; and either physical or chemical restraint use increased from 57. 9 % to 75. 7 %. Physical restraint use was independently associated with older age, impaired activities of daily living or cognitive function, bowel and bladder incontinence, dementia, and negative mood. Chemical restraint use was independently associated with older age, falls, bladder incontinence, use of feeding tube, dementia, poor cognitive function, delirium, behavioral problems, and negative mood. The increasing time-trend of physical but not chemical restraint use remained significant after adjusting for other factors as mentioned above (coefficient = 0. 092, P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of physical and chemical restraint was highly prevalent among LTCF residents in Hong Kong, with an increasing trend over a period of 11 years, especially targeting the most physically and cognitively frail older people. Appropriate healthcare staff education and policy change are urgently needed to ensure personal care that is characterized by respect, dignity, empathy, and compassion for the older generation...|$|R
