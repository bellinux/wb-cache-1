60|$|But it's {{farther to}} be noted, {{that the most}} {{luminous}} of the Prismatick Colours are the yellow and orange. These affect the Senses more strongly than all the rest together, and next to these in strength are the red and green. The blue compared with these is a faint and dark Colour, and the indigo and violet are much darker and fainter, so that these compared with the stronger Colours are little to be regarded. The Images of Objects are therefore to be placed, not in the Focus of the mean refrangible Rays, which are in the Confine of green and blue, but in the Focus of those Rays which {{are in the middle}} of the orange and yellow; there where the Colour is most luminous and fulgent, that is in the brightest yellow, that yellow which inclines more to orange than to green. And by the Refraction of these Rays (whose Sines of Incidence and Refraction in Glass are as 17 and 11) the Refraction of Glass and Crystal for Optical Uses is to be measured. Let us therefore place the Image of the Object in the Focus of these Rays, and all the yellow and orange will fall within a Circle, whose Diameter is about the 250th Part of the Diameter of the Aperture of the Glass. And if you add the brighter half of the red, (that half which is next the orange) and the brighter half of the green, (that half which is next the yellow) about three fifth Parts of the Light of these two Colours will fall within the same Circle, and two fifth Parts will fall without it round about; and that which falls without will be spread through almost as much more space as that which falls within, and so in the gross be almost three times rarer. Of the other half of the red and green, (that is of the deep dark red and willow green) about one quarter will fall within this Circle, and three quarters without, and that which falls without will be spread through about four or five times more space than that which falls within; and so in the gross be rarer, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>compared</b> with the whole Light within it, will be about 25 times rarer than all that taken in the gross; or rather more than 30 or 40 times rarer, because the deep red in the end of the Spectrum of Colours made by a Prism is very thin and rare, and the willow green is something rarer than the orange and yellow. The Light of these Colours therefore being so very much rarer than that within the Circle, will scarce affect the Sense, especially since the deep red and willow green of this Light, are much darker Colours than the rest. And for the same reason the blue and violet being much darker Colours than these, and much more rarified, may be neglected. For the dense and bright Light of the Circle, will obscure the rare and weak Light of these dark Colours round about it, and render them almost insensible. The sensible Image of a lucid Point is therefore scarce broader than a Circle, whose Diameter is the 250th Part of the Diameter of the Aperture of the Object-glass of a good Telescope, or not much broader, if you except a faint and dark misty Light round about it, which a Spectator will scarce regard. And therefore in a Telescope, whose Aperture is four Inches, and Length an hundred Feet, it exceeds not 2´´ 45´´´, or 3´´. And in a Telescope whose Aperture is two Inches, and Length 20 or 30 Feet, it may be 5´´ or 6´´, and scarce above. And this answers well to Experience: For some Astronomers have found the Diameters of the fix'd Stars, in Telescopes of between 20 and 60 Feet in length, to be about 5´´ or 6´´, or at most 8´´ or 10´´ in diameter. But if the Eye-Glass be tincted faintly with the Smoak of a Lamp or Torch, to obscure the Light of the Star, the fainter Light in the Circumference of the Star ceases to be visible, and the Star (if the Glass be sufficiently soiled with Smoak) appears something more like a mathematical Point. And for the same Reason, the enormous Part of the Light in the Circumference of every lucid Point ought to be less discernible in shorter Telescopes than in longer, because the shorter transmit less Light to the Eye.|$|E

40|$|The {{desorption}} of solutes from solid matrices under supercritical conditions {{has found}} many {{applications such as}} in soil remediation and in activated carbon regeneration. Soil remediation by SF’s has been proposed as alternative to incineration, vapour extraction, bioremediation, vapour stripping and thermal extraction. The SF extraction of contaminants will be influenced by temperature, pressure, water content of the soil, cosolvent’s effect and organic substance content. The regeneration of activated carbon used in wastewater’s treatment and in contaminated stream purification, can be performed with vapor stripping, liquid-liquid extraction and thermal regeneration. SF regeneration has been proposed since {{it is possible to}} regenerate spent carbon in situ avoiding losses of carbon due to friction <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>compared</b> with thermal regeneration, it is a process with lower losses of carbon (due to the oxidation of adsorbed substances) and less severe operating conditions. Many studies have been reported for the separation of oxygenated therpenes from hydrocarboned therpenes and of some benzopirones using silica gels as adsorbent. The recovery of nitrogen compounds from coal tar fraction and the separation of cholesterol from butter oil was also investigated. Our objective was to investigate the feasibility of a separation of alpha-tocopherol from alpha-tocopherol acetate in a desorption process. Experimental data are presented for adsorption and desorption of alpha-tocopherol from alpha-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) on/from activated carbon and silica gels with different surface area values in the presence of supercritical carbon dioxide. In order to verify if supercritical carbon dioxide is a simple carrier fluid or it is also adsorbed, adsorption of carbon dioxide on the adsorbents mentioned above has been determined gravimetrically and reported. Finally the different behavior of alpha-tocopherol from alpha-tocopherol acetate (related to solute-adsorbent-SF interaction) suggests the desorption process for the separation of the two tocopherols as an alternative to traditional methods...|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Medicina Nuclear - Área de especialização: RadiofarmáciaDada a atual conjuntura económica e social, torna-se cada vez mais importante rentabilizar os recursos nos serviços de Medicina Nuclear, de modo a reduzir os custos, nomeadamente na gestão dos radiofármacos utilizados. Neste sentido, os procedimentos devem ser otimizados e novas estratégias definidas, sem comprometer a qualidade dos radiofármacos e, consequentemente a realização dos exames de diagnóstico e/ou terapia. Tratando-se de uma prática com pouco suporte bibliográfico, torna-se importante avaliar a sua influência na qualidade do produto final, pois pode ser vantajosa na gestão de recursos por parte dos serviços. Neste estudo, com o objetivo de contribuir para um melhor aproveitamento e gestão de kits para marcação com 99 mTc, procedeu-se ao fracionamento de kits de Hidroximetileno difosfonato (HMDP - Osteocis®), cujas frações foram armazenadas no congelador e refrigerador, para {{posterior}} utilização. Após marcação das frações com 99 mTc, realizou-se o controlo do pH e da pureza radioquímica, de modo a testar se estariam de acordo com as especificações do fabricante e da Farmacopeia. Simultaneamente analisou-se a influência da temperatura de armazenamento e da idade das frações. Com vista a estudar o padrão de biodistribuição dos radiofármacos obtidos por fracionamento, efetuaram-se medições de atividades nos principais órgãos em murganhos Balb C. Os resultados obtidos foram comparados aos de um frasco de kit não fracionado, isto é, seguindo as indicações do fabricante. Sendo imprescindível realizar todos os procedimentos em assepsia, efetuou-se o controlo bacteriológico da câmara de fluxo laminar e do refrigerador. Com base nos resultados deste estudo, constatou-se que: 1) o valor de pH (5, 5) do frasco padrão e das frações se manteve constante; 2) a gama dos valores de pureza radioquímica das frações variou entre 91 % e 98 %, não sendo significativa a diferença entre as frações refrigeradas e as frações congeladas, e em relação ao frasco padrão (98 %); 3) os perfis de biodistribuição relativos ao frasco padrão e às frações foram semelhantes; 4) as frações podem ser utilizadas até 4 dias após o fracionamento; 5) a câmara de fluxo laminar e o refrigerador utilizados reuniam as condições de assepsia requeridas para o estudo. ABSTRACT - Given {{the current}} economic and social situation, it becomes increasingly important to capitalize the resources of Nuclear Medicine services {{in order to reduce}} costs, particularly in the management of the radioactive drugs used. In this sense, the procedures should be optimized and new strategies defined, without compromising the quality of the radiopharmaceuticals obtained, and therefore the achievement of scintigraphic studies or radionuclide therapy. Being a practice poorly supported by literature, it is important to assess its influence {{on the quality of the}} final product, because it may be advantageous in the management of resources by the services. In this study, in order to maximize the use of 99 mTc-labeled diphosphonates, the fractionation of HMDP (hydroxymethylene diphosphonate - Osteocis®) kits was performed, and the resulting fractions were stored in the freezer and refrigerator, for later use. After labeling the fractions with 99 mTc, the control of pH and radiochemical purity was performed, in order to test if they satisfy the manufacturer's and Pharmacopoeia’s specifications. Simultaneously, the influence of storage temperature and age of the fractions were analyzed. In order to study the biodistribution profile of the radiopharmaceutical obtained by fractionation, the activity retained in the major organs was measured in mice Balb C. The results were compared to a non-fractionated vial kit, which was labeled with 99 mTc following the manufacturer's instructions. Being necessary to perform all the procedures under aseptic conditions, a bacteriological control was carried out in the refrigerator, as well as in the laminar flow chamber. Based on the results of this study, it was found that: 1) the pH value (5. 5) remained the same in non-fractionated vial kit and in the fractions; 2) the values of the radiochemical purity of the fractions ranged between 91 % e 98 %, being not significant differences between fractions stored in the freezer and refrigerator, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>compared</b> to non-fractionated vial kit (98 %); 3) the biodistribution profiles of the non-fractionated vial kit and the fractions were similar; 4) fractions can be used until 4 days after the fractionation of the vials; 5) the laminar flow chamber and the refrigerator used had the aseptic condition required for this study...|$|E

When there is a complete occlusion of superior mesenteric vein (SMV), the findings are more evident <b>and</b> striking <b>if</b> <b>compared</b> with arterial etiology as it was recently described in an animal experimental model [36]. The SMV occlusion causes impairment in the intestinal vein drainage with consequent vascular engorgement, swelling, and hemorrhage of the bowel wall, with extravasation of fluid from the bowel wall and mesentery into the peritoneal cavity. Venous occlusion causes mucosal edema and punctate hemorrhage that progress to widespread hemorrhages. Progression of the thrombosis and inadequate collateral circulation leads to infarction of the jejunum and the ileum [37].|$|R
