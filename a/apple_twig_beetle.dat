Also {{known as the}} <b>apple</b> <b>twig</b> borer, adult <b>beetles</b> tunnel into live grape canes (or <b>apple</b> <b>twigs)</b> during late summer or early fall damaging and reducing the fruitfulness of the affected canes. In New York State significant damage has historically occurred near Keuka Lake, and this beetle is also found across the Finger Lakes and Lake Erie growing regions {{as well as other}} grape-growing areas in the east...|$|R
5000|$|The walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{commonly}} associated with the fungus Geosmithia morbida that causes damage ranging from discoloration in some species of walnuts to mortality in others. [...] "Thousand cankers disease" [...] was given its name because {{of the magnitude of}} galleries and subsequent cankers created by the disturbance regime of walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> and Geosmithia morbida. The black walnuts only survived for several years after the start of feeding by the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle.</b> However other species of walnut that are more regenerative towards Geosmithia morbida allowed the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> to feed for longer.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{observations}} of walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> activity in Arizona walnut {{indicate that the}} beetle in this host functions as a 'typical' <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> of the genus Pityophthorus, restricting breeding to overshaded or damaged branches and twigs. The appearance of extensive colonization of trees by walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> have only been observed in black walnut, a species native to {{the eastern half of}} the US but planted widely in the western states over the past century.|$|R
50|$|The walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> is not {{the first}} bark beetle to be {{associated}} with a species of Geosmithia. The deaths of black walnut trees associated with the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> are not caused by the beetle but instead Geosmithia morbida. The origin of Geosmithia morbida is not known, but experts strongly believe that its emergence is connected to the walnut tree beetle and the Arizona walnut tree, and was not caused by the transfer of the disease from another area but instead by an evolutionary change in a similar species of fungi that inhabited closely to where the beetle was first identified. The fungus and beetle have developed a symbiotic relationship in which the fungus allows itself to be eaten by the beetle in return for a ride to the fungi's next host. The walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle’s</b> hard shell covers two wings, and because the beetle can fly, Geosmithia morbida is reliant on the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> to be spread across distances, making the fungus entomochoric, or completely dependent upon the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> and only found in habitats with the beetle.|$|R

50|$|The walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1928 in Arizona inhabiting the Arizona walnut tree, Juglans major. The movement of this insect from Arizona {{to the surrounding}} areas was recorded in 1959 in Los Angeles when the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> was collected from both the black walnut and the native southern California black walnut, Juglans californica. Recently the beetle and fungus have spread to areas of the United States with much colder climates. In Denver, Colorado during 2001 the first cases of black walnut mortality due to cankerous sores caused by the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> and the fungus, Geosmithia morbida, which the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> carries, were recorded, and by 2008 {{nearly all of the}} black walnuts in Denver, Colorado had been eliminated. A similar instance occurred during this same time period in Delta, a city nearly four hundred kilometers west of Denver. Bark beetles are a major natural disturbance in North American forests, in recent history affecting more area annually than fire does.|$|R
50|$|This {{appears to}} have been preceded by unusual black walnut {{mortality}} during the mid-1990s of undetermined cause that were noted in the vicinity of Logan, Utah. Collections of walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> were made in 1996 in association with this outbreak. A 1988 collection of walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> from the Provo area, collected incidentally when sweeping vegetation, appears to be a precedent first collection of this species in the state.|$|R
5000|$|Several data seem {{to support}} this hypothesis. The walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> is a normal {{associate}} of Arizona walnut and was first described in 1929 from a collection near Silver City (Lone Mountain) in Grant County, New Mexico. Subsequent reviews of North American bark beetles through 1992 only note walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> from areas {{within the range of}} Arizona walnut, excepting the two 1959 captures in Los Angeles County, where southern California walnut is native.|$|R

5000|$|New {{state records}} of walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> have {{occurred}} in several other western states within the past 12 years including Oregon (1997), Idaho (2003) and Washington (2008). Most collections from these states were associated with walnut die-offs, although the beetle has also been incidentally collected in Lindgren funnel traps used for survey of other forest pests. Walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> records in California date to 1959, when it was found in Los Angeles County; known range extensions for this species within the state have increased widely {{in recent years and}} it is now known to be widely distributed within the state.|$|R
50|$|Geosmithia morbida is {{a species}} of {{anamorphic}} fungus that, together with {{the activity of the}} walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle,</b> causes thousand cankers disease in species of walnut trees (Juglans spp.). It was described as new to science in 2010 from specimens collected in the southern United States. The fungus, transmitted by the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle,</b> Pityophthorus juglandis, is known from the western USA from California to Colorado. The cankers resulting from infection restrict nutrient flow and typically kill the host tree within three to four years. Based on closeness of internal transcribed spacer DNA, the closest relative of G. morbida is G. fassatiae. The specific epithet morbida refers to the deadly pathogenic effect it has on its host.|$|R
5000|$|Thousand cankers is a {{recently}} described disease and its involvement in tree mortality apparently is also recent. The first published note involving black walnut die-offs that likely can be contributed to TCD {{occurred in the}} Espanola Valley of northern New Mexico in 2001. Walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> were associated with this unusual cluster of walnut mortality, but drought was originally {{thought to be the}} cause. A parallel situation occurred in eastern Colorado during the early 2000s where unexplained black walnut deaths were observed in several sites (Colorado Springs, Boulder, Westminster) and originally thought to be associated with drought. Walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> were subsequently recovered in 2004, which constituted a new state record for the species.|$|R
50|$|Pityophthorus juglandis, {{also known}} as the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> for feeding on several {{different}} species of walnut trees, Juglans, is one of only a few species in the genus Pityophthorus that is associated with hardwoods and the only one associated with feeding on walnut trees.|$|R
5000|$|Pityophthorus juglandis {{can easily}} be {{distinguished}} from other members of its genus. Curtis Utley, a researcher at Colorado State University, elaborates on these differences stating, [...] "Among these differences there are the 4 to 6 concentric rows of asperities on the prothorax, usually broken and overlapping at the median line. The declivity {{at the end of}} the wing covers is steep, very shallowly bisulcate, and at the apex it is generally flattened with small granules." [...] The walnut twig beetles' small size is common for its genus. Adult beetles average between 1.5 to 1.9 millimeters in length. Although little is known about the life-cycle of the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle,</b> during experimentation with the beetle in a controlled environment, the lifespan of one generation of walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> was seven weeks after logs of black walnut, Juglans nigra, were harvested from the wild in May, marking what scientists think is the beginning of the feeding season of the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle.</b> Gatherings of the beetle in sections of the walnut tree are known as galleries. The outward appearance of the walnut above these galleries seemed normal except for small beetle entrance holes. In later stages of decline, beetle entrance holes and galleries were found scattered every 2 to 5 centimeters, essentially crippling the tree.|$|R
50|$|Adult walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> carry spores of the Geosmithia morbida fungus, which grows profusely {{around the}} pupal {{chamber of the}} beetles. Following {{emergence}} from trees the beetles subsequently tunnel into branches and trunks of walnut for production of egg galleries or overwintering shelters. The fungus is introduced into the tree during this wounding where it subsequently germinates and grows.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} {{thousand}} cankers disease remains {{a subject of}} some uncertainty and its resolution will require further studies likely based on genetic analyses. One proposal suggests that the disease is resulted from a host transfer of the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> and its Geosmithia associate from native, resistant Juglans (Arizona walnut and possibly southern California walnut) into susceptible species of walnut.|$|R
40|$|The {{geographic}} {{range of the}} Douglas-fir <b>twig</b> <b>beetle,</b> Pityophthorus orarius Bright, was extended beyond the original provenance of southern British Columbia to northern California. A survey of 457 Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] trees in 1985 revealed that those with heavy cone crops {{were more likely to}} be infested by <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> than were those with a light crop. Furthermore, attack rates differed among clones. A second survey done in 1987 confirmed the importance of clone and cone crop in attack rate. In this survey, stressed trees were attacked at a higher rate than unstressed trees. Beetle distributions appeared clumped in both surveys, possibly because of semio-chemicals or oviposition behavior. Rappaport, N. G., et D. L. Wood. 1994.

5000|$|Regardless {{there has}} been a broad range {{extension}} of the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> within the past 15 years so that it currently is known from all western states for which it has been surveyed (AZ, CA, CO, ID, OR, UT, WA). Whether this has occurred through natural dispersal events or by human transport of <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> infested walnut products (e.g., firewood, fresh cut logs, wood pieces used by woodworkers) is not known. The most recent finding of the beetle, in the Knoxville, Tennessee area, clearly is the result of human transport of walnut twig beetle-containing walnut wood, the original event probably occurring a decade or more ago. Walnut wood is extremely infectious (i.e., contains fungus bearing bark beetles) for at least 2-3 years after trees are cut. The beetles are capable of surviving on small pieces of wood, as long as some bark is attached, and some beetles can even survive normal wood chipping.|$|R

5000|$|A disease complex {{known as}} {{thousand}} cankers disease has been threatening black walnut in several western states. [...] This disease {{has recently been}} discovered in Tennessee, and could potentially have devastating effects on the species in the eastern United States. Vectored by the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> (Pityophthorus juglandis), Geosmithia morbida spreads into the wood around the galleries carved by the small beetles. The fungus causes cankers that inhibit the movement of nutrients in black walnut, leading to crown and branch dieback, and ultimately death.|$|R
50|$|The Geosmithia fungus, {{although}} recently described, {{is consistently}} found where ever walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetles</b> are recovered, including {{those associated with}} Arizona walnut. In Arizona walnut, laboratory inoculations indicate that it grows slowly, particularly compared to black walnut, and thousand cankers disease has not been observed to develop in native stands of this species that grow in Arizona and New Mexico. Optimum temperatures for development of the Geosmithia fungus are high, also suggesting a warm climate origin, a feature {{that is consistent with}} the native distribution of Arizona walnut.|$|R
50|$|Thousand cankers {{disease is}} a {{recently}} recognized disease of certain walnuts (Juglans spp.). The disease results from the combined activity of the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> (Pityophthorus juglandis) and a canker producing fungus, Geosmithia morbida. Until July 2010 the disease was only known to the western United States where {{over the past decade}} it has been involved in several large scale die-offs of walnut, particularly black walnut, Juglans nigra. However, in late July 2010 a well-established outbreak of the disease was found in the Knoxville, Tennessee area. This new finding is the first locating it within the native range of its susceptible host, black walnut.|$|R
50|$|Human {{intervention}} in disturbances related to tree extinction because of infectious disease or invasive wildlife {{has historically been}} costly and therefore limited at best. Pruning a tree is one way humans combat fungi spread by bark beetles, and has been the reported course of action to take when dealing with similar fungi such as the Dutch elm disease. Bark beetles usually feast on limbs no greater than 10 cm in diameter, spreading Dutch elm disease {{to a place that}} is still manageable to prune. However, the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> is not limited to attacking the limbs. Because the beetle can attack the trunk, pruning is rendered useless. In 2010 an outbreak of both Geosmithia morbida and the walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle</b> was identified in the community of Knoxville, Tennessee, threatening over 27 million black walnuts in Tennessee alone. The establishment of quarantine in the area was enacted, denoting a most drastic need {{to stop the spread of}} the disease. Since then several other states have enacted an exterior state quarantine in order to stop the spread of these pests into their states. Currently the most successful cure for Geosmithia morbida is the insertion of sterile agar into the site of the infection. However, since the magnitude of the number of holes in one tree bored by the walnut tree beetle is so great, this method does not seem to be an effective solution either. Community officials claim that the best thing people can do is not transport firewood, limiting the human spread of the disease.|$|R

40|$|Using {{next-generation}} sequencing, 18 microsatellite loci {{were developed}} and characterized for walnut <b>twig</b> <b>beetle,</b> Pityophthorus juglandis, a vector of thousand cankers disease (TCD) affecting Juglans spp. Although all Juglans species {{are susceptible to}} TCD infection, native populations of J. nigra and J. cinerea, which is endangered in Canada, are most susceptible and threatened by habitat loss. Novel primers amplified di-, tri-, and tetra nucleotide repeats and detected 4 – 14 alleles per locus. Averaged observed and expected heterozygosity was 0. 22 and 0. 67, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the impact of drought on insect-tree relationships. Survival and feeding {{performances}} of leaf-beetles, Chrysomela populi put in cages with leaves of host-plants submitted to different levels of water stress were compared. Ninety 1 -year-old poplar (Populus × euramericana) cuttings were grown in a greenhouse, and distributed into 3 groups submitted to different water treatments during six weeks. Adult C. populi were then encaged for four days with these cuttings, together with the five terminal leaves of a <b>twig.</b> <b>Beetle</b> survival and consumed leaf areas were then determined. Predawn leaf water potential values indicated that the drought treatments induced different levels of plant water stress. Plant height growth and total leaf numbers were reduced by plant stress. Beetle survival and leaf areas eaten were also reduced proportionally to plant water deficit. In conclusion, this experiment suggests that drought has a negative impact on C. populi survival and feeding. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2010. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
