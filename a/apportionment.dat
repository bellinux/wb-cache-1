5|$|Washington {{exercised}} {{his presidential}} veto {{power for the}} first time on April 5, 1792 to stop an <b>apportionment</b> act from becoming law. The legislation introduced a new plan for distributed seats in the House of Representatives among the various states in a way that the president deemed unconstitutional. After attempting but failing to override the veto, Congress swiftly crafted new legislation, the <b>Apportionment</b> Act of 1792, which Washington signed into law on April 14.|$|E
5|$|Congressional Districts are reapportioned {{among the}} states {{following}} each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single member districts to conform with the census <b>apportionment.</b> The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland House of Delegates is {{the lower}} house of the Maryland General Assembly, the state {{legislature}} of the U.S. State of Maryland. Three delegates are elected from each district, though some districts are divided into sub-districts. In the original state constitution, four delegates were elected from each county to one-year terms, and two were elected {{from each of the}} major early cities of Baltimore and Annapolis. Reforms in the 1830s, however, led to the <b>apportionment</b> of delegates by population rather than geography, and by 1922, delegates served four year terms. The modern system of <b>apportionment</b> of seats began in 1972, when 47 districts of roughly equal population were identified, although sub-districts were created to ensure local representation for areas with too little population to warrant an entire district.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of <b>apportionment</b> was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden was {{appointed}} to the United States Senate in 1842, filling the vacancy caused by Clay's resignation. In January 1843, he was elected to a full term over Richard Mentor Johnson. The Whigs' feud with President Tyler continued unabated, and some even talked of impeaching him, but Crittenden condemned that course of action. During the 27th and 28th Congresses, he served on the Committee on Military Affairs. He was an advocate of moderate protective tariffs and federal internal improvements. He opposed giving states the option to forgo <b>apportionment,</b> which would have allowed them to elect their congressmen at-large.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 {{the state}} <b>Apportionment</b> Board, {{controlled}} by a 32 Republican majority despite the party's 6138 minority in the state House of Representatives, redrew state legislative districts following {{the results of the}} 1990 Census, in the hope of retaking control of the state House. The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with the twenty-two-year incumbent Mike Stinziano. Unable to be elected in another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to run for re-election.|$|E

5|$|The third case, Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington (Puyallup III), {{was decided}} in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing {{that under the}} {{doctrine}} of sovereign immunity, Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing {{for a majority of}} the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe's sovereign immunity, the state could regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river that ran through the Puyallup Reservation as long as the state could base its decision and <b>apportionment</b> on conservation grounds.|$|E
5|$|Under , {{the basis}} of {{representation}} of each state in the House of Representatives was determined by adding three-fifths of each state's slave population to its free population. Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of <b>apportionment.</b> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase {{the political power of}} the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.|$|E
5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His {{original}} proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave <b>apportionment</b> of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E

40|$|Quantifying source <b>apportionments</b> of {{nutrient}} load and their variations among seasons and hydrological years can provide useful information for watershed {{nutrient load}} reduction programs. There are large seasonal and inter-annual variations in nutrient loads and their sources in semi-arid watersheds {{that have a}} monsoon climate. The Generalized Watershed Loading Function model was used to simulate monthly nutrient loads from 2004 to 2011 in the Liu River watershed, Northern China. Model results were used to investigate nutrient load contributions from different sources, temporal variations of source <b>apportionments</b> and {{the differences in the}} behavior of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Examination of source <b>apportionments</b> for different seasons showed that point sources were the main source of TN and TP in the non-flood season, whereas contributions from diffuse sources, such as rural runoff, soil erosion, and urban areas, were much higher in the flood season. Furthermore, results for three typical hydrological years showed that the contribution ratios of nutrient loads from point sources increased as streamflow decreased, while contribution ratios from rural runoff and urban area increased as streamflow increased. Further, there were significant differences between TN and TP sources on different time scales. Our findings suggest that priority actions and management measures should be changed for different time periods and hydrological conditions, and that different strategies should be used to reduce loads of nitrogen and phosphorus effectively...|$|R
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of <b>apportionment.</b> The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper house would be the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey and {{all other}} U.S. states comport with the {{requirement}} of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which sought to set a national standard of 21 as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages. To make states comply, Congress tied a state's failure to enact a drinking age at 21 to a punitive decrease in a state's <b>apportionment</b> of federal highway funding. Federal law requires colleges and universities that accept federal financial aid institute policies to sanction students who violate underage drinking and other alcohol laws, and to track the number of liquor laws violations. The Chronicle of Higher Education has reported that many colleges fail to comply with these laws, and federal enforcement is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the <b>apportionment</b> of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious {{over the loss of}} so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E

40|$|Federal {{and state}} governments use funding {{formulas}} to apportion, or geographically distribute, {{billions of dollars of}} expenditures for transportation programs every year. Past studies suggest that successful targeting of such funding results in fairness towards all areas while lack of targeting results in favoritism towards some areas over others. By examining the two issues of geographic redistribution and fiscal equalization, this study assesses the fairness of three examples of transportation funding formulas. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods (including location quotients, indices of dissimilarity, and simple regressions) are used to measure the amount of funding that is geographically redistributed, and to measure how consistent the distributions of funds are with the principle of fiscal equalization. Analyses of the patterns of geographic redistribution show that federal transportation funds are redistributed from the most populous states to the least populous states, that California state highway funds are redistributed from the most densely populated counties to the least densely populated counties, and that California transit funds are not geographic redistributed. Numerous needs targeting studies have measured the need for funding in terms of fiscal capacity, or the ability of governments to raise revenues, and asked whether or not intergovernmental aid is apportioned in a manner which equalizes fiscal capacities. While the overall pattern of intergovernmental aid has been scrutinized, the distributive impact of transportation grants in particular has not been conclusively determined. This study finds that California highway funding <b>apportionments</b> result in fiscal equalization, while federal transportation funding and California transit <b>apportionments</b> do not act to equalize fiscal capacities. Based upon these empirical findings, the study concludes that the federal funding <b>apportionments</b> results in favoritism, because tax revenues are being redistributed from the less wealthy states to the more wealthy states. In contrast, the California state highway <b>apportionments</b> result in fairness, since tax revenues are being redistributed in a fiscally equalizing fashion from the more wealth counties to the less wealthy counties...|$|R
5|$|The {{second and}} third waves of castle {{building}} were led by the major magnates, {{and then by the}} more junior knights on their new estates. The <b>apportionment</b> of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a few key locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line of communication with Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans pushed on into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they went and often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.|$|E
5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land <b>Apportionment</b> Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|The 1923 {{constitution}} was drawn up in non-racial terms, and the electoral system it devised was similarly open, {{at least in}} theory. Voting qualifications regarding personal income, education and property, {{similar to those of}} the Cape Qualified Franchise, were applied equally to all, but since most blacks did not meet the set standards, both the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly from the white minority of about 5%. The result was that black interests were sparsely represented if at all, something that most of the colony's whites showed little interest in changing; they claimed that most blacks were uninterested in Western-style political process and that they would not govern properly if they took over. Bills such as the Land <b>Apportionment</b> Act of 1930, which earmarked about half of the country for white ownership and residence while dividing the rest into black purchase, tribal trust and national areas, were variously biased towards the white minority. White settlers and their offspring provided most of the colony's administrative, industrial, scientific and farming skills, and built a relatively balanced, partially industrialised market economy, boasting strong agricultural and manufacturing sectors, iron and steel industries and modern mining enterprises. Everyday life was marked by discrimination ranging from job reservation for whites to petty segregation of trains, post office queues and the like. Whites owned most of the best farmland, and had far superior education, wages and homes, but the schooling, healthcare, infrastructure and salaries available to black Rhodesians were nevertheless very good by African standards.|$|E

5000|$|In the Soviet times, {{the book}} <b>Apportionments</b> for dinners, {{separate}} dishes {{and other products}} of public catering (1928), which served as a standard reference for Soviet catering establishments, demanded renaming of many traditional restaurant dishes to replace the (mostly French-style) [...] "bourgeoise" [...] names with simple [...] "proletarian" [...] forms. This program was not realised immediately (at least not completely), and its successor, The Directory of <b>Apportionments</b> for Catering (1940), published by the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry, still included chicken and game fillets à la Maréchale stuffed with milk sauce and portobello mushrooms. The major Soviet cookbooks published after WWII, such as Cookery (1955) or Directory of Recipes and Culinary Products for Catering, included the same recipe but named it simply [...] "chicken or game cutlet stuffed with milk sauce" [...] and added a similar [...] "chicken or game cutlet stuffed with liver".
