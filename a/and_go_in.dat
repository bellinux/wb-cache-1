5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so he did not know how they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 19, 2008. In the episode, Mort accidentally goes into Stewie's time machine and is sent to Warsaw, Poland on September 1, 1939. Brian and Stewie realize Mort has gone back in time, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the time machine to save him.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} The Five {{as a unit}} was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove {{themselves}} from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply [...] "with complete frankness", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was [...] "a fully fledged artist" [...] and that {{he looked forward to}} discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.|$|E

500|$|After Hessenthaler was {{dismissed}} following a poor {{start to the}} 200405 season, the club saw a number of managers come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> {{a relatively short time}} before Mark Stimson's arrival in 2007. His two and a half year tenure saw the club promoted back to the third tier via the play-offs, but he {{was dismissed}} the following season. Hessenthaler then returned to the club for a period of two years before he was promoted to Director of Football to make way for Martin Allen. [...] Allen became only the second manager to win a trophy with the club, leading the team to the League Two championship in 2013, but he was dismissed a few months into the following season after a poor start, following which another former manager, Peter Taylor, returned to the club.|$|E
500|$|Alex {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{as someone who}} is not afraid of expressing her sexuality, and as a flawed human being who takes charge of her own life. Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to each one of us. As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women. She does not treat men as if they are {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men just happen to come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end. It may not be something I personally agree with or something I do, but I think different people have different individual choices that they make." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for the The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "It {{is rather}} {{difficult to understand}} by what magic the two signatures are made {{to appear in the}} court room without human agency. They come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> anything but legal fashion. Evidently their appearance is to be taken symbolically - not realistically." [...] The final part of the review is difficult to infer because the film is lost, but the synopsis states that a stereopticon was used. A stereopticon, {{not to be confused with}} a stereoscope, is a type of slide projector that projects an image. According to the synopsis, the production employs one, or possibly two, stereopticon's to display the two different signatures to compare and reveal the forgery. The reviewer seems to state that the appearance as unnatural, perhaps referencing a dissolve effect. The ability to project with a dissolve was a known ability of more advanced stereopticons. According to another reviewer the film included shots of Long Island Sound.|$|E

500|$|Before {{recording}} started, {{both parties}} organized a listening {{session with the}} musical material Hammond and Casablancas had brought to show the tone and energy they liked. One of the prerequisites mentioned at the meeting was to take {{what was happening in}} music at the time, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a completely different direction. Casablancas wanted Is This It to sound like [...] "a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record". The approach for the album became more studied than that of The Modern Age. The group wanted the majority of songs to sound like them playing live, while they requested a few others to be like [...] "a weird, in-studio production with a drum machine, even though no drum machine was used". The songs of the latter type were done track-by-track and were crafted into non-standard rock arrangements. Raphael's background in industrial music played a large part in the album's conception.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Ryan Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. Murphy said: [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> these teachers' lives." [...] Although four graduating seniors were confirmed in January 2012 as returning in the fourth season—Rachel, Finn, Kurt and Santana—there had been no announcement regarding Quinn or any other seniors as of the end of February 2012. As of May 2012, Murphy stated that all graduating seniors will come back for season 4 but, not all will be doing [...] "all 22 episodes".|$|E
500|$|Reportedly {{unhappy with}} {{life in the}} band, Malcolm quit in mid-1985. A friend of the band's from Athens, Juan Molina, was brought in for a brief U.S. tour, but was not {{interested}} in becoming a full-time member. Without a permanent bassist and a quickly approaching European tour looming—the band's first—they contacted Kramer, who quickly agreed to join. Meanwhile, their second LP, which had been submitted to Alternative Tentacles as Rembrandt Pussy Horse, was still in limbo. The reasons for Alternative Tentacles' actions are unclear, but it is known that the label delayed a decision for about a year before ultimately refusing to publish it. While waiting, the band released the four-song Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis EP on Touch <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> late 1985. Once Alternative Tentacles finally declined, the group went back into the studio to record two new tracks to replace [...] "Two Part" [...] and [...] "Tornadoes", which were originally intended for Rembrandt... before appearing on the Cream Corn... EP's B-side.|$|E

500|$|Their second LP {{was finally}} issued as Rembrandt Pussyhorse on Touch <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> April 1986. Coming out some {{two years after}} the {{original}} sessions, it featured a different mix and song selection than Alternative Tentacles' unreleased version. Best known for its minimalist reworking of The Guess Who's [...] "American Woman", {{it is one of the}} most experimental albums in Butthole Surfers' heavily experimental career. Following a particularly out-of-control tour, even by Butthole Surfers' standards, the band semi-settled in Austin, Texas in the summer of 1986. Nervosa rejoined them (Cabbage having been fired months earlier), and they went to work on crafting their first home studio in a rental house on the outskirts of town. Before long, they started a leisurely recording session for their third full-length project. Released in March 1987, Locust Abortion Technician is one of the heaviest Butthole Surfers albums, and it is often considered their finest to date. Harnessing aspects of punk, heavy metal, and psychedelia, its unique sound produced a number of grinding, slower-paced songs, arguably making it an early precursor of grunge.|$|E

[...] Falchuk insisted, [...] "It was never our plan or our intention to let them go... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E
