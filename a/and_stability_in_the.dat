5|$|After {{the end of}} the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the {{subsequent}} peace treaties ceded the region to Albania. This turn of events catalyzed an uprising among the local Greeks, which led to the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence, on February 28, 1914. The International Commission of Control, an organization responsible for securing peace <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, eventually intervened and the Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914. However the protocol’s terms were never implemented because of the politically unstable situation in Albania following the outbreak of World War I, and it was eventually annulled in 1921 during the Conference of Ambassadors.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} overtly support the uprising. Military and political officials continued {{to carry out a}} slow evacuation process, which had begun in March and ended on 28 April. Resistance was officially discouraged, and assurances were given that the Great Powers and the International Control Commission (an organization founded by the Great Powers in order to secure peace <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area) would guarantee their rights. Following the declaration in Gjirokastër, Zografos sent messages to local representatives in Korçë (gr. Korytsá) asking them to join the movement; however, the Greek military commander of the city, Colonel Alexandros Kontoulis, followed his official orders strictly and declared martial law, threatening to shoot any citizen raising the Northern Epirote flag. When the local bishop of Kolonjë (gr. Kolónia), Spyridon, proclaimed the Autonomy, Kontoulis had him immediately arrested and expelled.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th {{century the}} {{population}} had risen to 300 million from approximately 150million during the late Ming dynasty. The dramatic rise in population was due to several reasons, including the long period of peace <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century and the import of new crops China received from the Americas, including peanuts, sweet potatoes and maize. New species of rice from Southeast Asia led to a huge increase in production. Merchant guilds proliferated in all of the growing Chinese cities and often acquired great social and even political influence. Rich merchants with official connections built up huge fortunes and patronized literature, theater and the arts. Textile and handicraft production boomed.|$|E

Tadić drew {{attention to the fact that}} the KSF were formed on the basis of the Ahtisaari Plan that was never adopted by the Security Council and added that the creation of these forces constitutes a breach of the Serbian Constitution and international law, which is why they should be disbanded. He called for the demilitarisation of Kosovo.|$|E
25|$|Greece's {{foreign policy}} is {{conducted}} through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its head, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The current minister is Nikos Kotzias. According to the official website, the main aims of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are to represent Greece before other states and international organizations; safeguarding {{the interests of the}} Greek state and of its citizens abroad; the promotion of Greek culture; the fostering of closer relations with the Greek diaspora; and the promotion of international cooperation. Additionally, due to its political and geographical proximity to Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Greece is a country of significant geostrategic importance and {{is considered to be a}} middle power and has developed a regional policy to help promote peace <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|In {{contemporary}} conflict zones, international organizations, {{particularly the}} United Nations peacekeepers, {{have been involved}} in maintaining peace <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area as well as distribute humanitarian aid to the local population. At present there are 16 Peace Operations directed by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The peacekeepers are mainly composed of military personnel (but to a less number also the police) sent by governments of various member-states. However, over the course of their involvement in the field, peacekeepers have also been accused and at times found guilty of committing rape and other forms of sexual violence to the local population, in particular to women and children. Among all international staff in the conflict zone, United Nations peacekeepers (handled by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations) have been most frequently identified as the perpetrators of rape.|$|E

25|$|The city {{maintained}} independence as a city-state {{until it}} was annexed by Darius I in 512 BC into the Persian Empire, who saw the site as the optimal location to construct a pontoon bridge crossing into Europe as Byzantium was situated at the narrowest point in the Bosphorus strait. Persian rule lasted until 478 BC when {{as part of the}} Greek counterattack to the Second Persian Invasion of Greece, a Greek army led by the Spartan general Pausanias captured the city which remained an independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians, and later to the Spartans after 411 BC. A farsighted treaty with the emergent power of Rome in c.150 BC which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed. This treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would maintain this independent status, and prosper under peace <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pax Romana, for nearly three centuries until the late 2nd century AD.|$|E
25|$|The {{counties}} were {{governed by}} a county governor (Lithuanian: apskrities viršininkas), appointed by the Minister of Interior. Being almost the only link between the central government and the local population, governors were first responsible {{for a wide range}} of duties. They were to collect all property left by the retreating German army, organize local government, recruit local army groups, ensure security <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county, etc. In 1920 they were also entrusted to preside over county police. In 1931, in an effort to centralize the government, county governors also became the chairmen of a three-member county governing body (Lithuanian: apskrities valdyba), an executive institution of a county council. That way power in a county became centralized in the hands of a governor. County councils (Lithuanian: apskrities taryba) were elected by local population for a three-year term. The number of representatives from a township depended upon the number of residents in that township.|$|E
25|$|Despite this setback, Mohamoud {{would be}} a {{supporting}} for the women’s voices in Somaliland, as the Kulmiye Party was the only party to appoint a woman as Vice-Chair. During the next elections, Mohamoud was rewarded by garnering the largest national votes, only less than the total votes the incumbent party obtained during the previous presidential election. Through his stewardship, the Kulmiye Party has grown {{to be the largest}} party in Somaliland. Despite the ruling party’s continuous hold to power after its term expired, and its unwillingness to hold free and fair elections, Mohamoud continued to pursue political change through the democratic process by working closely with traditional elders and the international community, whose interest is peace <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Horn of Africa. Thus, when he ran as the Kulmiye Party candidate for president he was able to defeat incumbent President Dahir Rayaale Kahin of the United Peoples' Democratic Party (UDUB) in the 2010 presidential election.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn alternating-direction {{implicit}} {{method for}} N-dimensional parabolic equations with mixed derivatives is considered. The method requires {{the solution of}} N tridiagonal matrix equations per time-step and combines computational simplicity {{with the possibility of}} unconditional stability for any N. The regimes of conditional stability for N ⩽ 6 show that the scheme is less effective for higher dimensional problems, owing to the proliferation of mixed derivatives. An alternative scheme (requiring 2 N tridiagonal operations) which involves a single iteration to time-centre the mixed derivatives is shown to improve accuracy <b>and</b> <b>stability.</b> <b>In</b> particular <b>the</b> iterative scheme allows second-order accuracy <b>and</b> unconditional <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> important special cases of two and three space dimensions...|$|R
