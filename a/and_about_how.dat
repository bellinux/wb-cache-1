He again eviscerates the Pandavas for all their chicanery during the war and decries their legacy. Venerating his own character, Duryodhana proclaims he will die happily. Duryodhana then turns to Krishna and {{specifically}} accuses him of engineering his defeat, calling Krishna the most sinful of the lot.|$|E
25|$|The party stopped running presidential {{candidates}} after 1956, when its nominee Darlington Hoopes won fewer than 6,000 votes. In the party's last decades, its members, {{many of them}} prominent in the labor, peace, civil rights and civil liberties movements, fundamentally disagreed about the socialist movement's relationship to the labor movement and the Democratic Party, <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> best to advance democracy abroad. In 1970–1973, these strategic differences had become so acute that the Socialist Party {{changed its name to}} Social Democrats, USA.

25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem throughout most of American history was to keep its standing army small, relying on augmentation from militias (the predecessor of modern-day Reserve forces, to include the National Guard) and volunteers. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, {{with the advent of the}} Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force engendered new concerns of militarism <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> such a large force would affect civil-military relations in the United States.

500|$|Each {{season of}} The Wire {{introduces}} a different {{institution in the}} city of Baltimore and its relationship to law enforcement, while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is [...] "really about the American city, <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{prominent}} and successful women cite Nancy Drew {{as an early}} formative influence whose character encouraged them to take on unconventional roles, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor; TV personalities Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters; singers Barbra Streisand and Beverly Sills; mystery authors Sara Paretsky and Nancy Pickard; scholar Carolyn Heilbrun; actresses Ellen Barkin and Emma Roberts; former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; former First Lady Laura Bush; {{and former president of}} the National Organization for Women Karen DeCrow.

[...] Levesley also highlighted the [...] "many examples of well-written women, predominantly of color" [...] in the series. Oliver Sava at The A.V.

[...] In an interview with Kiss FM (UK) Gaga said that [...] "Dope" [...] was the most personal song she had ever created. Feeling that the album needed something more autobiographical and confessional and a song which would show her vulnerable side, Gaga worked with Rubin who let her do the song {{in the way she}} wanted and just assisted in recording it. He had contacted Gaga for producing the track, while she was on her sabbatical; Gaga consulted with Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, her main producer for Artpop and then decided to enlist Rubin's help.

2500|$|A {{critical}} tendency {{opposing the}} [...] "life cycle" [...] theory emphasizes {{the differences in}} tone and intent between this film and other Ozu works that deal with similar themes, situations and characters. These critics are also highly skeptical of the widely held notion that Ozu regarded marriage (or at least the marriage in Late Spring) favorably. As critic Roger Ebert explains, [...] "Late Spring began a cycle of Ozu films about families... Did he make the same film again and again? Not at all. Late Spring and Early Summer are startlingly different. In the second, Noriko takes advantage of a conversational opening [...] to overturn the entire plot... she accepts a man [...] she has {{known for a long}} time—a widower with a child." [...] In contrast, [...] "what happens [...] at deeper levels is angry, passionate and—wrong, we feel, because the father and the daughter are forced to do something neither one of them wants to do, and the result will be resentment and unhappiness." [...] Ebert goes on, [...] "It is universally believed, just as in a Jane Austen novel, that a woman of a certain age is in want of a husband. Late Spring is a film about two people who desperately do not believe this, <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they are undone by their tact, their concern for each other, and their need to make others comfortable by seeming to agree with them." [...] The film [...] "tells a story that becomes sadder the more you think about it." ...|$|E

Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
