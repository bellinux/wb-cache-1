5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, {{it would}} seem that cricket was a normal {{activity}} <b>at</b> <b>Oxford</b> for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established <b>at</b> <b>Oxford</b> by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was <b>at</b> <b>Oxford</b> and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during {{the first quarter of the}} 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E

5|$|George Calvert {{went up to}} Trinity College <b>at</b> <b>Oxford</b> University, matriculating in 1593/94, {{where he}} studied foreign {{languages}} and received a bachelor's degree in 1597.

After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln's Inn for three years.|$|E

While <b>at</b> <b>Oxford,</b> he also gained a Blue in athletics, running in the three-mile race against Cambridge in 1892. The same year, he played association football for Corinthians, and there were also appearances for Combined Universities and London. An injury prevented Palairet from playing against Cambridge, and thus earning his Blue in football.|$|E
