50|$|<b>Aeration</b> <b>turbines</b> are {{designed}} for mixing gases, usually air, with a liquid, usually water. They can serve additional purposes like destratification, agitator or pump.|$|R
50|$|Generally the {{performance}} efficiency of <b>aeration</b> <b>turbines</b> is very high, the space requirement is compact, both at high reliability {{and all those}} factors reduce operational cost.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>aeration</b> <b>turbines</b> in {{industry}} is still underdeveloped especially with waste water treatment. With raising {{population and the}} growing strain on clean water supplies such environmentally friendly solutions are becoming more important.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} design variations in use or newly entering the market. Most are centrifugal, where fluid enters at the axis and exits {{around the perimeter}} of the rotor. <b>Aeration</b> <b>turbines</b> can run open or in a housing. Some designs have bladed rotors which leads to more splashing and those need to run close to the surface, which is an obvious sign of lesser efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} {{allows a}} more decentralized approach to {{waste water treatment}} as sewage can be oxygenised at pumping stations for bacteria to start breaking down the sewage before it even arrives at centralized processing plants. <b>Aeration</b> <b>turbines</b> {{are more and more}} entering industry because of their significantly higher efficiency and reduced size of used gear compared to other methods of aeration. This means less investment into process infrastructure and substantial savings to both the overall cost but formemost running cost for electricity.|$|R

Ceramics are suitable for this purpose, often involving dispersion of fine air or gas bubbles through the porous ceramic into a liquid. The smaller the bubbles, the more gas is exposed to the liquid increasing the gas transfer efficiency. Diffusers or spargers can also be designed into the system to cause turbulence or mixing if desired.|$|R

40|$|Aeration (To supply or charge with air) is a unit-operation to {{be widely}} used in {{disposition}} of city sewerage and aerobic biological disposition of organic plant wastewater. There are three forms in aeration，they are surface mixer aeration and air bubbles <b>aeration</b> and <b>turbine</b> mixer <b>aeration.</b> We perceived the flow in the aeration vessels with suface mixer and measured circulation time about various type's vessels and we got distributions of circulation time. And we used photographic method for determination circulation time. For this，we set inspecting section，which was illustrated in this paper，then catched the change of {{the brightness of the}} tracer between the bright section and the dark section. And we took a photograph of streamline of each section by the section photograph method...|$|R
40|$|A team worked {{together}} {{on the development of}} environmentally advanced hydro turbine design concepts to reduce hydropower`s impact on the environment, and to improve the understanding of the technical and environmental issues involved, in particular, with fish survival {{as a result of their}} passage through hydro power sites. This approach brought together a turbine design and manufacturing company, biologists, a utility, a consulting engineering firm and a university research facility, in order to benefit from the synergy of diverse disciplines. Through a combination of advanced technology and engineering analyses, innovative design concepts adaptable to both new and existing hydro facilities were developed and are presented. The project was divided into 4 tasks. Task 1 investigated a broad range of environmental issues and how the issues differed throughout the country. Task 2 addressed fish physiology and turbine physics. Task 3 investigated individual design elements needed for the refinement of the three concept families defined in Task 1. Advanced numerical tools for flow simulation in turbines are used to quantify characteristics of flow and pressure fields within turbine water passageways. The issues associated with dissolved oxygen enhancement using <b>turbine</b> <b>aeration</b> are presented. The state of the art and recent advancements of this technology are reviewed. Key elements for applying <b>turbine</b> <b>aeration</b> to improve aquatic habitat are discussed and a review of the procedures for testing of aerating turbines is presented. In Task 4, the results of the Tasks were assembled into three families of design concepts to address the most significant issues defined in Task 1. The results of the work conclude that significant improvements in fish passage survival are achievable...|$|R
40|$|Owners of {{hydropower}} facilities face increasing {{demands to}} reduce or eliminate environmental concerns arising from the impoundment and control of once-natural stream flows. These demands, which are rooted in a complex mélange of technical, political, social, legal, and economic factors, are typically applied through regulatory criteria for mitigating the impact of hydro projects on aquatic habitat. The improvement of low dissolved oxygen (DO) in reservoir releases is a major environmental concern for projects with moderate to heavy amounts of organic sediments. When applicable, <b>turbine</b> <b>aeration</b> often is the most cost-effective technology for providing DO improvements. However, opportunities to solve DO-related water quality problems by turbine methods are often overlooked. In some cases {{this is due to}} ambiguous accountability for the low DO problem. In other cases, it is due to limited awareness of aerating turbine capabilities, limited support for research and development, or a lack of industry-accepted procedures for the analysis and design of these turbines. This paper presents a brief summary of guiding principles used for justifying, specifying, an...|$|R

Hydroelectric projects {{often have a}} low tailwater dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Low DO levels negatively impact the biota of the water body and are often regulated. Auto-Vented Turbines (AVTs) are one form of DO mitigation that is typically successful and cost-effective. Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) at the University of Minnesota (UMN) is partnering with the Department of Energy (DoE) and Alstom Engineering to conduct research developing a conventional hydropower <b>turbine</b> <b>aeration</b> test-bed for computational routines and a software tool for predicting the DO uptake of AVTs. The focus of this thesis is {{on the development of}} the test-bed through the conduct of physical experiments focused on measuring mass transfer across bubbles in various flow conditions. This test-bed will be a valuable database for verification of numerical models of DO uptake. Numerical models can simulate the parameters of the water tunnel and experimental set-up, then verify their accuracy by simulating the air entrainment rate, bubble size and mass transfer of the test-bed. The findings presented herein can lead to further optimization of AVTs, as well as reduce cost and regulatory uncertainty prior to hydropower relicensing or development...|$|R
40|$|Composting {{of sewage}} sludge is a common {{practice}} for sludge disposal. Some previous studies found high levels of polychorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychorodibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) after composting, especially octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) but also 1234678 -heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1234678 -HpCDD) to a lesser extent. In this work, the concentrations of OCDD, 1234678 -HpCDD {{and the rest of}} the 17 toxic congeners of PCDD/Fs were determined in compost obtained under different conditions. Although the toxicity of the two compounds mentioned above is small, their generation may reach undesirable levels. The PCDD/F content was analyzed in a composting plant and in a laboratory test. In both cases, the composted material was a mixture {{of sewage sludge}}, straw and sawdust. The composting plant was a tunnel with air <b>turbine</b> <b>aeration</b> and with a turner to homogenize and move the mixture upwards. The laboratory tests were carried out with Dewar vessels (with air dispersion at the bottom and controlled temperature) and with small vessels inside a controlled oven with non-forced aeration. The laboratory runs were also carried out with the addition of pentachlorophenol in some runs, as a dioxin precursor. The highest OCDD levels were found in three samples of the composting plant (30000 – 90000 pg/g dry matter or dm), with toxicity values surpassing the limit level for soil amendment (17 pg I-TEQ/g dm). Their formation was analyzed considering their concentration vs. that of octachorodibenzofuran (OCDF), which is not formed during composting. In the laboratory, in experiments carried out in a vessel with non-forced aeration conditions and with the addition of pentachlorophenol, the formation of OCDD was significant (e. g. from 80 to 1500 pg/g dm). That means that these two factors, non-forced aeration and the presence of pentachlorophenol, can cause the OCDD formation. Support for this work was provided by Research project GRE 13 - 14 from the University of Alicante, Research project PROMETEOII/ 2014 / 007 from the Generalitat Valenciana (Spain) and Research project CTQ 2013 - 41006 -R from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) ...|$|R
