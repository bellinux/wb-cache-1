In 1970 he raced his first CanAm car. He decided to call it Shadow, with the team's logo featuring a cloaked spy. Jackie Oliver won the CanAm title for Shadow in 1974. With major sponsorship from Universal Oil Products, Nichols expanded his operation and entered F1 at the start of 1973 with Oliver and George Follmer driving. In 1975 Oliver became the team's commercial director, but the original sponsor pulled out and could not be adequately replaced. In 1977 most of the team management walked out of Shadow to join the Arrows team. Nichols sued and won, claiming copyright infringement, and that year Alan Jones scored Shadow's single Grand Prix victory. Shadow was in financial decline, however, and in 1981 Nichols sold his assets to the Theodore team of Chinese businessman Teddy Yip.|$|E

40|$|The Power Electronics and Electric Machinery Research Center (PEEMRC) of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has {{for many}} years been {{developing}} technologies for power converters for motor drives and many other applications. Some of the research goals are to improve efficiency and reduce audible and electromagnetic interference noise generation for inverters and the driven loads. The converters are being required to produce more power with reduced weight and volume, which requires improvements in heat removal from the electronics, as well as improved circuit designs that have fewer electrical losses. PEEMRC has recently developed and patented a soft-switching inverter topology called an Auxiliary Resonant Tank (ART), and this design has been tested and proven at ORNL using a 10 -kW laboratory prototype. The objective of this project was to develop, test, and install the ART inverter technology in an electric transit bus with the final goal of evaluating performance of the ORNL inverter under field conditions in a vehicle. A scaled-up inverter with the capacity to drive a 22 -e bus was built based on the 10 -kW ORNL laboratory prototype ART soft-switching inverter. Most (if not all) commercially available inverters for traction drive and other applications use hard-switching inverters. A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement was established with the Chattanooga Area Regional Transit Authority (CARTA), the Electric Transit Vehicle Institute (ETVI), and <b>Advanced</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Systems</b> (AVS), all of Chattanooga, along with ORNL. CARTA, which maintains and operates the public transit system in Chattanooga, provided an area for testing the vehicle alongside other similar vehicles in the normal operating environment. ETVI offers capabilities in standardized testing and reporting and also provides exposure in the electric transit vehicle arena for ORNL's technologies. The third Chattanooga partner, (AVS) manufactures all-electric and hybrid electric transit buses using inverter drive systems from several manufacturers. AVS provided help in field installation, and parts for laboratory testing. A 100 -kW field-ready unit was developed, tested in an ORNL laboratory, and installed and successfully operated in a CARTA bus in Chattanooga. The tests on the vehicle were performed at a CARTA maintenance facility and at a l-mile test track in Chattanooga managed by CARTA...|$|E

We first review basic concepts from spark-ignition engine modeling and then proceed to {{a detailed description of}} our three-state model of a turbocharged intercooled diesel engine, which is the engine type used in heavy-duty commercial vehicles. Then we review basic concepts of transmission modeling, including torque converter and transmission mechanicals, and argue that automatic transmissions for heavy vehicles and passenger cars can be modeled the same way, albeit with different parameter values. Keywords <b>Advanced</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Control <b>Systems</b> Buses Commercial <b>Vehicle</b> Operations Control <b>Systems</b> Public Transit Trucking iii iv Executive Summary In our research we are addressing the design of <b>Advanced</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Control <b>Systems</b> (AVCS) which will allow the automated operation of heavy-duty vehicles on the intelligent highways of the future. Our effort focuses on longitudinal control algorithms, and hence requires models which capture all the important characteristics of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics. Hence, our first task was the modeling of turbocharged diesel engines and hydrodynamic automatic transmissions, both of which are used in the powertrains of commercial buses and trucks. Since our models are to be used for AVCS design, the level of detail of each subsystem model must be dictated by its significance for the dynamical behavior of the whole vehicle. Viewing the engine and the transmission as components of the system, rather than as separate systems, determines a specific objective for the modeling [...] ...|$|R
