5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> far from large room openings, {{and closer to the}} listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
25|$|Beck {{probably}} witnessed {{his first}} cardiac arrest during his internship in 1922 {{while on the}} surgery service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During a urologic operation, the anaesthetist announced that the patient's heart had stopped. To the amazement of Beck, the surgical resident removed his gloves {{and went to a}} telephone in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and called the fire department. Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad rushed into the operating room 15minutes later and applied oxygen-powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department and place it in the hands of surgeons.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one and a half inches thick, bisects <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and is prevented from falling by a short cylindrical prop wedged into the corner of the walls.|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein's studios {{reference}} {{what are}} known as Matisse's four Symphonic Interiors of 1911 (The Pink Studio, The Painter's Family, Interior with Eggplants, The Red Studio) and an earlier Matisse The Dance. Artist's Studio—Look Mickey was part of a series that included The Artist's Studio [...] with Model, 1974, Artist's Studio, Foot Medication, 1974, Artist's Studio, the [...] "Dance", 1974, Artist's Studio/A Still Life, 1973. Artist's Studio—Look Mickey {{was the only one of}} the five to include <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> like The Red Studio. Many sources, including Lichtenstein himself only include four works in the series (excluding Artist's Studio/A Still Life, 1973). In a 1995 lecture in conjunction with the Kyoto Prize, he said [...] "I did a series of four large, about 8' x10', paintings of interiors of artists' studios. They were inspired by Matisse's paintings..." [...] Artist's Studio—Look Mickey is regarded as the first of the four Artist's Studio works. From among the Artist's Studio series works, this depicts [...] "the deepest, most plainly articulated interior space." ...|$|E

He lived in the cabin for two years and wrote about this period in his book First Summer in the Sierra (1911). Muir's biographer, Frederick Turner, notes Muir's journal entry upon first visiting the valley and writes that his description [...] "blazes from the page with the authentic force of a conversion experience." ...|$|E

B-10 wishes his counterpart well. As you can see, B-10 is still alive. B-10 is hoping for a good result," [...] followed by laughter.

2500|$|In 1743, Swedenborg was {{dining in}} a private room at a tavern in London. By {{the end of the}} meal, a {{darkness}} fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> telling him: [...] "Do not eat too much!". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.|$|E
2500|$|President Roosevelt died at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. In {{the minutes}} after his death, Fala behaved very strangely. FDR biographer Jim Bishop {{wrote about the}} death scene: [...] "… a snapping, snarling series of barks was heard. No one had paid any {{attention}} to Fala. He had been dozing in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for the front screen door and bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men could see him, standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence. This led to the quiet question: 'Do dogs really know?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, who had {{previously}} collaborated with Guadagnino in Ferdinando Cito Filomarino's Antonia (2015), served {{as the director of}} photography. Guadagnino and Filomarino developed an [...] "exquisite and extraordinary" [...] relationship with Mukdeeprom during the production of Antonia, the cinematographer's first non-Thai film. Lighting {{is an important factor in}} Mukdeeprom's work, as he needs the light to be engaged with the characters. In order to capture the Northern Italian summer atmosphere for Call Me by Your Name, he had to create completely artificial light, due to the heavy rains that lasted the entirety of the shoot. He also connected to the actors during the scene; when they finished shooting the first take of the confrontation between Oliver and Elio, he was crying in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The film was shot using a 35 mm lens, a decision influenced by the work of David Cronenberg in order to [...] "solidif the point of view." ...|$|E
