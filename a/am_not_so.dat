500|$|Austen's novels {{quickly became}} fashionable among opinion-makers, namely, those aristocrats who often {{dictated}} fashion and taste. Lady Bessborough, sister to the notorious Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, commented on Sense and Sensibility {{in a letter}} to a friend: [...] "it is a clever novel. ...tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it." [...] The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to one of the book's heroines: [...] "I think Marianne & me are very like in disposition, that certainly I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> good, the same imprudence, [...] ".|$|E

She practices vegetarianism and was listed as [...] "India's hottest vegetarian" [...] in polls conducted by PETA in 2011 and 2012.

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> sure. You shoot {{a lot of things}} when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I really wish she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future." [...] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008; a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.|$|E
500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. [...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> happy about it. I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes. I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E

She almost played with discretion, and often she was delightful. Her self-introduction to her father was one long to be remembered. No wonder that the audience insisted on seeing it again and again. All in all, Miss Fox appeared greatly to her advantage." ...|$|R

2500|$|When Bartelme {{took over}} as {{athletic}} director, Michigan had withdrawn from the Western Conference. One of his principle accomplishments was the return of Michigan to the conference. In September 1909, Barthelme made his views known:"I always have thought that Michigan's place is in the conference, and moreover, I have thought that when conditions were so we could return, {{it would be the}} only thing for us to do. However, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> sure that that time has come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) {{reviewed}} the novel in The Guardians issue of 20 December 1963 when he said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> sure. This begins well, {{with the discovery}} of a stranger in a suburban sitting-room, with four strange clocks all showing the same time; but thereafter the story, though as readable as ever, does tends to hang fire. Also there is one very corny item, the vital witness killed when on the point of disclosing crucial information, which is quite unworthy of Miss Christie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1909, Michigan hired Philip Bartelme as the school's second {{athletic}} director following {{the resignation of}} Charles A. Baird. [...] The change in {{athletic director}}s led to speculation that Michigan might be prepared {{to return to the}} Western Conference. [...] In September 1909, Barthelme stated his intention to return Michigan to the conference, though he did not think the time was yet right. [...] He told the press, [...] "I always have thought that Michigan's place is in the conference, and moreover, I have thought that when conditions were so we could return, it would be the only thing for us to do. [...] However, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> sure that that time has come." [...] He noted that the [...] "training table" [...] was the biggest obstacle to Michigan's rejoining the conference and contended that the training table was [...] "a great factor in getting the men into the condition necessary for hard football" [...] and avoiding serious injuries.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 January 1896, in {{conversation}} with L. A. Tollemache, Gladstone explained that: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much afraid of Democracy or of Science as of the love of money. This {{seems to me to}} be a growing evil. Also, there is a danger from the growth of that dreadful military spirit". On 13 January, Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that [...] "In all matters of custom and tradition, even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is". On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce, describing himself as [...] "a dead man, one fundamentally a Peel–Cobden man". In 1896, in his last noteworthy speech, he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool. On 2 January 1897, Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism: [...] "I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by you and your friends with sincere interest, and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism".|$|E
2500|$|Goldwater was outspoken {{about the}} Eisenhower Administration, calling {{some of the}} {{policies}} of the Eisenhower Administration too liberal for a Republican President. [...] "...Democrats delighted in pointing out that the junior senator was so headstrong that he had gone out his way to criticize the president of his own party." [...] There was a Democratic majority in Congress for most of Eisenhower's career and Goldwater felt that President Dwight Eisenhower was compromising too much with Democrats in order to get legislation passed. [...] Early on in his career as a senator for Arizona, he criticized the 71.8 billion dollar budget that President Eisenhower sent to Congress, stating [...] "Now, however, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> sure. A $71.8 billion budget not only shocks me, but it weakens my faith." [...] Goldwater opposed Eisenhower's pick for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. [...] "The day that Eisenhower appointed Governor Earl Warren of California as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Goldwater did not hesitate to express his misgivings." [...] Goldwater and the Eisenhower Administration supported the integration of schools in the south, but Goldwater felt the states should choose how they wanted to integrate and should not be forced by the federal government. [...] "Goldwater criticized the use of federal troops. He accused the Eisenhower administration of violating the Constitution by assuming powers reserved by the states. While he agreed that under the law, every state should have integrated its schools, each state should integrate in its own way." [...] There were high ranking government officials following Goldwater's critical stance on the Eisenhower Administration, even an Army General. [...] "Fulbright's startling revelation that military personnel were being indoctrinated with the idea that {{the policies of the}} Commander in Chief were treasonous dovetailed with the return to the news of the strange case of General Edwin Walker." ...|$|E
