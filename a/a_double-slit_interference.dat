40|$|We develop general {{quantitative}} criteria for dynamic interference, {{a manifestation of}} <b>a</b> <b>double-slit</b> <b>interference</b> in time which should be realizable with brilliant state-of-the-art high-frequency laser sources. Our analysis reveals that the observation of dynamic interference hinges upon maximizing {{the difference between the}} dynamic polarization of the initial bound and the final continuum states of the electron during the light pulse while keeping depletion of the initial state small. These two properties, Stark shift and depletion, can be determined from electronic structure calculations avoiding expensive propagation in time.

40|$|The long-standing {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is reviewed. The shifts of both optical and particle interference patterns are summarized. It is {{pointed out that}} a line of electric dipoles and a line of magnetic dipoles (a long solenoid) both produce experimentally observed phase shifts similar to that produced by introducing a rectangular block of glass behind one slit of <b>a</b> <b>double-slit</b> <b>interference</b> pattern; the double-slit pattern is shifted while the single-slit envelope remains undisplaced. The quantum explanation for the magnetic interference pattern shift introduced by Aharonov and Bohm in 1959 involves completely different ideas from those suggested by a semiclassical analysis.

40|$|Double-slits provide {{incoming}} photons with a choice. Those {{that survive}} the passage have chosen from two possible paths which interfere to distribute {{them in a}} wave-like manner. Such wave-particle duality continues to be challenged and investigated in {{a broad range of}} disciplines with electrons, neutrons, helium atoms, C 60 fullerenes, Bose-Einstein condensates and biological molecules. All variants have hitherto involved material constituents. We present a matterless double-slit scenario in which photons generated from virtual electron-positron pair annihilation in head-on collisions of a probe laser field with two ultra-intense laser beams form <b>a</b> <b>double-slit</b> <b>interference</b> pattern. Such electromagnetic fields are predicted to induce material-like behaviour in the vacuum, supporting elastic scattering between photons. Our double-slit scenario presents on the one hand a realisable method to observe photon-photon scattering, and demonstrates on the other, the possibility of both controlling light with light and non-locally investigating features of the quantum vacuum's structure.

It is shown that not only can the visibil- ity be dramatically enhanced compared to the second-order case as previously theoretically predicted and shown experimentally, but also that the higher visi- bility {{is a consequence of}} the contribution of third-order correlation interaction terms, which is equal to the sum of all contributions from second-order cor- relation. It is interesting that, when the two reference detectors are scanned in opposite directions, negative values for the third-order correlation term of the intensity fluctuations may appear. The phenomenon can be completely explained by the theory of classical statistical optics, and is the first concrete demonstration of the influence of the third-order correlation terms.

40|$|Abstract The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} coherence of the fluo-rescence emission controlled by a quasi-two-dimensional hy-brid photonic–plasmonic crystal structure covered with a thin fluorescent-molecular-doped dielectric film is investigated ex-perimentally. A simple theoretical model to describe how a con-fined quasi-two-dimensional optical mode may induce coherent fluorescence emission is also presented. Concerning the spa-tial coherence, it is experimentally observed that the coherence area in {{the plane of the}} light source is in excess of 49 μm 2, which results in enhanced directional fluorescence emission. Concerning temporal coherence, the obtained coherence time is 4 times longer than that of the normal fluorescence emis-sion in vacuum.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{fabrication}} and characterization of X-ray waveguide beamsplitters. The waveguide channels were manufactured by electron-beam lithography, reactive ion etching and wafer bonding techniques, with an empty (air) channel forming the guiding layer and silicon the cladding material. A focused synchrotron beam is efficiently coupled into the input channel. The beam is guided and split into two channels with a controlled (and tunable) distance at the exit of the waveguide chip.

40|$|A “which-path” (welcher Weg) {{measurement}} necessarily {{destroys the}} fringes in <b>a</b> <b>double-slit</b> <b>interference</b> experiment. We {{show that in}} all instances one may attribute this destruction to a disturbance of the particle’s momentum by an amount equal to at least [Formula Presented], where [Formula Presented] is the slit separation, {{in accordance with the}} uncertainty principle. However, this momentum transfer need not be local; that is, it need not act at either of the slits through which the particle passes. For well-known welcher Weg measurements such as Einstein’s recoiling slit and Feynman’s light microscope, the disturbance can be understood in terms of random classical momentum kicks that act locally. In some recent proposals, including that by Scully, Englert, and Walther [Nature (London) 351, 111 (1991) ], the momentum transfer is of a peculiarly quantum, nonlocal nature. In this paper we introduce a formalism based on the Wigner function, as this describes both the local and nonlocal momentum transfer caused by any welcher Weg measurement. We show that for some examples, such as that of Scully, Englert, and Walther, there is no momentum disturbance at the slits even though the nonlocal momentum disturbance is sufficient to destroy the interference pattern. Finally, we discuss the experimental signatures of nonlocal versus local momentum transfer and demonstrate a strong similarity to the nonlocality of the Aharonov-Bohm effect...|$|E

40|$|By {{exploiting}} a {{generalization of}} recent results on environmentassisted channel correction, we show that, whenever a quantum system undergoes a channel realized as an interaction with a probe, the more efficiently {{the information about}} the input state can be erased from the probe, the higher is the corresponding entanglement fidelity of the corrected channel, and viceversa. The present analysis applies also to channels for which perfect quantum erasure is impossible, thus extending the original quantum eraser arrangement, and naturally embodies a general information-disturbance tradeoff. In <b>a</b> simple <b>double-slit</b> <b>interference</b> experiment with matter beams, two basic aspects of Quantum Theory reveal their deeply counter-intuitive interplay: the first aspect is the complementarity of particle- and wave-like matter’s behaviours, which is strictly related to the non-commutative feature of Quantum Mechanics, and hence to all forms of “uncertainty relations ” [1]. The second aspect is the active role played by the observer in a quantum measurement process, since the bare presence of accessible information about the particle’s path irreversibly affects the result of the measurement, as interference fringes are destroyed. A great contribution in understanding these two points and their connection came from the so-called quantum eraser, namely...|$|R

5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through <b>a</b> <b>double-slit</b> experiment exhibits <b>interference</b> phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through <b>a</b> <b>double-slit</b> experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} good {{experimental}} evidence for the Aharonov Bohm phase shift occurring when a solenoid is placed between the beams forming <b>a</b> <b>double-slit</b> electron <b>interference</b> pattern, there has been very little analysis of the relevant classical electromagnetic forces. These forces between a point charge and a solenoid involve subtle relativistic effects of order v 2 c 2 analogous to those discussed by Coleman and Van Vleck in their treatment of the Shockley James paradox. In this article we show that a treatment exactly analogous to that given by Coleman and Van Vleck predicts classical electromagnetic forces which {{provide the basis for}} the Aharonov Bohm phase shift. The magnetic force on the solenoid due to the passing charge leads to a displacement of the solenoid center of energy which must be balanced by the displacement of the passing charge. This classical displacement of the passing charge is exactly what is required to account for the Aharonov Bohm phase shift. Also, we discuss a magnetic moment model which appears frequently in the literature and note that although the model provides conservation of linear momentum, it does not satisfy the general requirements for relativistic theories. We give an example suggesting that the new equation of motion for a magnetic moment proposed by Aharonov, Pearle, and Vaidman based upon the hidden momentum of the magnetic moment is completely inappropriate. Finally, we emphasize that the Aharonov Casher phase shift is also explained by classical electromagnetic forces exactly parallel to those explaining the Aharonov Bohm phase shift...|$|R

This paper proposes a feasible experiment, based on an easy variation of the nowadays common double-slit experimental set-ups, aimed at detecting the effects of the pilot wave once 'detached' from the particles that it steers. Besides, a further realistic idea, based on the geometrical violation of Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI), is put forward as to the intrinsic nature of the photon.

When the structural foundation for describing particles is based on t-topos, the particle-wave duality of electron is a natural consequence. A presheaf associated with the electron represents both particle-like and wave-like properties depending upon whether an object in the site (t-site) is specified (particle-like) or not (wave-like).
