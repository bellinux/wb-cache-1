5|$|Emicho's company {{then went}} on to Cologne, and others {{continued}} on to Trier, Metz, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities.</b> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia. Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of Coloman of Hungary. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the other conquests, the Empire established a presence in Visigothic Hispania, when the usurper Athanagild requested assistance in his rebellion against King Agila I. In 552, Justinian dispatched a force of 2,000 men; according to the historian Jordanes, this army was led by the octogenarian Liberius. The Byzantines took Cartagena <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of Spania before being checked by their former ally Athanagild, who had by now become king. This campaign marked the apogee of Byzantine expansion.|$|E

5|$|One major {{advantage}} Manchester has is that, {{unlike most}} major {{cities in the}} UK, there are no height restrictions and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises.

Several residential, hotel and office developments are under construction or have recently been built in the city centre, including the Beetham Tower.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{contract}} was awarded, {{the start of the}} American Civil War caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the transcontinental telegraph reached Salt Lake City and connected Omaha, Nebraska, and Sacramento, California.

5|$|The Battle of Britain {{began in}} early July with Luftwaffe attacks on {{shipping}} and harbours. On 19 July, Hitler again publicly offered {{to end the}} war, saying he {{had no desire to}} destroy the British Empire. The United Kingdom rejected this ultimatum. The main German air superiority campaign started in August but failed to defeat RAF Fighter Command, and a proposed invasion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September. The German strategic bombing offensive intensified as night attacks on London <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> in the Blitz, but largely failed to disrupt the British war effort.|$|E

5|$|Chagas {{named the}} {{pathogenic}} parasite as Trypanosoma cruzi and {{later that year}} as Schizotrypanum cruzi, both honoring Oswaldo Cruz, the noted Brazilian physician and epidemiologist who successfully fought epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, and bubonic plague in Rio de Janeiro <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name Trypanosoma cruzi.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} months the communists tried {{repeatedly}} to seize power in Stuttgart <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> in Württemberg through armed rebellion, accompanied by large-scale strikes. They seized public buildings and print offices. During one such an attempt - {{at the beginning}} of April 1919 when the Bavarian Soviet Republic was formally proclaimed in Munich - a general strike took place in the Stuttgart area. The government in Stuttgart imposed a state of emergency and 16 people died in street fights. At the time of these events, Rau used his position as chief of the military police in Zuffenhausen to shut down companies that remained operational while the strike was ongoing. However, when the strike collapsed, Rau was removed from office by the government.|$|E

The WFDB consists of independent diamond bourses in major cutting centers such as Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Johannesburg <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> across the USA, Europe and Asia. In 2000, the WFDB and The International Diamond Manufacturers Association established the World Diamond Council to prevent the trading of diamonds used to fund war and inhumane acts.

He also discovered a new and inexpensive method of preparing guncotton, for which the state of South Carolina presented him a service of silver plate.|$|E

Solar panels are used to generate the electricity, and this pilot program is being monitored {{on a daily basis}} and performance results are published on the RechargeIT website. , Estonia is the first and only country that had deployed an EV charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a minimum distance of between , and a higher density in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian army, under Field Marshal Blasius Columban, Freiherr von Bender, invaded in the United Belgian States and {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the population which was already discontented with the governance and infighting of the rebels.
