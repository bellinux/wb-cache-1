5|$|Seven Irish <b>airmail</b> stamps {{were issued}} between 1948 and 1965 in the 1d, 3d, 6d, 8d, 1/-, 1/3 and 1/5 values. No {{specific}} <b>airmail</b> rate existed for the 1d and 3d stamps though their use was permitted on non-airmail correspondence; all others paid a contemporaneous rate when first produced. These {{were the only}} <b>airmail</b> stamps ever issued but many definitives and commemoratives have been produced in values that paid the postage rate for <b>airmail</b> service.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Simpson and Co. {{arranged}} for a test flight by the first aeroplane in Madras while a flying club was established at the Mount Golf Club grounds near St Thomas Mount by a pilot named G. Vlasto in October 1929. This site was later used as the Madras aerodrome. One of the early members of the club, Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar went on to establish an aerodrome in his native Chettinad. On 15 October 1932, Royal Air Force pilot Nevill Vintcent piloted J. R. D. Tata's plane carrying air-mail from Bombay to Madras via Bellary. This {{was the beginning of}} Tata Sons' regular domestic passenger and <b>airmail</b> service from Karachi to Madras. The flight was later re-routed through Hyderabad and became bi-weekly. On 26 November 1935, Tata Sons started an experimental weekly service from Bombay to Trivandrum via Goa and Cannanore. From 28 February 1938, onwards, Tata Sons' Aviation division, now renamed Tata Airlines, began a Karachi to Colombo <b>airmail</b> service via Madras and Trichinopoly. On 2 March 1938, the Bombay-Trivandrum air service was extended to Trichinopoly.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, the Petitcodiac Tidal Power Company {{proposed}} a tidal power project. This {{called for a}} dam to be built between Hopewell Cape and Fort Folly Point. The company sold shares {{to raise funds for}} the project and a series of on-site and airborne studies were conducted by the federal government, but the project fell through by 1928. As rail transport became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an <b>airmail</b> service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.|$|E
5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly <b>airmail</b> pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his forty-seven years in {{designing}} and building planes, Verville contributed to the design and development of nearly twenty different aircraft. A plane he designed, the Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger is on permanent exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Another plane he designed, the Verville-Sperry R-3 Racer won first place at the 1924 Pulitzer Trophy Races. In June 1961, it was honored as one of the twelve most significant aircraft of all time by Popular Mechanics and it was featured on a USPS <b>airmail</b> stamp issued in 1985.|$|E

25|$|The first {{scheduled}} US <b>airmail</b> service connected Washington, D.C., and New York. This 218-mile route was {{the first}} step in establishing a transcontinental route by air. Transcontinental air service was the best opportunity for <b>airmail</b> to provide faster service at lower cost than the existing railroads. Routes like College Park to New York were only slightly faster than the railroad, but were a good laboratory for developing safe and reliable <b>airmail</b> operations.|$|E

25|$|In June 1927, the new <b>airmail</b> {{contractor}} for {{the federal}} government refused to use Hoover Field any longer because it was so unsafe. <b>Airmail</b> service was transferred to nearby Bolling Field, a military airport.

The Air Mail Act of 1934 ordered him to break up his company into three separate entities: United Aircraft Corporation, Boeing Airplane Company, and United Air Lines.
