5|$|In August 2013, Dina Eastwood {{announced}} that she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> been living separately for an undisclosed length of time. On October 23, 2013, Dina filed for divorce after she withdrew her request for legal separation, citing irreconcilable differences. She asked for full custody of their 16-year-old daughter, Morgan, as well as spousal support. The divorce was finalized on December 22, 2014. Eastwood has since been linked publicly with photographer Erica Tomlinson-Fisher (no relation to Frances), 41 years his junior, and restaurant hostess Christina Sandera, 33 years his junior. He and Sandera went public with their relationship at the 87th Academy Awards in February 2015.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accusation}} against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged {{that she had}} used a spell to cause {{the death of his}} bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> to pay court-related costs.|$|E

5|$|Sherwood {{lived in}} Pungo, Princess Anne County (today part of Virginia Beach), and married James Sherwood, a planter, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she {{was accused of}} casting a spell on a bull, {{resulting}} in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 {{at the age of}} about 80.|$|E
5|$|Victoria fit in {{within the}} Russian {{aristocracy}} and {{the circle of}} her mother-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna. As French was frequently spoken in high circles, Victoria never completely mastered the Russian language. Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II, on her mother's side, and to Empress Alexandra, on her father's side, the relationship with them was neither close nor warm. As Kirill became a keen auto racer, the couple often took trips by car: a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces. Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days, and she traveled abroad frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother {{in the south of}} France or in Coburg. Victoria <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> a close relationship with their daughters, Maria and Kira. The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out.|$|E

25|$|Carmen Barahona, Jorge's wife, told {{investigators}} when questioned that she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> been separated for six months, {{when in fact}} they had never been apart.

25|$|Free {{women might}} marry slaves {{and still be}} dowered for the marriage. The {{children}} were free, and at the slave's death, the wife took her dowry and half of what she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> acquired in wedlock for self and children; the master taking the other half, as his slave's heir.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} manner, {{converts}} {{were made in}} Norway and Chile. A letter published in The Midnight Cry of October 12, 1843, from a Mrs O. S. Burnham of Kaloa, The Sandwich Islands, (now Hawaii) stated that she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> accepted the Millerite message and were worshipping with a small company of believers.|$|E

25|$|When Blankers-Koen {{gave birth}} to her first child Jan Junior in 1941, Dutch media {{automatically}} assumed her career would be over. Top female athletes who were married were rare at the time, and it was considered inconceivable that a mother would be an athlete. Blankers-Koen <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> other plans, and she resumed training only weeks after their son's birth.|$|E
25|$|She {{moved into}} her husband's {{apartment}} in Cambridge and {{gave birth to}} their daughter Zahara in late 2010. At times, {{she worked as a}} home health aide. From September 2011 to November 2012, she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> their income supplemented by public assistance and food stamps. When Tsarnaev was in Russia for six months, she and their daughter stayed in Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|There has been, {{in recent}} years, a trend of legally favoring {{the right to}} a {{relation}} between the child and its biological father, rather than preserving the appearances of the 'social' family. In 2010, the ECtHR ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, {{despite the fact that the}} mother <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> forbidden him from seeing the children.|$|E

25|$|During Kennedy's presidency, she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> come {{to respect}} him and {{understood}} his reluctance {{at times to}} get involved openly with civil rights. In April 1962, Coretta served as delegate for the Women's Strike for Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Martin drove {{her to the hospital}} on March 28, 1963, where King gave birth to their fourth child Bernice. After King and her daughter were due to come home, Martin rushed back to drive them himself.|$|E

Unlike Hermina Tismăneanu, he opted not to return, and soon after left for Venezuela, before ultimately settling in the United States in 1982. During his time in Caracas, he was the recipient of a scholarship at the Contemporary Art Museum.|$|E
