40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{constructions of}} children <b>and</b> <b>childhood(s)</b> on the American voluntourist website www. unitedplanet. com. Using discourse analysis, I identified an overarching discourse of global {{community as a}} common thread on United Planet’s website. Within this discourse, I identified three nodal points using Laclau and Mouffe’s discourse theory: relationships, the dichotomy of global and local, and development. The three nodal points were discussed {{in the context of}} their articulations with discourses of children <b>and</b> <b>childhood(s).</b> The nodal point of relationships was discussed with regards to the discourse of the Romantic child, the global and local to the discourse of universal <b>childhood,</b> <b>and</b> development with regards to the future-oriented or beings vs. becomings discourse. Throughout United Planet’s website, it refers to the contribution that its volunteers make towards building a community beyond borders. Yet within this discourse that proposes values of equality and sharing are tensions that betray this discourse. The construction of the voluntourist was contrasted with the construction of children on the website through images and words, bringing into question whether or not United Planet’s website is a place of equality or disjuncture. The research illuminates how United Planet perpetuates dominant discourses of children <b>and</b> <b>childhood(s),</b> <b>and</b> suggests that the organization understand the representations on their website in the context of the Social studies of children <b>and</b> <b>childhood(s)</b> to further their aim of establishing a unified global community. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fairy tales play a {{substantial}} {{role in the}} shaping of childhoods. Developed into stories and played out in picture books, films and tales, they are powerful instruments that influence conceptions and treatments of the child <b>and</b> <b>childhoods.</b> This article argues that traditional fairy tales and contemporary stories derived from them use complex means to mould the ways that children live <b>and</b> experience their <b>childhoods.</b> This argument is illustrated through representations of <b>childhoods</b> <b>and</b> children in a selection of stories and {{an analysis of the}} ways they act on and produce the child subjects <b>and</b> <b>childhoods</b> they convey. The selected stories are examined through different philosophical lenses, utilizing Foucault, Lyotard and Rousseau. By problematizing these selected stories, the article analyses what lies {{beneath the surface of the}} obvious meanings of the text and enticing pictures in stories, as published or performed. Finally, this article argues for a careful recognition of the complexities of stories used in early <b>childhood</b> settings <b>and</b> their powerful and multifaceted influences on children <b>and</b> <b>childhoods...</b>|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1986, Barry Levinson {{intended}} {{to produce and}} direct a biopic based {{on the life of}} Bobby Darin with funding from his own production company, Baltimore Pictures. With writer Lewis Colick, Levinson pitched the idea to Warner Bros. Pictures, who agreed to co-finance The Bobby Darin Story and cover distribution duties. Producer Arthur Friedman, a fan of Darin's work, began to laboriously negotiate for crucial music licensing rights with Darin's ex-wife, Sandra Dee; his son, Dodd; and former manager Steve Blauner. Colick wrote the first draft in 1987 before Warner Bros. and Levinson commissioned rewrites from Paul Attanasio and Paul Schrader. Their scripts, which kept The Bobby Darin Story title, concentrated on Sandra Dee's alcoholism <b>and</b> <b>childhood</b> molestation by her stepfather. David Gershenson, Darin's longtime friend, publicist and manager, joined the project as a historical consultant. Tom Cruise was reportedly under consideration to portray Darin.|$|E

5|$|He {{was born}} into a lower-class family in Quảng Trị Province, in the {{southern}} part of French Indochina as Lê Văn Nhuận. Little is known about his family <b>and</b> <b>childhood.</b> He first came in contact with revolutionary thoughts in the 1920s through his work as a railway clerk. Lê Duẩn was a founding member of the Indochina Communist Party (the future Communist Party of Vietnam) in 1930. He was imprisoned in 1931 and released in 1937. From 1937 to 1939 he climbed the party ladder. He was rearrested in 1939, this time for fomenting an uprising in the South. Lê Duẩn was released from jail following the successful Communist-led August Revolution.|$|E

5|$|In {{exploring}} {{the similarities between}} Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari, Zaini-Lajoubert notes that {{the names of the}} individual kingdoms, save Barham (Barbam in Siti Akbari), are taken directly from the earlier work. Names of characters, such as Abdul Muluk (in Siti Akbari, Abdul Moelan) and Siti Rapiah (Siti Akbari), are simply replaced, although some minor characters are present in one story and not the other. The main plot elements in both stories are the same; some elements, such as the birth <b>and</b> <b>childhood</b> of Abdul Muluk and the later adventures of Siti Rapiah's son, are present in one story and not the other– or given more detail. The two differ greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} broadly {{concerned}} with the positioning of children, {{both within and outside}} the subject area of International Relations. It considers the costs of an adult- 5 centric standpoint in security studies and contrasts this with investments made seemingly on behalf of children and their security. It begins by looking at how children <b>and</b> <b>childhoods</b> are constructed <b>and</b> contained - yet also defy categorization - at some cost to their protection. The many competing children <b>and</b> <b>childhoods</b> that are invoked in security discourses and partially sustain their victimcy are then illustrated. It is 10 argued that at their entry point into academia they are essentialized and sentimentalized.

5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood <b>and</b> <b>childhood.</b> However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race {{track in the}} desert, its engine roaring {{in and out of}} the shot.

He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor <b>and</b> <b>childhood</b> friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome <b>and</b> <b>childhood</b> disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
