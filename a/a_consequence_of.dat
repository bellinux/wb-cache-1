5|$|Presumably as <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the Roman advance, various hill forts such as Dun Mor in Perthshire, {{which had}} been {{abandoned}} by the natives long ago, were re-occupied.

5|$|Since coenzymes are {{chemically}} {{changed as}} <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> enzyme action, {{it is useful}} to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. For example, about 1000 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH.|$|E
5|$|The Institute of Rail Welding (IoRW) {{was set up}} in 2002 by The Welding Institute (TWI) and Network Rail as <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the {{recommendations}} in the investigation report.

50|$|The {{compactness}} theorem {{says that}} if a formula φ is <b>a</b> logical <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> (possibly infinite) set of formulas Γ then it is <b>a</b> logical <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite subset of Γ.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> his perfectionism is {{that some}} artists who {{initially}} sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.|$|E
