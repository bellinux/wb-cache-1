40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the negotiating positions, or preferences over <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> of the interest groups that may set such standards or negotiate changes in <b>standards.</b> We represent <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> by two properties: toughness and vagueness (or lack of precision). Our model predicts that auditors and investors would consider both toughness and vagueness to influence or set <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> (e. g., preference over vague-ness depends {{on the level of}} toughness.) Since the market is composed with auditors with different wealth and different investment projects, the optimal level of standards would be different for these parties. Therefore, in general, <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> with a certain level of vagueness is preferred. By analyzing economic incentives in the process of setting <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> we help explain how the standards have developed into their current form. ∗We greatly appreciate the advice from Kin Lo, Hugh Neary, and Sandra Chamberlain.
