At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> the club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest {{component}} of the Allied army on the Macedonian front. The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance {{between the two sides}} on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After the first serious battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> the Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, Terry {{was elected}} Councillor for York's Monk Ward, {{a rural area}} close to the modern day Strays of York, as a Conservative. He would later be {{appointed}} Chairman of the York Conservative Association (something that his grandson, Noel Goddard Terry, would also later achieve). Experience in local government was heightened by his election as sheriff, equivalent to a deputy mayoral position, in 1870 under Liberal MP George Leeman, who served as Member of Parliament for the City of York constituency for three years prior to his appointment as Lord Mayor. In 1874, Terry became an Alderman of the City, granting him <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> York's Guildhall for debate in a then partisan chamber under the Conservatives. The party, {{in response to his}} growing popularity, allowed him to run for the Lord Mayoralty within the same year, to which he was elected by consensus, defeating the incumbent local brewer, John March. This position granted him the style the 'Right Honourable' (a title exclusive to the Lord Mayoralty, not the individual).|$|E

5|$|The {{hijacking}} {{occurred on}} board Braathens SAFE Flight 139 {{en route from}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The aircraft was a Boeing 737–205, named Harald Gille (after Harald IV of Norway) with registration LN-SUG. The day before the hijacking, Huseby graduated from upper secondary school, where he studied health and social work. That evening, he purchased an air gun in Trondheim. The weapon was in his hand luggage when boarding the aircraft at Trondheim Airport, Værnes, {{where there was no}} security control. He selected <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> the rear of the aircraft. While airborne, the hijacker showed a female flight attendant the air gun, and asked her to inform the captain that he wanted control over the aircraft, but that otherwise all was to proceed as planned. The flight attendant and later the hijacker used the intercom to communicate with the pilot. The police were informed about the incident via air controllers at 15:05.|$|E
5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E
