40|$|LBNL {{has built}} for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) project a 402. 5 MHz RFQ that is {{designed}} to accelerate up to 60 mA H{sup -} from 65 keV to 2. 5 MeV [1]. A one millisecond pulse length at 60 Hz provides a 6 % duty factor. The RFQ has now been built, conditioned <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>duty</b> factor and tested with beam. This paper will present results from the final installation, tuning and beam commissioning. Beam measurements include acceleration and transport efficiencies and transverse emittances. The LEBT optics were tuned for best results. Performance testing of the RF power distribution is also discussed here...|$|E
40|$|A record {{volume of}} {{beef and veal}} imports into the EU outside of special {{preferential}} arrangements has been reported by Meat and Livestock Australia. In 2002 / 03 the EU imported 61, 615 tonnes of beef <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>duty,</b> some 27 % above 2001 / 2002 levels. The most important markets for this beef were Germany, the UK and the Netherlands. Comment: This {{suggest that there is}} considerable scope for ACP beef exporters to fully utilise their existing quotas and pick up the new markets arising from Zimbabwe's current exclusion from the market. However, {{in order to be able}} to do this the rules of origin on beef products may well need to be relaxed in order to allow greater cumulation with neighbouring non-ACP beef producers.

40|$|A three-axis {{controlled}} spacecraft (1), {{typically a}} satellite, is spun up about its roll axis (20) prior to firing a motor (2), i. e., a perigee kick motor, {{to achieve the}} requisite degree of angular momentum stiffness. Thrusters (21) for imparting rotation about the roll axis (20) are activated in open-loop fashion, typically <b>at</b> less than <b>full</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. Cross-axis torques induced by this rotational motion are compensated for by means of closed control loops {{for each of the}} pitch and yaw axes (30, 40, respectively). Each closed control loop combines a prebias torque (72) with torques (75, 74) representative of position and rate feedback information, respectively. A deadband (52) within each closed control loop can be widened during the spinup, to conserve fuel. Position feedback information (75) in each of the control loops is disabled upon saturation of the gyroscope associated with the roll axis (20) ...|$|R

40|$|In the Royal Navy, after surgery, {{the time}} that {{servicemen}} spend away from work {{and the level of}} duty to which they return are decisions made by the surgeon, not the general practitioner. In a prospective study, we have thus been able to assess the acceptability of return to <b>full</b> <b>duty</b> <b>at</b> decreasing intervals after highly selective vagotomy (HSV). Seventy-eight servicemen who underwent HSV for duodenal ulcer were studied in three periods, 1978 - 1980, 1981 - 1982, 1983 - 1986, each with a shorter interval to return to duty. There were no differences in the rates of ulcer recurrence, incisional hernia, or ability to perform <b>full</b> <b>duties.</b> After HSV the mean time to return to <b>full</b> <b>duties</b> for each group was 29. 3, 16. 4, and 4. 2 weeks, respectively. Every patient returned to <b>full</b> <b>duties</b> <b>at</b> 28 days was able to perform any assigned task whether at sea or ashore...|$|R
