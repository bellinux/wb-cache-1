5|$|Tom Johnson (born Tom Jackling; c.1750– 21 January 1797) was a bare-knuckle fighter who was {{referred}} to as the Champion of England between 1784 and 1791. His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport. Although <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>man,</b> his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to despatching his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered.|$|E

25|$|Dongalor and his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) try {{to extract}} tears from the kidnapped women by torturing them, {{whipping}} them and peeling onions {{in front of}} them, to no avail. Dongalor also tries staging a tragic play with a boy saying goodbye to his dog because his father cannot afford the pet due {{to the death of}} his mother, but the Pagan women are unmoved, although Dongalor cries like a baby. Meanwhile, Longshaft tells Kröd and his three friends to go to the Hessemeel Mountains, through the Forest of Certain Death, and light a pyre {{at the top of a}} tower to warn the other freedom fighters about the pending danger. The foursome go through the forest, where they find <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>man</b> has been savagely killed. They are approached by three beautiful wenches, who insist a group of banshees just tried to kill them. When they seek romance from the group, the homosexual Bruce is the only one who is skeptical, until the wenches bring a gay man from the forest for him. The wenches, who are revealed to be Succubi, impregnate Loquasto and Zezelryck after kissing them, as does the Incubus after kissing Bruce.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} {{toll road}} suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors {{began to make}} their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into [...] packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least , before they had moved all of their supplies {{to the end of the}} trail.

500|$|Although it {{was decided}} he has a sister, {{a wife and a}} daughter, Meyer's {{personal}} life is rarely mentioned on screen, enabling viewers to perceive him as <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>man</b> onto whom they can [...] "project whatever they want from their own imagination." [...] Irving believes that modern television drama is populated by characters prone to disclosing everything about themselves, and so feels that having an enigmatic character like Meyer, who behaves in the reserved vein of Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, makes for a [...] "refreshing change". He commented that revealing more of Meyer's personal life would be anticlimatic compared to viewers' expectations. As preparation for the role, Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, deeming the experience an [...] "enormous privilege". He had a [...] "real fascination" [...] with medicine and the human body prior to assuming the role, and considered studying biology at university. Upon receiving the script for the first episode of Holby City, Irving felt immediately connected to Meyer, commenting: [...] "I knew instinctively how he moved, how he spoke, what he felt. I could feel his heartbeat." ...|$|E

With the backing of the Stalwarts and calls for a [...] "man of iron" [...] to replace the [...] "man of straw" [...] in the White House, Grant was confident that he would receive the Republican nomination for the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, the leader of the Stalwart faction, formed a [...] "triumvirate" [...] with J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois to lead the campaign for Grant's return to the White House. With a Grant victory, Conkling and other Stalwarts would have great influence in the White House. Grant knew he could count on the Stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a Grant victory. Conkling was so confident in Grant's nomination that he said, [...] "Nothing but an act of God could prevent Grant's nomination." [...] An aide to the ex-president, Adam Badeau, commented that Grant had become [...] "extremely anxious to receive the nomination" [...] and did not think that there was any chance of failure.|$|E

Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>man.</b> 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just takes my breath away, b-b-b-breath away / I feel it every day / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips, our energy connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E

The severity of the sickness and the shattering of dreams might have broken lesser men but for Rivers in many ways the illness was the making of him. Whilst recovering from the fever, Rivers had formed a friendship with one of his father's speech therapy students, a young Army surgeon. His plan was formed: he would study medicine and apply for training in the Army Medical Department, later to become the Royal Army Medical Corps.|$|E
2500|$|This {{scheme was}} leaked, then ruined by a decree of the Assembly of 7 November 1789, such that no {{member of the}} Assembly could become a minister. This decree {{destroyed}} any chance {{of the sort of}} harmony between ministers and parliament that existed in England and dashed Mirabeau's hopes. The queen utterly refused to take Mirabeau's counsel saying, [...] "I hope that we shall never sink so low that we shall have to ask for aid from Mirabeau.", and La Marck left Paris. However, in April 1790, La Marck was suddenly recalled by the comte de Mercy-Argenteau, the Austrian ambassador to Paris, and became the queen's most trusted political adviser. From this time to Mirabeau's death, he was the bearer of almost daily communications between Mirabeau and the queen. Mirabeau at first attempted to make an alliance with Lafayette, but it was useless, for Lafayette was not <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>man</b> himself.|$|E
2500|$|Bleeding, says Hildegard, {{should be}} done when the moon is waning, because then the [...] "blood is low" [...] (77:23-25).

For therapeutic bleeding, use the veins nearest the diseased part (122:19); for preventive bleeding, use the large veins in the arms (121:35-122:11), because they are like great rivers whose tributaries irrigate the body (123:6-9, 17-20). 24 From <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>man,</b> take [...] "the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp" [...] (119:20); from a weak one, [...] "the amount that an egg of moderate size can hold" [...] (119:22-23). Afterward, let the patient rest for three days and give him undiluted wine (125:30), because [...] "wine is the blood of the earth" [...] (141:26). This blood can be used for prognosis; for instance, [...] "if the blood comes out turbid like a man's breath, and if there are black spots in it, {{and if there is a}} waxy layer around it, then the patient will die, unless God restore him to life" [...] (124:20-24).|$|E
