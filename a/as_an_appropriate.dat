5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E

5|$|Rugby {{union was}} not {{played at the}} 1904 games in St. Louis, nor at the 1906 Intercalated Games, but was {{included}} in 1908, when the Olympics were held in the sport's native country. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) {{was involved in the}} organization of the sport at this edition of the Olympics. Like the 1900 games, three teams entered: Australasia (representing Australia and New Zealand), France, and hosts Great Britain (which included the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). France pulled out prior to the commencement of the tournament, being unable to field a representative team. Australasia was represented by the Wallabies, who were already on tour in Britain. As the best English and Welsh players were on tour in New Zealand at the time, Great Britain was represented by the Cornwall county team, who were chosen by the RFU <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> side after they defeated Durham in the 1907 English county championship. The choice of Cornwall was controversial, as only three of their players had ever represented England and the Wallabies had defeated them 18 points to five.|$|E
5|$|The five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, {{was opened}} in May 1867. It was an Italianate style hotel and forecourt, {{designed}} by E. M. Barry, and it provided {{many of the}} station's passenger facilities, as well <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement was {{very similar to that}} put in place at Charing Cross. The hotel was not profitable, and was over £47,000 (now £) in debt by 1870. The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879. In July 1920, the hotel was the first meeting point of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, but the public rooms were kept open for meetings. The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable {{communication}} {{that if the}} British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons {{and parts of the}} British media <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.|$|E

25|$|By the 1870s, the old Riksdag Building on Riddarholmen {{had become}} too small and was {{regarded}} as not representative enough, a problem also plaguing the Riksbank, then residing at the Järntorget square in Gamla stan.

The winning proposal from an architectural competition in the late 1880s was further developed by the architect Helgo Zettervall (1831–1907) assisted by Aron Johansson (1860–1936). The old buildings were demolished in 1893, and both institutions completed during 1897-1906. The Riksbank was moved to Brunkebergstorg in 1976, and the building taken over by the Riksdag.|$|E
