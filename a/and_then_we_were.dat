500|$|Back to the Future spent 11 {{weeks at}} number one. Gale {{recalled}} [...] "Our second weekend {{was higher than}} our first weekend, which is indicative of great word of mouth. National Lampoon's European Vacation came out in August and it kicked us out of number one for one week <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> back to number one." [...] The film went on to gross $210.61 million in North America and $173.2 million in foreign countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $383.87million. Back to the Future had the fourth-highest opening weekend of 1985 and was the top-grossing film of the year. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 59 million tickets in the US.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated [...] "When we first came out we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started!". Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!". According to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.|$|E
500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Roberto Orci explained {{in an interview that}} the big reveal {{at the end of the}} episode, in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe, was actually planned for a fourth season, but the writers decided [...] "let's actually answer something instead and not get, not just rely on that mystery forever. And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended". The writers wanted to use an iconic image [...] for the scene, leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg's suggestion of the Twin Towers. Wyman first thought it was [...] "the greatest idea in the world" [...] before having doubts that its use would [...] "sensationalize" [...] it. He explained, [...] "But then, when we started thinking about it, we thought collectively America really understood 9/11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn’t exploited but indicative of the times we’re living in right now. We used it and that was the end of the first season <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all really thrilled with where it was going." [...] The cast would later recollect on the series, and for Jackson, considered that the show has never [...] "had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger" [...] as this finale.|$|E

Steve Aoki and I first talked on Twitter, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> emailing, and then we started throwing music back and forth." [...] In an interview on August 30, 2013, with Shinoda and Aoki, Shinoda said that they began working on the song [...] "no less than a half a year ago". He {{said they did not}} constantly work on it, but [...] "the ideas would flow whenever...something new came up".|$|E
2500|$|On April 8, 2015, Smith {{announced}} that {{plans to start}} shooting Clerks III in May 2015 were put on hold and instead his next film would be Mallrats 2. Smith said, [...] "We were talking about initially shooting Clerks III this summer <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{going to get to}} Mallrats in the beginning of 2016. And then it jumped into 2015, where we were going to shoot Clerks and then hopefully ‘Mallrats’ {{before the end of the}} year. But now, based on a fucking mall that we all dig that will be going away, the priority has become Mallrats. So the next fucking movie I’m making is Mallrats 2." [...] In June 2016, Smith {{announced that}} the plans for a Mallrats sequel had been turned into plans for a 10-episode TV series.|$|E
2500|$|Léger {{wrote in}} 1945 that [...] "the object in modern {{painting}} must become {{the main character}} and overthrow the subject. If, in turn, the human form becomes an object, it can considerably liberate possibilities for the modern artist." [...] He elaborated on this idea in his 1949 essay, [...] "How I Conceive the Human Figure", where he wrote that [...] "abstract art came as a complete revelation, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to consider the human figure as a plastic value, not as a sentimental value. That is why the human figure has remained willfully inexpressive throughout the evolution of my work". As the first painter to take as his idiom the imagery of the machine age, {{and to make the}} objects of consumer society the subjects of his paintings, Léger has been called a progenitor of Pop Art.|$|E

2500|$|Robyn {{performed}} the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge on 16 June 2010. She also {{performed the}} song on Capital 95.8 FM during a live session on 23 June 2010. The first live performance on US television {{was on the}} Late Show with David Letterman on 19 July 2010. Robyn performed the song on the All Hearts joint tour with American singer Kelis. On 30 July 2010, she took {{a break from the}} tour to appear on iHeartRadio in New York City, where she performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] and a cover of Alicia Keys' [...] "Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart". On 12 September 2010, Robyn performed a remixed version of the song with in-house DJ deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. The two did not rehearse the performance until the morning of the show, and Robyn said, [...] "I met him for, like, five minutes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing." [...] A few days later, Robyn spoke to MTV News about the performance, saying, [...] "usually, awards shows can be so strange, but [...] felt really real. There were so many stars there and so many expectations, so I wanted to make sure I went up onstage and did something that felt real, and I got all this love from all the people at MTV. I felt really wanted. It was really amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
