5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), have been <b>associated</b> with an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also {{been found to be}} <b>associated</b> with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly <b>associated</b> with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly <b>associated</b> with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30â€“40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E
