5|$|Government family-friendly {{initiatives}} such <b>as</b> <b>child</b> {{subsidies and}} cheaper child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender {{difference in the}} workplace, due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside the home. In addition, when developing policies related to paid work, {{it is important to}} do gender impact assessments in order {{to assess the impact of}} a policy on both the paid and unpaid sector.|$|E
5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such <b>as</b> <b>child</b> care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such <b>as</b> <b>child</b> care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E

40|$|Consistent with a {{holistic}} perspective emphasizing {{the integration of}} multiple individual characteristics within child systems, {{it was hypothesized that}} subgroups of anxious solitary (<b>AS)</b> <b>children</b> characterized by agreeableness, behavioral normality, attention-seeking–immaturity, and externalizing behaviors would demonstrate heterogeneity in peer relations and dyadic friendships. Sociometrics were collected for 688 3 rd-grade children (mean age 8. 66 years, 51. 5 % female), and recess observations were obtained for a subset of 163 children. Results revealed that agreeable <b>AS</b> <b>children</b> demonstrated significantly superior relational adaptation relative to other <b>AS</b> <b>children,</b> whereas normative, attention-seeking–immature, and externalizing <b>AS</b> <b>children</b> demonstrated increasing relational adversity. Attention-seeking–immature <b>AS</b> <b>children</b> engaged in particularly high rates of directed solitary behavior and were most ignored by peers. Externalizing <b>AS</b> <b>children</b> were most often victimized by peers. Subgroup differences in sociometric peer adversity were qualified by sex...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether adults who witnessed intimate partner violence (IPV) <b>as</b> <b>children</b> {{would have an}} increased rate of being victims of ongoing IPV, {{as measured by the}} Ongoing Violence Assessment Tool (OVAT), compared with adult controls who did not witness IPV <b>as</b> <b>children.</b> The authors also sought to {{determine whether}} there were differences in demographics in these two groups. Methods: This was a cross sectional cohort study of patients presenting to a high-volume academic emergency department. Emergency department patients presenting from November 16, 2005, to January 5, 2006, during 46 randomized four-hour shifts were included. A confidential computer touch-screen data entry program was used for collecting demographic data, including witnessing IPV <b>as</b> a <b>child</b> and the OVAT. Main outcome measures were witnessing IPV <b>as</b> a <b>child,</b> ongoing IPV, and associated demographics. Assuming a prevalence of IPV of 20 % and a clinically significant difference of 20 % between adults who witnessed IPV <b>as</b> <b>children</b> and adult controls who did not witness IPV <b>as</b> <b>children,</b> the study was powered at 80 %, with 215 subjects included. Results: A total of 280 subjects were entered; 256 had complete data sets. Forty-nine percent of subjects were male, 45 % were Hispanic, 72 (28 %) were adults who witnessed IPV <b>as</b> <b>children,</b> and 184 (72 %) were adult controls who did not witness IPV <b>as</b> <b>children.</b> Sixty-three (23. 5 %) were positive for ongoing IPV. There was no correlation of adults who witnessed IPV <b>as</b> <b>children</b> with the presence of ongoing IPV, as determined by univariate and bivariate analysis. Twenty-three of 72 (32 %) of the adults who witnessed IPV <b>as</b> <b>children,</b> and 39 of 184 (21 %) of the adult controls who did not witness IPV <b>as</b> <b>children,</b> were positive for IPV (difference, 11 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2 % to 23 %). Significant correlations with having witnessed IPV <b>as</b> a <b>child</b> included age younger than 40 years (odds ratio [OR], 4. 2; 95 % CI = 1. 7 to 9. 1), income less than $ 20, 000 /year (OR, 5. 1; 95 % CI = 1. 6 to 12. 5), and abuse <b>as</b> a <b>child</b> (OR, 9. 1; 95 % CI = 4. 2 to 19. 6). Other demographics were not significantly correlated with having witnessed IPV <b>as</b> a <b>child.</b> Conclusions: Adults who witnessed IPV <b>as</b> <b>children</b> {{were more likely to have}} a lower income, be younger, and have been abused <b>as</b> a <b>child,</b> but not more likely to be positive for ongoing IPV, when compared with patients who had not witnessed IPV...|$|R
5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them <b>as</b> <b>child</b> pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such <b>as</b> <b>child</b> pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Poole Hospital {{is a large}} NHS Foundation Trust {{hospital}} in Longfleet with 638 beds.

The hospital is the major trauma center for East Dorset and provides core services such <b>as</b> <b>child</b> health and maternity for a catchment area including Bournemouth and Christchurch. Specialist services such as neurological care and cancer treatment are also provided {{for the rest of}} Dorset. The South Western Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport.|$|E

5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels <b>as</b> <b>child</b> prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together <b>as</b> <b>Child,</b> Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
