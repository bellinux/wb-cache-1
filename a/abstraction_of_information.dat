50|$|Despite these {{potential}} problems, distance methods are extremely fast, {{and they often}} produce a reasonable estimate of phylogeny. They also have certain benefits over the methods that use characters directly. Notably, distance methods allow use of data {{that may not be}} easily converted to character data, such as DNA-DNA hybridization assays. They also permit analyses that account for the possibility that the rate at which particular nucleotides are incorporated into sequences may vary over the tree, using LogDet distances. For some network-estimation methods (notably NeighborNet), the <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about individual characters in distance data are an advantage. When considered character-by character, conflict between character and a tree due to reticulation cannot be told from conflict due either to homoplasy or error. However, pronounced conflict in distance data, which represents an amalgamation of many characters, is less likely due to error or homoplasy unless the data are strongly biased, and is thus more likely to be a result of reticulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of communication protocols, sensory hardware, mobile and pervasive devices, alongside social and cyber-physical networks, {{has made the}} Internet of things (IoT) an interesting concept with inherent complexities as it is realised.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} repetition for place learning in children although the acquisition of organizing spatial concepts is often seen as more essential. In a reaction-time accuracy task, 7 - and 9 -year-old children were presented with a randomized sequence of objects-in-places. In a novelty condition (NC), memory sets in different colours were presented, while in a repetition condition (RC), the identical memory set was tested several times. Shape memory deteriorated more than place memory in the NC, but also stayed superior to place memory when both improved in the RC. False alarms occurred for objects and places {{in the same way}} in 7 -year-olds in the NC, but were negligible for 9 -year-olds. In contrast, false alarms in the RC occurred in both age groups mainly for place memory. The Common Region Test (CRT) predicted reaction times only in the novelty condition, indicating use of spatial concepts. Importantly, reaction times for shapes were faster than for places {{at the beginning of the}} experiment but slowed down thereafter, while reaction times for places were slow at the beginning of the experiment but accelerated considerably thereafter.

On average, HRT had been used 9 years before recruitment to the study and for 15 months.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} realisation {{of the importance}} of information and elicitation of knowledge, the need for improved methods of extraction and <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and knowledge has gained equal attention. To this end, visualisation methods have been viewed an effective way of abstracting information. Over the past three decades, these methods have undergone a rapid revolutionary progress, supported by sophisticated visualisation tools, analytical and simulation methodologies and techniques. During this period, the visualisation of an object, such as a building, 'in time' – viewing it from different perspectives – has gained significant attention and developments have been underpinned by sophisticated software technology. However, visualisation of a building 'through time' – viewing it as it degrades through aging – has received limited attention. Indeed, the ability to visualise the behaviour of a building, through time, has the potential to yield significant advantages: at the design phase, the informed choice of different building materials enables the architect to meet the client's technical, aesthetic and economical objectives. Extending the same capabilities to the maintenance phase can result in the development of just-in-time schedules which can prevent wastages without compromising the service to the users of the building. With advances in the BIM technology and the promised paradigm shift in the manner stakeholders collaborate and interact, the ability to simulate and visualise the time-based behaviour of building elements can assist decisions relating to both design and scheduling. In this paper, the overall model of the visual building design and maintenance is proposed and its practicality is demonstrated through its application to the building lighting system. The overall process is modelled and generalised and the lighting system is introduced as an example where the research work can be applied: the time related behaviour of different light sources under the impact of intrinsic and environmental factors is modelled and expressed in a mathematical form which facilitates visualisation through the use of Visual User Interface...|$|E

In the EWall workspace, users collect and arrange cards, which are compact visual <b>abstractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> A significant problem that often arises when humans try to collect information is information overload. Information overload refers {{to the state of}} having too much information, and it causes difficulty in discovering relevant information. When affected by information overload, the user loses focus and spends more time filtering out irrelevant information. This thesis first presents a simple solution that uses a set of algorithms that prioritize information. Based on the information the user is working with, the algorithms search for relevant information in a database by analyzing spatial, temporal, and collaborative relationships. A second, more adaptive solution uses agents that observe user behavior and learn to apply the prioritization algorithms more effectively. Adaptive agents help to prevent information overload by removing the burden of search and filter from the user, and they hasten the process of discovering interesting and relevant information. by Matthew C.
