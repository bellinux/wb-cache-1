So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow then I remembered hearing Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> he was now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanland." [...] They worked on their first composition, [...] "Pulse," [...] inspired by the sound of a heartbeat.|$|E

[...] "I hadn't heard my voice in 10 years, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it coming over the speaker, it was like: 'Oh, that’s not bad. Maybe I should do that again,'" [...] Reddy explained in 2013. On 12 July 2012, Reddy returned to the musical stage at Croce's Jazz Bar in San Diego and for a benefit concert for the arts at St. Genevieve High School in Panorama City, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. Reddy also sang a duet ("You're Just in Love") with senior choir member Rosalind Smith.|$|E

Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song for a while <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes {{you get to a}} point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track. I just remember feeling like that at a point in my life. I know {{there are so many people}} out there that go through that dark time and I felt like it could speak to a lot of people." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{two hours}} or more we talked, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> her story <b>I</b> told her mine, and she wept for me, since with all her faults Marina's heart was ever gentle.|$|R

"Nay, the {{innocent}} sounds of mirth ring sweetly on my ears, like the notes of birds. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> a charming voice singing {{to the little}} ones, I have listened with delight.
