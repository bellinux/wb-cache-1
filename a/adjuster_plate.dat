40|$|Abstract. A {{swash plate}} pump-controlled {{hydraulic}} motor {{system has been}} presented in this work. The flow rate of the hydraulic motor system and then the output speed could be controlled by <b>adjusting</b> the swash <b>plate</b> angle. Actuating the swash plate using DC servomotor could enhance dynamic performance of the pump, and then better improve the performance of overall hydraulic motor system. In this study, another speed control configuration has been introduced and the angular velocity of hydraulic motor has been controlled using both PI (proportional and integral) and FL (fuzzy logic) controllers. However, due to the nonlinear nature and time-varying dynamics of the considered system, PI controllers are sometimes insufficient to overcome such nonlinearities because they have linear characteristics. Therefore, this classical controller sometimes fails to compensate the change in system parameters unless its parameters (PI controller) are repeatedly tuned. Unlike classical control methods, the fuzzy controller is designed with linguistic terms to cope with nonlinearities.

The participants were 8394  people, aged 5  years and over, living in 37  rural communities, mesoendemic and non-endemic for onchocerciasis, in Kaduna State in northern Nigeria. The main outcome measures were the detection of a defect in blue-yellow colour vision by two criteria: (1) failure with the City University tritan screening plates; (2) failure with the City University grading plates to identify severe tritan defects.  RESULTS— 91 % of those aged 10  years and above could perform the test. Below this age, there were difficulties in comprehension. The test showed good inter- and intraobserver agreement. After adjustment for confounders the odds of failing the screening plates were significantly increased {{in the presence of}} optic atrophy or glaucoma (3. 55  (2. 48 - 5. 08) and 15. 9  (4. 22 - 60. 2) respectively).

The dehydration curve was determined in the whole plant for ten times until the baling. The zero time corresponded to the plant before cutting, which occurred at 11 : 00 and the other collections were carried out at 8 : 00, 10 : 00, 14 : 00, and 16 : 00. The experimental design was randomised blocks with two intensities of conditioning (high and low) and ten sampling times, with five replications. The high and low intensities related to <b>adjusting</b> the deflector <b>plate</b> of the free iron fingers (8 and 18 cm). In order to determine gas exchanges during Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration, there were evaluations of mature leaves, which {{were placed in the}} upper middle third of each branch before the cutting, at every hour for 4 hours. A portable gas analyser was used by an infrared IRGA (6400 xt). The analysed variables were photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), transpiration (T), water use efficiency (WUE), and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi). In the second part of this study, the nutritional value of Tifton 85 hay was evaluated, so randomised blocks were designed in a split plot through time, with two treatments placed in the following plots: high and low intensity of cutting and five different time points as subplots: cutting (additional treatment), baling and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. Subsequently, fungi that were in green plants as well as hay were determined and samples were collected from the grass at the cutting period, during baling, and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. It was observed that Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration occurred within 49 hours, so this was considered the best time for drying hay. Gas exchanges were more intense before cutting, although after cutting they decreased until ceasing within 4 hours. The lowest values of acid detergent insoluble nitrogen were obtained with low conditioning intensity after 30 days of storage, 64. 8 g/kg DM. The in vitro dry matter of Tifton 85 bermudagrass did not differ among the storage times or the conditioning intensities. There was no fungi present in the samples collected during the storage period up to 90 days after dehydration, with less than 30 colony forming units found on plate counting.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis is primarily motivated by rising fuel costs and increasingly stringent emissions regulations for diesel engines. These factors increase the cost of operation {{and the cost of}} production of mobile hydraulic machine systems, thereby providing large incentives for the discoveries of more efficient hydraulic system solutions. Additionally, sensors and electronics are becoming more openly accepted for use in mobile hydraulic machine systems and they are key enablers to the development of smarter and more efficient system solutions. Displacement controlled (DC) actuation technology is an energy efficient hydraulic actuation technology which could have a substantial impact on energy consumption and emissions of the mobile machine sector if it were to become widely accepted. It has been demonstrated to save 40 % fuel compared to a standard load sensing hydraulic system on a compact excavator performing a truck loading cycle. Its lack of acceptance today is due to a combination of unfamiliarity with the system, higher costs due to current low volume production of necessary components, and its reliance on sensors and electronic controllers. DC actuation is a hydraulic actuation technology where the motion of the hydraulic motor or cylinder is controlled directly by the volume of fluid displaced by a servo pump, without the use of metering valves. More specifically, in this work it will refer to the use of a swash plate type axial piston pump to control a hydraulic cylinder, where the cylinder motion is controlled directly by <b>adjusting</b> the swash <b>plate</b> angle. This type of actuation is more efficient than valve controlled actuators because only the exact amount of pressure and flow required for actuator control is generated and therefore the only power losses are those of the pump, the transmission lines, and the cylinder. In addition to this the servo pump will behave as a motor when braking of the actuator is required and this will recover energy to the input shaft which can either be stored or used elsewhere in the system. This thesis will focus on design of multi-actuator DC hydraulic systems. Specifically new circuit architectures will be introduced with goals of overcoming common barriers to the application of basic DC actuators in mobile machine systems. The most notable of these architectures is the DC series-parallel (S-P) hydraulic hybrid system which introduces energy storage into DC actuator systems without requiring an additional pump/motor for energy storage and reuse. Among other benefits this system also has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} pumps required for DC actuator systems in multi-actuator mobile machines. A dynamic simulation of this system for an aggressive truck loading cycle of an excavator reveals that the hybrid design would save 20 % fuel compared to the non-hybrid DC system while allowing a reduction of 50 % for the rated engine power. In addition to new architecture designs static sizing guidelines are given for DC actuators and a multi-body dynamic and hydraulic co-simulation model is derived for multi-actuator DC systems and validated with experimental measurements on a DC excavator. The model is then used to study the effect of component sizing, component performance, and parameter variations on the overall system productivity and efficiency of the non-hybrid DC system. A new static sizing methodology is also introduced for the S-P hybrid system and a dynamic sizing methodology using dynamic programming as a design tool is presented for DC S-P hybrid systems. Finally the improved efficiency of DC hydraulic systems results in lower operating temperatures of the hydraulic oil compared to standard valve controlled systems. For this reason a thermal model for multi-actuator DC mobile machines is introduced. The model is validated with experimental measurements and simulations show that the heat rejection requirement of the hydraulic cooler on the prototype DC excavator could be reduced by as much as 50 %. ...|$|R
