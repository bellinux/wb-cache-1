5|$|After 600, {{information}} on the Britons of <b>Alt</b> Clut becomes {{more common in the}} sources. In 642, led by Eugein son of Beli, they defeated the men of Dál Riata and killed Domnall Brecc, grandson of Áedán, at Strathcarron. The kingdom suffered a number of attacks from the Picts under Óengus, and later the Picts' Northumbrian allies between 744 and 756. They lost the region of Kyle in the south-west of modern Scotland to Northumbria, and the last attack may have forced the king Dumnagual III to submit to his neighbours. After this, little is heard of <b>Alt</b> Clut or its kings until <b>Alt</b> Clut was burnt and probably destroyed in 780, although by whom and what in what circumstances is not known, Historians have traditionally identified <b>Alt</b> Clut with the later Kingdom of Strathclyde, but J.

5|$|After {{continuing}} into Allegany County, <b>Alt</b> US40 descends Savage Mountain into Frostburg, {{where it}} passes through the town as Main Street. Main Street in Frostburg has the highest traffic density on the route, with an AADT of 15,022. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 between exits 33 and 34 has an AADT of 20,931.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{identify}} the current usage of <b>ALTs</b> at schools for the deaf (SfDs) in Japan and to explore considerations for effective interaction and team teaching from the perspectives of the <b>ALTs</b> themselves. A questionnaire survey was conducted by mail to <b>ALTs</b> at SfDs. Twenty-six <b>ALTs</b> who work in 28 SfDs responded to the survey. Around eighty percent of <b>ALTs</b> had less than two yearsʼ experience and 60 percent of them did not have any knowledge of sign languages. Two specific issues for <b>ALTs</b> at SfDs were firstly use of sign languages and secondly the way of communicating with deaf students such as lip reading. For effective interaction and team teaching with <b>ALTs,</b> two recommendations were suggested. Specific considerations on the effective use of <b>ALTs</b> at SfDs include, valuing <b>ALTs</b> who provide a cross-cultural experience to students, providing <b>ALTs</b> with key points to communicate with deaf students and including <b>ALTs</b> {{as a member of the}} school community...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders {{characterized by}} restrictions in social interaction, understanding, and communication, by stereotyped patterns of repetitive behaviors, and by narrow interests. ASDs, which affect about 1 % of the population, are predominantly genetic, but no single explanation has been found. On the contrary, {{a multitude of}} developmental trajectories are possible. In relatives of individuals with ASDs, autistic-like traits (<b>ALTs,</b> i. e. traits that are less pronounced than, but qualitatively similar to, ASD symptoms) occur more frequently than expected by chance. When studied in the general population, <b>ALTs</b> have shown high internal consistency, dimensional distributions, and hereditary influence. It is, however, unclear if ASDs are the extreme end of a continuum of <b>ALTs,</b> if <b>ALTs</b> are psychiatrically relevant, and if <b>ALTs</b> share etiological factors with ASDs. Methods This thesis employs three nation-wide twin studies to pursue the following aims: 1. To establish the distribution of <b>ALTs</b> and provide estimates of the genetic and environmental effects involved. 2. To describe the relationships between <b>ALTs</b> {{and other types of}} mental problems, including shared etiology. 3. To clarify whether <b>ALTs</b> are influenced by increasing paternal age, which is a known risk factor for ASDs. 4. To determine whether there is a demarcation in the genetic effects between ASDs and <b>ALTs.</b> Results 1. <b>ALTs</b> are dimensionally distributed in 46 % of all 9 - and 12 -year-old twins, and genetic effects account for 68 % of the variation in <b>ALTs.</b> 2. Increasing levels of <b>ALTs</b> are related to an increased risk of concomitant mental health problems in both adults and children. In addition, common genetic and environmental etiological factors were found behind <b>ALTs</b> and phenotypically different mental health problems. 3. Increasing paternal age increases the risk for <b>ALTs</b> and ASDs alike. 4. No demarcation could be discerned between the genetic effects on ASDs and <b>ALTs,</b> implying a continuum from ASDs to <b>ALTs</b> predominantly affected by genes. Conclusion Taken together, the results of this thesis suggest that ASDs can be viewed as the extreme end of <b>ALTs,</b> or that <b>ALTs</b> are truly a ‘shadow’ of ASDs in persons with sub-threshold problems with social interaction, communication, and behavioral flexibility, and that <b>ALTs</b> may be crucial for understanding mental health problems and for scientific attempts to identify etiological factors behind ASDs...|$|R

5|$|<b>Alt</b> US40 {{branches}} from US40 near exit 14 on I-68 at Keysers Ridge. It {{runs parallel}} to I-68 through northern Garrett County as a two-lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections. The annual {{average daily traffic}} (AADT)—that is, the number of cars that use the road per day, averaged {{over the course of}} one year—is 1,831 at the western end of <b>Alt</b> US40. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 has an AADT of 14,271. <b>Alt</b> US40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland. The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County, and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill. The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is Negro Mountain. The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of , which is the highest point on <b>Alt</b> US40, and was also the highest point along the National Road. East of Negro Mountain, the highway enters Grantsville, where traffic increases, with the AADT increasing to 3,711, the highest traffic density on <b>Alt</b> US40 in Garrett County. In Grantsville, <b>Alt</b> US40 meets MD669, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 669 toward Salisbury, Pennsylvania. A short distance east of this intersection, the highway meets MD495, which junctions with I-68 and continues southward toward Oakland. East of Grantsville, <b>Alt</b> US40 passes over the Casselman River on a steel bridge built in 1933.

5|$|East of Eckhart Mines, <b>Alt</b> US40 {{passes through}} Clarysville, where it intersects MD55. It is near Clarysville that the terrain {{followed}} by <b>Alt</b> US40 changes: from Clarysville westward {{to the summit}} of Savage Mountain, the road runs uphill, while east of Clarysville, the road follows valleys, first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland, and then following the valley around Wills Creek into Cumberland. Near the MD55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s, and carried the National Road over Braddock Run, a tributary to Wills Creek. East of Clarysville, the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and Dan's Mountain. I-68, having been built later, {{is located on the}} hillside above <b>Alt</b> US40, on the Dan's Mountain side of the gap. <b>Alt</b> US40 then descends Red Hill into LaVale. At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale toll gate house. Built in 1836, tolls were collected there until the early 1900s, and it is the last original National Road toll gate house standing in Maryland. In LaVale, the route intersects MD53, which serves as a truck bypass for US 220 to Cresaptown. <b>Alt</b> US40 interchanges with westbound I-68 at exit 39, but eastbound access is only available via MD53 and MD658, which intersects <b>Alt</b> US40 east of the exit 39 interchange. The highway expands to a four-lane road near its intersection with MD53, then narrows to a two-lane road near its intersection with MD658. East of the intersection with MD658, <b>Alt</b> US40 turns northward, passing through LaVale toward the Narrows, bypassing Haystack Mountain to the north, as opposed to I-68, which passes directly over Haystack Mountain, paralleling Braddock Road (MD49).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Autistic-like traits (<b>ALTs),</b> that is {{restrictions}} in intuitive social interaction, communication and flexibility of interests and behaviors, were studied in two population-based Swedish twin studies, one {{in children and}} one in adults: (1) to examine whether the variability in <b>ALTs</b> is a meaningful risk factor for concomitant {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), anxiety, conduct problems, depression and substance abuse, and (2) to assess whether common genetic and environmental susceptibilities can help to explain co-existence of <b>ALTs</b> and traits associated with such concomitant problems. MethodTwo nationwide twin cohorts from Sweden (consisting of 11 222 children and 18 349 adults) were assessed by DSM-based symptom algorithms for autism. The twins were divided into six groups based on their degree of <b>ALTs</b> and the risk for concomitant mental health problems was calculated for each group. Genetic and environmental susceptibilities common to <b>ALTs</b> and the other problem types were examined using bivariate twin modeling. RESULTS: In both cohorts, even the lowest degree of <b>ALTs</b> increased the risk for all other types of mental health problems, and these risk estimates increased monotonically with the number of <b>ALTs.</b> For all conditions, common genetic and environmental factors could be discerned. Overall, the phenotypic correlation between <b>ALTs</b> and the traits examined were less pronounced in adulthood than in childhood and less affected by genetic compared with environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS: Even low-grade <b>ALTs</b> are relevant to clinical psychiatry as they increase the risk for several heterotypical mental health problems. The association is influenced partly by common genetic and environmental susceptibilities. Attention to co-existing <b>ALTs</b> is warranted in research {{on a wide range of}} mental disorders...|$|R
