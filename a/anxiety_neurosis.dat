Kiš visited his father in the hospital {{during one of his}} later stays. This visit, in which, Kiš recalled his father asking his mother for a pair of scissors with which to commit suicide, made a strong impression on young Danilo. For many years, Kiš believed that his father's psychological troubles stemmed from alcoholism. Only in the 1970s did Kiš learn that his father had suffered from <b>anxiety</b> <b>neurosis.</b> Between stays in the hospital, Eduard Kiš edited the 1938 edition of the Yugoslav National and International Travel Guide. Young Danilo saw his father as a traveler and a writer. Eduard Scham, the eccentric father of the protagonist of Early Sorrows, Garden, Ashes, and Hourglass is largely based on Kiš's own father.|$|E

5000|$|In 1959, Max R Hamilton {{developed}} {{the first version}} of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. He included a distinction “between anxiety as a normal reaction to danger, anxiety as a pathological condition not related to stress, and anxiety as a state or broad syndrome that he termed “anxiety neurosis.’” Hamilton {{developed the}} scale to be used with patients already known to suffer from <b>anxiety</b> <b>neurosis,</b> not {{to be used as a}} means of diagnosing anxiety in patients with other disorders. Although Hamilton developed the scale as a rating of severity, he used his scale to differentiate “anxiety as a pathological mood” from a “state (or neurosis).” [...] He used common methods for designing the rating scale. A variety of relevant symptoms were collected and divided into groups. The scale started with twelve groups of symptoms, which came to form thirteen scale variables. All of the thirteen variables were described by succinct statements and included on a sheet that was used by an interviewer for assessing a patient. The original version used a “five-point scale” for rating the groups of symptoms. The first version of the scale was only a start, and as Hamilton stated, “Some of the variables are obviously a rag-bag of oddments and need further investigation.” He conducted tests on the original scale that initiated improvement and, over time, evolved the structure and scoring of the scale to its present state.|$|E
5000|$|The American Psychiatric Association first {{introduced}} GAD as a diagnosis in the DSM-III in 1980. Prior {{to the introduction}} of this diagnosis, GAD was presented as one of the two core components of <b>anxiety</b> <b>neurosis,</b> the other being panic. The definition in the DSM-III required uncontrollable and diffuse anxiety or worry that is excessive and unrealistic and persists for 1 month or longer. High rates in comorbidity of GAD and major depression led many commentators to suggest that GAD would be better conceptualized as an aspect of major depression instead of an independent disorder. Many critics stated that the diagnostic features of this disorder were not well established until the DSM-III-R. Since comorbidity of GAD and other disorders decreased with time, the DSM-III-R changed the time requirement for a GAD diagnosis to 6 months or longer. The DSM-IV changed the definition of excessive worry and the number of associated psychophysiological symptoms required for a diagnosis. Another aspect of the diagnosis the DSM-IV clarified was what constitutes a symptom as occurring [...] "often." [...] The DSM-IV also required difficulty controlling the worry to be diagnosed with GAD. The DSM-5 emphasized that excessive worrying had to occur more days than not and on a number of different topics. It has been stated that the constant changes in the diagnostic features of the disorder have made it difficult for researchers to identify the biological and psychological underpinnings of the disorder making it difficult to create specialized medications for the disorder. This has led to the continuation of GAD being medicated heavily with SSRIs.|$|E

No such case should, however, be so labelled on evacuation as to fix the idea of nervous breakdown in the patient's mind.;In base hospitals:When evacuation to the base hospital is necessary, cases should be treated in a separate hospital or separate sections of a hospital, and not with the ordinary sick and wounded patients. Only in exceptional circumstances should cases be sent to the United Kingdom, as, for instance, men likely to be unfit for further service of any kind with the forces in the field. This policy should be widely known throughout the Force.;Forms of treatment:The establishment of an atmosphere of cure is the basis of all successful treatment, the personality of the physician is, therefore, of the greatest importance. While recognizing that each individual case of war neurosis must be treated on its merits, the Committee are of opinion that good results will be obtained in the majority by the simplest forms of psycho-therapy, i.e., explanation, persuasion and suggestion, aided by such physical methods as baths, electricity and massage. Rest of mind and body is essential in all cases.:The committee are of opinion that the production of deep hypnotic sleep, while beneficial as a means of conveying suggestions or eliciting forgotten experiences are useful in selected cases, but in the majority they are unnecessary and may even aggravate the symptoms for a time.:They do not recommend psycho-analysis in the Freudian sense.:In the state of convalescence, re-education and suitable occupation of an interesting nature are of great importance. If the patient is unfit for further military service, it is considered that every endeavor should be made to obtain for him suitable employment on his return to active life.;Return to the fighting line:Soldiers should not be returned to the fighting line under the following conditions:-:(1) If the symptoms of neurosis are of such a character that the soldier cannot be treated overseas with a view to subsequent useful employment.:(2) If the breakdown is of such severity as to necessitate a long period of rest and treatment in the United Kingdom.:(3) If the disability is <b>anxiety</b> <b>neurosis</b> of a severe type.:(4) If the disability is a mental breakdown or psychosis requiring treatment in a mental hospital.:It is, however, considered that many of such cases could, after recovery, be usefully employed in some form of auxiliary military duty.|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of meta-analyses of {{antidepressant}} randomized controlled trials (RCTs), {{it is unclear whether}} a relationship exists between study quality, treatment estimates, and different quality measures. In this systematic review, we investigated whether quality of RCTs allocating patients with major depression to fluoxetine versus any other antidepressant agent influenced treatment estimates. We designed a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of RCTs, obtaining data from the Cochrane Collaboration Depressive <b>Anxiety</b> and <b>Neurosis</b> Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists, and specialist textbooks, with no language restriction. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Efficacy and tolerability outcomes were calculated for the overall sample and for the subgroup of high-quality trials. Quality was assessed using the Jadad scale, the Cochrane Collaboration Depressive <b>Anxiety</b> and <b>Neurosis</b> quality assessment instrument and 3 items of the CONSORT statement. A meta-regression analysis was also carried out. Thirty-nine RCTs contributed to efficacy and 74 to tolerability analyses. We found no correlation between the methodological quality of reports of RCTs and treatment estimates of efficacy and tolerability. Subgroup analyses of high-quality trials provided treatment estimates that did not materially change from overall estimates. This finding was further confirmed by the meta-regression analysis. Quality is an important issue and meta-analyses should take quality into consideration to provide less biased treatment estimates. However, current quality measures are not related with treatment estimates in antidepressant trials and may not be useful weighting tools when meta-analyses of data extracted from antidepressant RCTs are carried out...|$|R

40|$|Aims: A {{discussion}} of the existence, prevalence and characteristics of the nocebo effect in health care. Background: There is increasing but inconsistent evidence for nocebo effects (the opposite of placebo). Causal mechanisms {{are believed to be}} similar to placebo (negative effects result from suggestions of negative clinical outcomes). Risk screening in health care may produce this unintended effect through labelling some patients as high risk. Given health care's almost universal coverage this potentially affects many people. Design: Discussion paper following a scoping review of the existence and frequency of nocebo. Data sources: Literature databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CCTR, CINAHL and EMBASE) searched from inception dates to 2013. Implications for nursing: Significant empirical evidence indicates that negative beliefs may impact on health outcomes (incidence estimates range from 3 - 27 %). The nocebo effect, rooted in the complex interplay between physiological functioning and social factors, appears significantly more common among women and where prior negative knowledge or expectations exist. Pre-existing psychological characteristics (<b>anxiety,</b> <b>neuroses,</b> panic disorder or pessimism) exacerbate it. Conclusion: While the placebo effect is well documented, there has been no systematic attempt to synthesize primary empirical research on the role of nocebo. It is possible that nocebo outcomes may be preventable through careful consideration of information provision and the prior identification of potentially high risk individuals. This paper summarizes the scale and importance of the nocebo effect, its distribution according to a range of social and clinical variables and its known relation to psychological precursors. It identifies important gaps in the research literature...|$|R
