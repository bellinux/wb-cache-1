40|$|BACKGROUND: Smartphone sensors are underutilised in rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} the step count algorithm {{used in the}} STARFISH smartphone application. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy adults (8 male, 14 female) walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 0. 44, 0. 67, 0. 90 and 1. 33 m⋅s- 1. Each wore an activPAL TM and four Samsung Galaxy S 3 TM smartphones, with the STARFISH application running, in: 1) a belt carrycase, 2) a trouser or skirt pocket), 3 a) a handbag on shoulder for females or 3 b) shirt pocket for males and 4) an upper <b>arm</b> <b>strap.</b> Step counts of the STARFISH application and the activPALTM were compared at corresponding speeds and Bland-Altman statistics used to assess level of agreement (LOA). RESULTS: The LOA between the STARFISH application and activPALTM varied across the four speeds and positions, but improved as speed increased. The LOA ranged from 105 – 177 % at 0. 44 m⋅s- 1; 50 – 98 % at 0. 67 m⋅s- 1; 19 – 67 % at 0. 9 m⋅s- 1 and 8 – 53 % at 1. 33 m⋅s- 1. The best LOAs were at 1. 33 m⋅s- 1 in the shirt pocket (8 %) and upper <b>arm</b> <b>strap</b> (12 %) positions.

40|$|A brief {{touch on}} the upper arm {{increases}} people's altruistic behavior and willingness {{to comply with a}} request. In this paper, we investigate whether this Midas touch phenomenon would also occur under mediated conditions (i. e., touching via an <b>arm</b> <b>strap</b> equipped with electromechanical actuators). Helping behavior was more frequently endorsed in the touch, compared to the no-touch condition, but this difference was not found to be statistically significant. However, a meta-analytical comparison with published research demonstrated that the strength of the virtual Midas touch is of the same magnitude as that of the Midas touch in unmediated situations. The present experiment, thus, provides empirical evidence that touch-like qualities can be attributed to electromechanical stimulation. This is important for the field of mediated social touch of which the design rationale {{is based on the assumption}} that mediated touch by means of tactile feedback technologies is processed in ways similar to real physical contact...|$|E

50|$|Before {{effective}} treatments were available, syphilis could {{sometimes be}} disfiguring {{in the long}} term, leading to defects of the face and nose ("nasal collapse"). Syphilis was a stigmatized disease due to its sexually transmissible nature. Such defects marked the person as a social pariah, and a symbol of sexual deviancy. Artificial noses were sometimes used to improve this appearance. The pioneering work of the facial surgeon Gasparo Tagliacozzi in the 16th century marked {{one of the earliest}} attempts to surgically reconstruct nose defects. Before the invention of the free flap, only local tissue adjacent to the defect could be harvested for use, as the blood supply was a vital determining factor in the survival of the flap. Tagliacozzi's technique was to harvest tissue from the arm without removing its pedicle from the blood supply on the arm. The patient would have to stay with their <b>arm</b> <b>strapped</b> to their face until new blood vessels grew at the recipient site, and the flap could finally be separated from the arm during a second procedure.|$|R

50|$|The M86 antipersonnel mine is {{manually}} armed {{by removing}} the safety clip and then the <b>arming</b> <b>strap</b> assembly. A camming action breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at-rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically. Disturbance of a tripline, or the mine itself, now triggers a switch which completes an electronic firing circuit. The S&A electric detonator initiates the S&A firing train which initiates a detonating cord which the initiates {{a thin layer of}} liquid propellant, which by gravity rests under the kill mechanism, shattering the plastic mine body and propelling the kill mechanism upwards from 6 inches to 8 feet above the ground where it detonates. The kill mechanism is a spheroid internally embossed and loaded with 21 grams of Comp A5 and when detonated, propels fragments in a high velocity spherical pattern.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that centrally generated motor commands contribute to the perception of position and movement at the wrist, but not at the elbow. Because the wrist and elbow experiments used different methods, {{this study was designed to}} resolve the discrepancy. Two methods were used to test both the elbow and wrist (20 subjects each). For the wrist, subjects sat with their right <b>arm</b> <b>strapped</b> to a device that restricted movement to the wrist. Before each test, voluntary contraction of wrist flexor or extensor muscles controlled for muscle spindle thixotropy. After relaxation, the wrist was moved to a test angle. Position was indicated either with a pointer, or by matching with the contralateral wrist, under two conditions: when the reference wrist was relaxed or when its muscles were contracted isometrically (30 % maximum). The elbow experiment used the same design to measure position sense in the passive elbow and with elbow muscles contracting (30 % maximum). At the wrist when using a pointer, muscle contraction altered significantly the perceived wrist angle in the direction of contraction by 7 deg [3 deg, 12 deg] (mean [95 % confidence interval]) with a flexor contraction and 8 deg [4 deg, 12 deg] with an extensor contraction. Similarly, in the wrist matching task, there was a change of 13 deg [9 deg, 16 deg] with a flexor contraction and 4 deg [1 deg, 8 deg] with an extensor contraction. In contrast, contraction of elbow flexors or extensors did not alter significantly the perceived position of the elbow, compared with rest. The contribution of central commands to position sense differs between the elbow and the wrist. © 2013 The Authors...|$|R
