5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an Oblivion release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> <b>with</b> analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion. News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing Hot Coffee minigame controversy, worse than average sales for the company's flagship , sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.|$|E
