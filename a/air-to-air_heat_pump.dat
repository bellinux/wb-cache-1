40|$|International audienceHeat pump {{systems have}} become very popular for space heating in the {{residential}} sector in Europe. However, there is no data available on the in situ seasonal <b>heating</b> performances of <b>air-to-air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> This {{is due to the}} difficulty of measuring their thermal capacity on field over a long period. Several methods relying on air flow rate and enthalpy measurements are being considered for in-situ measurement for <b>air-to-air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> But accuracy and reliability of these methods are still unknown. In this paper, we show the results of a method based on intrusive measurements (on the refrigerant side) adapted to the dynamic behavior. This method uses Coriolis flow meters measures for the refrigerant flow rate and for enthalpies. Results confirm that the refrigerant density measurement with a Coriolis flow meter can help to predict the refrigerant vapor quality with a satisfying accuracy if the quality is not too high. The method is validated by testing an air-to-water <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> in laboratory and by using the water enthalpy method as a reference.

40|$|AbstractWater source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> in {{comparison}} to <b>air-to-air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> have significant advantage for heating or cooling applications due to the relatively regulated temperature of most water resources. In the UK, similar to many other countries, disused coal mines have untapped potential for low cost green energy due to the flooding of coal mines with water at reasonable warm temperature due to the availability of geothermal energy at different depths. This allows to use water source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> in locations away from rivers and seas for heating and cooling applications. Extracting energy from flooded coal mines using water <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> with open loop systems is still relatively a new concept, but can provide much heating capacity due to eliminating the time needed for heat transfer between the external environment and the heating loop in case of closed loop systems. The use of real systems to conduct research could be an expensive task or impractical to users of the application such as {{the residents of the}} served building. On the other hand, computer simulation includes significant assumptions that might not be accurate in many real situations.

40|$|An {{alternative}} to {{traditional methods of}} residential heating and cooling is the heat pump. However, heat pumps which use the outside air as a heat source/sink become inefficient during the periods of highest demand.

This showed that the heat pump offers economic advantages over the oil and coal-fired boiler systems, but is not an economic alternative to the gas-fired heating system. Because the unit price of the gas is 3 Â· 84 times less than that for electricity, to become competitive with a gas-fired boiler, either the capital cost of the heat pump must be substantially reduced or its seasonal COP increased by about 60 %: it should also be driven by a gas engine rather than an electric engine. ...|$|E

These unique features result in a system behavior that is quite different than conventional <b>air-to-air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> The first part of this study considers the fluid selection, as choosing the best working fluid is critical for the overall performance and environmental safety of the system. This study then delves into the detailed performance analysis of the oil-free scroll compressors that are envisaged to be used in this system. Finally, the entire operating envelope of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system is considered, including failure cases as well as seasonal variations in the radiative environmental temperature...|$|R
40|$|Ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> (GSHP) {{systems are}} {{one of the fastest growing}} {{applications}} of renewable energy in the world with annual increases of 10 % over the past decade. GSHPs are potentially more efficient than conventional <b>air-to-air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> as they use the relatively constant temperature of the geothermal energy to provide heating or cooling to conditioned rooms at desired temperature and relative humidity. More importantly, GSHP systems can in fact achieve significant energy savings year round, compared to conventional HVAC systems. A hybrid ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> (HGSHP) system is designed in this study to heat and cool an office building all the year round. Dynamic models of each component of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system are developed for simulations of heat transfer between each component of the HGSHP system and for control strategy design and analysis. A detailed multiple-load aggregation algorithm (MLAA) is adapted from the literature to precisely account for and calculate the transient heat conduction in vertical ground heat exchangers with different yearly, monthly, and daily pulses of heat. Feedback PI controllers for <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> units and On/Off controllers for boiler and cooling tower are designed and utilized to match anticipated building loads and to analyze transient response characteristics of such outputs as water flow rate and air flow rate of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> return water temperature and supply air temperature of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> water temperatures of ground loops and heat exchangers, water temperature of boiler or cooling tower, and fuel flow rate of boiler. Control strategies for the HGSHP system in both heating and cooling modes of operation are also introduced to study the system responses. With the usage of On/Off controllers and well-tuned PI controllers, as well as optimal control strategies for heating and cooling operations, the HGSHP system is expected to give better operating performance and efficiency. As a result, noticeable energy savings can be achieved in both heating and cooling modes of operatio...|$|R
40|$|Europe has stablished {{the path}} towards nearly {{zero-energy}} buildings (nZEB), soon required in every new construction and large renovation in existing buildings. Regarding to this, the European energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD) proposes {{to search for}} cost-optimal building designs. The current study explores {{a great number of}} single-family house configurations, consisting on different energy-saving measures and energy-supply systems. In order to do this, a multi-stage methodology is used {{to reduce the number of}} needed simulations, performed by the Dynamic Building Energy Simulation model (DBES). The studied cases consist on single-family houses in Finland and Spain. Starting from reference buildings in these countries, different envelope parameters, heat recovery units, heating/cooling systems and renewable energy sources were considered. Results reveal cost-optimal solutions with primary energy consumption close to 125 kWh/m 2 a in Finland and 122 kWh/m 2 a in Spain. In order to achieve nZEB level, i. e., to reduce that consumption to 50 kWh/m 2 a, 20 m 2 of PV-panels are needed in Spain to generate electricity. However, this value rises to 50 m 2 in Finland. Global annual costs remain similar, or lower in the case of Spain, to those of the reference buildings. It has been proved that improving the insulation of the thermal envelope beyond current regulation requirements is not cost-efficient. Low installation-cost heating systems (e. g. <b>air-to-air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps)</b> are the base of cost-optimal solutions, under the financial parameters considered in this study. Although, more efficient systems (e. g. ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps)</b> could soon reach the cost-optimal solutions if their costs keep decreasing...|$|R
