25|$|The rudder is a spade type made of {{fiberglass}} with a brass rudder stock. The {{rudder port}} is a bronze tube with bushings top and bottom. Steering is by tiller. The tiller head is cast bronze and is held {{on with a}} pin. This pin passes horizontally through the head and stock. An <b>allen</b> <b>screw</b> locks into a key in the rudder stock. The tiller is straight grained ash. The rudder can be rotated a full 360 degrees if needed.|$|E
5000|$|The G&L Saddle-Lock bridge {{utilizes}} a small <b>Allen</b> <b>screw</b> on {{the side}} of the bridge, to reduce side-to-side movement of the individual string saddles. The design, and the bridge's beefy dimensions, aim to prevent loss of sustain due to this sideways motion by locking the saddles together.|$|E
5000|$|Military Reisings {{are usually}} parkerized. They often have an {{adjustable}} front sight with an <b>Allen</b> <b>screw</b> and a rear sight with a retaining screw. They routinely have 14 fins on the barrel, a two piece magazine release, outward flanges on the safety/selector switch, sling swivels, stock ties (crossbolts through the forearm), and a knurled take-down screw. Finally, the military model commonly has a three-hole trigger guard, proofmarks like [...] "PH" [...] or [...] "Pm2" [...] above the chamber, and serial numbers ranging from 20,000 to 120,000.|$|E

50|$|Subaru still {{offers a}} choice between front- and {{all-wheel-drive}} for its domestic market vehicles. The MOMO black leather steering wheel installed on the GT and RS model designations continued, but the style changed from a four spoke design to a three spoke. The previous steering wheel was affixed with six <b>allen</b> head <b>screws</b> to an adapter hub that incorporated the cruise control activation switch which was replaced with an integrated hub inside the three spoke steering wheel and is not compatible with the BC-BJ-BF series first generation Legacy cruise control arrangement.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the recent R 12 industrial robot commissioned at Robotics Laboratory of Mechanical Engg. Dept, JNEC, Aurangabad. Paper introduces the overview, functions and industrial applications {{of this type}} of robot. The R 12 articulated robot motion resembles human arm with 5 degrees of freedom having 5 joints. This robot operates with point to point motion and continuous motion. The R 12 Robot can carry a maximum effective payload of 1 kg at the centre of gravity of the end effectors. There are five major components namely base, shoulder, elbow, hand and end effectors (mechanical/suction grippers). Hand has flange coupling to accommodate gripper for holding the object. The object gripping is enabled with the help of various types of "end effectors " which are designed for different types of object. Various types of end effectors can be designed and attached to the flange coupling using set of <b>Allen</b> <b>screws</b> for R- 12 robot. The laboratory is equipped with two numbers of pneumatically operated end effectors namely, two finger/mechanical claw and vacuum suction gripper. The compressed air creates vacuum in the suction gripper. There R-series robot has industrial applications such as Pick & Place, Welding, Spray Painting, Inspection of precision screws, Sorting of components etc. The robot designed to sustain the shop floor environment. The R 12 robot can be integrated with “Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) ” in advanced industrial applications with visual sensor...|$|R
50|$|The Puffin Foundation, {{with more}} than $14 million in assets split between two {{independent}} entities, was seeded with the fortune Perry Rosenstein made in the <b>Allen</b> <b>screw</b> business. He got into the fasteners industry as a salesman. As he made the rounds on his accounts, he found several buyers who wanted diversity in Allen screws. He saw {{an opening in the}} market and began making screws in Japan. As an outsider in the industry, he faced stiff competition in the business. That experience has partly informed his interests in providing grants to artists and thinkers who do not usually secure grant money from more traditional foundations. He says he wants to make the fight a fair one.|$|E
50|$|The Honda MR50 Elsinore is an {{off-road}} mini cycle made by Honda. It was {{manufactured in}} Japan by Honda and imported first to Australia and the United States in 1974 {{and continued to}} {{be available in the}} USA, Canada and Australia until production was discontinued in 1975. It was patterned after the CR125 and CR250 Elsinores. Sometimes referred to as the Baby Elsinore, like its big brothers it had spoke wheels, knobby tires, and plastic fenders. The engine was a , air-cooled, two-stroke with 3 speed manual clutch transmission. Starting was primary kick with the starter {{on the right side of}} the bike. The bike used conventional controls just like larger models. The shift pattern was neutral at the bottom and 3 up. Lubrication was premix at 25:1. The exhaust had a spark arrestor. The ignition used points. Parents could limit the speed the rider could go by placing an <b>allen</b> <b>screw</b> in 1 of 4 throttle stops on the throttle.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the best manufacturing technology for fasteners {{was the subject of}} this work. Physical and numerical simulations were used to evaluate various technological variants. Possibility of application of new generation bainitic steels was considered, as well. Improvement of exploitation properties was the objective of the optimization having in mind tool wear and manufacturing costs as constraints. Several fasteners were investigated but results for three parts, including <b>Allen</b> <b>screw,</b> screw anchors used to carry concrete plates are presented as a case study. Industrial trials were performed and confirmed correctness of the designed manufacturing technology...|$|E
50|$|Initial {{problems}} with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the locking lug. This mechanism consisted of an <b>Allen</b> key <b>screw</b> that passed through the locking lug bearing against the right rear receiver wall. This headspace screw was locked in place, after adjustment, by a brass pin that bore against headspace screws' threads. the brass pin was not threaded but {{held in place by}} a lead plug. The lead plug shows a small eagle that was pressed into the plug by the special tool used by the armourer. If the eagle was disturbed the armourer would know that an attempt had been made to change the headspace by unauthorised personnel.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA bone mucormycosis {{outbreak}} in a clinic of Paraná city after arthroscopic knee {{anterior cruciate ligament}} reconstruction forced to suspend these interventions. The main candidates as the infection source were the implanted screws. These screws were metallurgically analyzed. Microscopic defects like burrs and bending's were found within the <b>screw's</b> <b>Allen</b> heads. According to previous report Spector et al. (2013), these defects protect microorganisms and make difficult to eliminate them. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the implication of metal working defects in the titanium fixing screws as a reservoir of contaminated machining oil which could be the possible transmitting vehicle in the outbreak of bone mucormycosis. The genetic relatedness of the isolated strains was established, favoring the hypothesis that contaminated screws might be the infection sources...|$|R
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex socket drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the <b>Allen</b> safety set <b>screw</b> product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the hex socket head, beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|R
50|$|The European, British and Australian {{versions}} {{were offered}} with three trim levels; the upscale GX, the more affordable LX in Australia called the GL in Europe and the UK, {{and the very}} basic DL in parts of Europe, with AWD offered as an option on the GX, LX and GL. In Europe and the UK, the GL and DL came with the 1.8-liter engine and the GX came with the larger 2.2-liter engine. For model year 1990, the British-spec. 1.8 GL was equipped with a carburetor and rear drum brakes but were later upgraded to single point fuel injection for model year 1991. The DL wasn't available in the UK or Australia. The British were also given a choice of vehicles equipped with a Catalytic Converter that restricted fuel usage to unleaded fuel only. The Australians could choose between the SOHC 2.2-liter no turbo on the GX and LX or the DOHC 2.0-liter with a turbo on the RS. In 1992, the Australians were offered the Liberty RS turbo as a sedan or extended roof wagon with a manual transmission only. When the Japanese-spec turbo was offered in Europe and Australia, the black leather covered MOMO steering wheel was also offered. The steering wheel was affixed with six <b>allen</b> head <b>screws</b> to an adapter hub that incorporated the cruise control activation switch, if cruise control was installed. This arrangement allowed the exchange of other aftermarket steering wheels using a six screw installation pattern to suit personal tastes. The black leather steering wheel accompanied matching black leather on the gearshift, center armrest cover, and parking brake handle. The main difference from the Japanese market MOMO steering wheel and the European and Australian version was the Japanese version was four spoke.|$|R
50|$|At the Legacy's introduction, the {{top level}} VZ sedan {{interior}} was originally available in blue, gray or a special color combination of pearl white exterior paint with dark red upholstery and brown interior plastic, with the other sedans and wagons offering interior color choices of blue or gray. The VZ wagon that was painted black came with light gray two-tone paint scheme on {{the lower half of}} the vehicle, and both front and rear bumper covers below the bumper rub strip, which was later used when the Outback was introduced with the Second Generation. Blue interior was offered on vehicles with blue exterior paint only. When model year 1990 arrived, however, the interior color choices were reduced to gray for the entire product line, with various types of upholstery selections, including a choice of velour, moquette, or tricot cloth upholstery based on the trim level. Leather was optional on the GT sedan and wagon only. A four spoke, black leather covered MOMO steering wheel also came with the Japanese-spec GT sedan/wagon and the RS sedan, and was affixed with six <b>allen</b> head <b>screws</b> to an adapter hub that incorporated the cruise control activation switch. This arrangement allowed the exchange of other aftermarket steering wheels using a six screw installation pattern to suit personal tastes. The black leather steering wheel accompanied matching black leather on the gearshift, center armrest cover, and parking brake handle. The upper half of the dashboard on the 1990 RS was available with an optional blue color, with the rest of the dashboard and interior in gray only. The RS and RS type R interior color was black with black cloth upholstery with matching door panels and extended side bolsters on the front seats, covered in an upholstery pattern insert unique to the RS and RS type R. Japanese models have been known to be exported to countries with right-hand driving requirements, such as the UK, India, Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
