40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} magnetic fields in models of radiative, Herbig-Haro (HH) jets {{have been studied}} {{in a number of}} papers. For example, magnetized, radiative jets from variable sources have been studied with axisymmetric and 3 D numerical simulations. In this paper, we present an analytic model describing the effect of a toroidal magnetic field on the internal working surfaces that result from a variability in the ejection velocity. We find that for parameters appropriate for HH jets the forces associated with the magnetic field dominate over the gas pressure force within the working surfaces. Depending on the ram pressure radial cross section of the jet, the magnetic field can produce a strong <b>axial</b> <b>pinch,</b> or, alternatively, a broadening of the internal working surfaces. We check the validity of the analytic model with axisymmetric numerical simulations of variable, magnetized jets. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures. ApJ in pres...|$|E
40|$|The {{mixing of}} a passive scalar like lithium, {{beryllium}} or temperature fluctuations {{due to the}} magnetic Tayler instability of a rotating <b>axial</b> <b>pinch</b> is considered. Our study is carried out within a Taylor-Couette setup for two rotation laws: quasi-Kepler and solid-body rotation. The minimum magnetic Prandtl number used is 0. 05 while the molecular Schmidt number Sc of the fluid varies between 0. 1 and 2. An effective diffusivity coefficient for the mixing is numerically measured by the decay process of a global concentration peak located between the cylinder walls. We find that only models with Sc> 0. 1 do provide finite eddy diffusivity values. We also find that for quasi-Kepler rotation at a magnetic Mach number Mm~ 2 the flow transits from the slow-rotation regime to the fast-rotation regime. For fixed Reynolds number {{the relation between the}} normalized eddy diffusivity and the Schmidt number of the fluid is always linear so that also a linear relation between the instability-induced diffusivity and the molecular viscosity results just in the sense proposed by Schatzman (1977). The numerical value of the coefficient in this relation will reach a maximum at Mm~ 2 and will decrease for Mm>> 1 implying that only toroidal magnetic fields of order kG can exist in the solar tachocline.

40|$|In {{magnetohydrodynamic}} {{problems in}} which there are boundaries in the axial or azimuthal symmetry directions, the energy principle involves multiple nonorthogonal trial perturbations. The subsequent Euler-Lagrange coupling of these allowed excitations necessitates a generalization of the Newcomb necessary-and-sufficient stability criterion. This extension, in which the absence of a conjugate point (instead of a simple zero) provides stability, is described in this paper. An important aspect of the proof involves the treatment of certain asymmetries which arise {{in the presence of the}} anisotropy caused by the magnetic field. The general method described here has applications to finite-length <b>axial</b> laboratory <b>pinches</b> and to astrophysical plasmas with rooted magnetic fields...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of mostly experimental work studying the early-time behavior of thin foil liners as compared to wire-array Z-pinches. It involves three studies, covering initiation, ablation and precursor formation, and instability analysis. Initiation was studied by observing the optical emission of various thick-ness (0. 6 - 23. 5 µm Cu) liners using a streak camera. It was found that thinner liners initiated sooner, more quickly, and more uniformly than thicker liners. This correlated well with both an increase in instantaneous dJ/dt at the time of first emission as well as the inductive voltage at the time of first emission. The threshold for uniform initiation was dJ/dt> 3. 5 × 1016 Acm− 2 s− 1. Uniform ini-tiation is important for liners because nonuniformities could lead to enhanced instabilities and poor liner performance (compression, x-ray production, etc.). Ablation and precursor formation of wire-arrays (16 x 75 µm Cu) and liners (6 µm Cu) were studied using r-θ density maps and radial mass profiles created by an <b>axial</b> X <b>pinch</b> radiography diagnostic. These images show very strong dif...|$|R

Copyright Springer [Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]We report on early results of submillimetre polarimetric measurements towards a sample of young stellar objects. The results allow us to infer the magnetic field structure and show a variety of configurations, providing evidence for <b>axial,</b> helical and <b>pinched</b> (i. e. ???hourglass???) magnetic field configurations.

In MSW 2 without no <b>axial</b> compression load, <b>pinching</b> and shear-slip deformation were significant in the cyclic response. On the other hand, in MSW 3 subjected to axial compression load [...] N = 0.07 A_g f_c^', the pinching and shear-slip deformation were decreased as the axial compression load restrained inclined diagonal cracking in the web. As shown in Fig.  6 c, the proposed method predicted the shear responses of MSW 2 and MSW 3 with reasonable precision. Ultimately, strength degradation due to softening of the unconfined cover concrete occurred in MSW 2 (see dashed line in Fig.  6 c). However, the proposed method did not properly capture such strength degradation (see solid line in Fig.  6 c). In MSW 3 subjected to [...] N = 0.07 A_g f_c^', the load-carrying capacity was decreased due to the second-order effect and softening of the unconfined cover concrete. The analysis results correlated well with the test results. Web concrete crushing didn’t occur in both specimens. Neither the test nor the proposed method predicted the web concrete crushing failure of MSW 2 and MSW 3.|$|R
40|$|An {{upgrade to}} the ATLAS silicon tracker cooling control system {{may require a}} change from C 3 F 8 (octafluoro-propane) {{evaporative}} coolant to a blend containing 10 - 25 % of C 2 F 6 (hexafluoro-ethane). Such a change will reduce the evaporation temperature to assure thermal stability following radiation damage accumulated at full LHC luminosity. Central to this upgrade is a new ultrasonic instrument in which sound transit times are continuously measured in opposite directions in flowing gas at known temperature and pressure to deduce the C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 flow rate and mixture composition. The instrument and its Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software are described in this paper. Several geometries for the instrument are in use or under evaluation. An instrument with a <b>pinched</b> <b>axial</b> geometry intended for analysis and measurement of moderate flow rates has demonstrated a mixture resolution of 3. 10 - 3 for C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 molar mixtures with 20 %C 2 F 6, and a flow resolution of 2 % of full scale for mass flows up to 30 gs- 1. In mixtures of widely-differing molecular weight (mw), higher mixture precision is possible: a sensitivity of < 5. 10 - 5 to leaks of C 3 F 8 into part of the ATLAS tracker nitrogen envelope (mw difference 160) has been seen. An instrument with an angled sound path geometry has been developed for use at high fluorocarbon mass flow rates of around 1. 2 kgs- 1 - corresponding to full flow in a new 60 kW thermosiphon recirculator under construction for the ATLAS silicon tracker. Extensive computational fluid dynamics studies were performed to determine the preferred geometry (ultrasonic transducer spacing and placement, together with the sound crossing angle {{with respect to the}} vapour flow direction). A prototype with 45 deg crossing angle has demonstrated a flow resolution of 1. 9 % of full scale for linear flow velocities up to 15 ms- 1. The instrument has many potential applications.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of mostly experimental work studying the early-time behavior of thin foil liners as compared to wire-array Z-pinches. It involves three studies, covering initiation, ablation and precursor formation, and instability analysis. Initiation was studied by observing the optical emission of various thickness (0. 6 - 23. 5 [MICRO SIGN]m Cu) liners using a streak camera. It was found that thinner liners initiated sooner, more quickly, and more uniformly than thicker liners. This correlated well with both an increase in instantaneous dJ/dt at the time of first emission as well as the inductive voltage at the time of first emission. The threshold for uniform initiation was dJ/dt> 3. 5 x 1016 Acm[-] 2 s[-] 1. Uniform initiation is important for liners because nonuniformities could lead to enhanced instabilities and poor liner performance (compression, x-ray production, etc.). Ablation and precursor formation of wire-arrays (16 x 75 [MICRO SIGN]m Cu) and liners (6 [MICRO SIGN]m Cu) were studied using r-[theta] density maps and radial mass profiles created by an <b>axial</b> X <b>pinch</b> radiography diagnostic. These images show very strong differences in this stage of the Z-pinch. Wire-arrays develop complex, azimuthally varying ablation structures that lead to dense precursors. Liners, however, show significantly reduced and azimuthally uniform ablation leading to an order of magnitude less dense precursor on axis. This is likely due to the discrete versus continuous nature of wire-arrays versus liners. With wire-arrays, plasma that is created {{on the outside of the}} wires can reach the array axis by being swept through the gaps between the stationary wire cores. In contrast, liners have no "gaps" for plasma to flow through. Therefore, any plasma that is created on the outside of the liner is trapped there until the bulk of the liner moves with the implosion. Consequently, only the plasma that is created on the inside of the liner is able to contribute to precursor formation. This is an important result because reduced precursor formation is important for fuel compression and heating in MagLIF. Less precursor can also lead to enhanced x-ray production because there is less mass on axis to cushion the conversion of kinetic energy into x-rays during the implosion and stagnation phases. Finally, in the instability studies, it was observed in laser shadowgraph images that liners develop a much larger amplitude instability on their outside surface as compared to wire-arrays. This is an important discovery and could be detrimental to liner performance (compression, x-ray production, etc.) because it could lead to enhanced magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability during the implosion phase. The reason for the larger instability in liners is again probably due to the fact that plasma builds up on the outside of the liners with no where to go. A possible source of the enhanced instability was found using 2 D (xy) PERSEUS simulations comparing the results of MHD and Hall MHD simulations. The instability only developed in the Hall MHD case. The 2 D nature of the simulation, along with all simulation parameters being equal between the two cases, rules out the possibility of MRT or m= 0 for the cause of the instability (in the simulation). It was found that the Hall term was responsible for causing a shear-flow instability that developed later in time to resemble the experimental results...|$|R
