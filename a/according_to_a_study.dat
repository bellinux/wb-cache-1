By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued.

5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC.

5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several countries along its path, Waka left {{the most significant}} losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, {{and much of the}} nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185km/h (115mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population {{due to the lack of}} fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33years.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E

The club had 3,202 fanclubs with total 231,197 members in 2012, {{making it the}} club with {{the largest number of}} organised supporters in Germany. Owing partly to the club having supporters all over the country, all of Bayern's away games have been sold out in recent years. Their following is mainly recruited from the aspiring middle class and regional Bavaria. Despite a large proportion of their supporters having to travel more than 200km (ca. 120 miles) regularly, the club's home matches in the Allianz Arena have almost always been sold out. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> by Sport+Markt Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, and the most popular football club in Germany with 10 million supporters.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>study,</b> it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Myotis alcathoe is a {{rare species}} with narrow {{ecological}} requirements. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> in the Czech Republic, the diet of Myotis alcathoe mostly consists of nematoceran flies, but caddisflies, spiders, small lepidopterans, and neuropterans are also taken. The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water, and is often found in dense vegetation. The parasitic mite Spinturnix mystacina has been found on M.alcathoe, and the mites on M.alcathoe, M.brandtii, and M.mystacinus are genetically closely related. The bat fly Basilia mongolensis nudior has been recorded on M.alcathoe in Thuringia and the tick Ixodes vespertilionis in Romania. When caught, individuals of M.alcathoe are much calmer than M.mystacinus or M.brandtii.|$|E
