5|$|In the {{two months}} <b>after</b> <b>Katrina</b> struck south Florida, Hurricane Rita brushed the region in late September with {{tropical}} storm-force winds and flooding rains. In late October, Hurricane Wilma struck southwestern Florida as a major hurricane, affecting the Miami area with hurricane-force winds that left 98% of south Florida without power. Including Hurricane Dennis in July, FEMA provided $1billion in public assistance to Florida residents {{in association with the}} four hurricanes in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman <b>after</b> <b>Katrina</b> to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

5|$|On August28, {{or about}} three days <b>after</b> <b>Katrina</b> struck the state, President George W. Bush {{declared}} a disaster area for Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which allocated federal funding for debris removal and other emergency services. Three days later, Monroe County was also declared a disaster areas, and {{on the same day}} the three counties were designated to receive funding for public assistance; this included aid to repair roads and bridges, water control facilities, public buildings, and recreation areas. The declaration was determined after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20State Emergency Response Teams {{to determine the extent of}} damage. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, President Bush declared a disaster area for seven counties along the Florida panhandle on September6; the counties were Bay, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton. In addition, Collier County in southwestern Florida was added to the list of disaster areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{credibility}} of the IPET was also challenged in a 42-page letter to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) submitted by Dr. Ray M. Seed, co-chair of the ILIT study. Dr. Seed described an early intentional plan by the Corps of Engineers to hide their mistakes in the New Orleans flooding <b>after</b> <b>Katrina</b> and to intimidate anyone who tried to intervene. All of this {{was done with the}} help and the complicity of some at the ASCE, according to Dr. Seed.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hurricane Katrina, LSU accepted an additional 2,300 displaced students from the greater New Orleans area, such as Tulane University, Loyola University New Orleans, Xavier University of Louisiana, and University of New Orleans. In addition to accepting displaced students, university officials also took on the challenge of housing and managing many hurricane victims, converting the Pete Maravich Assembly Center into a fully functional field hospital. Around 3,000 LSU students volunteered during the months <b>after</b> <b>Katrina,</b> assisting with the administration of medical treatment to some 5,000 evacuees and screening another 45,000 for various diseases.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>Katrina</b> {{the small}} Brazilian-American {{population}} expanded. Portuguese speakers were {{the second most}} numerous group to take English {{as a second language}} classes in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, after Spanish speakers. Many Brazilians worked in skilled trades such as tile and flooring, although fewer worked as day laborers than did Latinos. Many had moved from Brazilian communities in the Northeastern United States, Florida and Georgia. Brazilians settled throughout the metropolitan area. Most were undocumented. In January 2008 the New Orleans Brazilian population had a mid-range estimate of 3,000. By 2008 Brazilians had opened many small churches, shops and restaurants catering to their community.|$|E
25|$|When Emily reached Category5 {{intensity}} on July 16, {{it became}} the earliest Category5 hurricane ever, shattering the record set by Hurricane Allen in the 1980 season. When Katrina reached Category5 intensity on August 28, it became only {{the third time in}} recorded history (and {{the first time since the}} 1961 season) that there had been two Category5 hurricanes in a single season. When Rita reached Category5 intensity on September 21, 25days <b>after</b> <b>Katrina,</b> the 2005 season became the first that had three Category5 storms. When Wilma became a Category5 storm on October 19, the 2005 season doubled the record set by the 1960 and 1961 seasons, becoming the first that had four Category5 storms.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{with the}} {{approach}} of Hurricane Katrina, storm surge funneled by {{the confluence of the}} GIWW's and MRGO's levees created multiple breaches in the canal's concrete floodwalls, including the spectacular failure of a quarter-mile length on the Lower 9th Ward side, resulting in catastrophic flooding. On the Upper 9th Ward side, the canal poured through a breach near Florida Avenue. On the opposite side, there were two breaches between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. A large barge, the ING 4727, floated through the breach closer to the river and was deposited in the Lower 9th Ward. The barge itself may have caused {{one or more of the}} breaches; this possibility is under investigation. The canal lock was functioning two days <b>after</b> <b>Katrina</b> hit, at first mostly for barges bringing in fill to repair the breaches. A month later Hurricane Rita reflooded recently drained areas along the canal by topping emergency fill at the breach sites.|$|E

500|$|Additional acts {{of unrest}} {{occurred}} following the storm, {{particularly with the}} New Orleans Police Department. In the aftermath, a tourist asked a police officer for assistance, and got the response, [...] "Go to hell, it's every man for himself." [...] Also, one-third of New Orleans police officers deserted {{the city in the}} days before the storm, many of them escaping in their department-owned patrol cars. This added to the chaos by stretching law enforcement thin. Additionally, several NOPD officers were arrested weeks <b>after</b> <b>Katrina</b> for suspicion of vehicle theft.|$|E

2500|$|Other factors {{cited by}} some were the fond memory of Nagin's famous [...] "get off your asses" [...] radio {{interview}} during the worst days <b>after</b> <b>Katrina,</b> and what some saw as Landrieu's cautiously dispassionate campaigning style which some found uninspiring.
