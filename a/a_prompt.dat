5|$|Rupert's {{reputation}} {{never truly}} recovered, and in subsequent sieges and attacks he was frequently accused of acting without restraint. Birmingham, a key arms producing town, {{was taken in}} April 1643, and Rupert faced allegations—probably untrue—of wilfully burning the town to the ground (see the battle of Camp Hill). Shortly afterwards Rupert attempted to take the town of Lichfield, whose garrison had executed Royalist prisoners, angrily promising to kill all the soldiers inside. Only the urgent call for assistance from the King prevented him from doing so, forcing him to agree to more lenient terms in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>prompt</b> surrender. Towards {{the end of the}} war, practices were changing for the worse across all sides; a rebellious Leicester was retaken by the Prince in May 1645, and no attempt was made to limit the subsequent killing and plunder.|$|E
5|$|Lafontaine had hesitated {{over the}} 24 hours since the {{afternoon}} of 13 May. He spent hours reconnoitring the terrain, sometimes trying to contain and reason with fleeing, routing scores of French infantrymen and artillerymen of the 55th and 71st Infantry Divisions, and travelling around the area to various regimental headquarters, looking for his Corps commander, General Gransard (whom was deliberately reconnoitring the terrain, for some time, at that relative point in time), for an order to attack, and, in the meantime, extemporarily assessing and conferring with some local command personnel. Owing to this Lafontaine also delayed issuing orders to the tactical attack units until 05:00 on 14 May, by which time the Germans had consolidated their bridgehead and the Panzer divisions' combined arms infantry teams were already advancing inland to Bulson. Lafontaine had had a mission plan since 20:00 on 13 May to defeat the Germans and retake the Meuse bridgeheads, but he waited for an order to proceed. Lafontaine's need for an order was contrary to the unit actions of the Germans, who operated the tactically more efficient Auftragstaktik (Mission Command) system. Ultimately, Lafontaine had squandered valuable hours essential for <b>a</b> <b>prompt,</b> perhaps opportune and timely, perhaps potentially decisive counter-attack effort.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} of the meic Somairle to establish the Benedictines on Iona completely contrasted the ecclesiastical actions of Somairle himself, and provoked <b>a</b> <b>prompt</b> and violent response from Colum Cille's familia. According to the Annals of Ulster, after Cellach, Abbot of Iona built the new monastery in 1204, a large force of Irishmen, led by the Bishops of Tyrone and Tirconell and the Abbots of Derry and Inishowen, made landfall on Iona and burnt the new buildings to the ground. The sentiments of the familia may well be preserved in a contemporary poem which portrays Colum Cille lamenting the violation of his rights, and cursing the meic Somairle. Unfortunately for the familia, the Benedictine presence on Iona was there to stay, and the old monastery of Colum Cille was nearly obliterated by the new monastery. Somairle's attempt to revive Iona brought him into conflict with secular and ecclesiastical power in northern Ireland. If Ragnall was indeed responsible for {{the foundation of the}} Benedictine monastery about four decades afterwards, it may indicate that he was following in his father's footsteps, and asserting himself as a king in the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Volition {{aimed for}} a quality release, {{and promised to}} deliver a product without major bugs. Minor bugs would be fixed in <b>a</b> <b>prompt</b> manner. The shipped game, however, had {{deficiencies}} admitted by the team, such as problems with the multiplayer code, and a few design issues. The game underwent four patches, which resolved most of the bugs, and improved the multiplayer performance. Complaints about an online mission giving unfair scores led to Volition removing the mission from scoring play. Another patch allowed EAX capability to be enabled for Creative Sound Blaster sound cards. Interplay played its part in drumming up the community's interest by holding contests, and expanding material for the FreeSpace universe. Meanwhile, Volition created official star maps, and released Vasudan voice clips and story development notes. Interplay hired science-fiction writers such as Fred Saberhagen, Simon Hawke, and Jeff Grubb to write weekly FreeSpace stories for two months. Preparing for Silent Threats release, Interplay held a contest from July 28 to August 25, 1998, in which the submitted fan-designed missions could win their authors prizes such as free copies of Silent Threat, FreeSpace apparel, and gaming hardware. Entries were judged by a panel from PC Gamer, and qualified entries constituted half of the missions in Silent Threat.|$|E

40|$|Personalized {{prompting}} {{research has}} shown the significant learning benefit of prompting. The current paper outlines and examines <b>a</b> personalized <b>prompting</b> approach aimed at eliminating performance differences {{on the basis of}} a number of learner characteristics (capturing learning strategies and traits). The learner characteristics of interest were the need for cognition, work effort, computer self-efficacy, the use of surface learning, and the learner’s confidence in their learning. The approach was tested in two e-modules, using similar assessment forms (experimental n = 413; control group n = 243). Several prompts which corresponded to the learner characteristics were implemented, including <b>an</b> explanation <b>prompt,</b> <b>a</b> motivation <b>prompt,</b> <b>a</b> strategy <b>prompt,</b> and <b>an</b> assessment <b>prompt.</b> All learning characteristics were significant correlates of at least one of the outcome measures (test performance, errors, and omissions). However, only the assessment prompt increased test performance. On this basis, and drawing upon the testing effect, this <b>prompt</b> may be <b>a</b> particularly promising option to increase performance in e-learning and similar personalized systems...|$|R

5000|$|The MTL {{prompting}} procedure (Cuvo, Leaf, & Borakove, 1978) removes prompts {{by moving}} through a hierarchy from most restrictive to less restrictive. The MTL prompting procedure {{begins with the}} most restrictive <b>prompt,</b> usually <b>a</b> physical <b>prompt.</b> After the learner has received reinforcement for completing the task with physical <b>prompts,</b> <b>a</b> less restrictive <b>prompt</b> is given (e.g., <b>a</b> partial physical <b>prompt),</b> and then <b>an</b> even less restrictive prompt (e.g., verbal <b>prompt).</b> Usually, <b>a</b> specific criterion is set for each prompt change (e.g., {{after three days of}} correct performance of the behavior with the use of <b>a</b> partial physical <b>prompt,</b> <b>a</b> verbal <b>prompt</b> will be used). If the individual fails to perform the behavior correctly with the less intrusive prompt, the instructor would return to <b>a</b> more intrusive <b>prompt</b> for <b>a</b> specified number of trials. Eventually, the discriminative stimulus for the behavior is the typically occurring stimulus (e.g., when lunch is finished, student independently goes to the sink to wash hands) or the direction (e.g., when teacher says [...] "Class, it is time to sit in your desks", the student sits in his desk).|$|R
