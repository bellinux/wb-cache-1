Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> spend time with.|$|E

The importance of the credibility of these members among their own religious groups and in the larger society was raised. There were also differing opinions as to whether non-religious persons should be made members of the PCRH. Another concern was that the composition of the PCRH should be a fair representation of all the major religions in Singapore. It was pointed out that the diversity within religions such as Christianity made it difficult for fair representation and might lead to the exclusion of smaller and independent religious bodies.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Alhambra telling us of her {{conception}} in ‘the town’s only cinema’.

Through each character we obtain {{a different view of}} how Amber came into their lives, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> believed her to be, when she arrived unannounced and uninvited at their Norfolk holiday home, claiming her car had broken down. Through “The Beginning”, we learn of Astrid’s obsession with video-taping her life, seemingly as proof it existed; of Magnus’ involvement in a school prank which resulted in the suicide of one of his classmates; of Michael’s affairs with his students (he is a university lecturer); and of Eve’s writer’s block.|$|E
500|$|The main {{supporting}} character of Phantom Blood, Zeppeli, was {{created as a}} [...] "silly teacher" [...] {{in the style of}} the martial art masters from Jackie Chan's films and The Karate Kid, with a charm in the contrast between how they appear <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are inside. Araki designed him with a mustache, drawing inspiration from the appearances of the painter Salvador Dalí and the Osomatsu-kun character Iyami; this was considered a gamble, as mustachioed characters in shōnen magazines were considered to appear old and untrusthworthy, potentially turning readers off. His name comes from the rock band Led Zeppelin, and was chosen to balance out the large amount of names in the series beginning with [...] "J"; the character Speedwagon was given his name for the same reason.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{were aware}} {{that they would be}} casting young actors with little experience in film and television. Hundreds were seen for the part of Merlin, with the part going to 22-year-old Colin Morgan, whom Murphy and Capps felt possessed a broad acting range with good comedic timing and wonder, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> felt would most importantly be likable to the audience. Bradley James was cast as Prince Arthur, whom the producers saw as a [...] "medieval Prince Harry". They felt that James' sense of comedy balanced the fact that the character was intended to first appear acting like an [...] "idiot". Murphy and Capps had previously worked with James on a pilot, and kept him in the [...] "back of [...] minds" [...] when casting Arthur. Katie McGrath and Angel Coulby, who play Morgana and Gwen respectively, also had little previous professional acting experience. Despite this, it was noted that all four young actors took to their jobs maturely and with energy.|$|E
500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} who deal with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not just watching people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds are very important to their characterizations <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are. I really am interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people from all these different backgrounds find their place in the FBI, an agency that has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} of the Saturn is mixed, but generally praises its game library. According to Greg Sewart of 1UP.com, [...] "the Saturn {{will go down}} in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time." [...] In 2009, IGN chose the Saturn to be their 18th best video game console of all time, praising its unique game library. According to the reviewers, [...] "While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo... Nights into Dreams, the Virtua Fighter and Panzer Dragoon series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite." [...] The staff of Edge noted [...] "hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like Burning Rangers, Guardian Heroes, Dragon Force and Panzer Dragoon Saga." [...] In 2015, The Guardians Keith Stuart declared [...] "the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran stated [...] "Even today, despite the widespread availability of sequels and re-releases on other formats, the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it." [...] IGN's Adam Redsell wrote [...] " [...] devil-may-care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras is something that we simply do not see outside of the indie scene today." [...] Necrosoft Games director Brandon Sheffield expounded that [...] "The Saturn was a landing point for games that were too 'adult' in content for other systems, as it was the only one that allowed an 18+ rating for content in Japan... some games, like Enemy Zero used it to take body horror to new levels, an important step toward the expansion of games <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> served." [...] Sewart praised the Saturn's first-party titles as [...] "Sega's shining moment as a game developer", with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports, but also commented on the many Japan-exclusive Saturn releases, which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market. IGN's Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library's lack of [...] "fresh ideas" [...] and [...] "precious few high-profile franchises", in contrast to what he described as Sega's more creative Dreamcast output.|$|E

2500|$|Legal {{incapacity}} is an invasive and sometimes, difficult legal procedure.

Most states' laws require that {{a minimum of two}} doctors or other health professionals, provide reports as evidence of such incompetence and the person must be represented by an attorney. [...] Only then can the individual's legal rights be removed and legal supervision by a guardian or conservator be initiated.

Enraged by their idiocy, Montag leaves momentarily and returns with a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely.

2500|$|The {{relationships}} adolescents {{have with}} their peers, family, {{and members of}} their social sphere {{play a vital role}} in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. [...] "The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons)." [...] This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.|$|E
