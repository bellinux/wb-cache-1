5|$|Canada's {{military}} involvement in Afghanistan began in 2002 with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries, which was tasked as a counterinsurgency effort {{in response to the}} September 11 attacks. ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the United Nations Security Council on 20 December 2001, to secure Kabul. The Canadian Liberal government at the time, under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, chose to have the Canadian Forces (CF) hand over its prisoners to the United States, who led the fight against al-Qaeda and other insurgents. After NATO took command of Afghanistan in 2003, <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> torture and prisoner abuse {{at the hands of the}} United States armed forces in Iraq came to the attention of the public, and Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else. Canada entered into an agreement with the Afghan government and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces, which comprised the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS).|$|E

25|$|The <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> {{prison in}} the town of <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> {{was one of the most}} notorious prisons in Iraq during the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent. The prison was located on 280 acres of land 32 kilometers west of Baghdad. After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it and turned it into a military prison. It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military. In March 2004, during the time that the U.S. military was using the <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> prison as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners.|$|E

25|$|The {{real problem}} is what this movie says about us. When those <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half of}} America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E
