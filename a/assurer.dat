40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a growing {{criticism}} on the internal audit profession for the failure to discharge their responsibility as independent <b>assurers</b> diligently. Amongst the root causes that contribute to the flaws in internal audit judgment is the objectivity issue. The dual roles of an internal auditor (providers of both assurance services within the organization and consultancy services to managers) expose them to the conditions that could threaten their objectivity. The criticality of objectivity concept in the auditing profession is predominantly explored {{in the context of an}} external auditor; nevertheless, limited in the context of internal auditor. This paper sought to identify the existence of objectivity threats in the Malaysian internal auditing environment. Data were collected based on the survey of 50 internal auditors working in Malaysian Public and Private Sectors. The survey findings indicated that all nine objectivity threats listed in the “International Standards for Professional Practices of Internal Auditing (IPPF) : Practice Guide on Independence and Objectivity” did exist in the Malaysian internal audit environment. The most prevalent objectivity threats included social pressure threat, personal relationship threat and familiarity threat. An internal auditor ranked social pressure threat, economic interest, and personal relationship as the top three threats that could threaten objectivity. The paper provided basic empirical evidence of a potentially serious risk of objectivity threats that may impair the Malaysian internal auditors’ objectivity, thus reducing their ability to make an objective judgment. These empirical evidences are important to create awareness to the individual internal auditors as well as their stakeholders on the condition that could impair the internal auditors’ objectivity. Individual internal auditors need to be able to manage the objectivity threats to provides confidence on their services as independent <b>assurers,</b> whereas stakeholders, especially the Management, could address such threats by implementing preventive measures to ensure that the purpose of having an internal auditor as the second line of defense is fully utilized...|$|R
40|$|Prof Marx {{discusses}} in {{his inaugural}} speech {{the mission of the}} chair of Insurance at the University of Pretoria. This chair was established in 1988. The chair was instituted on the one hand to train actuarial students up to a level where they would be eligible for the maximum number of exemptions from the professional actuarial examinations. On the other hand the chair accommodates students with above average aptitude in Mathematics who wish to follow a business career. For these students the BCom(Insurance) degree will serve as an excellent take-off for a career in Insurance. Prof Marx says the chair is not only involved with the training of students but is also available to advise all final year students and alumni of the University as well as the insurance public in general on insurance matters. Observing the insurance industry, prof Marx claims that {{were it not for the}} savings mobilised by the industry, the South African economy would have collapsed. However, he warns that exorbitant commission is paid to agents for investments placed with life <b>assurers</b> and that agents often neglect their duty to properly analyse and provide in their clients' life assurance needs. An assurance agent earns R 8 268 commission on a RI 00 000 investment while for example a stock broker would earn R 778 investing such an amount. He calls for it that commission on large investments with life <b>assurers</b> should be revealed so that the transaction can be open to free market forces. In his observations on employee benefits prof Marx urges that pension funds should calculate retirement benefits not only on cash salaries but also on fringe benefits. He also demands that actuaries should place greater emphasis on better provision for post retirement pension increases to compensate for inflation. He also stresses that there is insufficient provision for the increasing medical costs and cost of care for the aged. Employers should further consider the fairness of the rate of interest paid on past contributions of employees leaving service, says prof Marx. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{nowadays}} insurance, {{although still}} having its own essential purpose, {{has a lot}} of differences in comparison with the predecessors, which have been mostly determined by the change in technologies, insurer`s demands and assurer`s opportunities. Purposes {{of this article is to}} review and highlight such problems, typical of the insurance market, as asymmetric information, adverse selection, conditional commissions, development level of insurance market, the main measures, defining the state of insurance, significance of intermediators in the process of selling. One of the ways of problems solution is versions of insurance products, when there may be reached at least partial resolution of risk, by suggesting fewer compensations or incomplete repayments. Conditional commissions for independent intermediators may facilitate the entrance of new <b>assurers</b> into the market, because they create favourable impacts of incentive, which help to overcome unwillingness to collaborate with a new market participant because of non-existing work relationship. Moreover, the system of compensation, motivated both by a bonus and profitability, based on commissions, induce to transmit reliable information for an insurer about customers, otherwise it would have a negative impact on conditional commissions. Solvency II will have impact not only on <b>assurers,</b> but, on the whole economy of the country. One of the expected results is the increase of an insurer's protection and improvement at understanding of insurance services. This would reduce problems of asymmetric information, because an insurer would not only dispose of the bigger information amount, but would also be more induced to reveal information for insurers, which is essential in order to offer an appropriate insurance policy, after a better perception of insurance particularity. Tasks of the research – to establish features of insurance market of the current period; to provide prognosis of its development; to anticipate application opportunities of a theoretical research model. There will also be an attempt to discuss not only specific, but also other phenomena, typical of other markets, such as competition or concentration. Methods of the research: after foreign scientific literature has been analysed, there are provided theoretical aspects of insurance market development and a represented-representative theory model in insurance, on the basis of which the research has been done and the current situation of insurance market has been evaluated...|$|R

To {{enhance the quality of}} corporate environmental disclosures in a largely voluntary context, various stakeholders are also demanding independent assurance. This study uses a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to examine whether the quality of voluntary environmental disclosures is enhanced when assured. This study also examines the difference in the quality of voluntary environmental disclosures when assurance is provided by either professional accountant <b>assurers</b> or private consultants. Our sample comprises listed companies voluntarily disclosing environmental information in stand-alone reports, annual reports, and websites. We use an index based upon the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to measure the quality of company environmental reporting. Results of this matched pairs study show that the quality of voluntary environmental disclosures scores significantly higher for assured companies than unassured companies. For assured companies, the quality is no different when assured by accountants or consultants.

40|$|Recent {{growth in}} {{sustainability}} reporting has {{been followed by}} growth in sustainability reporting assurance. Although sustainability reporting and its assurance are both still voluntary in many countries around the world, like New Zealand, several organisations have already disclosed sustainability reports publicly and also engaged in the assurance process. The aim of this research project is to explore {{the current state of}} sustainability reporting assurance in New Zealand listed companies. The intention is to discover the motivations for, and barriers to, assurance engagement; identify the preferred assurers; and introduce the influential factors for improving the quality of sustainability reporting assurance statements. Mono and multiple methods are implemented in this exploratory research. The research design is divided into four sequential phases. The first phase considers information about the current status of sustainability reporting assurance. The second phase analyses sustainability reporting assurance statements published by companies listed on NZX through content analysis. The last two phases investigate sustainability managers’ and sustainability assurers’ viewpoints about several aspects of sustainability reporting assurance through one-on-one online semi-structured interviews. Using agency theory, signalling theory and stakeholder theory, this research provides insights into motivations for, and barriers to, sustainability reporting assurance engagement from the perspectives of the sustainability <b>assurers</b> and two groups of sustainability reporting organisations – those that have not yet engaged, and those that have already engaged, in the assurance process. The results highlight the characteristics of the preferred sustainability <b>assurers.</b> This research also identifies that while the quality of sustainability reporting assurance statements is increasing, there is still considerable room for improvement. iv A number of potential limitations including subjectivity apply to this research which uses a qualitative approach on a small population of New Zealand listed companies. Despite these limitations, this research still provides some valid insights about sustainability reporting assurance in a voluntary environment. In particular, this research extends previous studies to add to sustainability reporting assurance knowledge by collating the results of several data gathering and data analysis techniques, which examine that area comprehensively. This research provides broader insights into the terms of sustainability reporting assurance since it considers all types of internal and external sustainability assurance as well as two groups of reporting organisations. The findings of this research will practically benefit organisations; sustainability assurers; New Zealand authorities, legislators and standard setters; and other stakeholders by introducing the characteristics of best practice for sustainability reporting assurance in a voluntary sustainability reporting and assurance environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examined}} whether selected South African {{mining companies}} obtain sustainability report assurance {{and whether the}} sustainability reports are internally or externally assured. The methodological approach {{is a combination of}} qualitative and quantitative analysis of assurance elements in sustainability reports. Findings indicate that a considerable number of mining companies are complying with the requirements of the King III assurance requirement; however, there is still room for improvement mostly in the external assurance requirement. The study finds that the lack of external assurance from some firms may stem from apparent optional nature of sustainability guidelines. Major finding from the t-test of difference in mean-assurance levels indicate that, whilst it is commendable that companies are responding to assurance requirement, however it took approximately four years for all the sampled companies to adjust toward a significant response to King III requirement for assurance of sustainability reports. Hence the paper recommends amongst others, that policy makers should allow ample time when initiating new sustainability guidelines and/or policies to enable firms to adjust. External assurance of sustainability reports should be made obligatory and that assurance work should be made to rest in the hands of qualified experts, such as the chartered accountants, to instil greater compliance and desired credibility in sustainability reports. It is also recommended that future studies may look into the extent of independence and objectivity of external <b>assurers</b> of sustainability in the mining firms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Within {{the context}} of an {{increasingly}} fragile life insurance industry, this paper conducts a quantitative investigation on the determinants of investment strategy within with profit life <b>assurers</b> in the UK, a dominant segment within the global industry. Examining a range of possible defining characteristics on investment strategy of such firms including size, financial strength (solvency), proprietary/mutual status, open/closed status and the level of guaranteed liabilities, the paper attempts to unravel the key influences on investment strategy as mapped out by an expanded set of investment risk indicators, such as the Equity Backing Ratio, Property Backing ratio, Non Approved Bonds Ratio and the Average Credit Rating of the bond portfolio. Having briefly collated the diverse academic literature on this subject, the paper uses a current dataset involving thirteen years worth of data from 1995 - 2007 sourced through SynThesys, in order to validate the research hypotheses. Splitting the analysis in two time intervals, one involving the full 13 year period and the other involving the years 2005 - 2007 post the new regulations, it finds that investment strategy is indeed significantly influenced by the defining characteristics of the firm albeit it in a complex way. While some relationships between these variables are straightforward, others present complex pictures requiring further explanation and research. In particular, the paper finds that larger, more solvent and open firms do tend to invest higher proportions in risky assets such as equity and property. It also contradicts to some degree, earlier findings that property and equities are viewed as competitive assets, finding instead that there are some complementarities between them...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The equator {{principles}} constitute an international voluntary code developed by banks to encourage consideration {{of environmental and}} social issues in project financing. Such codes can flexibly {{bridge the gap between}} individual companies' sustainability initiatives and mandatory, legal regulation. However, concerns continue to be expressed that the {{equator principles}} reporting of banks is not fully satisfactory, so the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate both the nature of the success and the shortcomings of equator principles reporting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on academic literature on motivations for corporate social responsibility and various publications by non-government organisations and professional accounting and legal organisations, together with analysis of the disclosures made by Barclays and HSBC. In addition, access was gained for semi-structured interviews with some senior executives/consultants. Findings – While the voluntary equator principles initiative has been remarkably successful in matching banks' strategic motivation, the environmental benefit may primarily be a by-product of the risk management processes of banks, consistent with enlightened shareholder theory. This does not mean the environmental benefits may not be real but, without more detailed project-level disclosure and a standardised performance evaluation system, it is difficult to measure the extent to which the equator principles have had a positive effect on the environment. Research limitations/implications – Further research is needed to gauge how the equator principles impact front-line decision making. There could usefully be further standardisation of equator principles reporting formats, with more detail about project-level implementation. With respect to reports of external <b>assurers,</b> it remains an open question as to whether these should be made compulsory, subject to further specification of the independence and competence standards. Originality/value – The study helps to illuminate the effectiveness of a voluntary code such as the equator principles in the social construction of how enlightened shareholder theory is to be interpreted and implemented. It makes an initial response to recent calls by Bebbington et al. and Adams for further empirical corporate social responsibility research and more direct engagement with organisations.
