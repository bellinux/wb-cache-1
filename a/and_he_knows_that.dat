500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> I {{have a sense of humor}} and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on?" [...] I'm like, [...] "It's a freakin' joke! It's 'Cribs'! Hello! It's a freakin' joke!" ...|$|E
500|$|Al-Mir's {{trial began}} before the Damascus First Criminal Court on August 29, 2007. His {{indictment}} stated he [...] "contacted {{enemies of the}} state in Lebanon including members of the March 14 group, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> the ideas and direction of this group are in accordance with the American and Zionist direction which are against the national approach of the Syrian government." [...] It accused al-Mir of conveying [...] "support for the approach and direction of March 14" [...] during the phone call. Al-Mir denied this, stating that he called Atallah only as head of the Democratic Left Movement. On November 8, the court adjourned his trial, postponing the verdict until November 28 {{as a result of the}} defense filing a petition to dismiss the judge in session.|$|E
60|$|Alice {{looked at}} him {{steadily}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> frankness was best.|$|R
60|$|He {{scarcely}} saw {{her face}} again. She pulled her veil down, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> silence was best.|$|R
60|$|Saxon {{reached out}} and touched his hand, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it was a hand that loved his hand.|$|R
2500|$|When David Cameron {{was asked}} in 2009 {{whether or not}} {{he would be willing to}} sack a close {{colleague}} such as Osborne, he stated, [...] "With George, the answer is yes. He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are godfathers to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> if that was not the case he would not be there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind,' said Charles, 'I'll {{take care}} {{the letter is}} moderate. Besides, it is only Philip, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> letter-writing is not his forte.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all play}} really; {{and he knows}} it--you can tell that from his voice. He can't help its not mattering, of course; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> too." ...|$|E
60|$|It was Edith now. She looked {{towards the}} corner where <b>he</b> was, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> face <b>and</b> manner very well.|$|R
60|$|Horace Sumner was {{a self-made}} man, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> self {{reliance}} {{is one of}} the best traits a boy can cultivate.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} time the music came very clearly to him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it was but the continual clashing of swords.|$|R
60|$|But {{just inside}} the theater, in the office, is {{a man in a}} circus {{waistcoat}} adding up dollars with a blue pencil, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> the play is all right.|$|E
6000|$|... “But how?” I asked, with a {{helpless}} shrug. “I dare not come {{within reach of}} his arms, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> so long as his resistance is passive I cannot shoot him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not from}} Lord Highgate, ma'am," [...] Sir Barnes said, gloomily. [...] "It is some time since I have known {{that he was not}} in earnest; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> I am now." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} Toby saw Mr. Lord enter the tent, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the summons to start {{was about to}} be given.|$|R
60|$|Gillespie <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{she meant}} Dylks <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> she {{kept out of}} her voice {{whatever}} feeling she had in delivering his message.|$|R
60|$|But the guardsman's quick ear {{had caught}} the sound of moving feet from within, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was master of the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{you know}} that he knows, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> I know, and we all know that each other knows, and why there should be any {{objection}} that every one should know is more than I can--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] Herr Freudenberg declared, [...] "bravery is {{a splendid}} gift, {{discretion}} a finer. Sir Julien knows who I am <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> I {{have yet to}} admit myself vanquished in any scheme in which I engage. He will use his judgment. Meanwhile, mademoiselle!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Redhand {{shook his}} head. [...] "The thief," [...] said he {{in a tone}} that was {{scarcely}} audible, [...] "has heard us; I see by his face that he suspects he has heard something, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> it was not the falling of a leaf. If we break a twig now we're done for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'An {{obviously}} trumped-up story. He {{had heard}} of Eustace's escape <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> any story connected with him would be a passport into the house.' ...|$|R
60|$|The burly man's face fell. He was Alexander Slocum's agent, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> to get tenants for {{the rooms}} Nellie Ardell {{occupied}} would be difficult.|$|R
50|$|Reason: She didn't {{feel the}} same way <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> she liked Dawson and Dawson liked her even though he was still hung up on Jen.|$|R
6000|$|Fitzpiers was {{not out of}} earshot, and {{his comment}} was, [...] "Sir Provost, well did I hear what the King said to thee; and since he is so set on my wealth, he will surely get it; but thou knowest; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows,</b> <b>that</b> I can raise such a storm as he will feel many a day after my death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I shall go," [...] Fowler Pratt {{had said}} to Montgomerie Dobbs. [...] "I always stick to a fellow if I can. Crosbie has behaved like a blackguard, and like a fool also; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> I think so. But I don't see why I should drop him on that account. I shall go as he has asked me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} as only natural," [...] Edgar replied, [...] "He has had a steer killed since the rustlers shot the bull; we have foiled {{one or two more}} {{attempts}} only by keeping a good lookout, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> he lies open to any new attack that may be made on him. His position isn't what you could call comfortable." ...|$|E
60|$|Larry blinked {{with the}} troubled, querulous {{eyes of a}} monkey. He was {{beginning}} to apprehend <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> not what, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> bending over him was a man-master.|$|R

6000|$|... "He gave Parker a five-pound note. Parker {{is only a}} {{grasping}} fool. He concocted {{the story}} of Mr. Dobson and the lease. He is always listening at key-holes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Dobson often sends up a clerk with papers for Uncle Rad's signature. Those things are not very difficult to manage. If one man is determined, and the other corruptible, it's done sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care a straw {{whether he}} be angry or not. He allows me eight hundred a year, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> if he stopped it I {{should go to}} the Jews the next day. I could not help myself. He can't leave an acre away from me, and yet he won't join me in raising money for the sake of paying Laura her fortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The way to {{make people}} want to be trusted is to trust them" [...] said he to himself. [...] "If I show Sammy Jay that I don't really trust him, he will think it is of no use to try and will give it up. But if I do trust him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> I do, he'll be the best {{watchman}} in the Green Forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|And it grew both day and night, [...] Till it bore {{an apple}} bright, [...] And my foe beheld it shine, [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it was mine,-- ...|$|R

60|$|This made Jimmy angrier than ever. He couldn't {{climb up}} there, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Unc' Billy <b>knew</b> it. Unc' Billy was {{perfectly}} safe in promising {{to wait for}} him.|$|R
