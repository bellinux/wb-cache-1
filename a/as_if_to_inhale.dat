60|$|It was, therefore, perhaps, {{with some}} {{mitigation}} of his usual critical severity {{that he saw}} her walking before him alone in the lane as he rode home to quarters. She was apparently lost in a half-impatient, half-moody reverie, which even the trotting hoof-beats {{of his own and}} his orderly's horse had not disturbed. From time to time she struck the myrtle hedge beside her with the head of a large flower which hung by its stalk from her listless hands, or held it to her face <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>inhale</b> its perfume. Dismissing his orderly by a side path, he rode gently forward, but, to his surprise, without turning, or seeming to be aware of his presence, she quickened her pace, and even appeared to look from side to side for some avenue of escape. If only to mend matters, he was obliged to ride quickly forward to her side, where he threw himself from his horse, flung the reins on his arm, and began to walk beside her. She at first turned a slightly flushed cheek away from him, and then looked up with a purely simulated start of surprise.|$|E

60|$|The old {{man turned}} around angrily; {{opened his mouth}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> speak, and then, repenting of his purpose, faced the on-coming {{officers}} once more, much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> say that such a question from such a questioner was not worthy of regard.|$|R

6000|$|... "I disgust {{you very}} much," [...] said Caspar Goodwood gloomily; not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> provoke her to {{compassion}} {{for a man}} conscious of this blighting fact, but <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> set it well before himself, {{so that he might}} endeavour to act with his eyes on it.|$|R
50|$|He smiled <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> {{acknowledge}} his acquiescence.|$|R

60|$|Without {{waiting for}} {{permission}} from her he quietly and deliberately placed {{his hat and}} cloak on a chair. Then he turned once more toward her, and made a movement <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> advance into the room; but instinctively she put up a hand <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> ward off the calamity of his approach.|$|R

60|$|At {{the instant}} {{something}} pulled the skirts of his cloak; and looking round, {{he saw the}} little spaniel, who immediately, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> plead his mistress's cause, got on his hind legs and began to dance, whimpering at the same time, and looking back <b>to</b> Louise, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> solicit compassion for his forsaken owner.|$|R

60|$|Then {{there was}} silence for a long moment. Wade stirred, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> look around. Belllounds also stirred, and gulped, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> breathe. The three {{prostrate}} rustlers lay inert, their positions singularly tragic and settled. The smoke again began to lift, to float {{out of the door}} and windows. In another moment the big room seemed less hazy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I can. God {{takes care}} of us,' said Johnnie, wistfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> striving <b>to</b> understand, <b>as</b> he felt the {{pressure}} redoubled on hand and head, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> burn in what was uttered with such difficulty and danger.|$|R
