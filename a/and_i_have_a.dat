He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer.

Then, she took the initiative to polish the song by sending a tape to Moody and Hodges, whom later worked with her and received co-writing credit of the song. Clarkson explained, [...] "Hearing the Evanescence album, you can obviously tell that David and Ben have a real passion for music and that big kind of background. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> big voice and I like the music to match it, so it was a real dream team." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Nintendo {{contacted}} Broken Rules {{and asked}} if a downloadable WiiWare version of And Yet It Moves could be developed for its Wii console after seeing {{a demonstration of the}} game at the 2008 IndieCade Festival in Los Angeles. Bohatsch stated that [...] "we didn't think long about this decision because we always wanted to bring And Yet It Moves to a console <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sweet spot for the Wii." [...] However, the PC game's projected release date was April 2, 2009; it was too late in development to begin co-developing for Wii and launch simultaneously on both platforms. PC version development was completed first and then Wii development started in June.|$|E
500|$|Straczynski {{surprised}} many when he publicly revealed: [...] "There's a {{lot that}} I don't agree with, and I made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel, especially Joe Quesada... {{there was a point}} where I made the decision, and told Joe, that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the OMD arc. Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E

500|$|The College Dropout diverged {{from the}} then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop {{in favor of}} more diverse, topical {{subjects}} for the lyrics. Throughout the album, West touches on a number of different issues drawn from his own experiences and observations, including organized religion, family, sexuality, excessive materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, and personal struggles. Music journalist Kelefa Sanneh wrote, [...] "Throughout the album, Mr. West taunts everyone who didn't believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap". West explained, [...] "My persona is that I'm the regular person. Just think about whatever you've been through in the past week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> song about that on my album." [...] The album was musically notable for West's unique development of his [...] "chipmunk soul" [...] production style, in which R and soul music samples were sped up and pitch shifted.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} could see his opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was so easy for him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{observers}} {{found the}} practice humorous. Luke Meredith, {{a writer for}} the Associated Press, wrote that it [...] "has already led to a few amusing moments where a coach, enraged with a call gone against his wrestler, had to reach for a tiny stuffed animal and fling it across the mat to get the referee's attention." [...] NBC Sports commentators for their Olympic coverage began referring to Vinicius as [...] "the challenge mascot." [...] Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website Thrillist, wrote that the mascot took [...] "a little of the anger out of a challenge." [...] Jason Bryant, the in-house commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was slightly surprised to see the practice at the Olympics, given the emphasis there on [...] "protocol", but he eventually commented that it does not matter what the challenge object is, particularly if it has cultural significance to the location of the competition. Coach Mike Maliconico argued that the practice does not belong at the Olympic Games, stating, [...] "The fate of one of my athletes who has been training for this specific moment for four years hangs in the balance of a referee's error. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> stuffed animal in my hands." ...|$|E

500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes Levin {{wrote about}} frivolous, even farcical matters, {{such as a}} series of mock-indignant {{articles}} about the sex-lives of mosquitoes. At other times he wrote about matters of grave moral importance, unfailingly denouncing authoritarian regimes whether of the left or the right. He observed, [...] "I am barred by the governments concerned from entering the Soviet Union and the lands of her empire {{on the one hand and}} South Africa on the other. These decrees constitute a pair of campaign medals that I wear with considerable pleasure <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> profound suspicion of those who rebuke me for partisanship while wearing only one". He wrote regularly about the arts. Music was a recurrent theme; he was notorious for his addiction to Wagner, and other favourite composers included Schubert and Mozart. He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. He turned less regularly to the visual arts, but when he did his views were clear-cut and trenchantly expressed. He wrote of a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in 1984, [...] "Never, in all my life, not even at the exclusively Millais exhibition in 1967, have I seen so much sickening rubbish in one place at one time". His knowledge and love of literature were reflected in many of his writings; among his best-known pieces is a long paragraph about the influence of Shakespeare on everyday discourse. It begins: ...|$|E
500|$|Greenwalt {{discusses}} how Cordelia [...] "is sort {{of forced}} {{to become a}} deeper character" [...] when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, [...] "She's sort of living with {{one foot in the}} world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> deeper purpose and mission.'" [...] Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a [...] "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, [...] "Parting Gifts", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating [...] "I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them." [...] Carpenter explains, [...] "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally {{inactive}} for the 2004–05 season, {{using the}} time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last [...] "a year-and-a-half [...] two years," [...] as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from 10 different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Four days later, he was officially introduced {{as a member of}} the Predators at a news conference. Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as [...] "unquestionably the biggest signing in [...] club's history." [...] He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier League-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized league rules, stating, [...] "As an offensive player, I'm going through the neutral zone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> player tugging me the whole way. If I don't go down, I'm not going to get a call because they are not going to make the call." [...] Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
