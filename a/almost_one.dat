5|$|Blackburn's {{primary focus}} was on reforms to the state's penal system. According to Blackburn, 953 prisoners were being held at the state penitentiary, {{although}} the structure only contained 780 cells. Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state's prisoners suffered from pneumonia in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the <b>almost</b> <b>one</b> thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta.|$|E

5|$|After the {{unification}} of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD, Gyeongju {{became the center of}} Korean political and cultural life. The city was home to the Silla court and the great majority of the kingdom's elite. Its prosperity became legendary, and was reported as far away as Persia according to the 9th century book The Book of Roads and Kingdoms. Records of Samguk Yusa give the city's population in its peak period as 178,936 households, suggesting that the total population was <b>almost</b> <b>one</b> million. Many of Gyeongju's most famous sites date from this Unified Silla period, which ended in the late 9th century by Goryeo (918–1392).|$|E

5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw <b>almost</b> <b>one</b> hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as <b>almost</b> <b>one</b> program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
5|$|The fusionism {{movement}} collapsed as the Colorados {{abandoned the}} coalition to join Flores' ranks. The Uruguayan Civil War quickly escalated, developing into {{a crisis of}} international scope that destabilized the entire region. Even before the Colorado rebellion, the Blancos within fusionism had sought an alliance with Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López. Berro's now purely Blanco government also received support from Argentine federalists, who opposed Mitre and his Unitarians. The situation deteriorated as the Empire of Brazil was drawn into the conflict. <b>Almost</b> <b>one</b> fifth of the Uruguayan population were considered Brazilian. Some joined Flores' rebellion, spurred by discontent with Blanco government policies that they regarded as harmful to their interests. Brazil eventually decided {{to intervene in the}} Uruguayan affair to reestablish the security of its southern frontiers and its regional ascendancy.|$|E

5|$|War {{memorials}} {{became a}} common sight in British towns and cities following the First World War (1914–1918). <b>Almost</b> <b>one</b> million men from Britain {{were killed in the}} conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in Spalding, a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for the commission and through his own practice. Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.|$|E
5|$|WrestleMania III is {{particularly}} notable for the WWF's claiming a record attendance of 93,173 {{and the largest}} recorded attendance of a live indoor event in North America at the time. This record itself stood until January 27, 1999 when it was surpassed by the Papal Mass presided over by Pope John Paul II, held at the TWA Dome in St. Louis, MO, which drew an audience of 104,000 people. The only WWF/E event with an official higher attendance was WrestleMania 32. Both of the latter events were held at AT Stadium. The event {{is considered to be}} the pinnacle of the 1980s wrestling boom. The WWF generated $1.6 million in ticket sales. <b>Almost</b> <b>one</b> million fans watched the event at 160 closed circuit locations in North America. The number of people watching via pay-per-view was estimated at several million, and pay-per-view revenues were estimated at $10.3 million, setting a record for the time.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2006 census, the country's largest {{self-reported}} {{ethnic origin}} is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%). There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing {{a total of}} 1,172,790 people. Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006. Another 16.2 {{percent of the population}} belonged to a non-indigenous visible minority. In 2006, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%). Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. By 2007, <b>almost</b> <b>one</b> in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East). The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According to Statistics Canada, visible minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.|$|E
40|$|Non-self-adjoint {{dynamical}} systems, e. g., nonholonomic systems, can admit {{an almost}} Poisson structure, which is formulated {{by a kind}} of Poisson bracket satisfying the usual properties except for the Jacobi identity. A general theory of the almost Poisson structure is investigated based on a decomposition of the bracket into a sum of a Poisson <b>one</b> and an <b>almost</b> Poisson <b>one.</b> The corresponding relation between Poisson structure and symplectic structure is proved, making use of Jacobiizer and symplecticizer. Based on analysis of pseudo-symplectic structure of constraint submanifold of Chaplygin nonholonomic systems, an almost Poisson bracket for the systems is constructed and decomposed into a sum of a canonical Poisson <b>one</b> and an <b>almost</b> Poisson <b>one.</b> Similarly, an <b>almost</b> Poisson structure, which can be decomposed into a sum of canonical <b>one</b> and an <b>almost</b> Lie-Poisson <b>one,</b> is also constructed on an affine space with torsion whose autoparallels are utilized to described the free motion of some non-self-adjoint systems. The decomposition of the almost Poisson bracket directly leads to a decomposition of a dynamical vector field into a sum of usual Hamiltionian vector field and an <b>almost</b> Hamiltonian <b>one,</b> which is useful to simplifying the integration of vector fields.
