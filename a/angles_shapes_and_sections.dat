Two types of rigid connections are considered. One is a conventional full-strength connection, {{and the other}} is a partial-strength connection using for example fiber reinforced mortar.

The method was proposed to fit time series by the first-order polynomial of Chebyshev and used TD method {{to measure the}} similarity simultaneously. A first order polynomial of Chebyshev is more suitable for one variable time series, but for multivariate time series, {{it is much more}} complex to fit. Moreover, since TD method selected different parameters, the accuracy rate is also quite different in their similarity. In view of this situation, we use a more simple method which combines PAA piecewise linear representation and fitting errors methods to extract pattern features (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation and Error, PAA_ERR), and then select the “tilt angle” and “shape feature value” of each segment which is produced by PAA_ERR method in a variable as the feature representation of the segment, finally, we propose a new similar measure method based on <b>shape</b> feature <b>and</b> inclination <b>angle</b> (<b>Shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>Angle</b> Dynamic Time Warping, SA_DTW) to measure the DTW distance between two time series to match their similarity.|$|R

40|$|For the {{successful}} {{performance of a}} granular filter medium, existing design guidelines, {{which are based on}} the particle size distribution (PSD) characteristics of the base soil and filter medium, require two contradictory conditions to be satisfied, viz., soil retention and permeability. In spite of the wider applicability of these guidelines, it is well recognized that (i) they are applicable to a particular range of soils tested in the laboratory, (ii) the design procedures do not include performance-based selection criteria, and (iii) there are no means to establish the sensitivity of the important variables influencing performance. In the present work, analytical solutions are developed to obtain a factor of safety with respect to soil-retention and permeability criteria for a base soil - filter medium system subjected to a soil boiling condition. The proposed analytical solutions take into consideration relevant geotechnical properties such as void ratio, permeability, dry unit weight, effective friction <b>angle,</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> size of soil particles, seepage discharge, and existing hydraulic gradient.
