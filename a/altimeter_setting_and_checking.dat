Error stems from physiological and psychological human limitations such as illness, medication, stress, alcohol/drug abuse, fatigue, emotion etc. Error is inevitable in humans and is primarily related to operational and behavioural mishaps. Errors can vary from incorrect <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> <b>and</b> deviations from flight course to more severe errors such as exceeding maximum structural speeds or forgetting to put down landing or takeoff flaps.|$|R

The landing took place with an {{instrument}} landing system (ILS) approach, with the autopilot coupler being used down to 100 to 60 meters (300–200ft) before a manual completion. The aircraft had three maintenance issues at Seattle, consisting of a non-functioning fast–slow airspeed function, low oil on the number one engine and a non-functioning lavatory light. The final crew arrived at Seattle–Tacoma {{an hour before the}} flight and was given necessary documentation. Flight time was estimated at two hours, 16 minutes. All preflight checks were concluded without discrepancies. The aircraft was de-iced <b>and</b> the <b>altimeters</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> cross-checked. The flight departed Seattle at 15:46 Pacific Standard Time (PST), one hour and eleven minutes after schedule. The first officer was designated as pilot flying. The altimeters were recalibrated and the autopilot was used for the climb and cruise.|$|R

In Study 1, a survey of individual investors, investment-related knowledge, psycho-social risks, and social needs emerge as antecedents that explain investors' susceptibility to informational and normative influence. In turn, susceptibility to normative influences increases transaction frequency, whereas susceptibility to informational influences decreases transaction frequency. The experiments in Studies 2 and 3 indicate the impact of interpersonal influences on consumers' investment decisions in a voluntary (free choice) <b>and</b> involuntary (confrontation) <b>setting</b> <b>and</b> <b>check</b> whether CSII moderates the impact of interpersonal influences.

Step-by-step decoding temporarily changes one information bit value {{at a time}} <b>and</b> then <b>checks</b> weather {{the weight of the}} error pattern decreases by computing the corresponding syndrome matrix determinant. Based on the channel information, this study propose a modified step-by-step decoding, which locates a test <b>set</b> <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> the weight of the error pattern in the decoding procedure. Rather than testing all information bits, the bit positions listed in the test set are examined in the proposed step-by-step decoding. The error performance of the proposed decoding is very close to that of the conventional step-by-step decoding with a low decoding complexity, as in simulations of a BPSK coherent system over AWGN channels.

During Prime+Probe, the {{attacker}} repeatedly probes certain cache <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> for cache misses after the victim executes. Hence, cache misses will be higher when the victim executes the monitored code. During Flush+Reload, attackers repeatedly flush and reload the cache lines and measure the access times to ascertain if the victim has accessed the same lines. The attacks are targeted on frequently used shared libraries. This results in large number of cache misses on the victim after every flush. With multiple lines <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> being monitored, the memory bus usage is high. This similarity in the anomalous behaviour of Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload has been observed previously [17, 19].|$|R

The assignment of particular trapline territories to individuals in band societies was traditionally handled by group consensus, and occasionally violence and warfare. In the present-day trapline assignment is typically formalized and controlled by the state.
