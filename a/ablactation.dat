40|$|The {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} on 114 Lippizaner breed foals in Đakovo stud. The accomplished measures obtained by cattle tape after parturition and <b>ablactation</b> (aged six months) referred to withers height, chest girth and cannon bone circumference per fathers' line. The foals dominance per lines varied as follows: line Favory 2, Maestoso 21, Neopolitano 5, Conversano 11, Pluto 40, Siglavy 9 and Tulipan 26 foals. The measuring values were processed by the statistical program SPSS/PC (Nie et al. 1975). Statistical processing was followed by correlation computation between aforesaid measures after parturition and <b>ablactation</b> in {{the total number of}} foals per line. Also, statistical significance between obtained values was also calculated. The smallest parturition withers height turned to be in the foals of the line Neapolitano 100. 80 cm and the greatest one in the line Siglavy 108. 11 cm. The smallest chest girth was with Maestoso line foals 80. 19 cm and the largest one with Siglavy 86. 78 cm. However, the smallest cannon bone circumference was found to be in Neapolitano line foals 11. 10 cm and the largest one with the line Favory 12. 50 cm. In the post <b>ablactation</b> period withers height ranged from 135. 50 cm in the line Favory to 143. 33 cm in Siglavy line whereas chest girth was from 133. 00 cm in Favory line to 142. 78 cm in Siglavy line. The smallest cannon bone circumference was also with Favory line foals 16. 25 cm and the largest one with Conversano line 17. 23 cm. Statistical significance of all three measures was more pronounced after parturition compared to the post <b>ablactation</b> period. Correlation for the total number ranged from r = - 0. 121 to r = 0. 913. Correlation among the processed body measures ranged from very strong negative to complete positive. Stronger correlation with all the lines appeared to be between withers height, chest girth and cannon bone circumference. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine foaling season effect on delivery size and on Lippizaner foals development in sucking phase. Mares mainly foal in spring months, but some of them also foal in summer and autumn months. The investigations refer to foals being delivered in the period 1 January - 30 June and 1 July to 31 December of the current year. We also studied male foals and females separately. Sixty three males and 50 females were studied in spring period whereas 14 males and 17 females in autumn months. Withers height, chest girth as well as cannon bone circumference were measured after birth and <b>ablactation.</b> Male foals had significantly higher withers in the first six month of the year and insignificantly thicker cannon bone compared to female ones. However, no significance was determined with foals being delivered in the second six months. Male foals being delevered {{in the first six months}} had insignificantly larger chest girth and cannon bone circumference compared to the foals being delivered in the second six months. Significantly very higher withers height and chest girth were determined in the first six month with female foals. Male foals being delivered in the first six months did have significantly very higher values for all three measures after <b>ablactation</b> whereas female foals being delivered in the second six months of the year had very significantly higher values compared to the male foals. Highly significant values in favour of male foals being delivered in the second six months of the year were determined by the testing. However, female foals delivered in the second six months of the year had significantly higher values. Keywords: foaling season, Lippizaner foals, development, body measure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: PCR-RFLP {{was applied}} to analyze {{the effect of the}} genetic {{variations}} of the POU 1 F 1 gene on growth traits of 100 Nan-yang cattle. The results showed that the 451 bp PCR product digested with Hinf demonstrated polymorphism in the population, which was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Moreover, the frequencies of alleles A/B in the Nanyang population were 0. 465 / 0. 535. The association of the variations of the POU 1 F 1 gene with the growth traits in the population was analyzed. The following pa-rameters were greater in individuals with a genotype BB than in those with an genotype AB: birth weight, average weight increase before <b>ablactation,</b> body height at 12 months, body weight, body length, and chest girth at 6 months and 12 months (P allele A in the other age groups. Therefore, the genotype BB maybe a dominant genotype and the allele B may be a dominant allele.

40|$|The {{clinical}} efficacy, {{tolerance and}} effect on plasma prolactin levels of four different dosages of intramuscular bromocriptine retard were compared. 108 Chinese puerperas {{with a mean}} body weight of 58 kg, who chose not to breast-feed following vaginal delivery, were randomized into four equal groups. The patients in each group were given intramuscular bromocriptine retard: 20, 30, 40 or 50 mg. The injection was well tolerated by all, except for two patients who developed small haematomas {{at the site of}} the injection and 2 patients who complained of dizziness. <b>Ablactation</b> occurred in 100 % of the patients in the 40 mg group, but was successful in only 92 and 91 % of the patients in the 20 and 30 mg groups, respectively. There were two cases of suboptimal response in the 50 mg group, despite marked reduction in plasma prolactin levels. Both these patients had developed moderate breast engorgement before they received the injection. The difference in response among the four groups was not statistically significant. We recommend that the injection be given prior to the development of breast engorgement. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Nasal {{exposure}} to the mixture of microbial extracts (MME) after <b>ablactation</b> enhanced airway resistance of newborn mice to Streptococcus pneumoniae (J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 298 : L 67, 2010). The present study was addressed to elucidate effective factors responsible for the enhanced innate resistance in the airway of MME-exposed newborn mice. MME exposure significantly increased the amount of pulmonary surfactants (SP-A and SP-D) in the airway. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the exposed mice exhibited greater levels of opsonic activity, thereby enhancing the phagocytic and intracellular killing activities of alveolar macrophages (MØ) against S. pneumoniae. The exposure itself did not increase a complement component C 3 and mannan-binding lectin-A (MBL-A) in the airway, whereas intratracheal infection with S. pneumoniae increased the quantity of SP-A, SP-D, C 3, and MBL-A in the exposed mice to a significant extent compared with control mice. The exposure enhanced {{the expression of the}} class A scavenger MØ receptor with collagenous structure on alveolar MØ and also increased the frequency of major histocompatibility complex II+ CD 11 c+ cells in the lung; the cells were able to produce IL- 10 and transforming growth factor-β in vitro. These results suggest that microbial exposure early in life increases the amounts of SP-A and SP-D and the number of scavenger MØ and also promotes maturation of CD 11 c+ cells in the airway of newborn mice, which may be involved in airway resistance to S. pneumoniae. 博士（医学）・乙 1323 号・平成 26 年 3 月 17 日発行元の規定により、本文の登録不可。本文は以下のURLを参照 "[URL]...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} feeding season effect (winter and summer) on reproductive and productive traits of the ewes and suckling lambs. Biological investigations {{were conducted on}} 60 Merinolandschaf breed ewes aged 4 years on the average and their lambs (123) in the suckling-ablactation period. In the winter feeding season ewes were fed grain mixture (300 g daily) containing 60 % oats, 30 % maize and 10 % soybean meal as well as hay (ad libitum). The lambs were suckling and they received forage mixture, quality hay and fresh water ad libitum. During the summer feeding season ewes grazed on the pastures. The lambs were suckling and received forage mixture, quality hay ad libitum and pasture green mass in smaller portions. While comparing winter to summer feeding season the ewes had longer gravidity period (150. 76 and 150. 40 days), more lambs at parturition (1. 21 and 1. 11) and <b>ablactation</b> (1. 10 and 1. 07), more twins (12 and 8), higher body weight during gravidity (65. 52 kg and 61. 86 kg) and increased body weight losses after lambing (7. 72 kg and 6. 44 kg). As for the body weight losses after lactation (7. 94 kg and 7. 78 kg) {{no statistically significant differences}} were determined between the feeding seasons. Birth weight of lambs was higher by 26. 91 % (4. 15 kg and 3. 27 kg) and at 60 days of age it was higher by 11. 40 % in winter compared to summer feeding season. Faster daily gains of lambs (by 7. 21 %) was determined during the winter feeding season. However, it was noticed that lambs aged from 40 th to 60 th and 20 th to 60 th day obtained higher daily gains (by 6. 25 % and 1. 74 %) in summer feeding season...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the effect of raw and roasted cereals (corn, oat and barley) and soybean in diet on growth performance and blood parameters of lambs fattening. Totally 60 lambs after <b>ablactation</b> at average of 50 days, were tested and equally divided into three groups: an experimental I (E I), experimental II (E II) and a control (C) group. The fattening period lasted 56 days. Lambs of the C group were fed on mixture with crude forages, those from the E I on mixture with roasted cereals and lambs of the E II on mixture with both roasted cereals and soybean. The lambs from E I and E II groups grew faster (by 13. 62 and 19. 40 %), gained higher final body weight (by 6. 72 and 8. 08 %) and spent less food per kg of daily gain weights (by 14. 03 and 13. 24 %) although feed consumption in E I was lower (by 2. 33 %) but in E II higher (3. 49 %) {{in comparison with the}} C group. The blood serum concentrations of cholesterol-total and cholesterol-HDL were lower for lambs EI groups compared with lambs C and E II groups. ALP activity was higher for lambs EI and EII groups compared with C group. Urea concentrations were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower, and that of albumin higher in E II group compared to C group. There were no differences among groups for the serum minerals content, other biochemical indicators and enzymes. Obtained differences in slaughter properties of lambs (carcass weight and dressing) indicate their better productive effects. Concerning the gained production results may be concluded that the use of roasted cereals and soybean in feed mixture in lambs fattening is justified...|$|E
40|$|Infection with Shiga toxin (Stx) -producing enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli is {{increasing}} among children. In this study, 5 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice with protein calorie malnutrition (PCM) {{that had been}} fed a 5 % protein diet for 2 weeks since <b>ablactation</b> were inoculated intragastrically with 2 × 106 CFU of Stx-producing E. coli O 157 :H 7. More than 75 % of infected mice with PCM died by 10 days postinfection. Infected mice with PCM developed neurologic symptoms 5 days after infection, while well-nourished control mice receiving a 25 % protein diet did not. In the intestinal tracts of infected mice with PCM, inoculated E. coli O 157 :H 7 multiplied between days 2 and 4 of infection, with a peak of growth at day 4. Although the pathogens were not culturable from the stool after day 7, O 157 lipopolysaccharide was detectable in the stool by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay even after day 8. Stx was detectable in the stool after day 2 of infection and increased {{in proportion to the}} growth of inoculated organisms. The maximal production of Stx occurred at 4 days postchallenge, and Stx was detectable in the blood on days 3 to 5. In contrast, well-nourished control mice survived the infection, and all of them remained well even after 3 weeks of infection. In these control mice, inoculated E. coli O 157 :H 7 disappeared from the stool before day 3. Stx was not detectable in the stool and blood of infected control mice at any time from day 1 through day 8. Histologically, cerebral hemorrhages seemed to be the cause of acute death of infected mice with PCM. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated the positive immunoreaction to Stx at the alveus and stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus and in renal tubules of infected malnourished mice. Such immunoreactions were not found in tissues from infected control mice. Histological study of the intestinal epithelium before infection showed that PCM severely affected the development of intestinal epithelia. These findings strongly indicate that PCM-induced nondevelopment of intestinal physical barrier is one of the predisposing factors for infection with Stx-producing E. coli O 157 :H 7 in mice and suggest that our mouse model may explain the high incidence of infection with Stx-producing E. coli O 157 :H 7 in the children whose intestinal epithelia have not yet completely developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{characterize}} the pressure and control when eating that mothers of Costa Rican preschoolers of high and lower class exert, evaluating relationships with the IMC of children, the type of lactancy, the <b>ablactation,</b> the schooling of the mother and her degree of dedication to housework.  Mothers of high class (n= 101) and lower class (n= 121) {{were asked to complete}} a validated survey (Cronbach’s α = 0. 7)  based on Likert Scale questions, to quantify, besides the required general information, the levels of control and pressure. Additionally, the IMC was determined for their preschooler sons and daughters (95 children of high class and 99 of low class). For the study of the data, t-Student tests, analyses of variance, correlations and evaluations of chi square were used.  An overweight tendency in children of both sexes was detected in the high class, which contrasts with girls of a lower class (lower weight).  A greater frequency of work outside the household was demonstrated for the low class (p= 0. 008), being the introduction of solid food earlier as well (p= 0. 04).  Maternal milk was used more often for both social classes for the newborn.  Both classes showed high “control” and “pressure”, especially between the mothers of lower class who work outside the household (p= 0. 0001). Both parameters correlate in a moderated positive way (r= 0. 44;  α= 0. 05). The correlation is stronger between the high class (r= 0. 54), mainly when dealing with preschool girls (r= 0. 6).  Keywords: Control when eating, pressure when eating, parenting, anthropometry, preschoolersEl objetivo planteado en este trabajo fue el de caracterizar la presión y el control al comer que ejercen madres de preescolares costarricenses de clase alta y baja, evaluando relaciones con  el IMC de sus hijos, el tipo de lactancia, la ablactación, la escolaridad de la madre y su dedicación al hogar.  Para ello se solicitó a 102 madres de clase alta y 121 de clase baja completar una encuesta validada (α de Cronbach de 0, 7) basada en escalas de Likert, para cuantificar, además de la información general requerida, los niveles de control y presión.  Adicionalmente, se determinó el IMC según género de sus hijos preescolares (102 niños de clase alta y 103 de clase baja).  Para el estudio de los datos se utilizaron pruebas  de t-Student y análisis de varianza, así como correlaciones y evaluaciones de chi cuadrado.  Se estableció una tendencia al sobrepeso en ambos sexos en la clase alta, la cual contrasta con las niñas pobres quienes tienden al bajo peso.  Se evidenció una mayor frecuencia de trabajo fuera del hogar en la clase baja (p= 0, 008), siendo la introducción de alimentos sólidos más temprana (p= 0, 04).  La leche materna fue la opción más empleada en ambas clases sociales para el neonato.  Ambas clases mostraron “control” y “presión” altas, especialmente entre las madres de clase social baja que trabajan fuera del hogar (p= 0, 0001).  Ambos parámetros correlacionan de manera positiva moderada (r= 0, 44; α= 0, 05).  La correlación es más fuerte entre la clase alta (r= 0, 54), sobre todo en las niñas (r= 0, 6).  Palabras claves: Control al comer, presión al comer, crianza, antropometría, preescolare...|$|E
