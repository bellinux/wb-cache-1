5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not <b>always</b> <b>so</b> consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E

5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was <b>always</b> <b>so.</b> There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} {{involved are}} not <b>always</b> <b>so</b> trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an {{inertial reference frame}} doesn't see objects he would describe as moving faster {{than the speed of}} light. However, in the non-inertial reference frame of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial reference frame of the Earth, anybody who looks at the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be moving faster than the speed of light.|$|E

25|$|In 1406 renewed {{efforts were}} made to stop the schism, and Chichele was one of the envoys sent to the new Pope Gregory XII. Here he {{utilised}} his opportunities. On 31 August 1407 Guy Mone (he is <b>always</b> <b>so</b> spelt and not Mohun, and was probably from one of the Hampshire Meons; there was a John Mone of Havant admitted a Winchester scholar in 1397), bishop of St David's, died, and on 12 October 1407 Chichele was by the pope provided to the bishopric of St David's. Another bull the same day gave him the right to hold all his benefices with the bishopric. He was consecrated on 17 June 1408.|$|E

Raphaël Géminiani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the most}} gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was <b>always</b> <b>so</b> incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E
25|$|Rumelia (or Trakya) {{refers to}} the region of Turkey {{which is part of}} Southeast Europe (the provinces of Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, the {{northern}} part of Çanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province). Folk songs from this region share similarities with Balkan, Albanian and Greek folk musics, especially from the ethnic minorities and natives of Thrace. Cypriot folk music also shares folk tunes with this region, e.g. the Çiftetelli dance. These type of folk songs also share close similarities with Ottoman court music, suggesting that the distinction between court and folk music was not <b>always</b> <b>so</b> clear. However, folk songs from Istanbul may have been closely influenced by its locality, which would include Ottoman rakkas and court music.|$|E

25|$|While Ruffini and Abel {{established}} that the general quintic could not be solved, some particular quintics can be solved, such as (x1)5=0, and the precise criterion by which a given quintic or higher polynomial could be determined to be solvable or not was given by Évariste Galois, who showed that whether a polynomial was solvable or not was equivalent {{to whether or not}} the permutation group of its roots – in modern terms, its Galois group – had a certain structure – in modern terms, whether or not it was a solvable group. This group was always solvable for polynomials of degree four or less, but not <b>always</b> <b>so</b> for polynomials of degree five and greater, which explains why there is no general solution in higher degree.|$|E
25|$|African slavery {{became more}} common in Brazil during the mid 16th century, though the {{enslavement}} of indigenous people continued into the 17th and even the 18th century in the backlands of Brazil. Indigenous slaves remained much cheaper during this time than their African counterparts, though they did suffer horrendous death rates from European diseases. Although the average African slave lived to only be twenty-three years old due to terrible work conditions, this was still about four years longer than Indigenous slaves, which was a big contribution to high price of African slaves. Even though prices for indigenous slaves were cheaper, {{there was never a}} focus on maintaining slave families. Because enslaved peoples were <b>always</b> <b>so</b> available, either through conquest or buying them through the market, the economic incentive to keep families together never manifested itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} increase in solar irradiation at closest {{approach to the}} Sun (perihelion) compared to the irradiation at the furthest distance (aphelion) is slightly larger than four times the eccentricity. For Earth's current orbital eccentricity, incoming solar radiation varies by about 6.8%, while {{the distance from the}} Sun currently varies by only 3.4% (5.1millionkm). Perihelion presently occurs around January 3, while aphelion is around July 4. When the orbit is at its most eccentric, the amount of solar radiation at perihelion will be about 23% more than at aphelion. However, the Earth's eccentricity is <b>always</b> <b>so</b> small that the variation in solar irradiation is a minor factor in seasonal climate variation, compared to axial tilt and even compared to the relative ease of heating the larger land masses of the northern hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|In the {{majority}} of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying {{a significant portion of}} the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes. However, the situation is not <b>always</b> <b>so</b> simple; in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.|$|E
25|$|The diffusion-limited {{aggregation}} {{model has}} given simulated results which are closest {{in comparison to}} vascular trees in vivo. This model suggests that vascular growth occurs along a gradient of shear stress at the vessel wall, which results {{in the growth of}} vessel radii. Diffusion-limited aggregation proposes that an aggregate grows by the fusion of random walkers, which themselves walk along a pressure gradient. Random walk is simply a probability-based version of the diffusion equation. Thus, in applying this model to the vascular tree, small, resistant vessels must be replaced with large, conducting vessels in order to balance the pressure across the entire system. This model yields a structure which is more random at the tips than in the major lines, which is related to the fact that Laplacian formulations are stable when speed is negative with respect to pressure gradient. In major lines, this is <b>always</b> <b>so,</b> but in small sprouts the speed fluctuates around 0, leading to unstable, random behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Arabs relying {{largely on}} Berbers conquered the Iberian Peninsula {{starting}} in 711, subduing the whole Visigothic Kingdom by 725. The triumphant Umayyads got conditional capitulations probably {{in most of}} the towns, so that they could get a compromise with the native population. This was not <b>always</b> <b>so.</b> For example, Mérida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered by storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the locals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, so that the Goths (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities ruled by the Forum Iudicum) continued to be ruled on new conditions by their own tribunals and laws. The Gothic Church remained in place and collaborated with the new masters. Al-Andalus or Muslim ruled Iberian peninsula, was conquered by northern Christian kingdoms in 1492, {{as a result of their}} expansion taking place especially after the definite collapse of the Caliphate of Cordova in 1031.|$|E
