There may be a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal wear debris or a hypersensitivity reaction to a normal amount of metal debris.|$|E

25|$|A {{third of}} intermarried couples provide their {{children}} with a Jewish upbringing, and doing so is more common among intermarried families raising their children in areas with high Jewish populations. The Boston area, for example, is exceptional in that an estimated 60% percent of children of intermarriages <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>raised</b> Jewish, meaning that intermarriage would actually be contributing to a net {{increase in the number}} of Jews. As well, some children raised through intermarriage rediscover and embrace their Jewish roots when they themselves marry and have children.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, {{during the}} 3rd World Scout Jamboree, he {{received}} as a present a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan. This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around Europe. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at Gilwell Park. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945. Jam Roll and Eccles were reunited at Gilwell for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007. Recently it has been purchased on behalf of Scouting and is owned by a charity, B-P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>raised</b> to repay the loan {{that was used to}} purchase the car. Baden-Powell also had a positive impact on improvements in youth education. Under his dedicated command the world Scouting movement grew. By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was in excess of 3.3million.|$|E
2500|$|Ari Millen as {{a number}} of male clones (see here) – the result of a sister project to Project Leda: Project Castor, a top-secret {{military}} program. Unlike their Leda counterparts, the Castor clones have always been aware of what they <b>are,</b> <b>being</b> <b>raised</b> together by the US military; their caretaker was Virginia Coady, who they refer to as Mother. They suffer a mental defect, which basically turns their brains to, quoting Scotty, [...] "Swiss cheese" [...] after set amount of time; unfortunately the defect is also an STD, which sterilizes women. Coady studies this, often sending Rudy off on leave to infect new test subjects. The first Castor clone to be introduced to the viewers is Mark Rollins, coming off as a homicidal Prolethean, before being exposed as an undercover Castor agent; he marries fellow Prolethean Gracie Johanssen after running away from the Prolethean farm, wanting a normal life with her before his defect kills him. Other major Castor clones includes the menacing scarefaced Rudy, the tormented Seth, the crippled Miller and the Neolutionist Ira. All the Castor clones are now deceased, with Mark, the last, executed by Coady. (recurring season 2; regular season 3–5) ...|$|E

So far as I can see, it is the only medium through which we can discuss the great majority of the problems which <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>raised</b> in such bristling multitude by our contemporary social development Nearly every one of those problems has at its core a psychological problem, and not merely a psychological problem, but one in which the idea of individuality is an essential factor.

The hunting only begins when you leave the cordon behind you and push into the thickets.|$|E

You must mind, Chris, above all things, to keep your temper, whatever may happen. You know how our people have been insulted, and actually maltreated in scores of cases, and in their present state of excitement the Boers would be only too glad to find an excuse for acts of violence.

Of course this news was very alarming in itself, and when two or three hours later the news came in of the murders in our own settlement we were naturally most anxious about you. However, as we could not come over in the dark through the forest, and as Mitford pointed out that the house was well prepared for defence, and that you would certainly be on the alert and had the dogs, who would give you notice of any body of men coming, we consented to remain if he would send us home in the canoe at five o'clock in the morning. And now, what is it that happened here yesterday?" ...|$|E
