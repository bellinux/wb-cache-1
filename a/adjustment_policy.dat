40|$|The {{analysis}} of the micro impacts of macroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> is quite new. It developed out of the concern that <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> adopted by governments to correct macroeconomic imbalances have affected various groups in the economy differently. The experience of several countries who have undertaken <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> have indicated that these policies tended to be deflationary and {{that most of the}} adjustment costs have been borne by the more vulnerable groups. The predominantly deflationary nature of <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> led to depressed employment and real income resulting to higher poverty incidence. Moreover, some macro policies have direct negative effects on the welfare of these vulnerable groups (Cornia, Jolly and Stewart, 1987). In response to the search for alternative adjustment paths that would minimize the social costs, the Micro Impacts of Macroeconomic <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Policies</b> (MIMAP) Project was conceived. Under Phase I of the MIMAP Project, Lamberte et al (1991) developed a general framework for analyzing the micro impacts of macroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies.</b> Their main finding was that there were many studies looking at the impacts of macroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> on macro aggregates and also severa...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the Korean {{government}} {{has sought to}} encourage rural young people to enter farming and older farmers to leave it. The government‟s tool for promoting this intergenerational change has been agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy,</b> which includes farm entry policy, farm exit policy, competitiveness policy, and rural development policy. However, {{the number of young}} farmers has decreased and number of old farmers has increased. This research investigates why agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> has failed, analyzing survey data on farm entry and exit using regression analysis, and with procedures enhanced by bootstrapping. The conclusions of the research are as follows. Agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> does not induce young people to enter farming mainly because: 1) Rural young people have as little enthusiasm for farming as their urban counterparts; and 2) Competitiveness policy cancels the effects of farm entry policy. Meanwhile, agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> has not induced old farmers to retire mainly because: 1) Older farmers are as reluctant to leave farming as younger ones; 2) Farm exit policy does not promote farm exit; and 3) Competitiveness policy and rural development policy, as well as farming conditions and farm exit barriers, cancel the effects of farm exit policy.

40|$|Multivariate process {{adjustment}} {{in the presence}} of fixed adjustment costs is investigated in this paper. A fixed adjustment cost leads to a trade-off between adjusting a process continuously and allowing the process to drift until a bound is violated. The problem of determining the best bounded <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> and the optimal bounded adjustment parameter is addressed. Although the univariate bounded adjustment problem has received interest in the past, there has been little focus on the multivariate case in the literature. It has been shown that in the univariate case, the shape of the optimal <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> is a dead band. Determining the shape of the optimal dead region and the parameter that defines this region in the multivariate case is a difficult problem. A State-Space model is formulated for the multivariate bounded process adjustment problem and a Kalman Filter based controller is used. With the help of simulation, the optimal bounded adjustment parameter is computed for two dead regionsubspace shapes. A numerical illustration of a semiconductor manufacturing process demonstrates the optimal bounded <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E

The aim {{of this article is}} to analyse the interconnections between five vicious cycles of recession and highlight the country's development prospects. The five vicious cycles of the Greek economy are as follows: a) fiscal, b) internal devaluation, c) financial, d) psychological, and e) sociopolitical. These five vicious circles of recession must be seen in parallel with the <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> applied. The results of this policy have created the preconditions for the maintenance of the recession. Also, other deficits of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> and structural weaknesses of the Greek economy continue to limit the prospects of recovery for the Greek economy.

After {{a review of}} the Chilean experience in the eighties, a general equilibrium, two period optimizing model is developed to evaluate the welfare effects of fiscal adjustment following an increase in the external payments of the publicly held external debt. The model considers two private sector representative agents: a capitalist and a worker. The government finances the external transfer with an internal transfer. The following fiscal policies are analvzed: lump sum transfers, direct taxes, inflation tax, public investment, and public debt. There are three channels by which the <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> affects the welfare of private agents. The first channel is the direct impact of fiscal policy on private sector agents income. The second channel is related to the impact of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> on growth and future income.

40|$|Structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> {{packages}} {{sponsored by}} the IMF and the World Bank are a combination of monetary, fiscal and trade measures intended to curb inflation, improve the balance of payments, and foster economic growth. From a brief discussion of a typical structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> package and the debate about its macroeconomic and distributional impacts, we derive a list of desirable characteristics for an adequate model thereof. Upon reviewing {{the literature on the}} issue, we see beginnings of a consensus on how to construct the sectoral structure of the real side of the economy and the formation of relative prices, and effective tools for analyzing distributional impacts also on population groups different from those used in formulating the model. However, the views on the proper relationship (in particular, directions of causality) between credit, prices, and real output are sharply divided between the monetarist and the structuralist school, with only one model allowing for an endogenous switch between the two corresponding modes of behavior. We also find that current methodologies are not very useful for representing the behavior of the economy prior to the achievement of the hypothetical equilibrium, thus not allowing for calibration of mode...|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES—The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine (1) trends concerning financial assistance from the national government to local governments, (2) trends regarding death rates and life expectancies among prefectures, and (3) the effect of the national financial <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> in equalising both the revenues of local governments and variations in the health levels among prefectures in terms of death rates and life expectancies.  DESIGN—The study analysed prefectural income, the amount of national taxes collected, financial assistance from the national government to local governments, and age adjusted death rates and life expectancies of all of the prefectures in Japan during the period from 1965  through 1995.  MAIN RESULTS—(1) Under the financial <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy,</b> financial assistance from the national government to the local governments, which consists of the sum of the local allocation tax and treasury disbursements, increased from 1831  billion yen in 1965  to 31   116 billion yen in 1995.  (2) During the same period, the age adjusted death rate per 100   000 people decreased from 1168. 9  (1965) to 545. 3  (1995). The range of variation in the age adjusted death rate among prefectures diminished as the coefficient of variation of the death rate declined from 0. 060  in 1965  to 0. 043  in 1995.  (3) There was a significant statistical correlation between higher prefectural incomes and lower mortality rates during from 1965  until 1975  (p <  0. 05), whereas this correlation was indistinct in the 1980 s and has not been observed since 1990.  (4) The relative health level of Tokyo has declined in terms of its ranking among all the prefectures with regard to life expectancy, from being the best in 1965  to below average in 1995.  CONCLUSIONS—The national financial <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> to balance the revenues of local governments has increased the health levels of rural prefectures. It is probable that the policy reduced the disparity in death rates and life expectancies among prefectures throughout the country. However, the policy has precluded the nation's capital city from applying its economic resources as local government expenditures to deal with the megacity issues affecting health.    Keywords: fiscal adjustment policy; mortality disparit...|$|E
