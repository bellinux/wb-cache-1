40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{test for}} otolith asymmetries, several studies {{described}} horizontal {{translation of the}} body and head en bloc during fast vertical axis rotation. This stimulus causes one otolithic organ to rotate on-axis, and the other to experience centripetal acceleration. OBJECTIVE: To test a new, more simple method of unilateral stimulation with head tilt and the body remaining on axis. METHODS: During stationary and during 360 deg/s rotation, 12 healthy blindfolded subjects had their heads tilted 30 degrees sideways, positioning one otolithic organ on the axis of rotation after the other. The haptic subjective vertical (SV) was recorded several times by means of a manually <b>adjustable</b> <b>rod.</b> RESULTS: It was found that during stationary the SV tilted about 4 degrees on average {{in the direction of the}} head. During rotation, the SV tilted about 9 degrees on average. We therefore estimate the effect of eccentric otolith rotation to be 5 degrees on average. CONCLUSIONS: Tilt of the subjective vertical induced by head tilt during on-axis body rotation can provide a relatively uncomplicated alternative to test unilateral otolithic function as compared to body and head translation during rotation. Moreover, unlike eccentric rotation of the entire body, somatosensory cues are minimized by keeping the body fixed on axis and by subtracting the effect of head tilt per se. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} component in energy usage is lighting, {{which is currently}} dominated by incandescent and fluorescent lamps. However, due to potentially higher efficiencies and thus higher energy savings, solid-state lighting (SSL) is seriously being considered as a replacement. Currently, state-of-the-art white LEDs {{are made up of}} thin films of GaN and InGaN grown on sapphire substrates. A new LED structure design is proposed, in which GaN nanorod arrays are grown on silicon substrates. This new structure could be fabricated using anodized aluminum oxide's (AAO) ordered arrangement of pores as a template for growth of the nanorod array. AAO is selected for its high porosity and simple controllability of pore size and separation, which can in turn produce high density monocrystalline nanorod arrays with <b>adjustable</b> <b>rod</b> size and separation. Several advantages are enjoyed by LEDs based on rod arrays: lower cost, better yield and reliability and higher efficiencies. Two more LED designs, other than the current state-of-the-art GaN LED and the proposed LED structure, are included for comparisons. It is found that the proposed LED structure design is the best after considering costs and efficiency. For commercialization of this new LED design, the market penetration plan is to have a partnership with one of the major players in the current white LED industry. This has the advantage of having minimal capital investment and the product could be sold under an established brand. A simplified projection of earnings is calculated to illustrate sustainability of this business plan. by Qixun Wee. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Most basses come with trill keys which allow the player to stabilize some otherwise unstable middle register notes as well as trill between otherwise impossible notes.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of examining electro‐mechanical {{activity of the}} human masseter muscles using non‐invasive recording techniques was examined in six healthy dentate adults (aged 34 ‐ 57 years). Electrical activity of the muscle was examined by surface electro‐myography (EMG) and the mechanical activity, {{in the form of}} muscle sounds, was examined by acoustic myography (AMG). Bilateral recordings of EMG and AMG were made simultaneously using composite probes which were placed on the skin over the masseter muscles. A standardized pressure was applied to the probes via <b>adjustable</b> <b>rods</b> attached to a safety helmet. Pressures were monitored by strain gauges placed between the ends of the rods and the probes. With the subject seated, recordings of AMG and EMG were obtained during maximal jaw clenching for 4 s and the raw signals were stored on a computer. Of three maximal contractions performed, the last two were used in the analysis. The raw amplified signals underwent frequency analysis by fast Fourier Transform. Total activity was also assessed after amplification, full‐wave rectification and integration, and repeatability of the results was assessed. The AMG frequency range was 6 ‐ 15 Hz and was similar to values for other human skeletal muscles. The integrated values for EMG and AMG were repeatable {{on both sides of the}} face (IEMG, right r = 0. 99, left r = 0. 99; IAMG right r = 0. 70, left r = 0. 71). Simultaneous recordings of AMG and EMG from the masseter muscles may be useful for assessing electro‐mechanical muscle function but further validation studies are required before the technique can be used clinically.

40|$|Successful {{anatomic}} fitting {{of a total}} {{artificial heart}} (TAH) is vital to achieve optimal pump hemodynamics after device implantation. Although many anatomic fitting studies have been completed in humans prior to clinical trials, few reports exist that detail the experience in animals for in vivo device evaluation. Optimal hemodynamics are crucial throughout the in vivo phase to direct design iterations and ultimately validate device performance prior to pivotal human trials. In vivo evaluation in a sheep model allows a realistically sized representation of a smaller patient, for which smaller third-generation TAHs {{have the potential to}} treat. Our study aimed to assess the anatomic fit of a single device rotary TAH in sheep prior to animal trials and to use the data to develop a three-dimensional, computer-aided design (CAD) -operated anatomic fitting tool for future TAH development. Following excision of the native ventricles above the atrio-ventricular groove, a prototype TAH was inserted within the chest cavity of six sheep (28 – 40 [*]kg). <b>Adjustable</b> <b>rods</b> representing inlet and outlet conduits were oriented toward the center of each atrial chamber and the great vessels, with conduit lengths and angles recorded for future analysis. A three-dimensional, CAD-operated anatomic fitting tool was then developed, {{based on the results of}} this study, and used to determine the inflow and outflow conduit orientation of the TAH. The mean diameters of the sheep left atrium, right atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were 39, 33, 12, and 11 [*]mm, respectively. The center-to-center distance and outer-edge-to-outer-edge distance between the atria, found to be 39 [*]±[*] 9 [*]mm and 72 [*]±[*] 17 [*]mm in this study, were identified as the most critical geometries for successful TAH connection. This geometric constraint restricts the maximum separation allowable between left and right inlet ports of a TAH to ensure successful alignment within the available atrial circumference.
