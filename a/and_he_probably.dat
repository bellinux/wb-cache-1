5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them {{into the back of}} his truck.|$|E
5|$|In Austria, Kepler {{left behind}} such a {{historical}} legacy {{that he was}} one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin, minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{present at}} King William's {{death in a}} hunting accident, Warelwast served as a diplomat to the king's successor, Henry I. After the {{resolution}} of the Investiture Controversy, Warelwast was rewarded with the bishopric of Exeter in Devon, but he continued to serve Henry as a diplomat and royal judge. He began {{the construction of a new}} cathedral at Exeter, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> divided the diocese into archdeaconries. Warelwast went blind after 1120, and after his death in 1137 was succeeded by his nephew, Robert Warelwast.|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} about Roald, apart from {{that he had a}} farm in Dalur, <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> {{originated}} from Shetland.|$|R
50|$|Lambert Tevoet was {{a tailor}} {{who worked for}} Bartemeier <b>and</b> Geerts. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> {{did not have the}} house built, but he was an early owner and lived here for many years.|$|R
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Æthelwold's {{immediate}} family. Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred's wife was probably the Wulfthryth who witnessed a charter in 868. Æthelwold {{and his older brother}} Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred's will in the 880s. Æthelhelm is not heard of again, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred's death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or {{he may have been}} related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz {{welcomed the}} Crimean War of 1853-1856, which {{he hoped would}} lead to a new European order {{including}} a restored independent Poland. His last composition, a Latin ode Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum, honored Napoleon III and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the Battle of Bomarsund in the Åland Islands in August 1854. Polish émigrés associated with the Hôtel Lambert persuaded him to become active again in politics. Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission. He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire, on 22 September. There, working with Michał Czajkowski (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia. With his friend Armand Lévy he also set about organizing a Jewish legion. He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yenişehir Street in the Pera (now Beyoğlu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855. Though Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there is no proof of this, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> contracted cholera, which claimed other lives there at the time.|$|E
50|$|He had a tomb {{constructed}} at Amarna, Amarna Tomb 5, {{although his}} remains {{have never been}} identified, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> never buried there.|$|R
50|$|Sometime {{during his}} forties, {{he began to}} suffer from {{lithiasis}} <b>and</b> gout. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> died of cachexia and was buried next to the Stadtkirche Darmstadt, with a monument bearing a medallion and a poetic inscription.|$|R
50|$|Eric Hosking brought birds {{into all}} our lives. He opened {{our eyes to}} the beauty of their world, their grace <b>and</b> fascination. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> {{achieved}} more for avian conservation than any other naturalist of our day.|$|R
5|$|The two did {{not resolve}} their disagreement, but Walpole did concede the matter, {{possibly}} {{to keep the}} letters between them polite. But Gray's outline of the events provides the second possible way the poem was composed: the first lines of the poem were written some time in 1746 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> wrote more of the poem during the time than Walpole claimed. The letters show the likelihood of Walpole's date for the composition, as a 12 June 1750 letter from Gray to Walpole stated that Walpole was provided lines from the poem years before and the two were not on speaking terms until after 1745. The only other letter to discuss the poem was one sent to Wharton on 11 September 1746, which alludes to the poem being worked on.|$|E
5|$|When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to {{the throne}} there were changes in the {{leadership}} on the Isle of Wight and the castle. Worsley was dismissed in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 {{for his role in}} the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen. When the Protestant Elizabeth I came {{to the throne}} in 1558, however, peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England. Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle. Worsley filled in half of the castle's courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> also constructed the Master Gunner's House on the other side of the castle. Nonetheless, an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition. Work costing £50 was done in 1587, including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns. The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, after which further repairs were carried out on the castle. By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle, which was still considered an important defence for the Solent, needed expensive repairs.|$|E
25|$|Carlotta {{followed}} a design by Andrea Salvini <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> built her; Napoleon was reportedly at her launch. In 1810 {{she was at}} Goro-Primaro, the southernmost branch of the river Po.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} if my kind friend from Chicago {{had gone on}} without me, until I suddenly remembered that the Brooklyn address was in my pocket, <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> did not remember the street and number.|$|R
50|$|Nuun Ujol K'inich (fl.800?), was an ajaw of the Maya city of Tikal. He ruled {{sometime}} between 794 <b>and</b> 810 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> father of Dark Sun.|$|R

25|$|Eventually Senfl {{acquired}} a post in Munich, a place which had high musical standards, a strong {{need for new}} music, and which was relatively tolerant of those with Protestant sympathies; he was to remain there {{for the rest of}} his life. By 1540 he was ill, judging from his correspondence with Duke Albrecht, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> died in early 1543.|$|E
25|$|Björn's {{hand-drawn}} maps {{were sent}} to Copenhagen for preparing the publication. Olaf Nikolas Olsen had been appointed {{as the director of}} publication; he proposed to publish the map on four sheets, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> also defined the scale of 1:480,000 and the conical projection used. The map was published under Olsen's name, with the Literary Society of Iceland as the publisher, and paid by the Danish treasury. The title page was in Danish and French. Although dated 1844, it was probably not completed until 1848. In 1849, a smaller version of the map on one sheet at a scale of 1:960,000 was published.|$|E
25|$|Morey's first patent, in 1793, {{was for a}} steam-powered spit, but he had grander plans. Morey {{realized}} that steam could be a power source in the 1780s, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> appreciated a steamboat’s potential from work on his father’s ferry and the locks he designed along the Connecticut river. In the early 1790s he fitted a paddle wheel and steam engine to a small boat and powered {{it up and down}} the Connecticut River. Legend has it, this was done on a Sunday morning, when the town was at church, to avoid ridicule if he failed.|$|E
5000|$|... 。 他看了三場球賽。He watched three ballgames (<b>and</b> <b>he</b> has <b>probably</b> watched many {{during his}} lifetime; {{often used in}} a time-delimited context such as [...] "today" [...] or [...] "last week").|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] drawled Carl, [...] "I have {{fairly good}} authority. Walter MacMonnies, for instance, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is <b>probably</b> the best flier {{in the country}} to-day, except for Lincoln Beachey." ...|$|R
50|$|Johann Jacob played oboe, flute <b>and</b> {{possibly}} violin. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> {{composed the}} Sonata in C minor under the pseudonym Signor Bach.|$|R
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
25|$|Between 1446 and 1448 Ockeghem served, {{along with}} singer and {{composer}} Jean Cousin, {{at the court}} of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon in Moulins, now in central France. During this service {{he became the first}} among the singing chaplains to appear in the court records. Around 1452 he moved to Paris where he served as maestro di cappella to the French court, as well as treasurer of the collegiate church of St. Martin, at Tours. In addition to serving at the French court – both for Charles VII and Louis XI – he held posts at Notre Dame de Paris and at St. Benoît. He is known to have traveled to Spain in 1470, as part of a diplomatic mission for the King, which was a complex affair attempting both to dissuade Spain from joining an alliance with England and Burgundy against France, and to arrange a marriage between Isabella I of Castile and Charles, Duke of Guyenne (the brother of king Louis XI). After the death of Louis XI (1483), not much is known for certain about Ockeghem's whereabouts, though it is known that he went to Bruges and Tours, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> died in the latter town since he left a will there. An indication of the renown in which Ockeghem was held is the number of laments written on his death in 1497; among the most famous of the musical settings of these many poems is Nymphes des bois by Josquin des Prez.|$|E
500|$|The castle {{was placed}} on a [...] "care and maintenance" [...] footing, with a {{skeleton}} garrison. Parliament appointed George Kekewich as the new captain <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> remained in post until the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, when Sir Richard Vyvyan, Sir Francis's son, took over command. Richard inherited a garrison of 13 men, which he considered insufficient. Richard's son, Sir Vyel Vyvyan, became captain in turn on his father's death, {{but he had no}} heirs and separated the castle's lands from the captaincy, selling them to John Granville, the Earl of Bath.|$|E
50|$|John de Egglescliffe (died 1347) was a 14th-century English bishop. Little {{is known}} of his {{personal}} background except {{that he was an}} Augustinian friar, <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> came from County Durham (there is a parish called Eaglescliffe there).|$|R
50|$|Carre's Hospital, Northgate, Sleaford, 1830. Tudoresque almshouses. Kirk was the {{contractor}} {{for the first}} range which designed by Kendall, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> responsible for the second range of 1841-46.|$|R
5000|$|Pierre Lecomte du Noüy ( [...] ; 20 December 1883, Paris - 22 September 1947, New York City) was a French biophysicist <b>and</b> philosopher. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> is best-remembered by {{scientists}} {{for his work}} on the surface tension, and other properties, of liquids.|$|R
2500|$|Robert the Bruce {{did change}} sides between the Scots loyalists and the English {{more than once}} in the earlier stages of the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he never betrayed Wallace directly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> did not fight on the English side at the Battle of Falkirk (although this claim does appear in a few medieval sources). [...] Later, the Battle of Bannockburn was not a {{spontaneous}} battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years. His title before becoming king was Earl of Carrick, not Earl of Bruce.|$|E
2500|$|King Richard {{was distracted}} {{by a growing}} {{conflict}} with the Lords Appellant from this time on. Glyndŵr's opportunities were further limited {{by the death of}} Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> returned to his stable Welsh estates, living there quietly for ten years during his forties. The bard Iolo Goch ("Red Iolo"), himself a Welsh lord, visited him in the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising Owain's liberality, and writing of Sycharth, [...] "Rare was it there / to see a latch or a lock." ...|$|E
2500|$|The discord Melkor created {{would have}} dire consequences, as this singing {{was a kind}} of {{template}} for the world: [...] "The evils of the world were not at first in the great Theme, but entered with the discords of Melkor." [...] However, [...] "Sauron was not a beginner of discord; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> knew more of the Music than did Melkor, whose mind had always been filled with his own plans and devices." [...] Apparently Sauron was not even one of the spirits that immediately began to attune their music to that of Melkor, since it is noted elsewhere that his fall occurred later (see below).|$|E
25|$|The fellows of the Jesus Seminar mostly {{held that}} Jesus {{was not an}} ascetic, <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> drank wine <b>and</b> did not fast, other than as all observant Jews did. He did, however, promote a simple life and the {{renunciation}} of wealth.|$|R
