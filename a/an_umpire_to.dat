25|$|In August 2007, after a gap {{of almost}} 23 years {{since his first}} women's ODI, Molenaar umpired two more matches, during the South African tour of the Netherlands. Later in the month, when Bermuda toured, he was also reserve umpire for two men's ODIs. Molenaar's last women's ODI to date came in July 2008, when the West Indian team toured. In September 2009, when Afghanistan toured, he was the third umpire {{for one of the}} men's ODIs. His final list-A match as <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> (<b>to</b> date) came in July 2010, a one-day match between the Netherlands and a Zimbabwe XI that preceded an Intercontinental Cup fixture. Molenaar's daughter, Marjolijn Molenaar, has played at ODI level for the Netherlands.|$|E

2500|$|Ranjitsinhji's {{tour was}} {{controversial}} {{in one aspect}} only: {{a series of articles}} he wrote for an Australian magazine. Although highly self-critical in the articles, he criticised, among other things, the behaviour of the crowds, [...] the refusal of Australian critics to accept that England had to bat in poor conditions in the second Test, and some opposing players. He also supported the decision of <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> <b>to</b> no ball some deliveries from Ernie Jones, in a match against Stoddart's team, for illegally [...] throwing the ball rather than bowling it. He generally very popular in Australia with crowds, the general public and influential figures in society, although he barracked but following these comments, the crowds at some matches barracked Ranjitsinhji while he was batting. At the end of the tour, he wrote an open letter to mend his relations with the Australian public, but in With Stodard's team in Australia, he wrote of the [...] "regrettable" [...] incident of [...] "merciless", [...] "uncomplimentary and insulting" [...] barracking.|$|E
2500|$|The England team {{thought that}} the Australian umpires failed to apply Law 46; 'the {{persistent}} bowling of fast short-pitched balls at the batsman is unfair if, {{in the opinion of}} the umpire at the bowler's end, it constitutes a systematic attempt at intimidation'. Wisden noted that [...] "never in the 98 years of Test cricket have batsmen been so grievously bruised and battered by ferocious, hostile, short-pitched balls". Both Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had written and stated that they liked to bowl bouncers to intimidate batsmen, with Thomson's 'blood on the wicket' statement particularly offending old-fashioned sensibilities. Traditionally it was the job of the captain to restrain his bowlers if they became too aggressive, but Ian Chappell refused to do so and the Australian umpires were loath to give them official warnings. It is rare in Test cricket for <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> <b>to</b> give a bowler an official warning or to ban him, and in Sydney the crowd would not have accepted such a move. To be fair the England fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis had bowled short and fast on the previous tour and Chappell [...] "employed almost the identical tactics used by Illingworth and Snow in 1970-71" [...] when the tourists had complained about Umpire Rowan's interference. Willis returned to bowl short in 1974-75, but was injury prone and not as fast as either Lillee or Thomson. It was possible for umpires to curb even a fast bowler like Lillee, as Dickie Bird was to demonstrate in England, but Brooks and Bailhache were relatively inexperienced and lacked authority. They also lacked the backing of the Australia Board of Control who enjoyed record profits from the series thanks to the crowd-drawing qualities of the bowlers. Keith Fletcher had his arm bruised by Thomson in the First Test and Dennis Amiss and John Edrich their hands bruised from being constantly hit with short balls. Wally Edwards was hit by a Willis bouncer in the Second Test, Colin Cowdrey on the arm by Lillee and David Lloyd painfully in the groin by Thomson. The Third Test had Fred Titmus struck a blow {{to the back of the}} knee from a ball by Thomson. In the Fourth Test Tony Greig hit Lillee on the elbow and Ashley Mallett on his bowling hand with his medium paced bouncers, John Edrich had his ribs broken when he ducked into a Lillee bouncer that kept low and Fletcher was hit on the head. In the Sixth Test Greg Chappell was struck on the chin by Peter Lever. Edrich (twice), Amiss and Lloyd were all dropped from Tests due to the severity of their injuries.|$|E
60|$|But it happened, unfortunately, {{that the}} rules for the {{interpretation}} of auguries and omens, were far too indefinite and vague to answer the purpose {{for which they were}} now appealed to. The most unequivocal distinctness and directness in giving its responses is a very essential requisite in any tribunal that is called upon as <b>an</b> <b>umpire,</b> <b>to</b> settle disputes; while the ancient auguries and oracles were always susceptible of a great variety of interpretations. When Remus and Romulus commenced their watch no vultures were to be seen from either hill. They waited till evening, still none appeared. They continued to watch through the night. In the morning a messenger came over from the Palatine hill to Remus on the Aventine, informing him that vultures had appeared to Romulus. Remus did not believe it. At last, however, the birds really came into view; a flock of six were seen by Remus, and afterward one of twelve by Romulus. The observations were then suspended, and the parties came together to confer in respect to the result; but the dispute instead of being settled, was found to be in a worse condition than ever. The point now to be determined was whether six vultures seen first, or twelve seen afterward, were the better omen, that is whether numbers, or simple priority of appearance, should decide the question. In contending in respect to this nice point the brothers became more angry with each other than ever. Their respective partisans took sides in the contest, which resulted finally in an open and violent collision. Romulus and Remus themselves seem to have commenced the affray by attacking one another. Faustulus, their foster-father, who, from having had the care of them from their earliest infancy, felt for them an almost parental affection, rushed between them to prevent them from shedding each other's blood. He was struck down and killed on the spot, by some unknown hand. A brother of Faustulus too, named Plistinus, who had lived near to him, and had known the boys from their infancy, and had often assisted in taking care of them, was killed in the endeavor to aid his brother to appease the tumult.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor was {{the only}} {{successful}} deaf pitcher in Major League Baseball and was regarded, along with Dummy Hoy, {{as a role model}} and hero in the American deaf community in the early 20th century.

He was also known as the comedian of the Giants teams, waving a lit lantern when <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> refused <b>to</b> call <b>a</b> game due to darkness and coaching at third base in rubber boots when <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> refused <b>to</b> call <b>a</b> game due to rain.|$|R

50|$|Finally, it was {{testified that}} it was common {{practice}} (although not necessarily explicit in the rules) for <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> <b>to</b> confirm that the timekeepers are ready by holding the ball above his head, {{and waiting for the}} timekeepers to sound the siren - after which he blows the opening whistle, followed by executing the opening bounce.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese archer Zhang Juanjuan {{defeated}} South Korean Park Sung-Hyun by {{a margin}} of 1 point, ending the Koreans' dominance in the women's individual archery event, which dated back to the 1984 Summer Olympics due to raucous Chinese crowds who visibly rattled the Korean by the conditions which made headlines in Korea for the unfair event organization.

5000|$|St Mark's' first (recorded) opponents {{were another}} church team {{representing}} the Baptist church in Macclesfield, with the score finishing 2-1 to the visitors.

Additionally, each fielded a 13th player as [...] "umpire", {{the rules of}} football dictating then that each team nominate <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> <b>to</b> command half of the pitch, holding a flag which he raised if he agreed with any player protest, the referee standing on the touchline as final arbiter and timekeeper. As befitted football pitches of the time, the goalposts were flimsy wooden posts with the crossbar being simply a tape tied between the posts.|$|E

5000|$|In {{modern times}} {{a home run}} is most often scored when the ball is hit over the outfield wall between the foul poles (in fair territory) before it touches the ground (in flight), and without being caught or {{deflected}} back onto the field by a fielder. A batted ball is also a home run if it touches either foul pole or its attached screen before touching the ground, as the foul poles are by definition in fair territory. Additionally, many major-league ballparks have ground rules stating that a batted ball in flight that strikes a specified location or fixed object is a home run; this usually applies to objects that are beyond the outfield wall but are located such {{that it may be}} difficult for <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> <b>to</b> judge.|$|E

50|$|High School umpires are {{part-time}} umpires; {{most have}} {{other forms of}} employment. <b>A</b> high school <b>umpire</b> has <b>to</b> go to clinics and rules meetings before becoming <b>an</b> <b>umpire.</b> <b>A</b> person trying <b>to</b> become <b>a</b> high school <b>umpire</b> has <b>to</b> register with their respective state. When they register with the state they receive a rulebook, a casebook and <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> manual. After reading through the rulebooks the umpires meet at clinics and rules meetings to discuss rules and mechanics. Clinics and rules meetings are crucial in <b>an</b> <b>umpire's</b> development. Once <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> has gone <b>to</b> clinics and rules meetings they then start <b>to</b> <b>umpire</b> scrimmages. In <b>a</b> scrimmage <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> gets hands on training for the first time. Scrimmages are where young umpires can learn from veteran <b>umpires.</b> After going <b>to</b> clinics and <b>umpiring</b> in scrimmages the <b>umpire</b> then has <b>to</b> take a rule exam. The umpire must pass the exam in order <b>to</b> <b>umpire</b> during the season. Once the umpire has passed the exam he/she is now ready <b>to</b> <b>umpire</b> high school level ballgames.|$|R
