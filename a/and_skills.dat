40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study <b>skill</b> learning <b>and</b> the meaning of the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects in Finnish comprehensive school. During the last decade, there have been many discussions in the media about the position of the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects in our school system and the curriculum. The beginning, the idea, of this study can be located in 2003, when we educators {{were in the middle of}} designing the new curriculum for the year 2004. In that curriculum the amount of the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects was decreasing, because the amount of the optional subjects decreased from 20 to 13. Many teachers asked: why was that happening? They had a feeling, that the direction was not right. I was also reasoning this matter and asking myself: what is the meaning of the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects in our educational system? In this research the aim is to point out, that it isnƘt waste of time to have art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects in school. I claim that “the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects are important, because it is possible to affirm selfhood with them. Also our brain functions <b>and</b> motor <b>skills</b> are developing. The learning process becomes more effective through the interaction and the creative thinking”. The research questions are: How do the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects affirm selfhood? How the hands on approach and action are affecting to oneƘs brain development <b>and</b> motor <b>skills</b> learning? How the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects are contributing the learning and creativity development? This research is interdisciplinary: phenomenological philosophy, cognitive neuroscience and pedagogy are the main aspects in the research. Edmund Husserl's eidetic reduction has been used as a research method. Based on that method the Architecture of Skill Learning -figure has been constructed during the research process. As a result of the analysis, the claim is strengthened during the process by interviewing pupils (N 50), art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> teachers (N 30) and an artist and also analysing the research literature. In the end of the research there is reasoned, how the 21 st century skills are adopted through the art <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> subjects...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of learning models on the knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect viewed from adversity quotient (AQ). The learning models compared were learning model of the Numbered Heads Together (NHT) with scientific approach, Pairs Check (PC) with scientific approach, and classical with scientific approach. This research was a quasi-experimental research. The population of the research was all of the eighth grade students of the State Junior High School in Sukoharjo. The instruments used to collect data were mathematics knowledge aspect test, mathematics <b>skill</b> aspect test <b>and</b> adversity quotient questionnaire. Technique of analyzing data that used was unbalanced two ways multivariat analysis of variance. From the research, it can be concluded that: (1) learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using classical learning with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach gave better knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than learning by using classical learning with scientific approach, (2) students who have adversity quotient of Climber gave better knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than students who have adversity quotient of Camper and Quitter, students who have adversity quotient of Camper gave the same knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with the students who have adversity quotient of Quitter, (3) on each learning model, students who have adversity quotient of Climber gave better knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than students who have adversity quotient of Camper and Quitter, students who have adversity quotient of Camper gave the same knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with the students who have adversity quotient of Quitter, (4) on each adversity quotient, learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using classical learning with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach gave better knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than learning by using classical learning with scientific approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{life style}} is formed and {{stabilized}} in adolescence. Since consumption {{of fruits and}} vegetables may affect the risk of chronic diseases, their low consumption during adolescence is very important. Knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> is considered as one of the main determinants of this behavior. This study aimed to investigate the Knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> of proper consumption of fruit and vegetables among adolescent girls in Shahrekord, Iran. Materials and Methods: This study was a descriptive-analytic investigation conducted on high school girls in Shahrekord city during 2013 to 2014. 308 female students were selected randomly from 8 high schools and a researcher made questionnaire was used to collect the demographic, Knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> related data. Validity and reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated by internal consistency method (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 70, Cronbach's alpha= 0. 76), respectively. The collected data was analyzed by SPSS- 21 software. Results: The mean age of students was 13. 86 ± 1. 3 years. There was no statistically significant association between consumption of fruit and vegetables and fathers' education level, mothers' job and parents' age. However, there was a significant association between fathers' job <b>and</b> adolescents' <b>skill</b> of fruit <b>and</b> vegetables consumption (P < 0. 05). In addition, a significant association between mothers' education level and adolescents' knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> of fruit <b>and</b> vegetables consumption was observed (P < 0. 05). There was a significant direct association between knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> (P= 0. 01 and r= 082), so that adolescents with more knowledge, had a better skill as well. Conclusion: Considering the adolescents' low knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> in proper consumption of fruit and vegetables and also the direct association between knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill,</b> it seems necessary to implement educational programs according to the health education and promotion theories and models, with contribution of parents and school personnel, to improve the knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> empower adolescent girls in consumption of fruit and vegetables...|$|R
