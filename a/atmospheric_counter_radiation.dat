Study with 9 -week-old inbred male Swiss albino Strain ‘A’ mice demonstrated that SBL- 1 treatment before 60 Co-gamma-irradiation (10 [*]Gy) significantly (p< 0. 05) <b>countered</b> <b>radiation</b> induced decreases in jejunum crypts (1. 27 -fold), villi number (1. 41 -fold), villus height (1. 25 -fold), villus cellularity (2. 27 -fold), cryptal Paneth cells (1. 89 -fold), and Bcl 2 level (1. 54 -fold).

The ability to realize earth observation using small satellites enables cost-efficient earth observation. To do this, improvements are inevitable for highperformance image processing units. We developed a highperformance image processing system for earth observation, HP-IMAP-EO, using commercial off-the-shelf technologies. To achieve good reliability against radiation effects, an autonomous hierarchical monitoring system is introduced. We planned to install HP-IMAP-EO on three satellites, TSUBAME, ChubuSat, and Hodoyoshi- 3, which are scheduled for launch in 2014. In this paper, we introduce the outline of HP-IMAP-EO and the strategy used to achieve high reliability to <b>counter</b> <b>radiation</b> effects...|$|R

This study investigated effects of our preparation from leaves of H. rhamnoides (code SBL- 1), on modification of immunosuppression and inflammation in whole body irradiated (10 Gy) mice. One time treatment with SBL- 1 before irradiation prevented the radiation induced (i) decrease in immunoglobulin G, (ii) early release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) protein, (iii) increase in tumour necrosis factor-α, myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation, (iv) liver haemorrhage, stomach enlargement, spleen shrinkage, intestinal oedema and hair fall, (v) decrease in thiols and ferric reducing ability of plasma. HMGB 1, a known therapeutic target, has roles in inflammatory diseases, tissue repair and immunomodulation.
