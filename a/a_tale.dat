However, these research groups differed in their interpretation of the results. <b>A.</b> <b>Tales,</b> J. L. Muir, A. Bayer, R. Jones, and R. J. Snowden (2002) and <b>A.</b> <b>Tales,</b> J. L. Muir, A. Bayer, and R. J. Snowden (2002) explained their data in terms of two independent processes, whereas E. Festa-Martino et al. (2004) interpreted their findings as indicative of an inverse association, namely that the increased spatial orienting effect in AD was {{the direct result of}} the abolition of the phasic alerting effect. In this further study examining exogenous spatial orienting and phasic alerting, the authors present evidence to suggest that the increased spatial orienting effect in AD is not the result of a decreased phasic alerting effect...|$|R
