The {{reason for this is that}} high voltage transmission towers visually impacts the surroundings and require a large servitude in order to accommodate these structures. The requirements for low visible towers with small foundation footprints may be achieved with double circuit power line towers. However, the structural loading in tower member's increase drastically as a result of large conductor bundles, higher reliability, smaller foundation footprints and a increase in wind loading because of the taller structures. This limits the further economical use of standard angular hot rolled sections and requires that alternative cross sections are considered in the design of power line towers. The aim of this research is to focus on the practical and cost-e ective implementation of circular hollow sections (CHS) in power line towers. The design of a power line system consist of a family of tower structures which include a large number of structural and non-structural members as well as many connections resisting various combinations of loads. The outcome of this research proves that a feasible and practical way exist to implement circular hollow sections in power line tower design using current design software, current design standards and current manufacturing techniques for South African conditions. It is recommended that connections between tower elements should be similar to existing connection practices where possible. This will reduce the requirements for specialized software or connection standards. This will also facilitate the design of hybrid tubular and <b>angular</b> <b>member</b> towers. Hence a review of current <b>angular</b> <b>member</b> and connection design practices are given for the reader. Before the design of a tubular power line tower may be done, various hollow section connections and stability criteria are reviewed. The CIDECT manuals provide an excellent resource for hollow section connections for static and dynamic conditions. It is important to note that it is not the intention of the author to question or improve on the existing hollow section design formulae, but rather to show their ease of implementation in the power line industry. A tubular tower was designed and fabricated in order to combine the theory and practical implementation thereof. In the design of this test tower, the author introduced a novel cross arm design. The new con guration cross arm has only three main chords compared with the conventional cross arm with four main chords. It is envisaged that this new cross arm con guration will reduce overall tower cost as well as construction cost. An analytical and numerical structural analysis was used to design the test tower. An isolated analysis was also performed on the tower cross arm in order to compare and validate the use of less expensive structural software. The comparison considered a full nite element analysis (ANSYS) compared with a beam element analysis (Prokon). The results show that there is an excellent correlation between the two models given that speci c, yet simple modeling techniques are used to model the tower elements. In order to conclude the validity of the recommended design approach and the integrity of the test structure, physical testing was done at the Eskom tower test facility. The structure was securely xed to the base of the test bed and strain gauges were tted on several of the tower members. Steel wire ropes with load cells were tted to the cross arms of the structure and three typical load cases were evaluated. Comparing the physical test results with the Prokon model, a 10 % variation between member loads were recorded. The loads in the test tower was in most cases higher compared with the Prokon model. In summary, the design process proposed here may successfully be used to design and manufacture CHS power line towers. The design process uses current design software, current design standards and current manufacturing techniques. Further investigation on full scale structures are required in order to study the economics of tubular towers versus <b>angular</b> <b>member</b> towers. This study should include fabricators and construction experts in order to comprehend the impact on the power-line industry. The author suspects that the fabrication cost of CHS towers will be slightly higher but the construction cost will be signi cantly less. Master...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the use of guided {{ultrasonic}} waves (GUWs) for the health monitoring of engineering structures increased rapidly, with the most recent studies focusing on the application of GUWs to complex structures or under varying environmental conditions. In fact, the health monitoring of complex structures is complicated because of reflections, scattering, and mode conversion. In addition, sensitivity to temperature and surface wetting can degrade the performance of a GUW-based structural health monitoring system. This thesis presents the results of an experimental investigation where GUWs and the Electro-mechanical Impedance (EMI) method were used for the health monitoring of a truss, which was part of a highway variable message structure removed from service and tested in laboratory. The monitoring strategy proposed here combines the advantages of GUWs and EMI with the extraction of defect-sensitive features to perform a multivariate diagnosis of damage. The effectiveness of the presented approach is tested by monitoring the propagation of waves along one of the main chords of the truss and by observing the onset and growth of two artificial cracks. The ability to diagnose the presence of these defects located around the welds that join two diagonal <b>angular</b> <b>members</b> to the chord is discussed. In the last portion of the thesis, the results from field application are presented. Two overhead sign support structures deployed along I- 279 were monitored by using the proposed SHM methodology developed in laboratory...|$|R
40|$|This report, {{which is}} a {{continuation}} of another appearing in Construction Report no. 272 (July 1975), studies the stress performance of reinforced concrete columns in insulated floors, usíng four different procedures: &# 13; — Two of the reinforcement methods presently used are an improvement over those previously used in the other report. They consist of increasing the croas section with concrete which penetrates in grooves made in the original concrete or by backing the steel angles to the columns edges with <b>angular</b> <b>members</b> against the forging, but obtaining the best possible fitting between the concrete and steel by using resins. &# 13; — The other two methods are new in our experiments. They consist in creating an outer liner of concrete with binder framework and in the metal solution by going through the column with the double T which transfers part of the load directy to the two strongest clips. Este trabajo, que es continuación de otro aparecido en INFORMES DE LA CONSTRUCCIÓN, número 272 (julio 1975), estudia el comportamiento resistente de pilares de hormigón armado reforzados en pisos aislados, por otros cuatro procedimientos diferentes: &# 13; — Dos de los métodos de refuerzo actualmente utilizados son una mejora de los empleados en el trabajo anterior. Consisten en el recrecido de la sección transversal con hormigón que penetra en cajeras practicadas en el hormigón original o adosado de angulares de acero a las aristas del pilar con capitel de angulares contra el forjado, pero procurando el mejor ajuste entre hormigón y acero mediante resinas. &# 13; — Los otros dos métodos son nuevos en nuestra experimentación. Consisten en crear una camisa exterior de hormigón con armadura de zuncho y en la solución metálica en atravesar el pilar con una doble T que transfiera parte de la carga directamente a dos presillas más robustas y, por tanto, dar menos importancia a la transmisión de esfuerzos por ei capitel que siempre es algo flexible...|$|R
50|$|All FMC {{diagrams}} are {{bipartite graph}}s. Each bipartite graph {{consists of two}} disjoint sets of vertices with the condition that no vertex is connected to another vertex of the same set. In FMC diagrams, members of one set are represented by <b>angular</b> shapes, and <b>members</b> of the other set are represented by curved shapes. Each element in an FMC diagram can be refined by another diagram of the same type, provided that the combined graph is also bipartite. This mechanism allows modeling all relevant layers of abstraction with the same notation.|$|R
50|$|The {{dwelling}} is asymmetrical in form, with a steeply pitched roof, {{from which}} wide gables {{project on the}} main elevation and {{on the eastern side}} of the building. A corner bay window is carried through into the main roof and is expressed as a chamfered hip. Two tall brick chimneys protrude through the corrugated iron roof and the main section of the roof is capped with cast-iron ridge decoration. A short set of unbalustraded stairs leads to a wide verandah that wraps around to the northern elevation. The verandah is edged with a three-rail dowel balustrade and has a bullnose roof stepped-down from the main roof. The verandah porch is decorated with <b>angular</b> timber <b>members</b> in a pattern of triangles. This stick-style detailing is repeated on the main gable, which is decorated with an angular pattern of timbers which are held by brackets from the gable and barge boards. Under the gable is a bay window with a curved awning which is supported on large decorative timber brackets.|$|R

A typical electro-rheological,fluid is characterized over a range of engineering conditions and is found to usefully approximate to a continuum of Bingham plastic form.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic pressure {{effects of a}} long duration blast load on small-diameter circular and <b>angular</b> structural steel <b>members</b> for a Mach stem region where a shock wave travels at near the speed of sound. In complicated flow fields, where fully coupled analyses are not reasonably practicable, the correct application of translational drag loads is vital. The variability in drag coefficient {{for members of the}} same shape can differ greatly owing to stagnation of the flow and the level of flow field obstruction. To investigate this effect, this paper details a simplified experimental trial conducted in the world’s most powerful blast tunnel, the US large-blast thermal simulator at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. Four assemblies were examined based upon hollow steel sections mounted at different angles and positions. The experiment indicated a drop in drag coefficient for shielded circular members in close proximity of approximately 40 %. The drag force on unshielded sections was lower in magnitude than initially expected; this was attributed to an absence of flow stagnation and reduced boundary layer effects. Comparative square and angled sections displayed approximately 50 % higher values than circular member...|$|R
