500|$|Gray {{wanted the}} film to be as {{realistic}} as possible; accordingly, the actors did most of their own stunts, and computer-generated imagery was used very sparingly. The second unit, under director Alexander Witt and cinematographer Josh Bleibtreu, filmed establishing shots, the Venice canal chase sequence, and the Los Angeles chase sequence {{over a period of}} 40 days. Filming on location posed some challenges. The opening heist sequence in Venice, Italy, was strictly monitored by the local authorities, due to the high speeds the boats were driven at. The frigid temperatures at Passo Fedaia in the Italian Alps created problems during production: [...] "The guns would jam, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> imagine not being able to walk 40 feet with a bottle of water without it freezing, those are the conditions we had to work in," [...] Gray remarked. Pedestrians had to be allowed to use the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard between takes. Also, scenes which took place on freeways and city streets were only filmed on weekends.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} Radiohead met while {{attending}} Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood {{were in the}} same year, guitarist Ed O'Brien and drummer Phil Selway the year above, and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin, two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became the lead guitarist; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and Yorke's brother Andy Yorke. According to Colin, the band members picked their respective instruments because they wanted to play music together, rather than through an interest in the particular instrument: [...] "It was more of a collective angle, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool." [...] At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.|$|E
500|$|The writer David Kimbell {{states that}} in Luisa Miller and Stiffelio (the {{earliest}} operas of this period) {{there appears to}} be a [...] "growing freedom in the large scale structure...and an acute attention to fine detail." [...] Others echo those feelings. Julian Budden expresses the impact of Rigoletto and its place in Verdi's output as follows: [...] "Just after 1850 at the age of 38, Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with Rigoletto. The so-called ottocento in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit." [...] One example of Verdi's wish to move away from [...] "standard forms" [...] appears in his feelings about the structure of Il trovatore. To his librettist, Cammarano, Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 that if there were no standard forms—"cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. ... <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> avoid beginning with an opening chorus....", he would be quite happy.|$|E

500|$|The {{race was}} met by anti-Trump protests in the first-stage {{finishing}} town of New Paltz, New York, where demonstrators held placards reading [...] "Fight Trumpism", [...] "Die Yuppie $cum", [...] "The Art of the Deal = The Rich Get Richer" [...] and [...] "Trump = Lord of the Flies". The 1989 race was won by the Norwegian rider Dag Otto Lauritzen of the American team 7-Eleven, although there was some controversy about the result as Belgian rider Eric Vanderaerden, who had won four stages and was expected {{to take the lead}} in the general classification in the final stage time trial in Atlantic City but took a wrong turn following a race motorbike. The Soviet rider Viatcheslav Ekimov, who took part as an amateur, won the first stage of the race (following a prologue time trial). Articles published the following year reported that Ekimov [...] "had had the nerve to win a stage as an amateur... and some pros reportedly rewarded him by jamming a feed bag into his wheel", and that he [...] "threatened to win the Tour de Trump last year as an amateur before the pros banded together to eliminate any chance he had of winning". Nonetheless, the first edition of the race was described as [...] "a smashing success" [...] in Sports Illustrated, which noted: [...] "If you could get past the name, the Tour de Trump, without losing your lunch, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> somehow divorce the sporting event from the excess baggage that went with it... what you had was a pretty nice bicycle race".|$|E
2500|$|Verdi also plainly {{states that}} if there were no {{standard}} forms – [...] "cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. [...] <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> avoid beginning with an opening chorus...." [...] he would be quite happy. Correspondence continued between the two men for the following two months or so, including another letter from the composer of 9 April which included three pages of suggestions. But he also made concessions and expresses his happiness in what he is receiving in the way of verse.|$|E
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments {{because we wanted to}} play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of a}} collective angle, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t think of myself as a bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E

2500|$|One {{turning point}} {{occurred}} when Fred Wang {{was head of}} R On October 4, 1983, Wang Laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products, and promised dates of delivery. The announcement was well received, but even at the time there were warning signs. According to Datamation, Wang announced [...] ". <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too." [...] Very few of the products were close to completion {{and many of them}} had not even been started. All were delivered late and some were never delivered at all. In retrospect this was referred to as the [...] "vaporware announcement" [...] and it hurt the credibility of Fred Wang and Wang Laboratories.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred {{opposite}} Edward G. Robinson in {{the gangster}} farce The Whole Town's Talking, also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise. It {{was the first}} time Arthur portrayed a hard-boiled working girl with a heart of gold, the type of role she would be associated with {{for the rest of her}} career. She enjoyed the acting experience and working opposite Robinson, who remarked in his biography that it was a [...] "delight to work with and know" [...] Arthur. By the time of the film's release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and would mostly stay that way. She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her best side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director Frank Capra recalled producer Harry Cohn's description of Jean Arthur's imbalanced profile: [...] "half of it's angel, and the other half horse." [...] Her next few films, Party Wire (1935), Public Hero No. 1 (1935) <b>and</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> Only Cook (1935), did not match the success of The Whole Town's Talking, but they all brought the actress positive reviews. In his review for The New York Times, critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur's performance in Public Hero No. 1, writing that she [...] "is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as Joseph Calleia is in his own department." [...] Another critic wrote of her performance in If You Could Only Cook that [...] " [...] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic." [...] With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several contractual concessions from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.|$|E
