Disney Channel publicity officials quickly took action, apologizing to Lovato and removing the episodes from the network's broadcast and video on demand sources after additional criticism (following Lovato's post) on the network's public-relations account.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} in Kirkuk received {{large numbers of}} patients with symptoms that doctors recognised from the 1960 outbreak. The first case of alkylmercury poisoning was admitted to hospital on 21 December. By 26 December, the hospital had issued a specific warning to the government. By January 1972, the government had started to strongly warn the populace <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> the grain, although dispatches {{did not mention the}} large numbers already ill. The Iraqi Army soon ordered disposal of the grain and eventually declared the death penalty for anyone found selling it. Farmers dumped their supplies wherever possible, and it soon got into the water supply (particularly the River Tigris), causing further problems. The government issued a news blackout and released little information about the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|Eating {{disorders}} are less reported in preindustrial, non-westernized countries than in Western countries. In Africa, not including South Africa, the only data presenting information <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> disorders occurs in case reports and isolated studies, not studies investigating prevalence. Data shows in research that in westernized civilizations, ethnic minorities have very similar rates of eating disorders, {{contrary to the}} belief that eating disorders predominantly occur in Caucasian people.|$|E

25|$|Cannibalism {{has been}} {{occasionally}} practiced {{as a last}} resort by people suffering from famine, including in modern times. Famous examples include the ill-fated Westward expedition of the Donner Party (1846–47) and, more recently, the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 (1972), after which some survivors ate the bodies of dead passengers. Also, some mentally ill people obsess <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> others and actually do so, such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish.

[...] Biller [...] reacted to the plot with the thought: [...] "a show <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> and sex — these are things I know a lot about…" [...] Biller {{explained}} in a later interview that he fought for Neelix and Kes to already be living together and having sex when drafting the teleplay, but he was shot down by Taylor and Rick Berman out of concern for Kes' young age {{and that it would be}} more interesting to show the couple grappling with this for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Writer Bill Oakley {{suggested}} the episode's barbecue scenes. Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> meat, but Oakley told Cohen {{that the story}} needed something more specific {{to serve as the}} basis of Homer and Lisa's dispute. George Meyer, a writer known among the staff for his [...] "bizarre physical jokes", contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and flying into the air. Cohen credits writer John Swartzwelder for inspiring the scene in which Homer finds it impossible to believe that bacon, ham, and pork chops could possibly come from the same animal. [...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was going on and on about how amazing the pig is for the variety of cuts of meat that come from it.|$|E

500|$|The Fairchild Family {{continued}} to be a bestseller despite the increasingly popular Wordsworthian image of childhood innocence and the sentimental picture of childhood presented in novels such as Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist (1837–39). One scholar has suggested that it [...] "influenced Dickens's depictions of Pip's fears of the convict, the gibbet, and 'the horrible young man' at the close of Chapter 1" [...] in Great Expectations (1860–61). Children's literature scholar Gillian Avery has argued that The Fairchild Family was [...] "as much a part of English childhood as Alice was later to become." [...] As late as the 1900s, Lord Frederic Hamilton states that he attended a party at which each guest dressed up as a character from the book. Although the book was popular, some scraps of evidence have survived suggesting that readers did not always interpret it as Sherwood would have wanted. Lord Hamilton writes, for instance, that [...] "there was plenty <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> and drinking; one could always skip the prayers, and there were three or four very brightly written accounts of funerals in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{disliked the}} focus the episode {{placed on the}} adult characters, with many objecting to Will's characterisation. VanDerWerff wrote that his storyline with Emma [...] "misplac what made either of the characters enjoyable in the first place", and IGN's Robert Canning—who otherwise enjoyed the episode, and rated it 8.5/10—observed that Will was presented as being selfish and a [...] "terrible educator", in contrast to his former role as the moral centre of the show. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post initially found {{the focus on the}} adults a welcome change, but felt their storyline rapidly became convoluted. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News liked Will less as the episode progressed, and deemed it overall, [...] "Creepy, vaguely uncomfortable, in slightly poor taste but well-intentioned, and ultimately, thoroughly entertaining to watch for reasons I can't quite put into words." [...] CNN's Lisa Respers France actually enjoyed the episode for the additional depth it brought to Will and his feelings for Emma, as well as Finn and his body image issues. While Stack commended the male body image storyline, and found it refreshing for a program to examine the objectification of men, de Moraes derided it, and likened Finn and Sam's discussion <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> healthily and working out to an [...] "after school special".|$|E

The city's Music and Entertainment {{division}} had initially denied permission to Gaga for playing inside the venue citing {{that it was}} for [...] "public safety concerns". Don Pitts from the division said that the venue being in close proximity with a parking lot was the reason they had to cancel Gaga's application. On March 6, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Gaga would indeed play at the venue. Tickets were sold to the fans through different competitions and challenges. Randal Lane from Forbes reported that the concert would support Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and charity events, but nevertheless opined that [...] "the way they're doling out the tickets is still crass". The concert was criticized when artist Millie Brown vomited a green liquid over Gaga during the performance of [...] "Swine" [...] from Artpop. The performance received complaints about [...] "glamorizing" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News: [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> disorders themselves."

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the adolescents’ knowledge and perceptions of healthy and unhealthy eating. It is a qualitative cross section study with 83 adolescents of both genders between 10 and 16 years old enrolled in a public school in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The participants answered two discursive questions that assessed their knowledge and perception of their actual diet. These questions were later analyzed by a qualitative technique, “Discourse of Collective Subject” based on the Theory of Social Representations. Overall, the youth presented an adequate knowledge <b>about</b> healthy <b>eating.</b> <b>About</b> half (52. 6 %) reported a balanced and varied diet; and 56. 3 % considered their actual diet as being healthy. Adolescents’ knowledge <b>about</b> healthy <b>eating</b> isn’t the only determinant for their food choices; and so traditional nutritional interventions focusing on concepts <b>about</b> healthy <b>eating</b> should be modified, aiming at behavioral changes...|$|R

Charlotte Yonge (1823–1901), a critic who also wrote children's literature, praised [...] "the gusto with which [...] dwells on new dolls" [...] and [...] "the absolutely sensational naughtiness" [...] of the children. Most twentieth-century critics, including George Orwell, who called it [...] "an evil book", have condemned the book's harshness, pointing to the Fairchilds' moral-filled visit to a gibbet with a rotting corpse swinging from it; but Cutt and others argue that the positive depiction of the nuclear family in the text, particularly Sherwood's emphasis on parents' responsibility to educate their own children, was an important part of the book's appeal. She argues that Sherwood's [...] "influence," [...] via books such as the Fairchild Family, [...] "upon the domestic pattern of Victorian life can hardly be overestimated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Margaret Atwood has {{repeatedly}} made observations about our relationships to animals in her works. In Surfacing, one character remarks <b>about</b> <b>eating</b> animals: [...] "The animals die {{that we may}} live, they are substitute people...And we eat them, out of cans or otherwise; we are eaters of death, dead Christ-flesh resurrecting inside us, granting us life." [...] Some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat-eating and consequently give up meat-eating. In The Edible Woman, Atwood's character Marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fiancé's experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit. Marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it.|$|E
