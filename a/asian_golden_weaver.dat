50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>weaver</b> (Ploceus hypoxanthus) is {{a species}} of bird in the Ploceidae family.It is found in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, swamps, and arable land.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|U Minh Thuong National Park {{is widely}} {{considered}} the richest region of the Mekong delta in terms {{of plant and animal}} biodiversity. It boasts of over 243 plant species. The park has a rich and varied mammalian population, totaling an impressive 32 species, including hairy-nosed otters and fishing cats. U Minh Thuong National Park is a haven for rare and endangered birds. A total of 187 species of birds has been recorded here, including the oriental darter, spot-billed pelican, black-headed ibis, glossy ibis, greater spotted eagle and <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>weaver.</b> There are also a total of 39 amphibian species and 34 species of fish in the park.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat {{is similar}} to the bay cat of Borneo in both {{appearance}} and behavior. Genetic studies revealed that the two species are closely related. The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat is found in Sumatra and Malaysia, which separated from Borneo only about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. These observations led to the belief that the Borneo bay cat is an insular subspecies of the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat. Genetic analysis has shown that the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat, along with the bay cat and the marbled cat, diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago, and that the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat and bay cat diverged as long as four million years ago, suggesting that the bay cat was a different species long before the isolation of Borneo. Because of the evident close relationship with the marbled cat, it has recently been suggested that all three species should be grouped in the genus Pardofelis.|$|R
25|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cats {{can climb}} trees when necessary. They hunt birds, hares, rodents, reptiles, and small {{ungulates}} such as muntjacs and young sambar deer. They {{are capable of}} bringing down prey much larger than themselves, such as domestic water buffalo calves.

40|$|Background. The bay cat Catopuma badia is {{endemic to}} Borneo, whereas its sister species the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat Catopuma temminckii is {{distributed}} from the Himalayas and southern China through Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. Based onmorphological data, {{up to five}} subspecies of the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat have been recognized, but a taxonomic assessment, including molecular data and morphological characters, is still lacking. Results. We combined molecular data (whole mitochondrial genomes), morphological data (pelage) and species distribution projections (up to the Late Pleistocene) to infer how environmental changes may have influenced the distribution of these sister species over the past 120 000 years. The molecular analysis was based on sequenced mitogenomes of 3 bay cats and 40 <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cats derived mainly from archival samples. Our molecular data suggested a time of split between the two species approximately 3. 16 Ma and revealed very low nucleotide diversity within the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat population, which supports recent expansion of the population. Discussion. The low nucleotide diversity suggested a population bottleneck in the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat, possibly caused by the eruption of the Toba volcano in Northern Sumatra (approx. 74 kya), followed by a continuous population expansion in the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene. Species distribution projections, {{the reconstruction of the}} demographic history, a genetic isolation-by-distance pattern and a gradual variation of pelage pattern support the hypothesis of a post-Toba population expansion of the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat from south China/Indochina to PeninsularMalaysia and Sumatra. Our findings reject the current classification of five subspecies for the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat, but instead support either a monotypic species or one comprising two subspecies: (i) the Sunda golden cat, distributed south of the Isthmus of Kra: C. t. temminckii and (ii) Indochinese, Indian, Himalayan and Chinese golden cats, occurring north of the Isthmus: C. t. moormensis...|$|R

The pair in the German Wuppertal Zoo successfully bred in 2007, and in July 2008, two siblings were born and mother-reared. In 2008, a female kitten was also born in the French Parc des Félins.

50|$|Smaller cats in China {{include the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat, Chinese {{mountain}} cat, jungle cat, wildcat, Pallas's cat, marbled cat, leopard cat, fishing cat, and Eurasian lynx. Of these, the Chinese mountain cat is endemic to Sichuan, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shaanxi. Several smaller cat species including the leopard cat and lynx are hunted or trapped for their fur. The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat is hunted for its bones, {{which are used}} {{as a substitute for}} tiger and leopard bones in traditional Chinese medicine.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} park is home for {{other kinds of}} big, medium, and small cats, clouded leopard/macan dahan (Neofelis nebulosa), marbled cat/kucing batu (Pardofelis marmorata), leopard cat/kucing hutan (Prionailurus bengalensis), and <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat/kucing emas (Catopuma temminckii). The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cats can be found everywhere in the {{national park}}, as they adapt well to various kinds of habitat, both forested and open spaces.

25|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> {{cats are}} poached mainly for their fur. In Myanmar, 111 body parts {{from at least}} 110 {{individuals}} were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006. Numbers were significantly greater than those of non-threatened species. Among the observed skins was a specimen with ocelot-like rosettes — a rare tristis form. Three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with China and Thailand and cater to international buyers, although the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat is completely protected under Myanmar's national legislation. Effective implementation and enforcement of CITES is considered inadequate.|$|R

2500|$|In {{some regions}} of Thailand, the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat is called Seua fai ( [...] ; [...] "fire tiger"). According to a {{regional}} legend, {{the burning of}} an <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat's fur drives tigers away. Eating the flesh {{is believed to have}} the same effect. The Karen people believe that simply carrying a single hair of the cat is sufficient. Many indigenous people believe the cat to be fierce, but in captivity it has been known to be docile and tranquil. In the south, it's called Kang kude (คางคูด). It's believed to be a fierce animal. It can hurt or eat the livestock of the villagers and can also hurt larger animals such as elephants.|$|R
