40|$|Cadbury showed {{concern for}} the welfare of its labour force {{in a variety of ways}} and not least in the {{provision}} of educational and educative-recreational facilities. The firm regarded the education of employees as having a positive effect on the efficiency of the business at the same time as being of benefit to the individual, the local community and the nation. The life-long education of people was seen as essential for personal fulfilament, social improvement, economic competitiveness and the proper functioning of democratic procedures. The educational system built up at Cadbury, and the philosophy on which it was founded, acquired both a domestic and international reputation. Its main components were the day <b>continuation</b> <b>education</b> of juniors; the Bournville Works Evening Institute; vocational and non-vocational scholarships; emphasis on the primary importance of general education as a basis for life, work and technical training; stress on equality of educational opportunity for females; and leisure and sporting amenities which the firm felt to be educative in the sense that they contributed to personal psychological and physical development and social skills. The system was primarily shaped and constructed in the first three decades of the twentieth century and went into decline and eventual demise in the 1960 's and 1970 's as a result of economic pressures, social changes, enhanced state arrangements for education, shifts in Cadbury management thinking and the merger with Schweppes in 1969...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose one {{possible}} explanation of the interrelationships between <b>education</b> <b>continuation</b> or avoidance, satisfaction level, and experience (entrepreneurial maturity) of potential and practicing entrepreneurs. By using the cusp catastrophe model we propose that relationship between <b>education</b> satisfaction and <b>continuation</b> tends to be linear for less experienced entrepreneurs (pre-entrepreneurs), whereas for more experienced entrepreneurs the relationship is proposed to be positive but non-linear (s-shaped). Data were collected with a structured questionnaire from 122 participants in management and entrepreneurship education and training programs. The proposed model was tested with linear and non-linear regression equations. The relationship between satisfaction and continuation (loyalty) {{was found to be}} positive for all entrepreneurial and nonentrepreneurial groups. The appropriate functional form for the satisfaction-continuation relationship discovered for non-entrepreneurs and people that are only thinking about entrepreneurship (maybe-entrepreneurs) is close to linear and less steep than for more entrepreneurial groups. By contrast, prospective entrepreneurs (people in the process of pre-start up) and practicing entrepreneurs tend to be more sensitive to their education satisfaction in their future <b>education</b> <b>continuation</b> decisions. The appropriate functional form for these entrepreneurial groups tends to be cubical, which is close to the s-shaped function proposed in the cusp model. The study provided evidence that the relationships between entrepreneurial maturity, education satisfaction and <b>education</b> <b>continuation</b> may be modeled as a cusp catastrophe model. The proposed model can be helpful for education and for training providers (and marketers) in explaining and predicting of education loyalty or the switching behavior of entrepreneurs...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the healthiest}} {{behaviors}} displayed by resilient {{families in the}} wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The <b>continuation</b> of <b>education</b> and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.|$|R
