50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>switches</b> proliferated in {{independent}} telephone {{companies in the}} 1910s and 1920s, well before the Bell System started deployment of Panel switch technology in the 1920s. In 1919 the Bell System was impacted considerably by organized operator strikes and the leadership abandoned its rejection of automatic switching equipment. As a result, Automatic Electric became a long-term supplier of step-by-step switching equipment to the Bell System.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} phone {{phreaking}} trace {{back at least}} to AT&T's implementation of fully <b>automatic</b> <b>switches.</b> These switches used tone dialing, a form of in-band signaling, and included some tones which were for internal telephone company use. One internal-use tone was a tone of 2600 Hz which caused a telephone switch to think the call had ended, leaving an open carrier line, which could be exploited to provide free long-distance, and international, calls. At that time, long-distance calls were quite expensive.|$|E

In modern applications, <b>automatic</b> <b>switches</b> (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a snap action mechanism which opens the switch contacts rapidly, and feature an arc chute where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.|$|E

40|$|Adequate {{forecasting}} {{and early}} warning systems {{are based upon}} observations of human behavior, population, disease time-series, climate, environment, and/or a combination thereof, whichever option best compromises among realism, feasibility, robustness, and parsimony. Fully automatic and user-friendly state–space forecasting frameworks, incorporating myriad options (e. g., expert opinion, univariate, multivariate, and spatial-temporal), could considerably enhance disease control and hazard mitigation efforts in regions where vulnerability to neglected tropical diseases is pervasive and statistical expertise is scarce. The operational simplicity, generality, and flexibility of state–space frameworks, encapsulating multiple methods, could conveniently allow for 1) unsupervised model selection without disease-specific methodological tailoring, 2) on-line adaptation to disease time-series fluctuations, and 3) <b>automatic</b> <b>switches</b> between distinct forecasting methods as new time-series perturbations dictate. In this investigation, a univariate state–space framework with the aforementioned properties was successfully applied to the Schistosoma haematobium time-series for the district of Niono, Mali, to automatically generate contemporaneous on-line forecasts and hence, providing a basis for local re-organization and strengthening public health programs in this and potentially other Sahelian districts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper uses {{simulations}} {{to identify}} what types of human influence are afforded by the flocking and swarming structures that emerge from Couzin’s bio-inspired model [4]. The goal is to allow a human to influence a decentralized agent collective without resorting to centralized human control. Evidence is provided that, when nominal agents use switching-based control to respond to human-guided predators and leaders, the resulting behavior is responsive to human input but is obtained {{at the cost of}} causing the dynamic structure of the collective to follow a single flocking structure. Leaders are more effective in influencing coherent flocks, but predators can be used to divide the flock into sub-flocks, yielding higher performance on some problems. Introducing a so-called “stakeholder ” leadership style makes it possible for a human to guide the agents while maintaining several different types of structures; doing so requires more than one human-controlled agent. We then demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} produce potentially useful emergent dynamics without centralized human control, and identify an important type of emergent dynamics: <b>automatic</b> <b>switches</b> between structure types.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{mathematical}} model is proposed regarding the temperature rise estimation in components installed to electric power distribution networks (e. g. circuit breakers, <b>automatic</b> <b>switches,</b> disconnectors, fuse carriers), during short-circuit faults. The overall short-circuit current waveform and the components' mass and material are considered. The model was applied to a common disconnector of the network and characteristics of the results are plotted according to different forms of the asymmetric part of the short-circuit current waveform and the initial value of the short-circuit d. c. current component. The models' response is also investigated {{for a wide range}} of values of the crossing resistance and the component mass. It is convincingly shown that the short-circuit current waveform asymmetric part and component mass significantly affect temperature rise, and calculations of temperature rise which omit the above factors are questionable. An easy to use approximating equation is proposed, which could be considered in the mathematical approach of the phenomenon, according to international standards and facilitate the above components design.
