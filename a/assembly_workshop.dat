50|$|Kits {{of parts}} offer a {{shortcut}} {{to the traditional}} method of building. Kits fall into two categories, machined and unmachined kits. Unmachined kits usually consist of drawings, castings, stock metal, and possibly fasteners and other fixings necessary to complete the model. They require machining facilities to complete and often also require additional components and raw materials. Typically the minimum machine requirements are a lathe, drilling machine, and possibly a milling machine. A good level of knowledge about machining is necessary to successfully complete these kits. Machined kits are a set of parts that are fully machined and only require finishing with hand tools, painting, and <b>assembly.</b> <b>Workshop</b> machinery is not required. The kit will typically contain all the parts necessary to complete the model. These kits require a lot less work than an unmachined kit, but are very expensive and choice of subject matter is limited.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe intense {{competition}} {{imposed by the}} current global market, forces companies to implement lean manufacturing techniques.

The logistics of an <b>assembly</b> <b>workshop</b> are usually specified empirically, which often generates an overestimation of its needs. Therefore, the current study focuses on these needs and introduces the ACW (assignment of components in warehouses) method for optimising the assignment of components to storage areas.

40|$|The {{project is}} carried out {{as a case study}} at FlexLink AB, a global company {{providing}} factory conveyor solutions, with head quarter in Gothenburg. Focus has been on the project execution phase called Project Engineering (PE) at four different operating units in Europe. The PE process provides the final project design by using modular designed conveyors; the output of the process is a CAD model and final detailed drawings sent to the <b>assembly</b> <b>workshop</b> where the physical execution takes place. The study investigates the PE process in terms of variation and noise factors. Hence non-value added activities throughout the process were identified by interviews, observations and conduction of a survey. As a backbone throughout the project, the principles of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) has been used. The project aims at identifying critical-to-quality factors of the PE process but also investigating the feasibility of using LSS as a method within project execution at an automation solutions company. An existing gap in documented research has been identified for practical examples of LSS and its applicability in the automation industry. Major findings of the study were an rejection of the existing measurement system and three critical x-factors with remarkable impact on the investigated process and its output. The x-factors were; (i) use of different CAD-tools, (ii) re-drawing and (iii) handover documents – assembly. They all contributed to unwanted non-value-added activities throughout the process. The project enabled possible saving of 1. 4 MSEK. In addition, it was concluded that LSS was a feasible method to use for an automation engineering process. Most fruitful was the establishment of a common technical language and enabling of cross-sectional agreements as LSS forces. The thesis work can prove evidence for additional strength of LSS as a method with abilities to reach both organizational and national borders...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{quality of}} the {{collector}} field of concentrating solar power plants is a fundamental factor for their profitability. High optical quality can be achieved and guaranteed when the manufacturing process is continuously monitored and adjusted in its essential steps. Therefore, a reliable and automatic method is needed to check the geometric accuracy of the concentrator support structures during their manufacturing in the <b>assembly</b> <b>workshop.</b> To verify the overall optical {{quality of the}} solar field after completion, an additional method is needed that allows measuring the slope errors of large mirror surfaces in the field with reasonable effort. This paper presents two measurement techniques that fulfill the required measurement demands: The stationary, automatic photogrammetry system “Q-Foto” has been developed for the shape accuracy control of concentrator structures. The measurement system consists of a digital camera, moved around the structure automatically while shooting photos of the concentrator structure from various positions. The photos are evaluated with photogrammetry software to check the assembly quality. The whole measurement and evaluation procedure is computer-controlled, robust and fast enough to be integrated in a solar collector production line. This paper describes how to reach, maintain and control this accuracy in the rough environment of an on-site production line. The new optical method “TARMES” has been developed for on-site measurements of mirror slope errors in parabolic trough collector fields. It uses {{the reflection of the}} absorber tube in the concentrator and is therefore called “Trough Absorber Reflection Measurement System (TARMES) ”. A set of pictures of the absorber tube reflection is taken with the concentrator in slightly different and known tilt angles. The developed image analysis algorithm detects the edges of the absorber tube in the reflected images and corrects for distortions from perspective. This information is then used to calculate the slope errors of the mirror surface with high spatial resolution and accuracy. The consequences of the measured reflector slope deviations on the collector performance are calculated with raytracing. The results give detailed information about the optical quality of the concentrator, systematic errors in the manufacturing process and their optical performance penalty...|$|E
