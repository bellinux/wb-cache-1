5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943. <b>At</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Frisch {{continued}} his work on critical mass studies, for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, timers and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, {{was one of the}} few women working <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness Thomas's {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Chemistry and metallurgy <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> would be led by the youthful Joseph W. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|April 5: <b>At</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> Emilio Segrè {{receives}} the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from Oak Ridge, and within ten days discovers that the spontaneous fission rate {{is too high}} {{for use in a}} gun-type fission weapon (because of Pu-240 isotope present as an impurity in the Pu-239).|$|E
5|$|Segrè's group set up its {{equipment}} in a disused Forest Service {{cabin in the}} Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos in August 1943. His group's task was to measure and catalog the radioactivity of various fission products. An important line of research was determining the degree of isotope enrichment achieved with various samples of enriched uranium. Initially, the tests using mass spectrometry, used by Columbia University, and neutron assay, used by Berkeley, gave different results. Segrè studied Berkeley's results and could find no error, while Kenneth Bainbridge likewise found no fault with New York's. However, analysis of another sample showed close agreement. Higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> which Segrè's group concluded were due to cosmic rays, which were more prevalent <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> due to its high altitude.|$|E

5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory.

The culmination of this was working on the Ivy Mike nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened}} in 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b> At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
