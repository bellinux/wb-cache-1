40|$|Networks {{and their}} {{services}} {{have been growing}} rapidly in recent years, so has the complexity of configuring the network operations. In order to manage the rapidly expanding networks, new management protocols are thus needed to change the network management from configuration of individual devices to automation of the whole network. SNMPCONF, a policy-based configuration with SNMP protocol, is proposed by IETF to meet this requirement. SNMPCONF is suggested to configure networks with a policy MIB (Management Information Base). However, deploying this protocol in existing network devices needs more work, because the policy MIB defined by SNMPCONF is not implemented now in the present network and no configuration MIB defined. Even if the configuration MIB and policy MIB implemented by vendors in future, some existing devices may not be upgraded to support these MIB for their hardware limitation (e. g., memory limit). Another problem {{is found in the}} communication between a SNMP supported network and the SNMP unsupported networks (e. g. telecommunication network where TL 1 is used in North America). In this study, CLI and TL 1 are used to help solving these problems. Based on Modular SNMP from University of Quebec at Montreal, a JAVA framework to deploy SNMPCONF with this approach is implemented and tested on a network built with Cisco routers (Cisco IOS 12. 0, routers ranged from Catalyst 2600 to 2900). The preliminary work shows the SNMPCONF can be implemented by wrapping CLI commands <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>functions</b> in policy language without configuration MIB. As shown in this work, another advantage of this approach is that policy execution is atomic and persistent...|$|E

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocyte}} (CTL) activation requires specific T {{cell receptor}} (TCR) -class I {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) antigen complex interactions {{as well as the}} participation of coreceptor or accessory molecules on the surface of CTL. CD 8 can serve as a coreceptor in that it binds to the same MHC class I molecules as the TCR to facilitate efficient TCR signaling. In addition, CD 8 can be "activated" by TCR stimulation to bind to class I molecules with high avidity, including class I not recognized by the TCR as antigenic complexes (non-antigen [Ag] class I), to augment CTL responses and thus serve an <b>accessory</b> molecule <b>function.</b> A Glu/Asp 227 [...] >Lys substitution in the class I alpha 3 domain acidic loop abrogates lysis of target cells expressing these mutant molecules by alloreactive CD 8 -dependent CTL. Lack of response is attributed to the destruction of the CD 8 binding site in the alpha 3 domain which is likely to disrupt CD 8 coreceptor function. The relative importance of the class I alpha 3 domain acidic loop Glu 227 in coreceptor <b>as</b> opposed to <b>accessory</b> <b>functions</b> of CD 8 is unclear. To address this issue, we examined CTL adhesion and degranulation in response to immobilized class I-peptide complexes formed in vitro from antigenic peptides and purified class I molecules containing wild-type or Glu 227 [...] >Lys substituted alpha 3 domains. The alpha 3 domain mutant class I-peptide complexes were bound by CTL and triggered degranulation, however to much lower levels than wild-type class I-peptide complexes. In further experiments, it is directly demonstrated that the alpha 3 domain mutant class I molecules, which lack the Glu 227 CD 8 binding site, still serve as TCR-activated, avidity-enhanced CD 8 accessory ligands. However, mutant class I peptide Ag complexes failed to effectively serve as CD 8 coreceptor ligands to initiate TCR-dependent signals required to induce avidity-enhanced CD 8 binding to coimmobilized non-Ag class I molecules.

40|$|Two human {{monocyte}} subsets {{from the}} peripheral blood of healthy donors have been isolated in greater than 90 % purity by countercurrent centrifugal elutration and human serum albumin gradients and their functional capabilities have been assessed. We {{have demonstrated that}} one subset ("regular" monocytes, RM) showed intense cytoplasmic peroxidase staining and contained substantial peroxidase activity. In contrast, another subset ("intermediate" monocytes, IM) stained poorly for peroxidase and had low peroxidase activity. By electron microscopic analysis combined with peroxidase localization, {{it was found that}} IM had fewer peroxidase-positive granules per cell than did RM. IM coelutriated with some lymphocytes and by cell sizing analysis were shown to be slightly smaller than RM. Functional and cytochemical analysis of these subsets indicated that IM had less activity than RM in assays such <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function</b> for mitogen-induced T lymphocyte proliferation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and that fewer IM expressed OKM 1 antigen and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) receptors on their membranes than did RM. The subset of IM not bearing either the PWM receptor or the OKM 1 antigen had very low peroxidase activity. IM also were found to have a greater sensitivity to polyriboinosinic and polyribocytidilic acid (100 micrograms/ml) -induced secretion of interferon. There {{was no significant difference in}} the phagocytic capability, the percentage of Fc receptor-positive cells, 5 '-nucleotidase activity, DR antigen expression, or the responsiveness to migration inhibitory factor of IM as compared with RM. Furthermore, it was found that the ratio of IM to RM increased after prolonged cytapheresis, which suggests that IM are more mobilizable than RM from the extravascular reservoirs of human monocytes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the effect of an in vitro infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{on the ability of}} human monocytes to present the soluble antigen tetanus toxoid to T cells. We observed that tetanus toxoid-specific T-cell proliferation was markedly reduced when monocytes were infected with large numbers (bacterium-to-monocyte ratio, 50 : 1) of both viable and heat-killed mycobacteria. The level of antigen-induced gamma interferon release also was decreased when M. tuberculosis-containing monocytes were used as antigen-presenting cells. However, mycobacterium-infected monocytes did not show or trigger suppressive activity, because the presence of mycobacterium-infected monocytes did not affect the T-cell response induced by tetanus toxoid-pulsed control monocytes. When M. tuberculosis-infected monocytes were fixed with paraformaldehyde, they were not able to serve as antigen-presenting cells even in the presence of untreated accessory monocytes. Moreover, the uptake of both viable and heat-killed M. tuberculosis cells reduced the expression of human leukocyte antigen DR on monocytes. With regard to <b>accessory</b> <b>function,</b> monocytes infected with large numbers of mycobacteria were less efficient <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells than were control monocytes in cultures of T cells activated with pokeweed mitogen. These results indicate that infection with large numbers of M. tuberculosis cells impairs the ability of monocytes to process and/or present soluble antigen and to serve <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells in T-cell activation...|$|R

The <b>function</b> of macrophages <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells in concanavalin A-induced proliferation of spleno-lymphocytes (<b>accessory</b> <b>function)</b> was enhanced 4 h after a low-dose irradiation (4 cGy) in vivo, {{but not in}} vitro, indicating that low-dose irradiation acts indirectly on the activation of macrophages. Because we expected that macrophages were activated by the recognition of substances damaged by in vivo irradiation, we co-cultured macrophages with oxidized erythrocyte-ghosts. No change was found in their <b>accessory</b> <b>function.</b> The production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) and inter-feron-g (IFN-g), in the supernatant of cocultures of spleno-lymphocytes and macrophages was deter-mined by an ELISA. Production of both increased {{in the presence of}} in vivo irradiated macrophages. Furthermore, IL- 1 b production from in vivo-irradiated macrophages treated with recombinant IFN-g also was enhanced. The mRNA expression of the cytokines released from macrophages and lymphocytes was determined by RT-PCR. Increases in IL- 1 b mRNA expression were found in both in vivo- and in vitro-irradiated macrophages. In vivo irradiation also enhanced the expression of IFN-g mRNA in lympho-cytes, whereas there was no change after in vitro irradiation. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the activation of macrophages is caused by interaction with neighboring cells, such as lymphocytes, and by paracrine induction of certain cytokines which is initiated by the small amount of IL- 1 b released by irradiated macrophages...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of human peripheral blood (PB) dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes to facilitate T cell activation {{and the interaction}} molecules employed were compared. We have shown that precursors of DC constitute 2 to 3 % of circulating PBMC, and can be isolated as CD 33 +CD 14 dim cells, whereas monocytes are CD 33 +CD 14 bright. Freshly obtained DC expressed similar densities of HLA-DR and the accessory molecules LFA- 3, ICAM- 1, and B 7 as monocytes; after a 36 -h incubation the expression of HLA-DR, ICAM- 1, and B 7 increased on both APC. <b>Accessory</b> cell <b>function</b> was examined in PB T cell cultures stimulated by suboptimal concentrations of immobilized mAb to CD 3, and by stimulation of an allospecific T cell line. Freshly isolated monocytes and DC were comparable accessory cells in these assays, but their <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> was increased by in vitro preincubation, although cultured DC and monocytes were comparably active. In contract, DC were much more effective stimulators of freshly isolated allogeneic T cells than monocytes. DC were much more effective stimulators of freshly isolated allogeneic PB CD 4 + naive and memory T cells than monocytes, whereas DC and monocytes were comparable accessory cells for memory and naive T cells stimulated with immobilized anti-CD 3. The accessory molecules ICAM- 1, LFA- 3, and B 7 were used comparably by DC and monocytes for <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> {{in the presence of}} immobilized anti-CD 3 and in the MLR, and none was unique for either APC population. These accessory molecules costimulated T cells in an additive fashion. Although immature blood DC and monocytes expressed minimal B 7 and did not utilize it <b>as</b> an <b>accessory</b> molecule, B 7 {{played an important role in}} the increased <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> of differentiated APC. The results indicate that PB DC and monocytes function most efficiently after differentiation into mature cells that express increased amounts of MHC and other accessory molecules. Because DC and monocytes exhibit comparable <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> in anti-CD 3 T cell stimulation, differences in the expression of MHC molecules and/or their bound peptides are likely to explain the markedly enhanced {{capacity of}} DC to stimulate allogeneic PB T cells...|$|R

These studies {{were designed to}} characterize {{the nature of the}} UVB-induced defect in human monocyte <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function.</b> Irradiated monocytes were deficient in their ability to serve <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells for OKT 3 -induced T cell activation. In vitro exposure of monocytes to 100 J/m 2 UVB completely inhibited the T cell proliferative response (51502 cpm, non-UVB-irradiated; 302 cpm, UVB-irradiated). Analysis of the accessory signals altered by UVB indicated that irradiated monocytes were incapable of binding to OKT 3 molecules attached to the CD 3 antigen on T cells. Provision of an alternative mechanism for binding of OKT 3 molecules by attaching anti-mouse IgG to the bottom of microtiter wells completely restored <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function.</b> Further characterization of the defect demonstrated that UVB radiation did not deplete p 72 Fc receptors from the surface of irradiated monocytes. However, UVB exposure did produce a dose-dependent decrease in monocyte membrane expression of ICAM- 1. It is proposed that UVB radiation leads to changes within the cell membrane that inhibit the ability of monocytes to express selected molecules necessary for binding of T cells...|$|R
40|$|Human {{alveolar}} macrophages (AM) are {{deficient in}} their ability to promote antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation when compared to in-vitro-aged blood derived macrophages (BM). The mechanisms behind the unique <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function</b> of human AM are unknown. The current paradigm for <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function</b> requires antigen presentation in the context of gene products of the HLA-DR locus of the major histocompatibility complex (Class II, DR antigens) and secretion of non-specific second signal (e. g. interleukin 1). While both AM and in-vitro-aged BM have limited ability to secrete interleukin 1 (IL- 1), more than 90 % of both cell types express DR antigens. However, only BM consistently promote antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. Addition of IL- 1 does not restore <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function</b> of human AM for antigen stimulation. It is possible that DR antigen expression and/or function of AM may be more contributory for their <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function.</b> The mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR) and autologous mixed leucocyte reactions (AMLR) in which DR epitopes stimulate proliferation of allogeneic and autologous T cells, respectively, are useful in vitro assays for assessment of DR-restricted macrophage-lymphocyte interactions. In the current studies we demonstrate that AM are usually equivalent to autologous in-vitro-aged BM {{in their ability}} to stimulate an MLR, but are consistently deficient relative to such BM {{in their ability to}} stimulate an AMLR. Experiments in which the two cells were co-cultured indicate that AM-mediated suppression does not account for the limited ability of AM to stimulate an AMLR. The deficiency of AM to act <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells for antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation may relate to their relative inability to stimulate autoreactive T cells and be attributable to differences in DR antigen expression and/or function...|$|R

When compared to autologous monocytes, normal AM failed to present the two recall antigens effectively. Likewise normal AM formed very few clusters with T lymphocytes when compared to monocytes, even in the presence of antigens or the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). In contrast, sarcoid AM presented both antigens as effectively, and were equally effective as monocytes in forming clusters with T lymphocytes, spontaneously and in further response to antigen or mitogen.

40|$|Alveolar macrophages {{form the}} first line of defense against inhaled {{droplets}} containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis by controlling mycobacterial growth and regulating T cell responses. CD 4 + and gamma delta T cells, two major T cell subsets activated by M. tuberculosis, require accessory cells for activation. However, the ability of alveolar macrophages to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells for T cell activation remains controversial. We sought to determine the ability of alveolar macrophages to serve <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells for resting (HLA-DR-, IL- 2 R-) and activated (HLA-DR+, IL- 2 R+) gamma delta T cells in response to M. tuberculosis and its Ag, and to compare <b>accessory</b> cell <b>function</b> for gamma delta T cells of alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes obtained from the same donor. Alveolar macrophages were found to serve <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells for both resting and activated gamma delta T cells in response to M. tuberculosis Ag. At high alveolar macrophage to T cell ratios (> 3 : 1), however, expansion of resting gamma delta T cells was inhibited by alveolar macrophages. The inhibition of resting gamma delta T cells by alveolar macrophages was dose-dependent, required their presence during the first 24 h, and was partially overcome by IL- 2. Alveolar macrophages did not inhibit activated gamma delta T cells even at high accessory cell to T cell ratios, and alveolar macrophages functioned as well <b>as</b> monocytes <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells. Monocytes were not inhibitory for either resting or activated gamma delta T cells. These findings support the following model. In the normal alveolus the alveolar macrophage to T cell ratio is > or = 9 : 1, and therefore the threshold for resting gamma delta T cell activation is likely to be high. Once a nonspecific inflammatory response occurs, such as after invasion by M. tuberculosis, this ratio is altered, favoring gamma delta T cell activation by alveolar macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{findings}} in our laboratory {{indicated that the}} bulk of Listeria monocytogenes injected intravenously into mice and recovered in the liver is taken up and replicates within hepatocytes. Other investigators have shown that hepatocytes can display costimulatory adhesion molecules, express major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules, and secrete a number of cytokines, including interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), IL- 6, and IL- 8. These data suggest that hepatocytes may serve <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells in the immune response to L. monocytogenes. The <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> and capacity of hepatocytes to present listerial antigens, however, have never been explored. We undertook a series of experiments to examine the response of Listeria-immune T lymphocytes to murine hepatocytes preincubated with heat-killed listeriae (HKL). Electron micrographs showing the organism within membrane-limiting vacuoles demonstrated the capacity of hepatocytes to internalize HKL. T cells cocultured with hepatocytes pulsed with HKL exhibited a 5 - to 10 -fold increase in [methyl- 3 H]thymidine incorporation relative to T cells cultured with either hepatocytes or HKL alone. Similarly, gamma interferon production by immune T cells was elevated significantly in cultures that contained both hepatocytes and HKL. The optimal response of T cells required lysosomal processing of HKL by hepatocytes and contact between the two cell populations. Furthermore, maximum T-cell proliferation and gamma interferon production were dependent upon the presence of CD 4 + T lymphocytes and the expression of Ia antigens. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that hepatocytes pulsed with HKL can stimulate the antigen-specific response of immune T lymphocytes. These results suggest that hepatocytes can serve <b>as</b> <b>accessory</b> cells in host defenses to listerial infections of the liver...|$|R

UV-B depressed <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> of ADH in a dose-dependent manner.

UV-B also decreased accessory activity of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} but not Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells for a PPD-reactive T cell line. Viability was approximately 90 % 0 - 72 h after exposure of ADH to 5 mJ/cm 2 of UV-B. Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) activity of supernatants of ADH was assayed on C 3 H/HeJ mouse thymocytes. Pretreatment of ADH with 5 mJ/cm 2 UV-B decreased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL- 1 activity from 169 +/- 34 (mean U/ml +/- s. e.) to 4 +/- 1 (P less than 0. 01, n = 4). Lysates of UV-B irradiated.
