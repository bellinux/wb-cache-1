50|$|Bowls are {{referred}} to and sold by their weight, and are available from 2 lb 0oz to 2 lb 14oz, in 2oz increments. They were traditionally made from lignum vitae wood but are now manufactured from a composite plastic. Wooden bowls have a variable density throughout their core {{due to the nature}} of wood. Plastic bowls have a consistent and regular density throughout and manufacturers can produce bowls in different densities generally known as standard, low density and high density. This means that a smaller <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> a higher density can be the same weight as <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lighter density.|$|R

A peacock fan overhangs a nude male who drinks from <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>with</b> his cast-off garment in the top right corner. The amphora beside him is sealed with a flower and in one extant copy is inscribed ZLS, probably a mistaken transcription for the Greek exhortation zeses, [...] "to your health". Three mature gourds or melons are another seasonal motif.|$|E
50|$|Fit-fit, or fir-fir, is {{a common}} breakfast dish. It is made from {{shredded}} injera or kitcha stir-fried with spices or wat. Another popular breakfast food is fatira. The delicacy consists of a large fried pancake made with flour, often {{with a layer of}} egg, eaten with honey. Chechebsa (or kita firfir) resembles a pancake covered with berbere and niter kibbeh, or spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. A porridge, genfo is another common breakfast dish.

25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the <b>bowl</b> inside <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|R

50|$|Mound 'C' held a charnel {{house where}} bundled bones, {{typically}} a skull and limb bones, were stored. After {{some period of}} time, the bundles were buried around {{the periphery of the}} mound. In about 475, approximately 36 bone bundles were removed from the charnel house and buried. The charnel house was burned, then a fire was built of top of it for a feast. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> animal heads on its rim, which may have been used for serving ceremonial drinks such as the black drink, was left on the remains of the fire after its bottom was knocked out. At least 17 ceramic vessels, including hollow figurines of animals, were broken and left atop the graves of the bone bundles. The whole mound was then covered with a six-foot layer of earth.|$|E

50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in sandstone rubble, with red tiled roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave and a chancel under a continuous roof, a north transept containing the organ chamber and vestry, a south chapel, and a west tower. The tower has angle buttresses, a stair turret at the northeast corner, a plain parapet, and a pyramidal roof. It has a three-light west window with Perpendicular tracery, a north doorway, and two-light bell openings with inscriptions above them. The windows {{on the sides of}} the church have two or three lights. In the chapel is a circular east window. The east window in the chancel has four lights with Perpendicular tracery. Inside the church is a two-bay arcade leading to the chapel. In the chancel is a sedilia and a piscina. The font stands under the tower and consists of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> buttressed sides. The stained glass in the windows was designed by Shrigley and Hunt of Lancaster. The two-manual pipe organ was made in about 1875 by Henry Ainscough and was originally in Barnacre Lodge.|$|E
25|$|The Powder River basin {{is shaped}} like <b>a</b> <b>large</b> shallow <b>bowl,</b> <b>with</b> its westernmost rock {{formations}} lying against the Big Horn Mountains. As these mountains uplifted over eons of geologic time they lifted and tilted the sedimentary rocks from the Powder River basin, {{which were then}} eroded away, creating the plains that stretch eastward from the mountains into the basin. Generally there are older sedimentary layers closer to the mountains and younger layers farther away.|$|R
25|$|At Nalanda, a Buddhist university, {{four hours}} a day and {{four hours a}}t night were {{measured}} by a water clock, which consisted of a copper <b>bowl</b> holding two <b>large</b> floats in <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> filled <b>with</b> water. The <b>bowl</b> was filled <b>with</b> water from a small hole at its bottom; it sank when completely filled and was marked by the beating of a drum at daytime. The amount of water added varied with the seasons and this clock was operated by the students of the university.|$|R

Spicy mustard sauce (or mustard oil) and vinegar are often added before consumption. Traditionally, the long noodles would be eaten without cutting, as they symbolized longevity {{of life and}} good health, but servers at restaurants usually ask if the noodles should be cut prior to eating, and use scissors to cut the noodles.|$|R
5000|$|... {{also known}} as crackler, is melted fat in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> sugar, eaten by dipping it with bread and is often served with tea. Kylmai is a sausage made during fall and winter {{slaughtering}} and is made by stuffing intestines with pieces of ground meat, fat, blood, garlic, salt, and black pepper. Zhauburek, {{also known as}} kebab, is popular among hunters and travelers and is a dish in which small pieces of meat are roasted over a fire. Ulpershek is a dish made from the heart, aorta, and fat of a horse, prepared in a kettle, and is often shared between sisters-in-law {{as a sign of}} unity. Kazy is a sausage eaten in the spring when a cow has a new calf; it is a giant sausage sometimes served with rice or kurt. Mypalau is a dish made from sheep's brain, made by putting the brain in a wooden bowl, adding marrow, pieces of meat, salted fat in broth, and garlic, and this dish is then often served to honored guests. Akshelek is a large camel bone distributed to children after slaughtering and cooking meat from a camel.|$|E
50|$|The Avoriaz-pistes {{are divided}} in 4 sectors: The Lindaret, Haut-Forts, Fornet and Super Morzine. The latter being mainly {{connection}} to Morzine and heavily used by ski-schools and beginners. The Lindaret {{is a beautiful}} valley {{with a number of}} red and blue runs plus a single black. In the Lindaret-valley one finds The Stash - a conceptual snowpark developed by Burton and based on ecological principles. It {{is the only one of}} its kind in France. There are a number of restaurants and a small village at the bottom of the valley. The Fornet area is <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> basically skiing everywhere between huge rocks and crevasses. From one of the ridges around the Fornet bowl one can test the famous La Chavanette - also known as The Swiss Wall, one of the steepest pistes in Europe - it is not part of the Avoriaz-system but belongs to neighbouring Swiss resort Les Crosets. Haut-Forts is the most demanding area with a number of black runs starting at 2.400 and ending at 1.100 metres, some of which are for experts only. The world cup piste - although rated black - is pretty easy though. This area is also ideal for off-piste although caution is advised since this is an area with frequent avalanches. From the Haut-Forts top-station it is possible to ski directly back to Avoriaz by red or blue slopes.|$|E

5000|$|Weight and Seesaw - Each {{contestant}} {{was placed}} {{on one side of}} a balance, with random household objects having a combined weight heavier than the contestant on the other side. Teams would take turns removing items attempting to balance the scale within a range. If a team took too much off the scale, the contestant would outweigh the objects onto the other side and descend into <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> filled <b>with</b> slime. The first team to balance the scale won the event. In the Carrington era, each team competed individually, and the first team to play would play with the clock counting up to a maximum of 45 seconds. If the first team failed, the other team still had to balance the scale before time ran out in order to claim the money.|$|R
50|$|The fountains {{are not all}} identical, {{but most}} share one of two basic designs. The most common version is 6 ft tall, {{consisting}} of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> circular <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> square pillar rising from its center placed on a square pedestal. The main bowl, intended for horses, is 6 ft in diameter and is fed by bronze spigots {{in the shape of}} lion heads on three sides of the upper pillar. The fourth side contains a bronze plaque listing details of the fountain's construction. The lower pedestal is 18 in high and has niches on each side <b>with</b> drinking <b>bowls</b> near ground level for dogs, cats, and other small animals. The fountain is assembled from five pieces of granite weighing 10000 lb in total.|$|R

One minute! three minutes! six minutes! The boat began to lighten, and no fresh wave swamped us. Five minutes more, and she was fairly clear. Then, suddenly, above the awful shriekings of the hurricane came a duller, deeper roar. Great Heavens! It was the voice of breakers! ...|$|R

60|$|Nine {{years had}} passed away, and Forest Lea still stood among the stumps of its cut-down trees; but one fair long day in early June there was much that was changed in its aspect. The park was {{carefully}} mown and swept; the shrubs were trained back; the broken windows were repaired; and within the hall the appearance of everything was still more strikingly cheerful, as the setting sun looked smilingly in at the western window. Green boughs filled the hearth, and were suspended round the walls; fresh branches of young oak leaves, tasselled with the pale green catkins; the helmets and gauntlets {{hanging on the wall}} were each adorned with a spray, and polished to the brightest; the chairs and benches were ranged round the long table, covered with a spotless cloth, and bearing in the middle <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> filled <b>with</b> oak boughs, roses, lilac, honey- suckle, and all the pride of the garden.|$|R
50|$|A typical frybread recipe {{consists}} of flour, water, salt, {{a small amount}} of oil, and baking powder. The ingredients are mixed and worked into a simple dough, and covered with a cloth for 30 minutes to an hour, until the dough rises. It is then formed into small balls, and are either rolled or pulled into flat discs prior to frying in hot oil. Many variations of this basic recipe exist, including substituting mayonnaise for oil in the dough (which produces a crisp, crunchy texture that resists getting soggy - ideal for Navajo tacos), and leavening the dough with a small container of yogurt or soured milk instead of using baking powder or yeast (produces a rich, sourdough flavor but requires several hours to fully leaven after the dough is prepared). Most frybread recipes do not use yeast at all because it was not typically available to Native peoples when this foodstuff was developed. In many Native American households, frybread dough is mixed {{early in the morning and}} left in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cloth to leaven and is used throughout the day to prepare fresh bread when needed.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "potty" [...] is {{used when}} {{discussing}} the toilet with small children, such as during potty training. It is also usually {{used to refer}} to the small, toilet-shaped devices made especially for potty training, which are similar to chamber pots. These [...] "potties" [...] are generally <b>a</b> <b>large</b> plastic <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ergonomically-designed back and front to protect against splashes. They may have a built-in handle or grasp at the back to allow emptying and a non-slip bottom to prevent the child from sliding while in use. Some are given bright colors, and others may feature some gentle or unoffensive drawing or cartoon character. In many cases they are used since it is difficult for children to maneuver themselves up onto the normal toilet; in addition the larger opening in the regular toilet is much too <b>large</b> for <b>a</b> child to sit over comfortably and not fall in without some type of aid. Their size means they can be packed away in a bag for days out or when camping with young children, and can be placed near or under beds for sufferers of nocturia or some other form of incontinence.|$|R
60|$|Christmas Eve had come, {{and all the}} men {{who worked}} under Marzinne or on the farms round about were {{gathered}} in the large kitchen to eat the soup flavoured with honey followed by rich puddings, {{to which they were}} always invited on this particular night. In {{the middle of the table}} was <b>a</b> <b>large</b> wooden <b>bowl,</b> <b>with</b> wooden spoons placed in a circle round it, so that each might dip in his turn. The benches were filled, and Marzinne was about to give the signal, when the door was suddenly thrown open, and an old man came in, wishing the guests a good appetite for their supper. There was a pause, and some of the faces looked a little frightened; for the new-comer was well known to them as a beggar, who was also said to be a wizard who cast spells over the cattle, and caused the corn to grow black, and old people to die, of what, nobody knew. Still, it was Christmas Eve, and besides it was as well not to offend him, so the farmer invited him in, and gave him a seat at the table and a wooden spoon like the rest.|$|R
5000|$|The arcade {{between the}} nave {{and the south}} aisle dates from the 14th century. In the chancel is a piscina in Early English style which has been much restored.

There is a variety of benches. Two of these date from the 15th century, are carved with poppyheads and animals. They were originally in the porch, and consequently are weathered. Others, also dating from the 15th century, are carved with poppyheads only, and the rest are 19th-century reproductions. [...] The single-manual organ is at {{the east end of}} the south aisle.

The finds also include <b>a</b> <b>large</b> double conical <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> strap handle and a pattern of alternating standing and hanging semicircles. Other double conical vessels survived only in fragments. One vessel has metope-like ornaments resembling the French Chasséen culture.

50|$|Many candle holders use a friction-tight socket to {{keep the}} candle upright. In this case, a candle that is {{slightly}} too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders {{were made in the}} same place, so they were appropriately sized, but international trade has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For tea light candles, {{there are a variety of}} candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for votives. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, is a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> glass <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane.
