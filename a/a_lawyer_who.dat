5|$|In 1911, {{the seat}} was {{won for the}} first time for the Australian Labor Party by Walter Dwyer, <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> helped to draft the Industrial Arbitration Act 1912 during the first Scaddan administration; however, he was {{defeated}} by James Connolly of the new Liberal Party in 1914. Connolly became a minister without portfolio in the new Wilson government in 1916, but resigned in June 1917 when appointed to the role of Agent General for Western Australia. Robert Pilkington of the Nationalist Party won the subsequent by-election on 21 July 1917 and election two months later, before leaving for England in 1921. Harry Mann, a former detective who, amongst other things, oversaw gaming and racing, was elected in his place.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Soviet Union {{shot down}} a United States U-2 spy plane. The Soviets {{captured}} its pilot, Gary Powers, and tried him for committing espionage against the Soviet Union. At first, the United States believed that Powers could be freed by crafting an argument regarding international principles. To this end, Miskovsky {{and two other}} lawyers (Alexander W. Parker and Frank Rogers) wrote a brief stating that Power's U-2 plane did not violate Soviet airspace any more than Sputnik violated American airspace. However, the Soviet Union refused to allow foreigners to defend Powers. Powers was ultimately defended by <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> acted as {{a spokesman for the}} Soviet government.|$|E

At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making Paul's case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives his body back to Paul's hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in April, Atlanta was {{decommissioned}} in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 {{and placed}} in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled in a civil war. Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{returned}} to her mother's home and frequent arguments. Her mother had long resented the Bradleys' influence and soon decided that Copeland would cease study with the Bradleys. Copeland was distraught with fear {{that she would not}} be able to dance. She had heard the term emancipation while in San Francisco; the procedure was common among young performers to secure their financial and residential independence. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> explained the emancipation petition process. The Bradleys encouraged her to be absent from home when the emancipation petition was delivered to her mother. Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend, while Bartell filed the emancipation papers. After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about the emancipation petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was {{returned to}} her mother by the police. DelaCerna engaged lawyer Gloria Allred and applied for a series of restraining orders, which included the Bradleys' five-year-old son, who had been Copeland's roommate, and Bartell. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between the Bradleys and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor David Brooks, and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E

5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all counterfeit footwear in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he has moved from that spot and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E
5|$|Montacute House {{was built}} in about 1598 by Sir Edward Phelips, whose family {{had lived in the}} Montacute area since at least 1460, first as yeomen farmers before rising in status. The site was bought from the Cluniac Montacute Priory by Thomas Phelips and passed to his grandson, also called Thomas, who started {{planning}} the house, but died before it was built and left the completion of the work to his son Edward. Edward Phelips was <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> had been in Parliament since 1584. He was knighted in 1603 and a year later became Speaker of the House. James I appointed him Master of the Rolls and Chancellor to his son and heir Henry, Prince of Wales. Phelips remained at the hub of English political life, and his legal skills were employed when he became opening prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters.|$|E
5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the term}} public defender {{is often used}} to {{describe}} <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> is appointed by a court to represent a defendant who cannot afford to hire an attorney. More correctly, a public defender is <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> works for a public defender's office, a government-funded agency that provides legal representation to indigent defendants. The court appoints the public defender's office to represent the defendant, and the office assigns a lawyer to the defendant's case. In the federal criminal court system and some states and counties, representation is through a publicly-funded public defender office.|$|E

25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> must prepare a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E
