5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean <b>are</b> <b>assumed,</b> if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E

A patrilineal system governs the society, where descent and inheritance are traced through the male line and men are generally in control of the distribution of family resources.|$|E

5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Tacitus, {{the emperor}} is {{acclaimed}} by the Senate, {{meeting in the}} Curia Pompiliana, which never existed. The History then lists a number of individuals, {{all of whom are}} invented by the author: the consul 'Velius Cornificius Gordianus', 'Maecius Faltonius Nicomachus', the Prefect of the City 'Aelius Cesettianus', and the Praetorian Prefect 'Moesius Gallicanus'. Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to be fictitious. Most of the 'Maecii' and 'Gallicani' in the History are believed to be inventions of the author.|$|E

5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E
5|$|The Diolkos {{remained}} reportedly {{in regular}} service {{until at least}} {{the middle of the}} 1st centuryAD, after which no more written references appear. Possibly the trackway was put out of use by Nero's abortive canal works in 67AD. Much later transports of warships across the Isthmus in the late 9th century and around 1150 <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to have used a route other than the Diolkos due to the extensive time lag.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E

5|$|The outer {{atmosphere}} of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume. The proportion of helium is significantly deficient {{compared to the}} abundance of this element in the Sun. The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to match the primordial abundances from {{the formation of the}} Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of the Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is divided}} into two groups of somites. The {{anterior}} group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past the margins of the carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to be the endopodites, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E
5|$|When mass is {{concentrated}} into a sufficiently compact region of space, general relativity predicts {{the formation of}} a black hole– a region of space with a gravitational effect so strong that not even light can escape. Certain types of black holes are thought to be the final state in the evolution of massive stars. On the other hand, supermassive black holes with the mass of millions or billions of Suns <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to reside in the cores of most galaxies, and they {{play a key role in}} current models of how galaxies have formed over the past billions of years.|$|E

Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria {{can be traced back}} to the Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.|$|E

These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
