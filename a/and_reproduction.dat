5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{universal}} agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, <b>and</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Life may also {{be said to be}} simply the characteristic state of organisms.|$|E
5|$|Defensive {{structures}} and chemicals are costly as they require resources that could otherwise {{be used by}} plants to maximize growth <b>and</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Many models have been proposed to explore how and why some plants make this investment in defenses against herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{based on}} the fossil record, serology, karyology, behavior, anatomy, <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> reflect closer affinities with Procyonidae than Ursidae.

5|$|Natural selection, {{introduced}} in 1859 {{as the central}} mechanism of evolution by Charles Darwin, is the differential survival <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> of individuals {{due to differences in}} phenotype.

5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building <b>and</b> <b>reproduction,</b> and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|More {{offspring}} {{are produced}} than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival <b>and</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Consequently, organisms with traits that {{give them an}} advantage over their competitors {{are more likely to}} pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} species kept {{commonly}} as pets, only Campbell's dwarf hamster and Djungarian hamsters {{are able to}} interbreed and produce live hybrid offspring. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> problems. In addition, the widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem, resulting in only mongrels. Hybridizing causes each litter to become smaller and the young begin to form congenital problems.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> by reducing the impact of herbivores. Plants can sense being touched, and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E

5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: they stop the growth <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> of bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in the ribosome.

5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth <b>and</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
