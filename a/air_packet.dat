40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new modelling approach to evaluate saturation {{performance of the}} AIr protocol based on conditional probability arguments rather than bi-dimensional Markov chains. Moreover, we extend performance studies in former literature papers by providing an intuitive <b>AIr</b> <b>packet</b> delay analysis assuming error-free transmissions and a fixed number of stations. Using OPNET simulation results, we validate our mathematical analysis and we show that the proposed model predicts <b>AIr</b> <b>packet</b> delay performance very accurately. Utilizing the derived mathematical analysis, we determine the significance of both link layer and physical parameters, such as burst size, minimum CW size value and minimum turnaround time on <b>AIr</b> <b>packet</b> delay performance. Finally, we propose suitable values for both backo# and protocol parameters that reduce average packet delay and, thus, maximize performance. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During the winter‐time, the South Pole lies at {{the center}} of the giant Antarctic polar vortex which {{isolates}} it from the rest of the world. Over the past four years, USU has successfully operated an infrared camera at the US Amundsen‐Scott South Pole Station to investigate dynamics of atmospheric gravity waves within the vortex. Gravity waves are generated when a force disturbs an <b>air</b> <b>packet</b> and buoyant and gravitational forces in turn cause it to oscillate. While gravity waves in general are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, propagating well into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region (~ 80 ‐ 100 km), one rare type of gravity wave known as a “bore” is characterized by a sharp leading front followed by several distinct trailing waves that grow in number. Bore wave events are observed in tropospheric clouds, but to date observations are rare in the upper atmosphere, especially at high‐latitudes. In this study ranging over 4 winter seasons (April‐August 2012 ‐ 2015), we have discovered a surprisingly large number of bores (83 events). Examples of these events are presented together with measurements of their propagation characteristics. These results provide important new information on the generation and propagation of gravity waves within the winter polar vortex...|$|E

25|$|The air {{entrainment}} {{occurs in the}} form of air bubbles and <b>air</b> <b>packets</b> entrapped at the impingement of the upstream jet flow with the roller. The <b>air</b> <b>packets</b> are broken up in very small air bubbles as they are entrained in the shear region, characterised by large air contents and maximum bubble count rates. Once the entrained bubbles are advected into regions of lesser shear, bubble collisions and coalescence lead to larger air entities that are driven towards the free-surface by a combination of buoyancy and turbulent advection.|$|R
50|$|In {{hydraulic}} engineering, {{air bubble}} entrainment {{is defined as}} the entrapment of air bubbles and pockets that are advected within the turbulent flow. The entrainment of <b>air</b> <b>packets</b> can be localised or continuous along the air-water interface. Examples of localised aeration include air entrainment by plunging water jet and at hydraulic jump. Bubbles are entrained locally at the intersection of the impinging jet with the surrounding waters. The intersecting perimeter is a singularity in terms of both air entrainment and momentum exchange, and the air is entrapped at the discontinuity between the impinging jet flow and the receiving pool of water. Interfacial aeration {{is defined as the}} air entrainment process along an air-water interface, usually parallel to the flow direction.|$|R

The player will be awarded in-game pickups to increase score and <b>air</b> <b>packets</b> to increase <b>air</b> supply. Star Trigon is simple in only requiring one button, the challenge is timing the jumps from planet to planet and rescuing the stranded aliens before the air supply is depleted and as your characters are spinning faster and faster without jumping off screen. Along the way new obstacles will help complicate things {{and add to the}} challenge of the game like black holes and flares.|$|R
40|$|Observation {{of shadow}} bands during the solar eclipse of Mar. 7, 1970. Data were {{gathered}} by recording onto magnetic {{tape of the}} output from six collimated photocells whose spectral responses ranged from the ultraviolet to the infrared, and by visual and mechanical measurement of the orientation and motion of the bands. The recorded data were later processed using the output from a frequency spectrum analyzer. Most of {{the energy of the}} shadow bands ranges between 1 and 25 Hz, and appears not unlike plots of scintillation spectra. The onset, amplitude, and duration of the shadow bands seem to be spectrally related to the limb darkening of the sun's photosphere. Other results of the experiment conclusively indicate that the shadow band phenomenon is a manifestation of atmospheric turbulence in the form of <b>air</b> <b>packets</b> of different density from that of their environment (density schlieren), made visible by the light from the crescent sun...|$|R

40|$|Thousands {{of plant}} and animal species have been {{observed}} to have superhydrophobic surfaces that lead to various novel behaviors [1 - 5]. These observations have inspired attempts to create artificial superhydrophobic surfaces, given such surfaces have multitudinous applications [6 - 13]. Superhydrophobicity is an enhanced effect of surface roughness and there are known relationships that correlate surface roughness and superhydrophobicity, based on the underlying physics. However, while these recognize the level of roughness they tell us little about the independent effect of its scale. Thus, they are not capable of explaining why naturally occurring such surfaces commonly have micron-submicron sizes. Here we report on the discovery of a new relation, its physical basis and its experimental verification. The results reveal that scaling-down roughness into the micro-submicron range is a unique and elegant strategy to not only achieve superhydrophobicity but also to increase its stability against environmental disturbances. This new relation takes into account the previously overlooked but key fact that the accumulated line energy arising from the numerous solid-water-air intersections that can be distributed in the apparent contact area when <b>air</b> <b>packets</b> are trapped at small scales on the surface can dramatically increase as the roughness scale shrinks. This term can in fact become the dominant contributor to the surface energy and so becomes crucial for accomplishing superhydrophobicity. These findings guide fabrication of stable super water-repellant surfaces. Comment: arXiv-admin note: This version has been removed because it is in violation of arXiv's copyright polic...|$|R

We {{conducted}} studies of the propagation of self-confined packets of light or ''Optical Bullets'' through <b>air.</b> These <b>packets</b> are self-forming and require no active optics. At the present time, theoretical explanations provide an incomplete description of this process. Generation of these pulses requires a light source of sufficient energy and with a short enough pulse-width that the intensity exceeds a critical wavelength dependent value. We used a Ti:Sapphire based system to generate the pulses and we observed pulse-splitting and chirp-dependent control {{of the formation of}} these filaments. In addition, we developed a novel algorithm for extracting the phase and electric field of these pulses using Frequency Resolved Optical Gating coupled to genetic algorithms for pulse retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Imagine {{a packet}} of data {{transmitted}} by radio frequency through the <b>air.</b> This <b>packet</b> appears at two separate antenna ports of a radio receiver. Even though the same data appear at both antennas, a different path in space is associated with each antenna. Any path in space results in signal power reduction and usually in a power redistribution in the allocated frequency band. Both effects enhance the error rate and reduce {{the reliability of the}} decoded data. The receiver usually supports the wireless link only through a single antenna due to cost considerations. This paper focuses on the particular case where the signal at one antenna is strong, but does not efficiently utilize the available frequency band, and at the other antenna the signal is weak, but uniformly distributed over the band. The paper provides a general algorithm for selecting the optimal antenna and explains both quantitatively and qualitatively which antenna should be selected...|$|R

As part of this ritual the scorpions repeatedly raise and cross their tails, push and pull at one another, and then separate. Eventually, {{after a series of}} contractions, the male produces an off-white spermatophore, which contains sperm and hardens on contact with <b>air.</b> After this <b>packet</b> of sperm is introduced to the female's genital opening she becomes aggressive towards her mate and sometimes devours him in an episode of sexual cannibalism.|$|R
40|$|The {{exchange}} of mass (gases, water & salts) between the oceans {{and the atmosphere}} {{is vital to the}} maintenance of life on earth. At high wind velocities most of this exchange is attributable to breaking wave entrained air bubbles. A vertical supported planar plunging jet experiment was used to model the entrainment process. The bubbles were detected with a dual tip conductivity probe and a video camera. At plunging jet velocities below 1. 0 m/s there is no bubble entrainment. This inception velocity appears to have a Froude and Weber number scaling for large rough turbulent jets. At jet velocities up to 5 m/s air appeared to be entrained via intermittent air cavities at the jet - plunge pool intersection. The entrained <b>air</b> <b>packets</b> subsequently break in the two phase free shear layer under the entrainment point. At higher jet velocities there may be partial penetration of the aerated jet surface via pulsating induction cavities plus air entrainment via jet self aeration before impact. Plunging jet air flow data displays the different types of entrainment mechanisms. Mono-phase diffusion models can be successfully adapted to describe the shear layer developing zone. The diffusion of the air bubbles is approximately a Gaussian self similar process. The mean bubble velocity profiles can be modelled using the Goertler Error function or Hyperbolic Tangent models. The bubble spectra is approximately Lognormal with a geometric mean diameter of 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm for a range of jet velocities. A bubble Weber number is found to model the maximum bubble size of approximately 10 mm diameter. An original adaptation of the potential flow solution for the vortex sheet is shown to be a simple and reasonably accurate finite amplitude model for water surface gravity waves, especially in deep water. This model has some interesting features, such as both vertical and horizontal asymmetry and standing wave water profile modelling. A simple and possibly insightful model of wave growth due to the wind is introduced, using a constant sea surface Reynolds number U*. sqrt(L. F) /Gamma, where U* = wind friction velocity, L = wavelength, F = fetch, and Gamma = wave field vortex circulation per wavelength. The results may have application in the modelling of air - sea gas exchanges, predicting breaking wave forces on structures {{and the use of the}} planar plunging jet as an aeration device in industry...|$|R

However, {{much of this}} potential can be realized while working with legacy equipment. By adding modules that interface transparently to existing equipment, continuous telemetry data can be encapsulated in discrete packets for over the <b>air</b> transmission. <b>Packet</b> fields can include header, sequence number and bytes for error detection and correction. The RF packet is transmitted without gaps through a standard serial interface and rate adjusted for the packet overhead – effectively making packetization transparent to a legacy system. The receiver unit performs packet synchronization, error correction, extraction of stream quality metrics and re-encapsulation of the payload data into an internet protocol (IP) packet. These standard packets can then be sent over the existing network transport system to the range control center. At the range control center, the extracted stream quality metrics are used to select the best telemetry source in real-time.

40|$|Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) {{communication}} systems intend to increase safety {{and efficiency of}} the transportation networks. At high vehicle density, the communication channel may become congested, impairing {{the reliability of the}} safety applications. As a counter measure, the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI), proposes the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) framework to control the channel load, by tuning message transmission parameters, such as message rate and transmitting power. In this paper, we analyze a congestion control scheme that follows the DCC framework known as Data Rate-DCC (DR-DCC) for various traffic densities. DR-DCC adjusts the data rate based on channel load measurements thus controlling the <b>air</b> time of <b>packets</b> to avoid congestion. Although tuning the data rate has been proposed before we are not aware of any reported work, where its full potential has been investigated in detail. In this paper we intend to provide more insight on the benefits of this approach by analyzing schemes that aim at optimum data rate for various traffic density cases. The objective is not only to avoid congestion but also to provide optimal support to safety applications. We compare the performance of DR-DCC to another DCC approach based on adjusting transmit power for various traffic density cases. DRDCC outperforms at various traffic densities providing better support to safety applications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple RLC/MAC protocol architecture for a wireless IP (Internet Protocol) network. In {{order to support}} IP-based multimedia services in a wireless network, two different approaches can be used. One approach is to transmit end-to-end IP packets in a multi-hop network, such as a cellular mobile telephone network. In this case IP packets can be transmitted on high data rate air interfaces using a suitable IP header compression technique. Another possibility is to transmit non-IP packets from a UE to a BTS using standard 2 G/ 3 G <b>air</b> interfaces. IP <b>packets</b> can be generated at a BTS by encapsulating received MAC packets on an uplink. On a downlink, an IP packet received from a RAN is fragmented at a BTS for further transmission using a standard air interface. This paper first reviews the end-to-end IP packet transmission strategy based on IP header compression techniques. Next a simple RLC/MAC protocol architecturefor a wireless IP network is proposed. The proposed protocol architecture is suitable for generating IP packets at a BTS by encapsulating MAC packets. IP packet encapsulation delay at a BTS is minimized by using a reservation-based MAC protocol. The MAC protocol uses class-based reservation and priority queuing techniques to satisfy QoS needs of different classes of traffic. The RLC protocol is mapped onto the MAC protocol to minimize signaling overhead. The proposed RLC/MAC layer is simple, flexible, and generates minimum signaling load to maintain high QoS for multimedia traffic. Performance of the RLC/MAC protocol is analyzed using a simulation model...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of satellite {{networks in the}} commercial and military world has pushed the research community towards the solution of important problems related {{to this kind of}} network, which are characterized from the lack of physical hierarchy. One of those important problems is how to design an efficient reliable multicasting protocol for one-hop (flat) networks where the link may present characteristics like high propagation delay and high BER. The existing reliable multicasting protocols are inefficient when applied to flat networks, since those are based on intermediate receivers and local recovery techniques. We introduce the Air Cache, which serves as a fast access memory that is realized on the <b>air</b> and contains <b>packets</b> for the recovery of corrupted or erroneous data packets at the receivers. In this thesis we present two classes of reliable multicasting protocols, which are based on the combination of FEC and ARQ with air caching. The non-adaptive class of protocols (UDPAC, RDPAC, PPAC) is characterized by the static nature of the Air Cache in term of size and content and the second class of protocols (ACDAC, ASPAC, HADAC) is characterized by the dynamic nature of the Air Cache. The objective is to achieve better performance than the existing reliable multicasting protocols in flat hierarchy networks. We evaluate the proposed protocols in terms of the delay, robustness, scalability and the hardware requirements that they pose. The results that we collected prove the effectiveness of air caching when it is combined with traditional techniques like FEC and ARQ...|$|R
