5|$|Traversing <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> {{at night}} was {{considered}} dangerous {{because it was}} the place and time of the ala’s supper; the unfortunate person who stepped on an “ala’s table” could become blind, deaf, or lame. Ale gather at night on the eves of greater holidays, divert men from their ways into gullies, and torture them there by riding them like horses.|$|E

Dean claims that he is not scared of his impending death, but Sam challenges this. Dean eventually relents, agreeing to behave more like his old self again. The two then prepare to wait out the night.|$|E

5|$|The {{stories were}} written when Irish {{nationalism}} {{was at its}} peak and {{a search for a}} national identity and purpose was raging; at <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.|$|E
5|$|Art in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} artistic production within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and {{the adoption of the}} Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. In the early Middle Ages, there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it {{can be seen in the}} extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata suggests that it was one of the places, as <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> between cultures, where the Insular style developed.|$|E

5|$|By 1951, Dawson Creek {{had more}} than 3,500 residents. In 1952, the John Hart Highway linked the town {{to the rest of}} the British Columbia Interior and Lower Mainland through the Rocky Mountains; a new {{southbound}} route, known locally as Tupper Highway, made the town <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> with neighbouring Alberta. The next year, western Canada's largest propane gas plant was built and federal government offices were established in town. In 1958, the extension of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway to the Peace from Prince George was completed, and the village was re-incorporated as a city. Between 1951 and 1961, the population of Dawson Creek more than tripled. The RCAF center reemerged on 1 October 1956 and was declared functional in 1958. It was disbanded a final time in March 1964.|$|E
5|$|Desperate to {{save his}} brother, Dean sells his soul to <b>a</b> <b>Crossroads</b> Demon (Ona Grauer) in {{exchange}} for Sam's resurrection, and is given only one year before collection is due. They later conduct research at Bobby's home, hoping to determine Azazel's plan. Ellen Harvelle (Samantha Ferris), owner of the now-destroyed Roadhouse, then arrives, and is forced to drink holy water to prove {{that she is not}} possessed by a demon. After giving them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe, she points out five X's that have been marked, representing frontier churches built by Samuel Colt—hunter and creator of the mystical Colt, a gun capable of killing anything. Research also shows that railway lines connect all the churches {{in the form of a}} pentagram, creating a giant devil's trap that demons cannot enter.|$|E
5|$|For {{more than}} 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been {{inhabited}} by agricultural and sedentary people. The region became <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> of civilizations. The earliest {{of these were}} the legendary Sao, known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the Kanem Empire, the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's Sahelian strip {{by the end of}} the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, Sultanate of Bagirmi and Wadai Empire emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. These states, at least tacitly Muslim, never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves. In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.|$|E

5|$|Government troops killed Jonas Savimbi on 22 February 2002, in Moxico province. UNITA Vice President António Dembo took over, but {{died from}} {{diabetes}} 12days later on 3 March, and Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba became UNITA's leader. After Savimbi's death, the government came to <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> {{over how to}} proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier. Morgado did say that he had not heard from Angola since Savimbi's death. The military commanders signed a Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the Lusaka Protocol in Luena on 4 April, with Santos and Lukambo observing.|$|E
5|$|Route 56 heads {{through a}} mix of farms and woodland, passing {{to the south of}} Rainbow Lake. Past the lake, the road turns to the east and {{continues}} into agricultural areas and intersects CR 655. Traveling eastward, the road crosses CR 638 and a Winchester and Western Railroad line. The route heads into forested areas, where it passes over the Maurice River into Vineland in Cumberland County. Here, it widens into a four-lane divided highway and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 55. Past this interchange, Route 56 becomes a four-lane undivided road that is locally maintained. The route heads through commercial sectors of Vineland before coming to <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> with CR 628. The route continues past more inhabited areas and businesses before reaching its end at Route 47 (Delsea Drive). From here, Landis Avenue continues to the east toward the downtown area of Vineland.|$|E
5|$|Route 70 {{crosses the}} Pennsauken Creek into Evesham Township, Burlington County, running east through more {{commercial}} areas within the Marlton {{section of the}} township. A short distance later, the route intersects Route 73 at an interchange that was formerly the Marlton Circle. After the Marlton Circle, the road heads east passing through some more commercial areas and then into residential neighborhoods that are separated from the road by trees, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. It continues into a mix of suburban development and rural woods and farms as it crosses into Medford Township, coming to <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> with CR 618. From this intersection, Route 70 continues east through the Medford area, passing a couple shopping centers before crossing CR 541. After the CR 541 intersection, the route leaves the suburban development and runs through a mix of woodland and farmland with occasional homes. It enters Southampton Township, where the road enters more wooded surroundings before coming to U.S. Route 206 at the Red Lion Circle.|$|E

5|$|Route 72 {{begins at}} the Four Mile Circle {{intersection}} with Route 70, CR 644, and CR 646 in Woodland Township, Burlington County, heading to the southeast on Barnegat Road, a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through heavily wooded areas of the Pine Barrens that {{are a part of}} the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest. The road passes near a state hospital before coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 563. Past CR 563, the route continues through the Pine Barrens, passing under an abandoned railroad line prior to a junction with CR 532. Here, Route 72 forms a concurrency with CR 532 and the road enters Barnegat Township in Ocean County, where it comes to <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> with CR 539. From this intersection, Route 72 and CR 532 continue to a junction with CR 610, where CR 532 splits from the route by heading to the east. A short distance later, the route intersects the western terminus of CR 554, which continues along Barnegat Road, and Route 72 turns to the south-southeast through more wooded areas.|$|E
5|$|Route 73 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 322 (Black Horse Pike) in Folsom, Atlantic County, {{heading to the}} northwest on Blue Anchor Road, a two-lane undivided county-maintained road signed as County Route 561 Spur. This portion of the route is officially considered a part of Route 73 but is not signed as such. The road runs through forested areas of the Pine Barrens with some homes and farms, coming to <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> with Route 54. Following this intersection, the road continues northwest as Mays Landing Road, crossing over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. It enters a small corner of Hammonton before it crosses into Winslow Township in Camden County. Here, Route 73 crosses over a Southern Railroad of New Jersey railroad line and intersects County Route 725. From this point, the road heads north to a partial interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway that has access from southbound Route 73 to the eastbound Atlantic City Expressway and from the westbound Atlantic City Expressway to northbound Route 73.|$|E
5|$|The forces {{commanded}} by the 7th SS Division were organised into northern, {{central and southern}} columns. The northern column consisted of Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion and included a company of tanks. It moved swiftly southwest from its start point near Banja Luka, and had reached Čađavica (at <b>a</b> <b>crossroads</b> halfway between Mrkonjić Grad and Ključ) by the evening of 25 May, brushing off the 16th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division deployed on the right flank of its axis of advance. The rapid advance meant that the 13th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division was unable to organise an effective defence. The 39th Krajina Division then ordered the 13th Krajina Brigade to block the road from Čađavica to Ključ {{in order to prevent}} the loss of Ključ, but only one battalion of the brigade managed to reach that position by dawn on 26 May.|$|E
