40|$|This study {{reports on}} an {{electrochemical}} capacitive properties of nickel tetraaminophthalocyanine (NiTAPc), nickel tetraaminophthalocyanine incorporated with Nickel oxide (NiTAPc-NiO) and nickel oxide incorporated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NiO-MWCNT), using three different techniques known as successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR), electrodeposition and dip-dry. This study also {{reports on the}} effect of undoped polymer of poly-pyrrole on NiTAPc. The physical properties of the synthesised materials were investigated using SEM and EDX and the electrochemical properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The supercapacitive properties of NiTAPc film on nickel foam showed <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> capacitance of 416. 0 Fg- 1, a maximum power density of 15. 50 x 103 WKg- 1 and <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> energy of 66. 0 WhKg- 1. The NiO-MWCNT film on nickel foam gave <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> capacitance of 1034. 0 Fg- 1, a maximum power density of 10. 41 x 103 WKg- 1 and <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> energy of 132. 0 WhKg- 1. The NiTAPc-NiOE film on nickel foam was found to possess <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> capacitance of 1117. 0 Fg- 1, a maximum power density of 20. 48 x 103 WKg- 1 and <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> energy of 119. 0 WhKg- 1. The NiTAPc-NiOE-S film on nickel foam gave <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> capacitance of 1279. 0 Fg- 1, a maximum power density of 26. 96 x 103 WKg- 1 and <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> energy of 114. 0 WhKg- 1. Finally, the NiO mixed with an oxidant (NiOS-ox) film on nickel foam gave <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> capacitance of 1403. 0 Fg- 1, power density of 14. 44 x 103 WKg- 1 and <b>a</b> maximum <b>specific</b> energy of 147. 0 WhKg - 1. In addition, the electrodes were found to be very stable even after repetitive cycling. These electrodes have clearly proved that they may be suitable for use as potential supercapacitors. Further research is necessary to fully explore their supercapacitive behaviour in single cell (2 -electrode) systems. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

50|$|A modern civil {{turbofan}} has <b>a</b> low <b>specific</b> thrust (~30 lbf/(lb/s)) to {{keep the}} jet noise at an acceptable level, and to achieve low fuel consumption, because <b>a</b> low <b>specific</b> thrust helps to improve specific fuel consumption (SFC). This low specific thrust is usually achieved with a high bypass ratio. Additionally <b>a</b> low <b>specific</b> thrust implies that the engine is relatively large in diameter, for the net thrust it produces. Consequently such aircraft engines are normally located externally, in a separate nacelle or pod, attached to the wing, or the rear fuselage.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{one-to-one}} mappings between {{features and}} system components and parameters, the CA uses a basic {{set of four}} reconfiguration operations to instruct the CM, namely: add (feature selected), remove (feature deselected), replace (one feature selected and other deselected in an alternative relationship), and update component (feature representing a component parameter is selected or deselected). However these operations do not have <b>an</b> <b>specific</b> semantics. For instance, adding a component can mean to deploy it on a particular slot {{of the system that}} requires <b>an</b> <b>specific</b> interface, or it can mean to connect a new component with an already deployed one, among others. The Component Manager and operation classes must be extended in order to apply the approach on a particular system and provide semantics to these operations.|$|R
