40|$|In {{the last}} decades, rural tourism {{has spread to}} all countries. This {{has been seen as}} part of an {{increasing}} farm diversification to solve the crisis of the agricultural sector. The prospect of financial grants has caused different kinds of interventions and effects on the landscape. The results have not always respected the sense of place, neither the identity of rural landscape recommendations of the Europe landscape convention. Looking at the problems surveyed in the rural landscapes of Northern Italy, this paper re-views how to implement the principles of sustainable tourism to enhance working farms and local identity. It examines how those principles can be translated into practice, identifying new and innovative ways for individual operators and stakeholders. A web page is introduced as interactive guide-lines for future practitioners. Identifying markers of sustainability which define the links between the farm and its environment, it guides to reusing old farm buildings, {{in a manner that is}} able to revitalise the agricultural landscape and/or promote novel alternatives to the tourism-residential function envisaged by the redevelopment policies currently in force. As Web-based decision support system for ru-ral land, it assists the users in their day-to-day decisions on considering of the costs and the benefits for environment and landscape of alternative types of rural tourism businesses and helps planning authorities to develop a marketing project to expand forms of <b>agri-tourisms</b> able to creating employment and increasing the appeal of agriculture to younger generations...|$|R

50|$|It {{was within}} this context of pineapples, tourism and Big Things that Taylor Family Investments Pty Ltd {{purchased}} a 23 hectare pineapple farm southeast of Woombye in January 1971, from Gordon Ollett. Bill Taylor had worked at the United Nations for 20 years and had been head of the Development Finance Section, and Lyn Taylor was an interior designer in New York City. They returned to Australia in 1970. In 1971 Bill and Lyn Taylor embarked on {{what was then a}} new concept in <b>agri-tourism,</b> using Maroochy's agricultural heritage to attract tourists. The pineapple farm became an <b>agri-tourism</b> project showcasing over 40 varieties of fruits, nuts, spices and sugar cane: the Sunshine Plantation. The Maroochy Shire Council and the Queensland Government supported the venture, and on 15 August 1971 the plantation was opened by the State Minister for Labour and Tourism, John Herbert. Mr Herbert claimed that the attraction was unique for the Queensland tourist industry, combining the specific promotion of tourism with the promotion of the area and its tropical production as a whole. A 1980 promotional booklet for the Sunshine Plantation claimed that in 1971 the concept and design was original and unique in the world.|$|E

50|$|This {{concept has}} gained {{currency}} {{in the small}} farm policy debate, {{in response to the}} concern that the farm value of the consumer food dollar continues to decrease. Value added agriculture might be a means for farmers to capture a larger share of the consumer food dollar. Examples include direct marketing; farmer ownership of processing facilities; and producing farm products with a higher intrinsic value (such as identity-preserved grains, organic produce, hormone-free beef, free-range chickens; etc.), for which buyers are willing to pay a higher price than for more traditional bulk commodities. Value-added agriculture is regarded by some as a significant rural development strategy. Small-scale, organic food processing, non-traditional crop production, <b>agri-tourism,</b> and bio-fuels development are examples of various value-added projects that have created new jobs in some rural places.|$|E

5000|$|The Golden Nematode {{infestation}} and {{the resultant}} ban on root crop growth, especially potatoes, had both direct and indirect consequences for the Saanich Peninsula community. Foremost, several large-scale farms were forced to sell portions of their land, encouraging a trend away from industrial farming and toward smaller-scale farming on the Peninsula. Additionally, the Peninsula farmers were forced to look to alternate crops and <b>agri-tourism</b> solutions to remain afloat; the Golden Nematode Order [...] banned the growth of potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, which together account for approximately 50% of all fresh vegetables consumed by Canadians. Without access to this {{substantial portion of the}} market, Peninsula farmers sought alternate crops, which included kiwis, berries, and grapes. Thus, combined with outside competition and new industries taking priority, the farming industry has substantially diminished on the Saanich Peninsula. It has been suggested that while fifty years ago, over 90% of food on the Peninsula was grown locally, by 2004 this percentage had dropped below 10%.|$|E
