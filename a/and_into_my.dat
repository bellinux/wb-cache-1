25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mind flashed what I {{had told}} Fortini when {{he pressed his}} {{insolence}} on me.|$|E
50|$|So I {{grow more}} <b>and</b> more <b>into</b> <b>my</b> inner happiness.|$|R

60|$|His face became grave all at once. He seized me by both shoulders, <b>and</b> looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> face.|$|R

60|$|He {{put an arm}} {{about my}} shoulder, fondly as a father might have done, and so led me below again <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mother's presence.|$|E

60|$|The {{letter was}} written <b>and</b> given <b>into</b> <b>my</b> hands. I myself {{put it into}} the post-box in the village that evening.|$|R
60|$|I {{finished}} breakfast <b>and</b> went <b>into</b> <b>my</b> tent for something--I forget what, {{for wild}} yells from Emett and Jim brought me flying out again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Up those stairs <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> {{room with}} you!" [...] said Crispin shortly. [...] "I {{will try to}} head them off. Come, man, stir yourself; they are here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo!" [...] shouted Lumley and Spooner simultaneously, as they bounded {{rather than}} rose from my bed. Before they {{had crossed the}} {{threshold}} I was out of bed <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> trousers.|$|E
6000|$|... "The cider went up my nose!" [...] cried Cainy, {{as soon as}} {{he could}} speak; [...] "and now 'tis gone down my neck, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> poor dumb felon, and over my shiny buttons and all my best cloze!" ...|$|E

60|$|I clumb up {{the shed}} <b>and</b> crept <b>into</b> <b>my</b> window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.|$|R
60|$|I laughed. She laughed. We {{both looked}} at one another; {{and the next thing}} I {{remember}} was that I had drawn down Isaline's plump little face close to mine, and was kissing it vigorously, in spite of an acute darting pain at each kiss all along my spine <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> marrow-bones. Poor M. Claude was utterly forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... 6. What {{think you}} did Agnes see in Christ, when rejoicingly she went to meet the soldier that was {{appointed}} to be her executioner. I will willingly, said she, receive into my paps the length of this sword, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> breast will draw the force thereof, even to the hilts; that thus I, being married to Christ my spouse, may surmount and escape all the darkness of this world? P. 122.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not seek}} to explain the mystery which had brought her across the sea into that little garden of Mrs. Temple's <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> heart. There she was now enthroned, deified; that she would always be there I accepted. That I would never say or do {{anything}} not in consonance with her standards I knew. That I would suffer much I was sure, but the lees of that suffering I should hoard because they came from her.|$|E
60|$|She took {{my face in}} {{her hands}} <b>and</b> looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> eyes, saying no word. Then she leaned forward, and very gently touched my {{forehead}} with her lips.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught me}} viciously {{by the arm}} <b>and</b> looked sharply <b>into</b> <b>my</b> face.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled himself}} {{together}} {{and struggled to}} his feet. Then he looked round the room <b>and</b> finally <b>into</b> <b>my</b> anxious face, with an odd little laugh, strained and unnatural.|$|R
60|$|I went {{among young}} women next, and I found them no better. Fair words and fair pretences; but I {{penetrated}} below those assertions {{of themselves and}} depreciations of me, and they were no better. Before I left them, I learned that I had no grandmother and no recognised relation. I carried the light of that information both into my past <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> future. It showed me many new occasions on which people triumphed over me, when they made a pretence of treating me with consideration, or doing me a service.|$|E
60|$|My indignation ebbed away, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> being {{rushed the}} tides of fear. I saw at last, clear-eyed, what I was up against. I grew meek and lowly. Each day I {{resolved}} more emphatically {{to make no}} rumpus when I got out. All I asked, when I got out, {{was a chance to}} fade away from the landscape. And that was just what I did do when I was released. I kept my tongue between my teeth, walked softly, and sneaked for Pennsylvania, a wiser and a humbler man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, child. It is not {{anything}} you have done, {{or that you}} have left undone. But I took you into my house <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> heart, and only asked you to love and trust me, and you forgot it all in a moment, and were ready to believe the worst of me. A stranger told you that I had secretly planned your destruction, and you at once believed it. How could you find it in your heart to believe such a thing of me--a thing so horrible, so impossible?" ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not answer}} her. I could not. She leaned forward <b>and</b> looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> face, <b>and</b> {{instantly}} her tone changed. Her soft fingers clutched mine for a moment.|$|R
60|$|I {{started to}} my feet, looked at him, <b>and</b> dropped back <b>into</b> <b>my</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|Again I {{heard the}} whacks of the bamboos, <b>and</b> peace flowed <b>into</b> <b>my</b> soul.|$|R
60|$|That was why Nelson had lingered at the bar. Having {{bought a}} drink, he had {{waited for me}} to buy one. I HAD LET HIM BUY SIX DRINKS AND NEVER ONCE OFFERED TO TREAT. And he was the great Nelson! I could feel myself {{blushing}} with shame. I sat down on the stringer-piece of the wharf and buried my face in my hands. And the heat of my shame burned up my neck <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> cheeks and forehead. I have blushed many times in my life, but never have I experienced so terrible a blush as that one.|$|E
60|$|Suffice it that I {{submitted}} {{and went}} through with the cruel infliction of a shave by a French barber; tears of exquisite agony coursed down my cheeks now and then, but I survived. Then the incipient assassin held a basin of water under my chin and slopped its contents over my face, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> bosom, and {{down the back of}} my neck, with a mean pretense of washing away the soap and blood. He dried my features with a towel and was going to comb my hair, but I asked to be excused. I said, with withering irony, that it was sufficient to be skinned--I declined to be scalped.|$|E
60|$|But it was {{the cold}} that was most distressing. I felt that I could survive but a few minutes. People were {{struggling}} and floundering in the water about me. I could hear them crying out to one another. And I heard, also, the sound of oars. Evidently the strange steamboat had lowered its boats. As the time went by I marvelled that I was still alive. I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs, while a chilling numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it. Small waves, with spiteful foaming crests, continually broke over me <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mouth, sending me off into more strangling paroxysms.|$|E
