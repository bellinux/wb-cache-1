2500|$|Later that night, the {{president}} of Pride FC made a public apology to Mezger at the Tokyo Dome for the miscommunication. Braverman added, [...] "We had a big meeting (with PRIDE). We {{were able to get}} some concessions out of them, money and guarantees of future fights. They wanted to make it right. One thing I said in the meeting was, [...] "Do you want me to call Kenny back in here <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says?" [...] "No, no, no, no!" ...|$|E

[...] The paper stated that he was the Indian who killed General Custer! [...] The chief and his people had been held prisoners of war, and now here they were to appear in a Philadelphia theater. [...] So I determined to go <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to say, and what he was really in the East for. [...] I had to pay fifty cents for a ticket. [...] The theater was decorated with many Indian trappings such as were used by the Sioux tribe of which I was a member.|$|E

2500|$|For the {{recording}} of Wah Wah, Eno {{enlisted the help of}} engineer Markus Dravs to work as a co-producer, [...] "providing distraction" [...] to the band inside a secondary studio inside the Real World Studios complex from {{the recording}} of Laid, which was being recorded in one of the complex's larger studios. Eno recalled in June 1993 that he wanted Dravs [...] "to look at the improvisations <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could make of them" [...] while he [...] and James carried on recording Laid. Each improvisation started with the band recording a jam session improvisation, and then Eno or Dravs would then select a [...] "promising" [...] part of the improvised music and mix it, but with only one take on each mix to keep in the improvisation spirit. According to Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club, each piece would be [...] "whisked away" [...] to Dravs [...] "straightaway" [...] for studio [...] "tinkering" [...] after the initial jamming process. Bassist Jim Glennie recalled that [...] "it {{was a bit of a}} production line: We’d jam, those would go over to Markus to start properly messing about with. I think Brian was happy for us to be actively involved in that process, to try and keep it away from the main studio." [...] Booth was then left to come up with lyrics, but many of the tracks ultimately remained instrumentals or had soundbites rather than coherent structured lyrics.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, well; {{what with}} one thing and another this day will cost me a pretty penny!' said Loveday, bustling off to the cellar, which he found to be several inches deep in {{stagnant}} liquor. 'John, how can I welcome 'ee?' he continued hopelessly, on {{his return to the}} room. 'Only go <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{struck me}} as {{significant}} that he’d seen a doctor,” Osborne remarked. “The bottle proves that. From the careful directions about the dose {{it must have been}} made up from a prescription. Anyway, he’s been overdoing it lately, and perhaps you had better go along <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> about.

6000|$|... "You shall, if necessary. But {{it is only}} proper {{that you}} should first tell your husband {{distinctly}} that you are without any, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was in {{a regular}} daze all dinner, {{wondering}} whether that chap next door wasn't over the fence and filling 'is pockets. But in the afternoon I got easier in my mind--it seemed to me it must 'ave been there so long it was pretty sure to stop a bit longer--and I {{tried to get up}} a bit of a discussion to dror out the old man <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>'E</b> thought of treasure trove." ...|$|R

6000|$|But this didn't dismay the Colonel one atom. [...] "Why, {{of course}} there isn't," [...] he said. [...] "You don't suppose you'd find Saloonio there! That's the whole art of it! That's Shakespeare! That's the whole gist of it! He's kept clean out of the Personae--gives him scope, gives him a free hand, makes him more of a type than ever.
