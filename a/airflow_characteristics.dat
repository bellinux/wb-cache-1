40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} is structured vertically into several conceptual sublayers because the main <b>airflow</b> <b>characteristics,</b> e. g. the velocity field, air temperature, and air moisture, show different height dependent features. To investigate mean <b>airflow</b> <b>characteristics</b> over a Scots pine forest {{up to several}} stand heights, remote sensing and in situ measurements (profile and eddy covariance method) were conducted at the forest meteorological experimental site Hartheim in the Upper Rhine Valley. This methodological combination enables the continuous measurement of the main <b>airflow</b> <b>characteristics</b> exceeding the measuring range of tower-based measurements. Up to now <b>airflow</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the atmospheric boundary layer over forests exceeding the range of tower-based instrumentation are little experimentally studied because - remote sensing devices for operational use are available only for a short time, - of the extensive infrastructure and the problematic experimental setup. Therefore, <b>airflow</b> <b>characteristics</b> above and within forests were often studied based on selected time series and in a narrow range of atmospheric stability conditions when air-flow characteristics were most pronounced (Lu and Fitzjarrald, 1994; Brunet and Irvine, 2000). Furthermore, most of the knowledge of turbulent <b>airflow</b> <b>characteristics</b> and air mass exchange processes between tall plant canopies and the atmosphere has been gained of studies in relatively dense plant canopies (Green et al., 1995; Poggi et al., 2004).
