Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. These products include detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as ethylene glycol, ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers, and other compounds. Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance.

40|$|About {{one third}} of all {{synthetic}} drugs are produced {{in the form of}} racemates, containing two enantiomers of the same substance, although only one of them is effective. Studies on racemic <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>gases</b> indicate that pure enantiomers may have better pharmacological properties in comparison to the racemate. In order to design improved anaesthetics, it is important to further investigate the mechanism of the action of pure enantiomers and to develop efficient methods of their separation. In this work fluorinated volatile anaesthetics like isoflurane, enflurane and desflurane are investigated. There are different processes for separation of these gases, like capillary chromatography, as well as more advanced multi-column options like Simulated Moving Beds (SMB) and Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA).

40|$|Hospital {{management}} is often confronted with discussions concerning (re) {{building of the}} operating theatre. Criteria regarding working conditions and well-being of the staff cannot easily be set. In order to get more insight, relevant aspects were studied interdependently. These were climate, illumination, acoustics, ventilation of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>gases</b> and concentration of bacteria and dust particles in the operating-room air. The influence of working postures and movements of the operating-room personnel on air quality is briefly characterized. Most measurements were performed during open-heart surgeries, although for some a simulation needed to be set up. Some remarkable results were found. Ventilation systems do not operate as was intended because of the heat production of the surgical team. Microcirculations originating thereof may cause high local concentrations of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>gases</b> and heavily contaminated spots in the incision area. The hierarchical air pressure distribution in the ward is disturbed by the intense 'traffic'. The static and dynamic load on the surgical team can give rise to complaints. Unless precautions are taken, the indoor climate cannot be comfortable and safe for everybody at the same time. Monjtoring systems have to be developed to check the quality of ventilation systems, to visualize microcirculations with respect to bacteria and <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>gases,</b> and to synchronize all different registrations.
