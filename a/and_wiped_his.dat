2500|$|In the Gospel of John, a Mary {{appears in}} {{connection}} to two incidents: the raising {{from the dead}} of her brother Lazarus and the anointing of Jesus. The identification of this being the same Mary in both incidents is given explicitly by the author: [...] "Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> feet with her hair." [...] The mention of her sister Martha suggests a connection with the aforementioned woman in Luke.|$|E

We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart. And now ..." [...] "Don't Be Cruel", which was, after a short introduction by Elvis, followed by [...] "Love Me Tender". According to Elaine Dundy, Presley sang [...] "Love Me Tender" [...] "straight, subdued and tender ... —a very different Elvis from the one on The Steve Allen Show three months before".|$|E

[...] He then started telling the audience all about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, generally spoken as the ‘Custer massacre.’ [...] He [...] mentioned how the Sioux were all prepared for battle, and how they had swooped down on Custer <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> soldiers all out. [...] He told so many lies that I had to smile. [...] Then {{the white man}} said that all those who wished to shake hands with Sitting Bull would please line up if they cared to meet the man who had killed Custer. [...] It made me wonder what sort of people the whites were, anyway. [...] Perhaps they were glad to have Custer killed, and were really pleased to shake the hand with the man who had killed him!" ...|$|E
