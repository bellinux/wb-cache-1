5|$|On 11 May the Dutch {{commander}} General Winkelman {{was faced}} with two priorities. First of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the German airborne troops. Though the strategic assault had failed, he feared a further enemy build-up via Waalhaven and saw the German possession of the Moerdijk bridges as a serious impediment to the movement of allied reinforcements to the Fortress Holland. The second priority was {{closely related to the}} first: enabling the French army to build up a strong defensive line in North Brabant, to connect the Fortress Holland with the Allied main force in Belgium. As he had withdrawn most of his troops from the area, Winkelman had only limited means available to influence this process, largely leaving the task to local commanders.|$|E
25|$|When war {{appeared}} inevitable {{he resigned}} his Royal commission and volunteered his {{services to the}} colonies. He expected to be named Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, as {{he was the most}} experienced candidate in terms of military service. On the other hand, he was born in Britain, somewhat eccentric, slovenly in appearance, coarse in language, and perhaps most of <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be paid: by joining the rebellion, he forfeited all his properties in England, and wanted to be compensated.|$|E
25|$|Rabi {{felt that}} {{to compete with}} the University of Chicago, Columbia needed to have access to a {{research}} reactor too; but the cost was greater than Columbia could afford without collaborating with other institutions, government assistance, or both. On January 16, 1946, Pegram convened a meeting of representatives of 16 different colleges, universities, hospitals and research institutions like the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The meeting drafted a request to the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., asking him to establish a regional research laboratory near New York City. In response, Groves sent Colonel Kenneth Nichols to meet with Pegram and Rabi and their opposite numbers from Princeton University, Hugh S. Taylor and Henry D. Smyth on February 8. They found Nichols amenable to their idea; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know was where it would be built, and who would run it.|$|E

6000|$|... "The same, that he's a plant now, {{and has no}} more {{interest}} in being a Patrolman. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do is sit in the sun. It's the damnedest thing I ever heard." ...|$|R
500|$|Knowing that Liz {{will not}} break off with Danny, Jack tells Danny {{he knows about}} the two. He lies to Danny by telling him he cares for Liz, hoping that Danny [...] will end it with Liz, which he does. After Sue returns from a night of partying, Tracy tells her that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do {{was to be a}} father figure to her. Liz enters Tracy's {{dressing}} room—with the mustache intact—to take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz had been looking for her. At the end, Tracy wonders if he can go through his experience with Sue if he has a daughter, to which Kenneth says he thinks he can.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was taken}} to church when he was 10, and from then he read the Bible, {{becoming}} engrossed, and completing a dozen readings {{by the time he}} was 12. In May 1889, while reading the Bible in his hut in the woods, he 'saw' a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered, and asked him what he wanted most of all. He was frightened, but he said that most of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> help others, especially sick children. [...] He decided he would like to be a missionary.|$|E
2500|$|Demonstrating {{early on}} a {{creative}} and quirky bent, in his junior year at Princeton, Kelley submitted a paper for a political science class about John F. Kennedy's plot to kill Fidel Castro, written as a poem. For his senior thesis, he turned the Bill of Rights into a play. [...] "I made each amendment into a character", he said. [...] "The First Amendment is a loudmouth guy who won't shut up. The Second Amendment guy, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> talk about was his gun collection. Then the 10th Amendment, the one where they say leave the rest for the states to decide, {{he was a guy}} with no self-esteem." [...] Also while at Princeton, {{he was a member of}} the Princeton Triangle Club.|$|E
60|$|BANNAL. There can be {{no doubt}} of that: {{everybody}} knows it. But Shaw doesnt write his plays as plays. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do is to insult everybody all round and set us talking about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep mum," [...] 'Frisco Kid {{whispered to}} him while the irate Frenchman was busy {{fastening}} the painter. [...] "Don't talk back. Let him say <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to,</b> and keep quiet. It 'll {{be better for}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} every man gets one {{and tell him}} <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know. I dare not put down too much in black and white. They are to be round at the rise behind the depot at six Thursday night." ...|$|R
2500|$|Limestone Lad was {{scheduled}} to be offered for sale as a three-year-old gelding at Tattersalls Ireland in June 1995, but was withdrawn from the auction after the auctioneer's vet found that he had an abnormal heartbeat. The gelding was officially trained throughout his racing career by James Bowe, although the day-to-day handling was managed by his son Michael on the family farm which was also home to 60 cattle and 150 sheep. Commenting on the process of training the horse Michael Bowe said [...] "Everything you taught him, you had to do it slowly and carefully - but once he picked it up he would die or do it. He was so genuine, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was to please you". [...] He was often subjected to demanding schedules, with few breaks: Bowe explained the strategy by saying [...] "He is happiest racing frequently and the more you take him racing the more he likes it".|$|E

60|$|And then Wade {{perceived}} that, like a flash, the old spirit {{leaped up}} in Columbine. It was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see.|$|E
5000|$|Ali dreams big - <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be {{with the}} girl he loves, but he’s been promised to another girl at his father’s mosque. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be the great doctor that the {{community}} expects him to be, but he doesn’t get the marks. And above <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> make his father proud. Really proud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal', wal'," [...] said Captain Kittridge, [...] "as {{to dress}}in' this 'ere child,--why, ef Pennel's {{a mind to}} dress her in cloth of gold, it's none of our business! He's rich enough for <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do, and so let's eat our breakfast and mind our own business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't {{you believe}} that was success enough for any {{reasonable}} mortal? Wouldn't you say that, with a wife holding an honored and great position in the State, and his daughter by his side, he'd settle down out there and live a respectable, decent life? Not <b>he!</b> First of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> travel.|$|R
6000|$|... "He got {{after me}} when he saw he was corraled," [...] Lister replied, and narrated his {{struggle}} on the platform. He was now willing to tell Vernon <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know, but saw the other's interest was not keen and they presently {{began to talk about}} something else.|$|E
60|$|At {{that very}} instant Peter looked up {{just in time}} to see a tail disappearing in the little round hole in the side of the bunch of moss. He knew that that tail belonged to Mrs. Sprite, and just that glimpse told him <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he grasped}} my hand. I thought I was doomed {{and he was}} saying good-bye. But <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was to jab a needle into the end of a finger and compare the red drop with a lot of fifty-cent poker chips that he had {{fastened}} to a card.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the moment}} Major Morris was silent. Then {{he turned to}} Ben. [...] "Our mission seems to {{have come to a}} sudden end," [...] he said. [...] "Brownell can tell Colonel Darcy <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know." [...] And he related to the escaped {{prisoner}} the reason for their coming beyond the American lines.|$|R
50|$|Akbar, {{an orphan}} Muslim is an auto driver, whose days {{are all about}} lugging {{passengers}} from one town to another on the highway. But driving an auto is not <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> more in life. His goal is to pass his final year B.com examinations, something he has failed to do now {{three times in a}} row.|$|R
5000|$|According to Eldritch, Steinman mainly {{focussed}} on {{the production}} of the choral singings: [...] "I have to point out that he didn't contribute to the composition or the arrangements. ... That's why he got only half of the production credit on 'Dominion', he's not interested in drums, bass or guitars. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do is the backing vocals and choirs." ...|$|R
60|$|Clennam, however, {{finding him}} already {{beginning}} to be pacified, had said <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say, and more. He wrung his hand, only adding, 'Blind leaders of the blind, Pancks! Blind leaders of the blind! But Doyce, Doyce, Doyce; my injured partner!' That brought his {{head down on the}} desk once more.|$|E
60|$|The Rovers {{had drawn}} {{to one side}} to talk over the {{situation}} while Barney Stevenson was preparing to accompany them from the cave. The old man was both excited and worried. He cared little about the wound he had received on the head. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was to get back his treasure box, as he called it.|$|E
60|$|Everybody was in bed. He {{looked at}} himself. His face was {{discoloured}} and smeared with blood, {{almost like a}} dead man's face. He washed it, and went to bed. The night went by in delirium. In the morning he found his mother looking at him. Her blue eyes--they were <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see. She was there; he was in her hands.|$|E
5000|$|Mayor Swift - The Senior Mayor of Splittsboro, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{do is to}} see Maxum Man, which {{happened}} once in [...] "Ain't No Party Like a Maxum Brain Party".

6000|$|... "I {{have put}} the boy into the cellar for, at the moment, I could see {{nothing else to do}} with him. But really, the routine he is {{learning}} is of little importance, and there is no occasion for him to learn to do these things himself. He would pick up <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know there, when he came back, in a very short time." ...|$|R
60|$|But most of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> vindicate {{himself in}} the eyes of the once-hated law. He wanted to clear his record of the unjust charge of murder which had sent him scurrying out of Chicago over a year before, that night that Patrolman Stanley Lasky of the Lake Street Station had tipped him off that Sheehan had implicated him in the murder of old man Schneider.|$|E
60|$|He {{found her}} {{spinning}} in an underground chamber, but {{quite ready to}} tell him <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know. In answer to his questions he learned {{that in order to}} win the hand of the princess it was not enough to be born a prince, for she would marry nobody who had not proved himself faithful, and had, besides, all those talents and accomplishments which help to make people happy.|$|E
60|$|When he {{went off}} Cartwright smiled, but soon {{afterwards}} he put his cigar-case {{in his pocket and}} told Gavin he was going out. He thought he knew where to find the cattle boat's shore-engineer, and when he did so the waitress gave them a table at which they would not be disturbed. In half an hour Cartwright had found out <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know, and returning to his office, he smoked and mused.|$|E
50|$|Javi {{has landed}} a job driving a sound truck that plays the same radio spot for pasta all day long, while his buddy Leche, who is {{supposed}} to be studying for his exams, instead finds himself having sexual fantasies about his tutor, and Seba is waylaid by a handful of small-time dope dealers when <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do is go home and watch the porno movie he's just rented.|$|R
50|$|After a while, Heather {{begins to}} doubt the {{veracity}} of Lloyd's feelings for her, wondering if {{it might not be}} the effect of the drugs after all.

50|$|After {{his roommate}} {{committed}} suicide, Marco(Luca Guastini) begins {{to realize that}} his life {{is very similar to}} his friend's. Perhaps even more hopeless. A lack of prospects and a strong sense of inadequacy only darken his mood. Deep in crisis, the young man asks his brother Davide(Nicola Garofalo) to travel with him to the Netherlands, where <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> accomplish what his friend Maurizio(Antonio Calamonici) had so lucidly planned to accomplish: assisted suicide. He confesses that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> end it <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> stop being such an outsider, stop thesuffering.|$|R
