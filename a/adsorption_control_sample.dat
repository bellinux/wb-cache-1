Sodium selenate sample was divided into two parts – one part was control, while another part was treated with the Biofield Energy remotely by twenty renowned Biofield Energy Healers and termed as the treated sample. The PXRD analysis showed that the crystallite size of the treated sample significantly altered in the range of - 50. 01 % to 59. 97 % compared to the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> The average crystallite size of the treated sample was significantly increased by 7. 32 % compared with the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> The PSD analysis indicated that the particle size of the treated sample at d 10, d 50, and d 90 values were increased by 6. 84 %, 8. 04 %, and 3. 04 %, respectively compared with the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> Thus, the surface area of the Biofield Energy Treated sample was significantly decreased by 7. 41 % compared with the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> The FT-IR spectra indicated the presence of sharp and strong absorption bands at 887 and 888 cm- 1 due to the Se=O stretching in the <b>control</b> and treated <b>sample,</b> respectively. The wavelength of maximum absorbance from the UV-vis spectroscopic analysis of the Biofield Energy Treated sample (205. 2 nm) was increased by 0. 39 % compared to the <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> (204. 4 nm). The TGA analysis revealed the total weight loss of the Biofield Energy Treated sample was significantly reduced by 12. 63 % compared with the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> The DSC analysis showed that the vaporization temperature of the Biofield Energy Treated sample (95. 14 °C) was increased compared to the <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> (94. 28 °C). But, the latent heat of vaporization was decreased significantly in the treated sample by 43. 67 % compared to the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> Thus, The Trivedi Effect® - Consciousness Energy Healing Treatment might lead to generate a new polymorphic form of sodium selenate, which would have better powder flowability and long-term storage stability compared with the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> The Biofield Energy Treated sodium selenate would be helpful for designing better nutraceutical/pharmaceutical formulations against immunological disorders, inflammatory diseases, aging, stress, infectious diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, etc...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Individual probes on an Affymetrix tiling array usually behave differently. Modeling and {{removing}} these probe effects {{are critical for}} detecting signals from the array data. Current data processing techniques either require <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> or use probe sequences to model probe-specific variability, such as with MAT. Although the MAT approach can be applied without <b>control</b> <b>samples,</b> residual probe effects continue to distort the true biological signals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recently, {{researchers}} have been using mass spectroscopy to study cancer. For use of proteomics spectra in a clinical setting, stringent quality-control procedures will be needed. Methods: We pooled samples of nipple aspirate fluid from healthy breasts and breasts with cancer to prepare a <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> Aliquots of the <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> were used on two spots on each of three IMAC ProteinChip ® arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.) on 4 successive days to generate 24 SELDI spectra. In 36 subsequent experiments, the <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> was applied to two spots of each ProteinChip array, and the resulting spectra were analyzed to determine how closely they agreed with the original 24 spectra. Results: We describe novel algorithms that (a) locat...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{investigation}} of influence of different extracts addition on total phenols, anthocyanin content, antioxidant activity and percent of polymeric colour of blackberry juice during storage of 52 days at 4 °C. Anthocyanin content of <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> (blackberry juice without extracts addition) was 149. 91 mg/L. Samples with addition of extracts (olive leaf, pine bark PE 5 : 1, pine bark PE 95 %, green tea, red wine PE 30 %, red wine PE 4 : 1 and bioflavonoids had higher anthocyanin content (from 152. 42 to 161. 19 mg/L) in comparison to <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> Sample with addition of bioflavonoids had the highest anthocyanin content. Samples with addition of extracts had much higher total phenol content and antioxidant activity than <b>control</b> <b>sample,</b> what was expected since extracts are rich in phenols. During storage decrease of phenols, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity occurred in higher or lesser extent, depending on extract type addition. Anthocyanin content in <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> was 119. 85 mg/L. Samples with addition of bioflavonoids, olive leaf, pine bark PE 5 : 1 and red wine PE 4 : 1 had lower (from 103. 44 to 118. 84 mg/L), while other samples had higher (from 131. 99 to 135. 57 mg/L) anthocyanin content than <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> After storage, decrease of anthocyanins was followed with increase of percent of polymeric colour, with exception of samples with addition of green tea...|$|R
