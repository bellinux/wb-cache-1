5|$|The {{constellation}} {{does not}} lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, {{and there are no}} prominent star clusters. NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of active star formation. NGC 37 is a lenticular galaxy of apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. Robert's Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which {{are in the process of}} colliding and merging. They are within <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> of 1.6 arcmin, corresponding to about 75,000 light-years. Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole—the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.|$|E

500|$|Another {{relationship}} between different string theories is T-duality. Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension. T-duality states that a string propagating around <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> [...] {{is equivalent to}} a string propagating around <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> [...] {{in the sense that}} all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has momentum as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the winding number. If a string has momentum [...] and winding number [...] in one description, it will have momentum [...] and winding number [...] in the dual description. For example, type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality, and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by T-duality.|$|E
500|$|The idea of mirror {{symmetry}} can {{be traced}} back to the mid-1980s when it was noticed that a string propagating on <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> [...] is physically equivalent to a string propagating on <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> [...] in appropriate units. This phenomenon is now known as T-duality and is understood to be closely related to mirror symmetry. In a paper from 1985, Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz, Andrew Strominger, and Edward Witten showed that by compactifying string theory on a Calabi–Yau manifold, one obtains a theory roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics that also consistently incorporates an idea called supersymmetry. Following this development, many physicists began studying Calabi–Yau compactifications, hoping to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string theory. Cumrun Vafa and others noticed that given such a physical model, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, there are two Calabi–Yau manifolds that give rise to the same physics.|$|E
500|$|Once the Calabi–Yau {{manifold}} {{has been}} decomposed into simpler parts, mirror symmetry {{can be understood}} in an intuitive geometric way. As an example, consider the torus described above. Imagine that this torus represents the [...] "spacetime" [...] for a physical theory. The fundamental objects of this theory will be strings propagating through the spacetime {{according to the rules}} of quantum mechanics. One of the basic dualities of string theory is T-duality, which states that a string propagating around <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> [...] is equivalent to a string propagating around <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> [...] in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has momentum as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the winding number. If a string has momentum [...] and winding number [...] in one description, it will have momentum [...] and winding number [...] in the dual description. By applying T-duality simultaneously to all of the circles that decompose the torus, the radii of these circles become inverted, and one is left with a new torus which is [...] "fatter" [...] or [...] "skinnier" [...] than the original. This torus is the mirror of the original Calabi–Yau.|$|E
50|$|A general Apollonius {{problem can}} be {{transformed}} into the simpler problem <b>of</b> <b>circle</b> tangent to one circle and two parallel lines (itself a special case of the LLC special case). To accomplish this, it suffices to scale {{two of the three}} given circles until they just touch, i.e., are tangent. An inversion in their tangent point with respect to <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> appropriate <b>radius</b> transforms the two touching given circles into two parallel lines, and the third given circle into another circle. Thus, the solutions may be found by sliding <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> constant <b>radius</b> between two parallel lines until it contacts the transformed third circle. Re-inversion produces the corresponding solutions to the original problem.|$|R
