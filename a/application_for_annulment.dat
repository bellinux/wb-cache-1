The elections were originally scheduled for 26 September 2004, but faced technical issues and an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> requested by the opposition, and were held under high political pressure after {{the events of the}} recall referendum of August 2004. The ongoing political crisis in the country and the proximity of the two electoral processes marked the environment of the elections, which were won with an overwhelming margin by the candidates supported by the president, Hugo Chavez.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 July 1898 {{during a}} {{questioning}} in the House, Cavaignac reported three items [...] "overwhelming among a thousand", {{two of which}} had no connection with the case. The other was the [...] "faux Henry". Cavaignac's speech was effective: the MPs gave him an ovation and voted to display copies of the three documents in the 36,000 communes of France. The anti-Dreyfusards had triumphed, but Cavaignac implicitly recognized that the Dreyfus's defence had not had {{access to all the}} evidence. The <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> made by Lucie Dreyfus became admissible. The next day, Colonel Picquart declared in Le Temps to the council president: [...] "I am in a position to establish before a court of competent jurisdiction that the two documents bearing the date of 1894 could not be attributed to Dreyfus and that the one that bears the date of 1896 had all the characteristics of a fake," [...] which earned him eleven months in prison.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, the {{analyses}} of conflicts {{based on the}} observation of legal and administrative litigations are conducted at small administrative unit (department, district, division etc.) level. This choice is justified by two arguments: on the one hand, that particular administrative unit is the territorial unit of reference for many actors, whether they be public actors in charge of land use regulation (prefect, non-central government services), or para-governmental and private actors: Associations {{for the protection of}} the environment generally act at these administrative levels; the same applies to chambers of agriculture or the associations of hunters and fishermen; on the other hand, court rulings generally state precisely where the problem is situated at municipal level (private litigations, <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> of municipal decrees or deliberations) or at departmental level (<b>applications</b> <b>for</b> the <b>annulment</b> of prefectoral decrees).|$|R

40|$|Trying {{to explain}} the {{influence}} of communist ideology on the post-revolutionary Romanian legal system, we sought effective procedures, within legal boundaries, illustrating {{the manner in which}} democratic principles are compromised by old practices. One of these procedures is financing territorial administrative units from the budget reserve fund of the Romanian Government according to political criteria. This research focuses, briefly, on demonstrating the illegality of this activity and on the way to be followed so as to cancel the administrative legal acts covering allocation on political criteria, namely administrative action. The approach doesn’t pretend to be exhaustive, treating all aspects implied by such an action. Therefore, we only talk about those we consider relevant. Responsibility for issuing illegal administrative acts may take different forms: political, criminal or administrative. We believe, in this case, that the best solution is to promote the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> of the act of discrimination in contentious administratively even if pedendi causa, law enforcement, is abstract. A sustained practice in this area would undoubtedly deter excessive executive power by public authorities and strengthen democratic institutions...|$|E
40|$|V diplomskem delu predstavljam Sodišče EU ter spremembe, ki jih je le-to doživelo z Lizbonsko pogodbo. Čeprav Sodišče EU ni osrednja tema Lizbonske pogodbe, je z Lizbonsko pogodbo doživelo nekatere pomembne spremembe. V diplomskem delu analiziram te spremembe ter predstavljam Sodišče EU kot sodni organ Evropske unije. Ker je za analizo sprememb potrebno poznati Sodišče EU kot institucijo EU, v prvem delu diplomskega dela predstavljam Sodišče EU. Glavni poudarki so na sestavi in organizaciji Sodišča EU, pri kompetenčnem vidiku pa na pristojnostih in postopkih pred Sodiščem EU. Lizbonska pogodba je okrepila položaj Sodišča EU na vseh področjih njegovega delovanja. Z Lizbonsko pogodbo se nadaljuje federalizacija EU. Poenostavitev pogojev za denarno kaznovanje držav članic, splošna pristojnost predhodnega odločanja na področju svobode, varnosti in pravice ter ustanovitev odbora, ki poda mnenje o ustreznosti kandidata za položaj sodnika ali generalnega pravobranilca, so nekatere od sprememb, ki gredo v tej smeri. Nujen postopek predhodnega odločanja, ki je po novem urejen v Lizbonski pogodbi, je posledica večjih pristojnosti Sodišča EU na področju svobode, varnosti in pravice. Bolj kot na področju svobode, varnosti in pravice ostajajo omejene pristojnosti Sodišča EU na področju skupne zunanje in varnostne politike. Kljub omejenim pristojnostim Sodišča EU na tem področju, bodo spremembe znatno izboljšale pristojnosti Sodišča EU za presojo omejujočih ukrepov za posameznike. Spremembe na področju ničnostne tožbe so dobrodošle, čeprav morda ne dovolj konkretne. Tako bo predvsem od Sodišča EU odvisno, kako bo razširitev pristojnosti biti vlagatelj ničnostne tožbe delovala v praksi. S tem ko je Listina o temeljnih pravicah EU vključena v »ustavno materijo«, Sodišče EU lahko o njej odloča. Čeprav Lizbonska pogodba ne priznava pravice posameznikov, da neposredno pred Sodiščem EU uveljavljajo varstvo pravic iz Listine in ne velja v Združenem kraljestvu ter na Poljskem, v prihodnosti pa tudi na Češkem, kar pomeni le še večjo diferenciacijo EU, vendarle gre za pomemben korak naprej. The thesis {{presents}} the Court of Justice of the EU and changes to that institution {{brought by the}} Lisbon Treaty. Although the Court of Justice of the EU is not the central theme of the Lisbon Treaty, the latter has brought some significant changes. The thesis analyzes these changes and {{presents the}} Court of Justice of the EU as the judicial body of the European Union. Since {{the analysis of the}} changes requires to know the Court of Justice of the EU as an institution of the EU {{in the first part of}} the thesis I present the Court of Justice of the EU. The main highlights are the composition and organization of the Court of Justice of the EU, and the jurisdiction and proceedings before the Court of Justice of the EU. The Lisbon Treaty has strengthened the position of the Court in all areas of its operation. The Lisbon Treaty continues the federalization of the EU. Simplification of the conditions for financial punishment of the Member States, the general jurisdiction of the preliminary ruling in the area of freedom, security and justice, and creation of a Committee responsible to give its opinion on the appropriateness of the candidates for the position of a Judge or an Advocate-General, are some of the changes that go in that direction. Urgent preliminary ruling procedure, which is now regulated by the Lisbon Treaty is due to increase powers of the Court in the area of freedom, security and justice. More than in the area of freedom, security and justice, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s powers remain limited in the area of common foreign and security policy. Despite the limited jurisdiction of the Court in this area, new powers will significantly improve the Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction to assess the EU 2 ̆ 7 s restrictive measures directed at individuals. Changes in <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> are welcome, though perhaps not enough concrete. This is largely dependent on the Court of Justice of the EU and how the extension of the applicant for annulment will apply in practice. By including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the »constitutional substance« the Court of Justice of the EU may decide on it. Although the Treaty would not recognize a right of individuals to invoked the protection of EU rights in the Charter directly before the Court and it does not apply in the United Kingdom, Poland, in the future as well as the Czech Republic, which means only a greater differentiation of the EU, however, this is a important step forward...|$|E
40|$|Article 173 of the Treaty of Rome allows {{natural and}} legal persons to obtain {{judicial}} review of certain legal acts of the Council or Commission of the European Economic Community (EEC Council or Commission).

Before an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> an <b>annulment</b> is admissible, however, the applicant must show that the legal act is of 2 ̆ 2 direct and individual concern 2 ̆ 2 to him. Yet, the European Court has not clearly interpreted 2 ̆ 2 direct and individual concern 2 ̆ 2 : the locus standi requirement, or the right of appearance in the European Court. The European Court 2 ̆ 7 s unclear interpretation of the locus standi requirement generates uncertainty and reduces the utility of Article 173 (2) as a judicial review provision. he primary objective of this Comment is to help clarify the locus standi requirement in order to reduce uncertainty.

40|$|Locus standi of non-privileged {{applicants}} {{to bring an}} action <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> Abstract Every developed legal system is bound to have a mechanism for checking the procedural and substantive legality of measures adopted by its institutions. In the European Union it was of significant importance to create a system of control over the acts of the EU institutions given the democratic deficit within the Union and the limited supervisory role of the European Parliament. Binding acts of the EU institutions are subject to review through a number of routes provided by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), namely action <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> (Art. 263 TFEU), the plea of illegality (Art. 277 TFEU), the preliminary reference (Art. 267 TFEU) and the action for damages (Arts. 268 and 340 TFEU). The Court has consistently endeavoured to treat the several strands as a complex and coherent system of judicial review within the Union based on the rule of law. The action <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> under Art. 263 TFEU plays a crucial role for individuals as it is in practice the only direct way open to individuals to challenge the acts of EU institutions. The main purpose of my thesis is to examine whether the current wording of Art. 263 (4) TFEU provides for individuals a sufficiently [...] ...|$|R
