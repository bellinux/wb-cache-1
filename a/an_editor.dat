5|$|With {{respect to}} the theory {{that there was a}} single author, as {{initially}} postulated by Dessau, this is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of <b>an</b> <b>editor</b> who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the scriptores. If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then <b>an</b> <b>editor</b> must {{have been involved in the}} project in order to select one scriptors life over another's.|$|E
