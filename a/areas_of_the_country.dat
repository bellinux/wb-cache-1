5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to different <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{for the winter}} of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America.

U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E

5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury {{says that}} the king also seized and {{depopulated}} many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting.
