500|$|This album {{followed}} , {{which was}} released in 1998. Anthrax decided to sign with record label Nuclear Blast {{for the release of}} their upcoming album. Asked if changing the record company will affect the songwriting, guitarist Scott Ian replied: [...] "To be honest, I don't care <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> all. You know, business is business and the creative side is the creative side. Creatively, there was no big challenge. We just wanted {{to try to make the}} best record we can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Down manager James McCartan {{paid tribute}} to Cork [...] "Because I do feel Cork were deserving winners on the day. We've no qualms <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> all". He also {{expressed}} pride in his own players. Down forward Danny Hughes said: [...] "Well, none {{of us want to}} be one-hit wonders. There are a lot of young lads that came in this year, and there is a great development squad coming through. But we know these days don't happen every year, making All-Ireland finals. Hopefully this will make them hungrier, going forward into next year".|$|E
2500|$|Rumours of the {{connection}} between the title of [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] and the initialism [...] "LSD" [...] began circulating shortly after the release of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP in June 1967. [...] Paul McCartney gave two interviews that same month admitting to having taken the drug. Lennon later said he was surprised at the idea that the song title was a hidden reference to LSD, countering that the song [...] "wasn't <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> all", and that it [...] "was purely unconscious that it came out to be LSD. Until someone pointed it out, I never even thought of it. I mean, who would ever bother to look at initials of a title?... It's not an acid song." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They didn't {{seem to say}} so. Young Bartletot {{took his}} wife out there,--just married. He liked it. There wasn't much society, but they didn't care <b>about</b> <b>that</b> just <b>at</b> first." ...|$|R
2500|$|One such theory {{concerns}} Alf Boxall, who {{was reportedly}} involved in intelligence work during {{and immediately after}} World War II. In a 1978 television interview Stuart Littlemore asks: [...] "Mr Boxall, you had been working, hadn't you, in an intelligence unit, before you met this young woman [...] Did {{you talk to her}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> all?" [...] In reply, Boxall says [...] "no," [...] and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies [...] "not unless somebody else told her." [...] When Littlemore suggests in the interview {{that there may have been}} an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: [...] "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?" [...] Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.|$|E
2500|$|Blackman is {{a rarity}} {{as a female}} jazz percussionist. [...] "In the past, {{there were a lot}} of stigmas {{attached}} to women playing certain instruments", Blackman says. [...] "I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> all. I'm going to do what I'm going to do musically anyway." [...] However Blackman draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a classical pianist and does not let stereotypes deter her. [...] "God forbid I should be limited to only play my drums in my basement; but if that's all I had, that's what I would do", says Blackman. [...] "Any woman, or anyone facing race prejudice, weight prejudice, hair prejudice ... if you let somebody stop you because of their opinions, then the only thing you're doing is hurting yourself. I don't want to give somebody that power over me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-bye, Mrs. Ray. I don't think I've {{been very}} well treated among you. I don't indeed. But I won't say any more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> present. Is she quite well?" ...|$|E
