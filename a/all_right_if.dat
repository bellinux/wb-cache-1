500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Bianco for USA Today wrote of Chenoweth's guest appearance: [...] "Her presence {{may not make}} much sense, but that's probably <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> <b>If</b> it means hearing Chenoweth sing, we can put up with any explanation the show cares to offer." [...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal was equally positive regarding Chenoweth's role, praising her [...] "powerful voice", [...] "kittenish mien" [...] and [...] "commanding presence". Flandez deemed the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] the show's best number since [...] "Don't Stop Believin debuted in the pilot episode. Mike Hale of the New York Times similarly stated that [...] "The Rhodes Not Taken" [...] was [...] "the best episode musically since the pilot", calling the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] "truly rousing". TV Guide included the renditions of [...] "Somebody To Love" [...] and [...] "Maybe This Time" [...] in its list of Glee best performances so far. Jarett Wieselman for the New York Post called the episode: [...] "the smartest, funniest, heart-warmingest, song-tastic-est episode of the show yet." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1967, Peng {{was taken}} to a [...] "struggle meeting", which was held in a stadium {{attended}} by 40,000 PLA soldiers. At this meeting, Peng was led in chains to a stage, where he was forced to kneel for several hours while he listened to soldiers repeatedly denouncing him for his [...] "crimes". At the end of the meeting, Lin Biao personally appeared to the soldiers, where he addressed the assembled soldiers and Peng, who was still kneeling. Lin gave a speech in which he denounced Peng as a villainous element who must be purged, and that it was [...] "in the interest of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole people of the whole country" [...] to persecute Peng so severely. Lin then addressed Peng directly, stating: [...] "If you reform yourself, <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>if</b> not, it is all right too. But of course we hope you reform yourself." [...] It is not known whether Peng eventually broke down and [...] "confessed" [...] at the rally.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers' {{opinions}} on the graphics and gameplay were largely negative, while {{opinions on}} the title's music varied. The background music was described as [...] "...the only thing that is remotely interesting about this appallingly tedious game..." [...] by Popular Computing Weeklys reviewer. He followed this by stating [...] "At first it sounds <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>if</b> a little monotonous, then it begins to grate the nerves. After a while it begins to take on all {{the appeal of the}} Chinese water torture." [...] Crash magazine's three reviewers were more positive about the music, stating [...] "The sound is fairly well done...", [...] "The title screen plays a nice tune..." [...] and [...] "...the game's drawing point is the sound..." [...] The game's graphics were described as [...] "fairly crude", [...] "unattractive" [...] and [...] "...none too exciting, consisting of colourful but flickery characters." [...] One reviewer stated [...] "The graphics are large and colourful but {{there is a lot of}} character clash..." [...] Overall impressions of Moonlight Madness were negative. Crash magazine's reviewers compared the game unfavourably to Booty. One expressed disappointment because of Bubble Bus' history of releasing [...] "great arcade/adventures". Your Sinclairs reviewer stated [...] "Maybe Bubble Bus had a touch of Moonlight Madness when it picked this one for its new release." [...] The reviewer from ZX Computing stated [...] "Keeping to the boy scout theme, be prepared before you buy this one." ...|$|E

If he die, <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> <b>If</b> I die, you two look after Missie Lackalanna. You take rifles, and you look after her daytime and night-time. If she {{want to talk with}} Mr. Tudor, <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> <b>If</b> she not want to talk, you make him keep away. Savvee?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, you bet I'll go, Mr. Farrington. The store closes {{at twelve}} on Saturdays. I guess Coney'll be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> even <b>if</b> we did {{spend a week}} with the swells." ...|$|R
