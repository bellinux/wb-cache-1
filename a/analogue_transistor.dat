Introduction: Yield and reliability have been identified {{as one of the greatest}} present and future challenges associated with nanometer process technologies [1].

40|$|We measure {{graphene}} coplanar waveguides {{from direct}} current (DC) to 13. 5 GHz {{and show that}} the apparent resistance (in the presence of parasitic impedances) has an quadratic frequency dependence, but the intrinsic conductivity (without the influence of parasitic impedances) is frequency-independent. Consequently, in our devices the real part of the complex alternating current conductivity {{is the same as}} the DC value and the imaginary part~ 0. The graphene channel is modelled as a parallel resistive-capacitive network with a frequency dependence identical to that of the Drude conductivity with momentum relaxation time~ 2. 1 ps, highlighting the influence of alternating current (AC) electron transport on the electromagnetic properties of graphene.

A circuit framework for SPICE simulation was also set up for the negative feedback noise reduction technique. The testing and simulation results will be presented in the results Section. This test chip has 40 pins with an area of 1941 x 1935 p 2. Three digital circuit blocks were built on the chip. Each block was made of a chain of inverters.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{scaling of}} CMOS process features enables ever-faster and denser circuits, which {{comes at the}} cost of increased device parameter variation. The performance of analogue and mixed-signal circuits in particular degrades in such a high variation environment, which poses an extraordinary challenge in the design and fabrication of such circuits. This thesis develops a set of tools and methodologies for a post-fabrication calibration system called the Configurable <b>Analogue</b> <b>Transistor</b> (CAT). The principle of the CAT technique is to replace certain transistors in a circuit with calibration devices, which allow adjustment of circuit performance after fabrication to compensate the effects of device parameter variation. Building on initial research on the CAT, this thesis develops a methodology to identify the most suitable calibration devices in their circuit and determine their optimal sizes. Furthermore, the applicability of CAT is extended beyond parameter variation to also include direct compensation of temperature. A complementary technique to post-fabrication calibration is robust design, where a circuit is designed to be inherently robust against variation in device parameters. In this thesis, a novel closed-loop pick-off circuit for force-balanced MEMS accelerometers is presented. It is comparable in performance to other state-of-the-art techniques, but provides vastly improved robustness against parameter variation and a more intuitive design process. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of electronic}} circuits {{is influenced by}} ageing effects. Modelling the behaviour of circuits is a standard approach {{for the design of}} faster, smaller, more reliable and more robust systems. In this thesis, we propose a formalization of robustness that is derived from a failure model, which is based purely on the behavioural specification of a system. For a given specification, simulation can reveal if a system does not comply with a specification, and thus provide a failure model. Ageing usually works against the specified properties, and ageing models can be incorporated to quantify the impact on specification violations, failures and robustness. We study ageing effects in the context of analogue circuits. Here, models must factor in infinitely many circuit states. Ageing effects have a cause and an impact that require models. On both these ends, the circuit state is highly relevant, an must be factored in. For example, static empirical models for ageing effects are not valid in many cases, because the assumed operating states do not agree with the circuit simulation results. This thesis identifies essential properties of ageing effects and we argue {{that they need to be}} taken into account for modelling the interrelation of cause and impact. These properties include frequency dependence, monotonicity, memory and relaxation mechanisms as well as control by arbitrary shaped stress levels. Starting from decay processes, we define a class of ageing models that fits these requirements well while remaining arithmetically accessible by means of a simple structure. Modeling ageing effects in semiconductor circuits becomes more relevant with higher integration and smaller structure sizes. With respect to miniaturization, digital systems are ahead of analogue systems, and similarly ageing models predominantly focus on digital applications. In the digital domain, the signal levels are either on or off or switching in between. Given an ageing model as a physical effect bound to signal levels, ageing models for components and whole systems can be inferred by means of average operation modes and cycle counts. Functional and faithful ageing effect models for analogue components often require a more fine-grained characterization for physical processes. Here, signal levels can take arbitrary values, to begin with. Such fine-grained, physically inspired ageing models do not scale for larger applications and are hard to simulate in reasonable time. To close the gap between physical processes and system level ageing simulation, we propose a data based modelling strategy, according to which measurement data is turned into ageing models for analogue applications. Ageing data is a set of pairs of stress patterns and the corresponding parameter deviations. Assuming additional properties, such as monotonicity or frequency independence, learning algorithm can find a complete model that is consistent with the data set. These ageing effect models decompose into a controlling stress level, an ageing process, and a parameter that depends on the state of this process. Using this representation, we are able to embed a wide range of ageing effects into behavioural models for circuit components. Based on the developed modelling techniques, we introduce a novel model for the BTI effect, an ageing effect that permits relaxation. In the following, a transistor level ageing model for BTI that targets analogue circuits is proposed. Similarly, we demonstrate how ageing data from <b>analogue</b> <b>transistor</b> level circuit models lift to purely behavioural block models. With this, we are the first to present a data based hierarchical ageing modeling scheme. An ageing simulator for circuits or system level models computes long term transients, solutions of a differential equation. Long term transients are often close to quasi-periodic, in some sense repetitive. If the evaluation of ageing models under quasi-periodic conditions can be done efficiently, long term simulation becomes practical. We describe an adaptive two-time simulation algorithm that basically skips periods during simulation, advancing faster on a second time axis. The bottleneck of two-time simulation is the extrapolation through skipped frames. This involves both the evaluation of the ageing models and the consistency of the boundary conditions. We propose a simulator that computes long term transients exploiting the structure of the proposed ageing models. These models permit extrapolation of the ageing state by means of a locally equivalent stress, a sort of average stress level. This level can be computed efficiently and also gives rise to a dynamic step control mechanism. Ageing simulation has a wide range of applications. This thesis vastly improves the applicability of ageing simulation for analogue circuits in terms of modelling and efficiency. An ageing effect model that is a part of a circuit component model accounts for parametric drift that is directly related to the operation mode. For example asymmetric load on a comparator or power-stage may lead to offset drift, which is not an empiric effect. Monitor circuits can report such effects during operation, when they become significant. Simulating the behaviour of these monitors is important during their development. Ageing effects can be compensated using redundant parts, and annealing can revert broken components to functional. We show that such mechanisms can be simulated in place using our models and algorithms. The aim of automatized circuit synthesis is to create a circuit that implements a specification for a certain use case. Ageing simulation can identify candidates that are more reliable. Efficient ageing simulation allows to factor in various operation modes and helps refining the selection. Using long term ageing simulation, we have analysed the fitness of a set of synthesized operational amplifiers with similar properties concerning various use cases. This procedure enables the selection of the most ageing resilient implementation automatically. Viele alltägliche Geräte in Haushalt, Verkehr, zur Kommunikation oder Medizintechnik werden seit Mitte des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts von elektronischen Schaltungen beherrscht. Solche Schaltungen messen, steuern und regeln wichtige Eigenschaften, Funktionen und Prozesse und ermöglichen immer weiter ausgefeilte Anwendungen, höhere Effizienz und neue Einsatzmöglichkeiten. Grundsätzlich besteht ein Interesse an der einwandfreien Funktionalität solcher Geräte. Mit elektronischen Halbleiterschaltungen werden zunehmend kleinere Bauteile in diese Geräte verbaut. Einerseits führt dies zu einer wachsenden Systemkomplexität bei mitunter gleichbleibenden Abmessungen, andererseits werden im Zuge der Miniaturisierung physikalische Grenzen erreicht und bisweilen überwunden. Die Einzelteile eines Systems sind nach Fertigung nicht zugänglich und können nicht ausgetauscht werden. Als Konsequenz erwartet man einen Ausfall, sobald ein Einzelteil nicht mehr funktioniert. Um solchen Ausfällen vorzubeugen, möchte man gerne vor der Serienproduktion in Erfahrung bringen, wie sie zustande kommen. Hierzu bedarf es geeigneten Modellen und Analysemethoden.

40|$|Living {{systems are}} able to achieve prodigious feats of {{computation}} with remarkable speed and efficiency (e. g. navigation in a complex environment, object recognition, decision making, and reasoning). Many of these tasks have not been adequately solved using algorithms running on our most powerful computers. When one examines the physical structure of living systems {{it is very difficult}} to understand how indeed such systems {{are able to}} perform computation. Two things stand out. First, the simplest living systems have a complexity and sophistication that dwarfs manmade technology. Secondly, these living systems were not designed specifically to do computation. In fact, as Richard Dawkins made clear in his book “The Blind Watchmaker” they were not designed at all. Instead they have been subjected to a long process of Darwinian evolution. Why is it that such a blind process can find solutions to these difficult computational tasks, when our best attempts at the principled design of solutions to computational problems are poor by comparison? It is because natural evolution is a bottom-up process that is able to exploit the emergent physical and chemical properties of molecules. It is par excellence a physical exploitation process. Natural evolution uses the enormous complexity of molecular interactions and also the huge parallelism of physical systems. This is the inspiration for the NASCENCE project which aims to emulate Nature and use computer-controlled Darwinian evolution to create sophisticated information processing systems in materials. The benefit of this approach to computation is that we can use the high parallelism and computational complexity of physical components to solve problems that are either computationally intractable or very difficult to model. The technological drive to produce ever-smaller devices (Moore’s Law) is leading to the construction of machines at the molecular level. However, the basic computational paradigm is still Von Neumann. Molecular and nanoscale electronics concerns building molecule-sized <b>analogues</b> of <b>transistors</b> and assembling them into designs that are facsimiles of today’s solid state circuits. There are fundamental issues with this approach: molecules cannot be controlled and manipulated in the same way as silicon wafers, and it is unclear that macroscopic top-down design methods are appropriate. The NASCENCE project will use computer-controlled manipulation of physical systems, such as networks of nanoparticles, arrays of carbon nanotubes and films of graphene, to evolve them towards doing useful computation and information processing. This is physical computation in a dish...|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{expansion of}} the electronics industry over the past 40 years {{has been based on}} the progressive reduction in size of the silicon-based semiconductor components of integrated circuits. The miniaturisation of semi-conductor circuits cannot, however, continue indefinitely, and we are rapidly approaching the stage where quantum effects will prevent further dramatic improvements in computer performance using existing technology. As a result, the field of molecular electronics, which seeks to identify and develop much smaller molecular <b>analogues</b> of the <b>transistors</b> that make up integrated circuits, has expanded rapidly over the past few years. Recent studies suggested that extended metal atom chains (EMAC) may have many potential applications in molecular electronics, {{but it is clear that}} this potential can only be realised if we establish a link between the fundamental electronic properties of these systems and the transport of electrons. For this reason the ultimate goal of this thesis is to relate the electronic structure of extended metal chains to their electron transport properties. We address the problem using non-equilibrium Green’s function, in conjugation with density functional theory. In the results sections of this thesis we present calculations on tricobalt, trichromium and trinickel chains. Our data suggested that in the trimetal chains, the dominant electron transport channel is the σ manifold, while the π systems establish the contact with the electrodes. The implication of this is that even when the highly polarized π channels are strongly rehybridised by the applied electric field, current flow is not affected. In the trichromium systems we find that the distortion of the chain away from the symmetric equilibrium structure does not perturb the current flow but rather enhances it. Our rather counter intuitive conclusion is therefore that ‘broken wires’ (highly unsymmetric) are more efficient conductors than their symmetric counterparts. We have performed calculation on longer penta- and heptacobalt structures chains to establish the extent to which longer structures attenuate the conductance. Our calculations show significant oscillations of the conductance due to development of a one-dimensional band structure about the Fermi level. The evolution of the electron transport properties in cobalt chains with different length is a complex one, but it is clear that narrowing the band gap in longer chains makes it increasingly likely that the Fermi level will be in resonance with one or more of the orbitals of the extended metal atom chain. </p...|$|R
