5|$|The {{inauguration of}} the first Whig {{president}} would give that party the opportunity to fill federal jobs for the first time. This proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He made <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>public</b> progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the President-elect and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he filled his cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he had been promised the position of Postmaster General.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics, {{many of whom}} complimented the lyrics, as well as Carey's vocals. The song was not commercially successful due to its limited release and other factors. The song {{was the center of}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>public</b> controversy between Carey and her label Sony Music, based on what she perceived to be weak promotion of the single. It peaked at number 40 in Belgium Wallonia, number 45 in Italy and number 65 in the Netherlands. Stateside, due to Billboard rules at the time, it was not eligible to chart on the Hot 100, though it managed to reach number six on the dance chart.|$|E

5|$|In 1381, Le Gris and Carrouges {{engaged in}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>public</b> {{argument}} over {{the domain of}} Arnou-le-Faucon. Carrouges had returned from the wars with a new bride, Marguerite de Thibouville, daughter of a controversial Norman squire who until recently had owned Arnou. Although the lands had been legally bought by Count Pierre in 1377 for 8,000 livres, Carrouges wanted them back {{as part of his}} dowry and took Count Pierre in court to return them. Count Pierre was forced to visit his cousin the King to obtain royal approval for his purchase and consequently was furious with Carrouges. The eventual result was that Carrouges was isolated from the court and subjected to three years of legal struggles over land with Count Pierre, who denied him the purchase or inheritance of several estates. Le Gris was heavily involved in these legal disputes both as the Seigneur of Arnou-le-Faucon and as adviser to the Count. He thus became a target of Carrouges, who accused Le Gris of orchestrating the lawsuits against him.|$|E
5|$|One {{day after}} the report was released, Metropolitan Herman {{resigned}} from his position as Metropolitan. That November, the OCA elected a new Primate at its 15th Annual All-American Council. Metropolitan Jonah (Paffhausen) was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop (only 11 days prior) and was viewed to not be involved with the previous financial scandal. Metropolitan Jonah immediately took a strong stance against the previous scandal and became <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>public</b> metropolitan, seeking to repair damage done by the previous scandal and bring the OCA into the public realm. Metropolitan Jonah also sought to improve relations with non-Orthodox groups and especially sought to repair {{the relations between the}} OCA and traditional Anglican groups. He was invited twice to speak at the conference of the Anglican Church of North America, in 2009 and 2012.|$|E
