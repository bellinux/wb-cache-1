25|$|<b>ABC</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{a method}} for {{analyzing}} inventory based on Pareto distribution, it posits that since revenue from items on inventory will be power law distributed then {{it makes sense to}} manage items differently based on their position on a revenue-inventory level matrix, 3 classes are constructed (A,B and C) from cumulative item revenues, so in a matrix each item will have a letter (A,B or C) assigned for revenue and inventory. This method posits that items away from the diagonal should be managed differently: items in the upper part are subject to risk of obsolescence, items in the lower part are subject to risk of stockout.|$|E
25|$|Inventory {{management}} {{involves a}} retailer seeking to acquire {{and maintain a}} proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling and related costs are kept in check.

This would include the monitoring of material moved {{into and out of}} stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. It also may include <b>ABC</b> <b>analysis,</b> lot tracking, cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs.|$|E

40|$|Two {{distinct}} analytic {{methods have}} been used to identify the function of problem behavior. The antecedent-behavior-consequence (ABC) method (Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, & Richman, 1982 / 1994) includes the delivery of consequences for problem behavior. The AB method (Carr & Durand, 1985) does not include consequence delivery, instead relying exclusively on antecedent conditions to evoke the behavior. The AB and <b>ABC</b> functional <b>analysis</b> methods were compared in this study with 4 children with developmental disabilities who engaged in task-related problem behavior. Results show that the ABC method identified an escape method for all four cases, whereas the AB method failed to identify a function for any case...|$|R
