5|$|By 1916, the Princess {{had stopped}} booking live acts and was {{focusing}} {{exclusively on the}} more profitable cinema side of the business. Revenues from the rental spaces {{in the basement and}} upper floors had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> to flow in. Notably, Hugh Morrow, a beat cop, had leased apartment 205. His granddaughter Susan Morrow would manage the Princess from 1981 to 1994.|$|E
5|$|Hip hop/pop {{combination}} had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> {{to dominate}} 2000s and early 2010s. In the early 2010s, prominent artists like Bruno Mars, Drake, Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz, Kendrick Lamar, Machine Gun Kelly, and Macklemore began {{to dominate the}} mainstream music scene.|$|E

50|$|South African Airways <b>also</b> <b>began</b> weekly flights between Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport and Hong Kong's Kai Tak via Plaisance Airport in Mauritius. Later in 1991, as {{sanctions}} were lifted and trade and tourism began to increase, Cathay Pacific <b>also</b> <b>began</b> flights {{on the same}} route.|$|R
50|$|Videoland <b>also</b> <b>began</b> {{producing}} children's {{programs in}} 2004.|$|R
5|$|Internally, the wiping policy officially {{came to an}} end in 1978, {{when the}} means to further exploit {{programmes}} by taking advantage of the new market for home videocassette recordings started to become apparent. The prevailing view had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> to shift toward the attitude that archive programmes should, in any case, be preserved for posterity and historical and cultural reasons.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu has {{a number}} of hotels, most of which were {{recently}} constructed. The city's many returning expatriates, investors and international community workers are among these establishments' main customers. To meet the growing demand, hotel representatives have <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> participating in international industry conferences, such as the Africa Hotel Investment Forum.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the times}} changed, KHEP sought to remain relevant. In 1972, it aired {{a special program}} on “Solving the Drug Problem”; that year, it <b>also</b> <b>began</b> hosting a daily radio program, “Tips for Teens,” hosted by Rev. Mel Johnson. It <b>also</b> <b>began</b> {{offering}} community hymn sings at Encanto Park.|$|R

5|$|Crusader {{was built}} by the Melbourne Harbour Trust at Williamstown Dockyard. She was the largest {{all-welded}} steel vessel to have been constructed in Australia at the time, and her final price of £124,000 was considerably more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to be commissioned by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a sister ship, to be called AV2768 Corsair, was <b>also</b> <b>begun,</b> but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|FRELIMO attack {{groups had}} <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> {{to grow in}} size to include over 100 {{soldiers}} in certain cases, and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into their ranks. On either October 10 or October 11, 1966, on returning to Tanzania after inspecting the front lines, Filipe Samuel Magaia was shot dead by Lourenço Matola, a fellow FRELIMO guerrilla who {{was said to be}} in the employ of the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|The film {{ran into}} {{production}} trouble in mid 2010 and {{was close to}} being shelved, with sources reporting that Thiagarajan sold the film to Santiago Martin to revive the project. The reports proved to be untrue, and Thiagarajan maintained {{that he was still}} the producer of the film. The film had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> to surpass its budget, due to the casual nature of shooting and difficulties in creating historical sets. The first shots from the film and the video for three songs were unveiled publicly in March2011, with the publicity campaign initiated after this.|$|E

50|$|The parish {{community}} {{got started}} in 1986 with SSPX's Father Goettler saying Mass in Lawrence Town Hall. Education of children by the parish <b>also</b> <b>began</b> immediately. Once the parish grew to about 50 people, a temporary chapel {{was established in}} 1989. Construction of the academy building <b>also</b> <b>began</b> in October 1989.|$|R
5|$|Biko married Ntsiki Mashalaba in December 1970. They had two {{children}} together: Nkosinathi, born in 1971, and Samora, born in 1975. Biko's wife chose the name Nkosinathi ("The Lord is with us"), and Biko named their second child after the Mozambican revolutionary leader Samora Machel. Angered by her husband's serial adultery, Mashalaba ultimately moved out of their home, {{and by the time}} of his death, she had begun divorce proceedings. Biko had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> an extra-marital relationship with Mamphela Ramphele. In 1974, she bore him a daughter, Lerato, who died after two months. A son, Hlumelo, was born to Ramphele in 1978, after Biko's death. Biko was also in a relationship with Lorrain Tabane, who bore him a child named Motlatsi in 1977.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the central}} {{pressure}} of the depression had decreased to 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was {{compared to that of}} a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft flew into Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet flew into the storm. The storm executed a counter-clockwise loop, ending on November3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system. By this time, the storm had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> a southeastward track.|$|E
5|$|During McCartney's {{early years}} with the Beatles, he {{primarily}} used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, {{in contrast to the}} much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.|$|E

5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E
5|$|The Thames estuary {{leading out}} of London, through which 80 percent of England's exports passed, was {{protected}} with a mutually reinforcing network of blockhouses at Gravesend, Milton, and Higham {{on the south}} side of the river, and West Tilbury and East Tilbury on the opposite bank. Camber Castle was built to protect the anchorage outside the ports of Rye and Winchelsea, defences were built in the port of Harwich and three earth bulwarks were built around Dover. Work was <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> on Calshot Castle in Fawley and the blockhouses of East and West Cowes on the Isle of Wight to protect the Solent, which led into the trading port of Southampton. The Portland Roads anchorage in Dorset was protected with new castles at Portland and Sandsfoot, and work began on two blockhouses to protect the Milford Haven Waterway in Pembrokeshire.|$|E
5|$|The {{boats were}} begun {{late in the}} war when {{shortages}} of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of other boats under construction. As a result, none of the first four boats was ever launched or completed {{before the end of}} the war. U-107 was 35% complete at war's end, while U-108 was only 30% complete, respectively. Ganz Danubius had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> stockpiling materials for U-109 and U-110 but had not started on these two boats. Although there is no specific mention of the fates of the pair of incomplete boats of the U-107 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped 1919–1920.|$|E

5|$|While William was in Normandy, {{a former}} ally, Eustace, the Count of Boulogne, invaded at Dover but was repulsed. English {{resistance}} had <b>also</b> <b>begun,</b> with Eadric the Wild attacking Hereford and revolts at Exeter, where Harold's mother Gytha was {{a focus of}} resistance. FitzOsbern and Odo {{found it difficult to}} control the native population and undertook a programme of castle building to maintain their hold on the kingdom. William returned to England in December 1067 and marched on Exeter, which he besieged. The town held out for 18 days, and after it fell to William he built a castle to secure his control. Harold's sons were meanwhile raiding the southwest of England from a base in Ireland. Their forces landed near Bristol but were defeated by Eadnoth. By Easter, William was at Winchester, where he was soon joined by his wife Matilda, who was crowned in May 1068.|$|E
5|$|While at Deraa on 21 September {{during his}} {{withdrawal}} from Nazareth to Damascus, Liman von Sanders ordered the Fourth Army to withdraw. They were to move {{without waiting for}} the II Corps/Southern Force, which had <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> to withdraw north from Ma'an and the southern Hejaz railway. The army was in general moving northwards from Amman along the railway towards Deraa by 22 September, where they were ordered to form a rearguard line from Deraa to Irbid. Aerial reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Ottoman army withdrawal from Amman towards Deraa. Ottoman units in the hills to the south west, and a column of all arms, were seen moving from the Es Salt area towards Amman. The aircraft bombed and machine gunned this column, then flew back to report at Ramleh.|$|E
5|$|Worrying {{that the}} {{rebellion}} might rapidly reignite and spread, the colonial authorities instigated arbitrary reprisals against the Nyasa population, including mass hut burnings. All weapons were confiscated and fines of 4 shillings per person were levied in the districts {{affected by the}} revolt, {{regardless of whether the}} people in question had been involved. The colonial government <b>also</b> <b>begun</b> attacking the rights of missionaries in Nyasaland and banned many independent churches, including Kitawala, from Nyasaland, and placed restrictions on other African-run churches. Public gatherings, especially those associated with African-initiated religious groups, were banned until 1919. Fear of similar uprisings in other colonies, notably Northern Rhodesia, also led to similar repression of independent churches and foreign missions beyond Nyasaland.|$|E
