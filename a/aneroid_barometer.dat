25|$|How to Use the <b>Aneroid</b> <b>Barometer.</b> London: John Murray, 1881.|$|E
25|$|His {{experiences}} in South America having convinced him of certain serious {{errors in the}} readings of aneroid barometers at high altitudes, he published a work entitled How to Use the <b>Aneroid</b> <b>Barometer</b> and succeeded in introducing important improvements in their construction. He afterwards published two guide books to Zermatt and Chamonix.|$|E
25|$|Increases in {{barometric}} pressure increase a pendulum's period slightly {{due to the}} first two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per kilopascal (0.37 seconds per day per inch of mercury or 0.015 seconds per day per torr). Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.|$|E

50|$|In 1966 {{they used}} a {{theodolite}} and <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> to establish spot heights of mountain peaks between Brachina Gorge and Parachilna Gorge, in the Flinders Ranges. They also suggested Aboriginal names {{for many of the}} features.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> {{are used}} in scuba diving. A {{submersible}} pressure gauge is used {{to keep track of}} the contents of the diver's air tank. Another gauge is used to measure the hydrostatic pressure, usually expressed as a depth of sea water. Either or both gauges may be replaced with electronic variants or a dive computer.|$|R
25|$|Aneroid {{barometers}} have {{a mechanical}} adjustment {{that allows the}} equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without further adjustment if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude. Setting an <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> is similar to resetting an analog clock that is not at the correct time. Its dial is rotated so that the current atmospheric pressure from a known accurate and nearby barometer (such as the local weather station) is displayed. No calculation is needed, as the source barometer reading has already been converted to equivalent sea-level pressure, and this is transferred to the barometer being set—regardless of its altitude. Though somewhat rare, a few aneroid barometers intended for monitoring the weather are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude. In this case, knowing either the altitude or the current atmospheric pressure would be sufficient for future accurate readings.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} altimeter, {{also known}} as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. [...] The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. [...] Inside the instrument, there is a sealed <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer.</b> [...] As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. [...] The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.|$|E
500|$|Since its {{discovery}} by explorers, {{the height}} of Adams has also been under debate. The topographer for the Pacific Railroad Surveys, Lt. Johnson K. Duncan, and George Gibbs, ethnologist and naturalist for the expedition, thought {{it was about the}} same height as St. Helens. Its large, uneven size apparently contributed to the underestimation. The Northwest Boundary Survey listed Adams as having an elevation of [...] while a later US Coast and Geodetic Survey gave it an elevation of [...] The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the Mazamas mountaineering club, William A. Gilmore, Professor Edgar McClure, and William Gladstone Steel. Using a boiling point thermometer, mercurial barometer, and an <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer,</b> they determined the elevation to be [...] respectively. None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the US Geological Survey (USGS), using a triangulation method, also measured {{the height of}} several mountains in the Cascades and they measured Adams as having an elevation of [...] The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to [...] and again in 1970 to [...] for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle. The current elevation, , is generated by the new method, NAVD88, for calculating altitudes.|$|E

5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.|$|R
2500|$|An <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> is an {{instrument}} for measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer.</b> [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{density of}} mercury will change with {{increase}} or decrease in temperature, so a reading must be adjusted for {{the temperature of the}} instrument. For this purpose a mercury thermometer is usually mounted on the instrument. Temperature compensation of an <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> is accomplished by including a bi-metal element in the mechanical linkages. [...] Aneroid barometers sold for domestic use typically have no compensation under the assumption that they will be used within a controlled room temperature range.|$|E
2500|$|The Misquah Hills were {{surveyed}} by Newton H. Winchell, Minnesota state geologist, and Ulysses S. Grant II in the 1890s, who, using an <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> mistakenly gave {{the title of}} highest peak in Minnesota to an unnamed 2230-foot summit near {{what is now called}} Winchell Lake. [...] A United States Department of the Interior survey team remeasured several summits in the Misquahs in 1961, using aerial photographs and benchmarking (geolocating), resulting in the current set of height measurements.|$|E
50|$|Records of {{the lowest}} {{pressure}} were secured from three <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers,</b> the values ranging from 26.75 to 26.98 inches. However, none of these barometers had previously been compared to standard. One of the barometers, owned by Ivar Olson, was shipped to the Weather Bureau in Washington where it was tested in the Instrument Division. Careful laboratory tests showed {{it to be an}} exceptionally responsive and reliable instrument and that the correct reading at the position of the needle indicated by Mr. Olson {{at the center of the}} storm was 26.35 inches. This is the worlds lowest record of pressure at a land station.|$|R
500|$|In 1908, the Workmans {{returned}} to the Karakoram and explored the 38-mile-long (61km) Hispar Glacier in the Hunza Nagar region; they went from Gilgit to Nagir over the Hispar pass (...) and onto the 37-mile-long (60km) Biafo Glacier to Askole. Their total traverse of the glaciers was another record, and Fanny {{became the first woman}} to travel across any Himalayan glacier of this size. They were the first to explore its many side glaciers and the maps created by their Italian porters helped map the region for the first time. They recorded the physiological effects of high altitude, studied glaciers and ice pinnacles, and took meteorological measurements, including altitude data recorded with both <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> and boiling point thermometers.|$|R
50|$|Bourdon tubes measure gauge pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|R

6000|$|At {{last the}} fishermen's prayers were answered, the {{thoughts}} of the visitor bore fruit, and, convinced {{that he was being}} led by God, he began to move in the matter with prayer and energy. The result was that in the year 1881 he received the unsolicited offer of a smack which should be at his entire disposal for mission purposes, but should endeavour to sustain herself, if possible, by fishing {{like the rest of the}} fleet. The vessel was accepted. A Christian skipper and fisherman, named Budd, and a like-minded crew, were put into her; she was fitted out with an extra cabin, with cupboards for a library and other conveniences. The hold was arranged with a view to being converted into a chapel on Sundays, and it was decided that, in order to keep it clear on such days, the trawl should not be let down on Saturday nights; a large medicine-chest--which was afterwards reported to be [...] "one of the greatest blessings in the fleet,"--was put on board; the captain made a colporteur of the Bible Society, agent for the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society and of the Church of England Temperance Society. The Religious Tract Society, and various publishers, made a grant of books to form the nucleus of a free lending library; the National Lifeboat Institution presented an <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer,</b> and Messrs. Hewett and Company made a present of the insurance premium of 50 pounds. Thus furnished and armed, as aforesaid, as a Mission Church, Temperance Hall, Circulating Library, and Dispensary, the little craft one day sailed in amongst the smacks of the [...] "Short Blue" [...] fleet, amid the boisterous greetings of the crews, and took up her position under the name of the Ensign, with a great twenty-feet Mission-flag flying at the main-mast-head.|$|E

50|$|Strained {{political}} {{tensions between}} Russia and Britain prevented Gill from following his original planned route. Instead, he and Mesny agreed to travel via eastern Tibet to northern Burma (Myanmar). They {{set out on}} 10 July 1877 with their servants and 60 porters. They entered eastern Tibet via Tachienlu (Kangding). From there, Gill, Mesny and their party climbed to the Tibetan plateau, which is mostly more than 2 miles above sea level. Passing through Litang, they reached Batang in the valley of {{a tributary of the}} Jinsha River, then regarded by Europeans as the true upper Yangtze. Jinsha means “golden sand” and Gill named his book on the expedition The River of Golden Sand. Crossing the Jinsha, the party followed its valley or the ridge between it and the upper Mekong valley for 24 days to Dali City (Talifu), the western capital of Yunnan. Up to that point, Gill had surveyed the entire route and measured the altitude with <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> and a hypsometer. They were now in known territory, as Edward Colborne Baber had already surveyed the route from Dali to the Irrawaddy while investigating the murder of Gill’s schoolmate Augustus Margary. Gill and Mesny arrived at Bhamo in Burma on 1 November 1877, where they met Thomas Cooper, whose advice Gill had sought in London. Cooper was now the local British political agent; he was murdered five months later. From Bhamo, the party took a steamer down the Irrawaddy River to Rangoon and then travelled by sea to Calcutta, where they disbanded. William Gill’s scientific work, including the Chinese expeditions and the resulting 42 sheets of maps, was recognised on 26 May 1879, when the Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Patron's Gold Medal. The following year, the Geographical Society of Paris awarded Gill a gold medal.|$|R
