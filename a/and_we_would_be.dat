500|$|Curtis chose Notting Hill as {{he lived}} there {{and knew the}} area, saying [...] "Notting Hill is a melting pot and {{the perfect place to}} set a film". This left the {{producers}} to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted [...] "Early on, we {{toyed with the idea of}} building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers." [...] In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried [...] "that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting". The location team, and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were [...] "genuinely excited" [...] about the film. The location manager Sue Quinn, described finding locations and getting permission to film as [...] "a mammoth task". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.|$|E
500|$|On May17,2002, Robert S. Stephens and Roger A. Roffman of The Seattle Times {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] in a guest column for the newspaper. The two argued that drugs are almost always shown as having only negative effects, even though 10million people in the United States use marijuana for recreational purposes. [...] "We believe {{there are good reasons}} for a more honest dialogue about the positive and negative effects of marijuana use. A recent episode of the popular TV show The Simpsons highlighted {{the pros and cons of}} marijuana use, and Homer Simpson's experiences with marijuana provide an example of what we mean", they wrote. For example, when under the influence of marijuana, Homer is relieved from the pain in his eye, and he also finds himself having a variety of sensory experiences and an enhanced appreciation of music and food. [...] "These are real effects reported by many marijuana users, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> hard pressed to call them anything other than benefits", Stephens and Roffman wrote. However, Homer is also depicted spending more time with other drug users than with his family, and his friends find that his personality has changed. Eventually, Homer is shown having problems with memory and attention, losing track of the date on which a pro-marijuana rally takes place. Stephens and Roffman wrote that the side effects shown in the episode are [...] "Perhaps a bit exaggerated, but clearly there are costs of marijuana use similar to these that are experienced by real-life users." ...|$|E

Their response to the questions regarding Israel have been outright denial of Israel or staying quiet. An example of the dilemma of Iranian Jews can be observed in this example :"We hear the ayatollah say that Israel was cooperating with the Shah and SAVAK, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fools to say we support Israel.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{damaging}} arguments by the bill's opponents was that once passed, the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain racial quotas in schools. Proponents of the bill, such as Emanuel Celler and Jacob Javits, said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Senator Hubert Humphrey (D-MN) wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing. Humphrey said [...] "if the bill were to compel it, {{it would be a}} violation , because it would be handling the matter {{on the basis of race}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> transporting children because of race." [...] While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes [...] "would be making a fool of himself," [...] two years later the Department of Health, Education and Welfare said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.|$|E

30|$|Metadiscourse is {{important}} in all formal writing, but it is claimed to be especially crucial in argumentative writing, to facilitate persuasion (Crismore et al. 1993; Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2004; Williams 1981). Vande Kopple (1985) states that without recourse to metadiscourse, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to write lists of sentences, but not cohesive texts <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> able to express our ideas to a minimal extent.|$|R
2500|$|The Soviet {{threat to}} send troops to Egypt to fight the Allies led Eisenhower to fear {{that this might be}} the {{beginning}} of World War III. One of Eisenhower's aides Emmet Hughes recalled that the reaction at the White House to the Bulganin letters was [...] "sombre" [...] as there was fear that this was the beginning to the countdown to World War III, a war that if it occurred would kill hundreds of millions of people. In private, Eisenhower told Undersecretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr. of his fears that: [...] If the Soviet Union did go to war with NATO allies Britain and France, then the United States would be unable to remain neutral, because the United States' obligations under NATO would come into effect, requiring them {{to go to war with}} the Soviet Union in defense of Britain and France. Likewise, if the Soviet Union attacked Israel, though there was no formal American commitment to defend Israel, the Eisenhower administration would come under heavy domestic pressure to intervene. From Eisenhower's viewpoint, it was better to end the war against Egypt rather than run the risk of this escalating into the Third World War, in case Khrushchev was serious about going to war in defense of Egypt as he insisted in public that he was. Eisenhower's reaction to these threats from the Soviet Union was: [...] "If those fellows start something, we may have to hit 'em â€” and, if necessary, with everything in the bucket." [...] Eisenhower immediately ordered the U-2s into action over Syria and Israel to search for any Soviet air forces on Syrian bases, so the British and French could destroy them. He told Hoover and CIA director Allan Dulles, [...] "If the Soviets attack the French and British directly, we would be in a war <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> justified in taking military action even if Congress were not in session." [...] (The Americans excluded Israel from the guarantee against Soviet attack, however, alarming the Israeli government.) ...|$|E
