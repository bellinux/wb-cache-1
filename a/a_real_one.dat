5|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, {{the bank}} robber {{was to have}} jumped into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena. After Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way, the producers agreed to make the change. The opening bank robbery scene was filmed on location in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one,</b> and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
25|$|During his {{highschool}} days in Galatasaray High School (and {{later in}} Şişli Terakki High School) he formed his first band, Kafadarlar ("The Buddies"), allegedly upon seeing Erkin Koray's band performing, all students of Deutsche Schule Istanbul (İstanbul Alman Lisesi), a nearby highschool. Prof. Dr. Asaf Savaş Akat, a famous economist in Turkey, played saxophone, and guitarist Ender Enön {{made his own}} guitar because {{it was difficult to}} find <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> on the market in those years.|$|E

25|$|Hrithik's {{enacting}} of {{a ballet}} sequence with a transparent ball was originally {{shot with a}} real ball. However some shots needed to have a CG ball when it was impractical to execute the shot with <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> In between the sequence, Hrithik lies on the ball to take a 360-degree turn. This was originally shot with a green cubical turntable to give Hrithik the necessary support to do the act and the table had to be replaced with the transparent ball.|$|E
25|$|Marx {{was asked}} to apply the greasepaint {{mustache}} once more for You Bet Your Life {{when it came to}} television, but he refused, opting instead to grow <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one,</b> which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him actually to need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in Love Happy, the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this ruling, Overland had been denied the {{opportunity}} to cross-examine Mark Safarik, the last prosecution witness and an FBI expert on burglaries, who had testified that the crime scene suggested a staged burglary, as opposed to <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> that had been interrupted in progress. Since the prosecution had told the court at a sidebar prior to Safarik's testimony that they intended to limit their questioning to supporting this theory, Perry similarly limited the defense on cross. However, Tickle argued, since Safarik's own report had considered the other burglary, testimony about that should have been allowed.|$|E

25|$|Billy LaHiff, {{who owned}} a popular pub frequented by showpeople, {{introduced}} Ruby in 1926 to impresario Willard Mack. Mack was casting his play The Noose, and LaHiff suggested that {{the part of the}} chorus girl be played by <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> Mack agreed, and after a successful audition gave the part to Ruby. She co-starred with Rex Cherryman and Wilfred Lucas. As initially staged, the play was not a success. In an effort to improve it, Mack decided to expand Ruby's part to include more pathos. The Noose re-opened on October 20, 1926, and {{became one of the most}} successful plays of the season, running on Broadway for nine months and 197 performances. At the suggestion of either Mack or David Belasco, Ruby changed her name to Barbara Stanwyck by combining the first name of her character, Barbara Frietchie, with the last name of another actress in the play, Jane Stanwyck.|$|E
25|$|La Tosca {{is set in}} Rome on 17 June 1800 {{following}} the French victory in the Battle of Marengo. The action takes place over an eighteen-hour period, ending at dawn on 18 June 1800. Its melodramatic plot centers on Floria Tosca, a celebrated opera singer; her lover, Mario Cavaradossi, an artist and Napoleon sympathiser; and Baron Scarpia, Rome's ruthless Regent of Police. By {{the end of the}} play, all three are dead. Scarpia arrests Cavaradossi and sentences him to death in the Castel Sant'Angelo. He then offers to spare her lover if Tosca will yield to his sexual desire. She appears to acquiesce, but as soon as Scarpia gives the order for the firing squad to use blanks, she stabs him to death. On discovering that Cavaradossi's execution had in fact been <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one,</b> Tosca commits suicide by throwing herself from the castle's parapets.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{bank robbery}} scene was filmed on {{location}} in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> Interior shots set in Dupre's basement were filmed in an asbestos-lined apartment building, where a translator was required to interface with the mostly-Asian tenants. This episode features {{the first of several}} occasions in which Scully is abducted. Her birthday, February 23, is revealed {{for the first time in}} this episode; though the year of her birth, 1964, would not be established until the second season episode [...] "One Breath".|$|E

500|$|In the film, Ferris convinces Cameron {{to borrow}} his father's rare 1961 Ferrari GT California. [...] "The insert {{shots of the}} Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California", Hughes {{explains}} in the DVD commentary. [...] "The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so it was way too expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. They were pretty good, but for the tight shots I needed <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one,</b> so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|E
500|$|David Duchovny was {{somewhat}} {{disappointed with the}} episode, hoping {{he would have had}} a chance to do more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, and I like the thinking that went into the episode as a viewer. As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. If I had to do any episode over again, it would be that one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E
500|$|Two {{days before}} the main race and in inclement weather, the Cambridge boat began to sink and was pushed into barges and tugs moored below Beverley Brook.

[...] It was the first Boat Race vessel to sink since the 1951 race. [...] The Light Blues would row in the same boat in which they won the 1962 and 1964 races, while Oxford's craft was manufactured by Swiss firm Stämpfli Racing Boats. [...] Both boats were German-rigged, where the number four and five row on the bow side. [...] The inclement weather continued until the day of the race, with further disruption predicted and the threat of postponement <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> [...] The race was umpired by the former Cambridge University Boat Club president and rower Alan Burrough who took part in Cambridge's victory in the 1939 race.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} June 23, 1980, at La Rochelle, France, with scenes involving the Nazi submarine, {{which had been}} rented from the production of Das Boot. The U-boat pen was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> from World War II. The crew moved to Elstree Studios for the Well of Souls scenes, the opening sequence temple interiors and Marion Ravenwood's bar. The Well of Souls scene required 7,000 snakes. The only venomous snakes were the cobras, but one crew member was bitten on set by a python. The bulk of the snakes' numbers were made up with giant but harmless legless lizards known as Scheltopusiks (Pseudopus apodus) which occur from the Balkan Peninsula of southeastern Europe to Central Asia. Growing to 1.3 m they are the largest legless lizards {{in the world and}} are often mistaken for snakes despite some very obvious differences such as the presence of eyelids and external ear openings, which are both absent from all snakes, and a notched rather than forked tongue. In the finished film, during the scene in which Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a reflection in glass screen that protected Ford from the snake was seen, an issue that was corrected in the 2003 digitally-enhanced re-release. Unlike Indiana, neither Ford nor Spielberg has a fear of snakes, but Spielberg said that seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him [...] "want to puke".|$|E
500|$|When Lisa {{develops}} stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who {{suggests he}} could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa {{has had enough}} and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one,</b> as his tank falls {{out of the back of}} the van.

Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E
500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E
