40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 A {{selection}} of southern African bird species were modelled {{in terms of}} the probability of these species colliding with or being electrocuted on overhead power lines in South Africa, based on morphological and behavioral factors. Species were included in the model on the basis of internationally recognized vulnerability to these interactions at the family level. The collision model performed poorly when tested against the actual reported mortalities for species contained in the Eskom-EWT Strategic Partnership Central Incident Register CIR) (chi-square of goodness of fit) at the individual species, family and within family levels. The electrocution model performed slightly better at the family, and within family level. Both collision and electrocution models performed better for the physically larger species (and families) and for those species with higher modelled probability of collision or electrocution. As the product of random carcass detection and reporting, the CIR data are biased in various ways. Testing the models against the CIR is therefore equally important for highlighting inadequacies in the CIR, as in the model. A number of new species have emerged as being of high collision (including most importantly <b>African</b> <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Goose,</b> Southern Ground Hornbill, Black-bellied Bustard, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, Caspian Tern, Hooded Vulture, Bateleur, African Marsh Harrier, Black Harrier, Pink-backed Pelican and Yellow-billed Stork) or electrocution (Southern Bald Ibis) probability in theoretical terms, and will require further investigation to determine their actual probability of interaction. By mapping the combined distributions of those species with high probabilities of collision and/or electrocution mortality, a number of priority high risk geographic areas emerge around the country...|$|E

In addition to being generally perching and cavity-nesting, they also have fairly wide, rounded wings, elongated tails, and sometimes also relatively long legs. Many of the species exhibit {{a great deal of}} iridescent coloration in their plumage, even among females, and in a few species nearly the entire body plumage is iridescent. In some of these brilliantly colored forms, such as the comb duck, muscovy duck, and the spur-winged goose, there is a great difference in the sizes of the sexes even though they may be very similar in plumage patterning. In spite of their brilliant plumages, males of {{only a few of the}} species exhibit definite eclipse plumages, probably in part because most of the forms are tropical, with long or irregular breeding seasons. Pair bonding is generally seasonally established in the species that breed in temperate climates, while in the more tropical and seemingly more primitive species the pair bonds are weak and in a few cases apparently even nonexistent. The patterns of the downy young are typically well marked and characterized by white or yellow spots and stripes on a darker background; in many species they are not readily separable from the downy young of dabbling ducks. The two tribes are obviously closely related, and taxonomists are not agreed on which group some species such as the ringed teal, pink-eared duck, and Brazilian teal should be included in. However, to merge the tribes would make a comparatively large tribe and tend to obscure the well-defined differences in the behavior patterns and breeding biologies of these two groups...|$|E
