It had erroneously been suggested that the king become a patient at Brislington House.|$|E
5|$|In Belgium, Merrick {{was robbed}} by his road manager and {{abandoned}} in Brussels. He eventually {{made his way}} back to London; unable to communicate, he was found by the police to have Dr. Treves's card on him. Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital. Although his condition was incurable, Merrick was allowed to stay at the hospital for the remainder of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> of London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales.|$|E

5|$|On 10 July 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Dudley and his {{supporters}}, and on {{the same}} day Mary's letter to the council arrived in London. By 12 July, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at Framlingham Castle, Suffolk. Dudley's support collapsed, and Mary's grew. Jane was deposed on 19 July. She and Dudley were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553, on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth and a procession of over 800 nobles <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{design has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Architectural historian David Watkin described {{the house as}} 'large, irregular and rather featureless' and of a 'dull design'. On the other hand, historian, archivist and Maltravers Herald Extraordinary John Martin Robinson, in The architecture of Northern England, noted the 'complex building history' of the hall, describing it as a 'substantial and elegant Georgian house'. In his early 19th century work 'Views of the Seats, Mansions, Castles, Etc. of Noblemen <b>and</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of England, Scotland and Ireland', John Preston Neale noted that the house is 'large and handsome'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those of peers <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced {{the same way as the}} helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E

5|$|On the whole, Cecil and Dudley were {{in concord}} about {{policies}} while disagreeing fundamentally about some issues, {{such as the}} Queen's marriage and some areas of foreign policy. Cecil favoured the suit of Francois, Duke of Anjou, in 1578–1581 for Elizabeth's hand, while Leicester was among its strongest opponents, even contemplating exile in letters to Burghley. The Anjou courtship, {{at the end of}} which Leicester and several dozen noblemen <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> escorted the French prince to Antwerp, also touched the question of English intervention in the Netherlands to help the rebellious provinces. This debate stretched over a decade until 1585, with the Earl of Leicester as the foremost interventionist. Burghley was more cautious of military engagement while in a dilemma over his Protestant predilections.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jacobite armies {{were made}} up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. They were 70 per cent of the forces in the 1715 {{rebellion}} and over 90 per cent of those in 1745. Most were forced to join by their clan chiefs, landlords or feudal superiors and desertion was a major problem during campaigns. The Jacobites suffered {{from a lack of}} trained officers. A typical clan regiment was {{made up of}} a small minority of gentlemen (tacksmen) who would bear the clan name. The clan gentlemen formed the front ranks of the unit and were more heavily armed than their impoverished tenants who made up the bulk of the regiment. Because they served in the front ranks, the gentlemen suffered higher proportional casualties than the common clansman. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed. In the rising of 1745, at the Battle of Prestonpans, some only had swords, Lochaber axes, pitchforks and scythes, but arms tended to become more conventional as the campaigns progressed. Only officers <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> were equipped with a broadsword, targe and pistol. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Hanoverian commander the Duke of Cumberland reported that there were 2,320 firelocks recovered from the battlefield, but only 190 broadswords.|$|E
