40|$|Abstract—Service <b>advertisement</b> <b>and</b> {{discovery}} {{are important}} components for computing in mobile ad hoc network (MANET). In this paper, a lightweight protocol of service <b>advertisement</b> <b>and</b> discovery has been implemented, {{which is based}} on a MANET multicast protocol ODMRP (On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol). In this protocol, service <b>advertisement</b> <b>and</b> discovery information is piggybacked in ODMRP routing control packets. Simulation results of the implementation prove that the implementation workload and resource consumption of the protocol are lightweight.

5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by <b>advertisements,</b> <b>and</b> 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E

The results suggest that a strong threat appeal is not effective for counseling services but that positive emotions toward the <b>advertisement</b> <b>and</b> cognitive involvement {{have a positive impact on}} advertising outcomes. The study contributes further to knowledge of threat appeal effectiveness, targeting “anxious” audiences...|$|R

5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its <b>advertisements</b> <b>and</b> business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J.

A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E
