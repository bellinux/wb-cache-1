5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the rachis <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and boring into follicles and eating seeds. This tunneling itself damages {{the architecture of}} the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an unidentified weevil species.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b>|$|E
50|$|Emilia sonchifolia is a branching, {{perennial}} herb up to 40 cm tall. Leaves are lyrate-pinnatilobed, up to 10 cm long, sometimes becoming purplish <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old.</b> One {{plant can}} produce several pink or purplish flower heads.|$|R
50|$|Ericameria watsonii is a {{branching}} shrub up to 40 cm (16 inches) tall, {{the stems}} green when young but become reddish-brown <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old.</b> Flower heads are yellow, with both ray florets and disc florets.

50|$|Chaptalia texana is a {{perennial}} plant growing {{from a large}} root. Leaves are in a basal rosette close to the ground, with dense woolly hairs on the underside but not on top. There is generally only one flower head, held on an unbranched stalk; head is nodding (hanging) at fruiting time but not at flowering time. Flowers are cream-colored, turning reddish <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old.</b>|$|R
5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, {{eyes open and}} fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.|$|E

5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} age-based stereotypes {{in accordance}} with the Stereotype Content Model in four different age groups: schoolchildren, adolescents, adults and the elderly.

The hypothesis that age groups, besides a positive evaluation of their own age cluster, would rate old people in an increasingly negative way <b>as</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> was not confirmed. On the contrary, young children seem to have the most extreme prejudice against older people. Interestingly, adults and elderly appear to evaluate their own age cluster rather negatively too. Other relations between age groups indicate that ageism does not only affect old people and that it can include positive stereotypes as well. It is also argued, that ageism may have a changing pattern throughout the lifespan...|$|R
2500|$|The western {{lowland gorilla}} is the {{smallest}} subspecies of gorilla but nevertheless still a primate of exceptional size and strength. This species of gorillas exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism. They possess no tails and have jet black skin along with coarse black hair that covers their entire body except for the face, ears, hands and feet. The {{hair on the back}} and rump of males takes on a grey coloration and is also lost <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> progressively <b>older.</b> This coloration is the reason why older males are known as [...] "silverbacks". Their hands are proportionately large with nails on all digits, similar to that of a human's, and very large thumbs.

Among these teeth are strong sets of frontal canines and large molars {{in the back of the}} mouth for grinding vegetables.|$|R
40|$|Migration and {{its effects}} on {{identity}} and integration form an important part of international research today but often tend to focus on the situation of younger migrants and their children. However, throughout the world, older people are affected directly or indirectly by migration, whether through relocation to another country late in life or their children’s resettlement. By examining the case of older Transylvanian Saxons in Romania, a country that has seen massive out-migration of its German speaking minority since 1990 (from 150, 000 to just 14, 000 now), this research seeks to address key issues concerning old age provision from the perspective of transnational families – including profiling ‘stayers’ and their decisions to remain in Romania, their changing situation and needs <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are <b>getting</b> <b>older,</b> and what role migrant children and relatives play in their care. The research also examines the presence and significance of locally-based, transnationally-funded charity organisations in the welfare provision of older Transylvanian Saxons. The research study reports on the findings collected through fieldwork in Transylvania as part of a one-year pilot study, including key issues to be addressed such as the effects of migration on Transylvanian Saxons who have resettled in Germany in later life, and the implications for Romanian families who have been affected by a sharp rise in international work migration by younger generations in recent years...|$|R

25|$|People make {{exceptions}} to and modify their space requirements. A number of relationships may allow for personal space to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, {{where there is}} a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. Personal space is affected by a person's position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger personal space. Personal space also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older).</b> Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of personal space by age twelve.|$|E
25|$|Females {{have their}} first {{ovulation}} at 13–14 {{months of age}} and have 20- to 26-day intervals between estrous cycles until they are fertilized. Males from traditional territories and leks have different courtship strategies. Males of traditional territories will herd females and keep them in their territories. Lek males {{try to do the}} same, but usually fail. They have to rely on advertising themselves. Kob courtship may last as short as two minutes, and copulation may only last a few seconds. At leks, a female may mate up to 20 times with {{at least one of the}} central males in a day. After an eight-month gestation period and giving birth, estrus may commence 21–64 days later. For their first month, calves hide in dense vegetation. Mother and calf can identify each other by their noses. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> calves gather into crèches. When they are three to four months old, the young enter the females' herds and stay with mothers until six to seven months, by which time they are weaned.

40|$|Religious {{leaders and}} {{philosophers}} have long acknowledged {{the importance of}} forgiveness. In the past twenty years, the concept of forgiveness has {{moved out of the}} domain of the religious communities and into the scientific community and popular culture. The scientific community has begun to explore and document the impact of forgiveness in our lives. Forgiveness research can ―demonstrate that the healing effects of forgiveness extend beyond personal happiness, health and well-being, to a deeper sense of coherence, wholeness, and integration of the self‖ (Emmons, 2000, p. 171). Forgiveness affects people throughout their life; however, as older adults face the developmental tasks of conducting a life review, forgiveness can help them recognize the meaning and purpose of their lives (Emmons, 2000). The pilot study will explore the nature of forgiveness as an aspect of mental health in one cohort of older adults, older Holocaust survivors. Interviews will include a purposive sample of thirty individuals who were living in any country in Europe occupied by Germany from 1933 - 1945. These survivors now range in age from early sixties to late nineties. As this generation of living witnesses of the Holocaust ages, there is an urgency to learn from them before they die. Researchers will conduct in-depth narrative interviews to hear the lived experiences of these survivors. Findings will enhance the practice of social workers who assist older adults and their families in confronting unresolved forgiveness issues. The specific aims of this study are to explore the narratives of older Holocaust survivors to understand and describe: 1. their experience, feelings, and expression of forgiveness and unforgiveness 2. changes in perception of forgiveness <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have <b>gotten</b> <b>older</b> 3. alternatives to forgiveness they have develope...|$|R

25|$|Stuttering {{can also}} have its roots in development. Many {{toddlers}} and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable {{when a child is}} excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.|$|E
