30|$|One-part <b>type</b> <b>foam</b> needs 1 h for curing, {{and this}} <b>foam</b> <b>type</b> is not useful for quick {{response}} task (ex. victim searching). However, one-part <b>type</b> <b>foam</b> can build structure {{on the wet}} condition field (ex. water, mud, snow, etc.), and befit with long-term rescue missions (ex. building foothold in Fukushima 1 st nuclear power plant). These characteristics are effective on extreme environment. On the other hand, two-part <b>type</b> <b>foam</b> needs 0.5 - 1 min for curing, and doesn’t befit on wet condition. This <b>foam</b> <b>type</b> is useful for short-term rescue missions.|$|R
30|$|The {{property}} that differs most is curing time; that is, {{the time before}} the foam is hard enough to be touched. The one-part foam requires more than 18 h to be fully cured, whereas the two-part type requires only 10 min. In our preliminary experiments, we investigated the minimum curing time required to support a robot. The robot was able climb over the foam structure approximately 1 h after construction using one-part <b>type</b> <b>foam</b> and 2 min after using two-part <b>type</b> <b>foam.</b> Moreover, the curing process differs for the two <b>types</b> of <b>foam.</b> The one-part <b>type</b> relies on moisture being present in the atmosphere, because curing {{occurs as a result}} of reaction with moisture. This means that the curing process of the one-part <b>type</b> <b>foam</b> depends on volumetric humidity (g/m 3). The two-part type cures {{as a result of an}} exothermic chemical reaction, induced by mixing the same proportion of isocyanates and polyols.|$|R

30|$|Another {{environment}} {{that could be}} considered for the application of both <b>types</b> of polyurethane <b>foam</b> is a heap of rubble.

One of the most interesting applications for one-part foam is building a road on water. The one-part <b>type</b> <b>foam</b> can cure on water whereas the two-part foam dissolves, and the density of the polyurethane structure is less than that of the water. Thus, a robot may be able to build a road on the surface of water and move over it.|$|R

ABSTRACT: Polyurethanes are versatile materials used widely in many applications. Annual production of polyurethanes is increasing day by day. The most important application of polyurethane covering its major market is polyurethane <b>foam.</b> Different <b>type</b> of <b>foaming</b> systems and foaming processes are used for synthesis of foam. There are two major <b>types</b> of polyurethane <b>foam</b> which are flexible foam and rigid foam. This review has been structured to present an overview of different <b>types</b> of <b>foam,</b> foaming systems, and processes used for production of foam.

30|$|We {{intend to}} extend our {{system in a}} swarm {{robotics}} implementation. One idea is to divide {{the roles of the}} robots according to the type of robot, where the two-part <b>foam</b> <b>type</b> robots build a strong foundation for construction, and the one-part <b>foam</b> <b>type</b> robots fill the gaps between the structures built by the two-part <b>foam</b> <b>type</b> robots. We feel that such a role-sharing model of a swarm system could improve the construction process making it more efficient. Further goals include using our system to understand the social behavior of insects and indirect communication as a source of “intelligence", which we call FMI.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} alcohol prohibition on the consumption of alcohol and other addictive goods. Using a series of household expenditure surveys for India, it finds that alcohol prohibition had differential effects on alcohol consumption by <b>alcohol</b> <b>type</b> and sector. In particular prohibition reduced consumption of arrack, IMFL, and beer in both urban and rural sectors, although {{its impact on the}} rural sector was lower. In addition, prohibition reduced toddy consumption in urban households. The relationship between alcohol and other addictive goods is also examined using prohibition as an instrument for alcohol consumption. The results suggest significant associations between alcohol and these items with the direction of the relationship differing by <b>alcohol</b> <b>type.</b> Consequently prohibition also had spill-over effects on the consumption of these items and is associated with an increase in bidi and cigarette consumption and a decrease in leaf tobacco and pan consumption.

30|$|Thus, to {{investigate}} the specifications of the two <b>types</b> of <b>foam</b> used, we carried out preliminary tests focusing on solidification time {{and the degree of}} volume expansion of the two types of material. From the results of these tests, we determined appropriate coefficients for the characteristic features of each <b>type</b> of <b>foam</b> for use in the real robot experiments. We designed the actual construction robots paying attention to spray angles. Furthermore, we proposed state transition rules to realize a set of actions involving sensing slopes, movement by actuators, and moving over irregular ground. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed system was evaluated through experiments using actual robots.|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{experimented with}} a robot that can modify the {{environment}} using one- or two-part polyurethane foam. First, we investigated {{the properties of}} both <b>types</b> of polyurethane <b>foam.</b> We also designed robots to use one- and two-part polyurethane foam, with an appropriate ejection mechanism. The reconstruction algorithm was implemented on each robot. In the foam properties section, we focused on the curing mechanism of each <b>type</b> of polyurethane <b>foam.</b> One-part <b>type</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> needed 1 h to cure before the robot could traverse it. Moreover, the foam expanded in a horizontal direction (and not a vertical direction). Conversely, the two-part <b>type</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> cured within 2 min, and the foam expanded approximately 2 times in a vertical direction (and not a horizontal direction). To consider these different properties of one- and two-part polyurethane foam, we implemented different algorithms for modifying the environment. The main difference in the algorithms is the waiting time before the robot evaluates the environment after ejection; the two-part <b>foam</b> <b>type</b> robot waits 10 s between evaluations. In the actual experiments, both types of robot could autonomously detect a ditch or step in front, and ejected polyurethane foam with a head sweeping motion. After each ejection, the robot moved backward and re-evaluated the environment. The robot looped through this sequence of actions until the environment was suitable for traversal. After waiting the required time for the structure to harden, the robot traversed the constructed foam structures. From {{the results of the}} experiments, the two-part foam appears to be a more efficient material for environmental construction.|$|R
