40|$|This {{communication}} {{deals with}} the compounding of an inexpensive material which allows temporary ad-hesion of the conductor to an electroluminescent de-vice. Many electroluminescent devices consist of a con-ductive transparent material, an electroluminescent layer and an aluminum back electrode prepared by high-vacuum evaporation. It {{is very difficult to}} repair pinholes and small blemishes in the electrolumines-cent layer once the aluminum back electrode has been applied. A temporary electrode that would make it possible to find such defects before the aluminizing step would allow the preparation of defect-free de-vices. Such an electrode must provide good electrical contact to the sometimes very rough electrolumines-cent layer, and it should be easy to apply and remove. Although water dispersions of graphite can be used for this purpose, the water is deleterious for most de-vices and may magnify or even cause defects. In addition, the black color of the conductor will detract from the brightness of a device. Alloys of mercury, indium, and thall ium can be used for this purpose since they have very low melting points and wet al-most any surface; these alloys, however, are extremely toxic and quite expensive (1). It is well known that the reaction products of boric acid and <b>aliphatic</b> <b>polyhydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> and their ammonium salts are good conductors of electricity (2). Some of these compounds dissolve in ethylene glycol; such solutions are also good conductors and are colorless, water-free liquids. They have been used formerly in the manufacture of capacitors (3). A solid polyhydric alcohol increases the viscosity with-out decreasing the conductivity; hence, it is possible to mix ethylene glycol, mannitol, boric acid, and am-monia {{in such a way that}} a very viscous, clear mass results which may be used as an adhesive; the amounts are not critical.

30|$|When {{investigating}} the sorption of organic acids onto Al minerals, one main topic is the pH {{influence on the}} distribution equilibrium. As for the adsorption of aliphatic and aromatic polycarboxylic acids, it was repeatedly found that the adsorbed amounts reached a maximum within the pH range of 4.0 – 5.5 and strongly decreased with increasing pH up to the isoelectric point (pHIEP) of the minerals [16 – 20]. This pH dependency of the adsorption maximum is usually explained by an optimal balance between the degree of the acid dissociation which increases with rising pH, depending on the respective pKa values, {{and the number of}} positive charges on the mineral surface which concomitantly decreases. The pH influence on the sorption of an aromatic <b>polyhydroxy</b> <b>compound</b> (1, 2, 3 -benzenetriol) greatly differed from that of the aromatic polycarboxylates.

The polymers were characterised by NMR, FTIR and GPC. A detailed study of the solution thermal properties showed that polymers with up to about 50 wt. % hydroxy monomer show lower critical solution temperature (LCST) properties in water. Polymers with higher hydroxy monomer content are fully soluble at all temperatures up to 100 °C. The effect of pH, salts and solvent additives on the solution thermal behaviour of the copolymers was investigated, showing that “salting-out” salts lowered the LCST and “salting-in” salts caused an initial increase in LCST at low concentrations, but reduced LCST at higher concentrations, in line with the Hoffmeister series. The LCST of any copolymer composition from this family in pure water can be predicted from the empirical equation; LCST = 0. 015 x 2 + 0. 25 x + 31. 76, where x is the fraction of the hydroxy monomer. Due to differences in polarity and the length of the carbon chain, methanol and ethanol altered LCST of p(NIPAAm) and its hydroxyl copolymers in different manners, showing a transition from cononsolvency to cosolvency as the hydroxy content of the copolymer increased.

The consequence of the intimate mixing of these components in protein bars {{is that they can}} react together, creating sensory characteristics that are unacceptable to consumers. This study examined the changes occurring in a model protein bar during storage for 50 days at 20 °C. Over this time, fracture stress increased from 20. 1 +/- 1. 8 Pa to 201 +/- 75 Pa at a rate that decreased slightly over time. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased dramatically over the first 5 days as the batter set into a solid bar. Over the first 17 hours after manufacturing, protein particles became more clustered, and soluble protein appeared to precipitate, as shown by confocal microscopy. Reactive lysine fell 38 % in the first 10 days of storage and was approximately constant thereafter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed little change in protein molecular weights. Following the initial ‘setting’ phase of 5 - 10 days, fracture stress continued to increase and the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased. Changes in PHC molecular mobility were consistent with glucose crystallisation. Chemical changes were minimal during this phase, which suggests that chemical reactions play little part in the hardening of protein bars and that changes in molecular mobility and changes in microstructure driven by moisture migration may be more important...|$|R

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is useful as a homopolymer endowed with interesting characteristics. It contains a high crystallinity rate, but is base sensitive. In addition, VDF can be co- or terpolymerized with several fluorinated monomers, rendering them suitable as elastomers and various examples of synthesis of VDF-copolymers are also presented. This review also focusses on binary and tertiary systems containing VDF. Several curing systems for these VDFcontaining copolymers have been investigated, especially diamines and their derivatives, aromatic <b>polyhydroxy</b> <b>compounds,</b> peroxides with coagents, such as triallylisocyanurate, radiations, and thiol-ene systems. The best vulcanizate properties are obtained by a two-step process.

Poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymers can react with primary, secondary or tertiary monoamines, but they are mainly crosslinked by diamines such as hexamethylene diamine (HMDA), their carbamates (HMDA-C), and derivatives. A mechanism of crosslinking is identified by Infrared and 19 F NMR spectroscopies, and was evidenced to proceed in three main steps. First, a VDF unit undergoes a dehydrofluorination {{in the presence of}} the diamine, then the Michael addition occurs onto the double bonds to form crosslinking, while HF is eliminated from crosslinks in the presence of HF scavengers.

40|$|The {{freezing}} {{temperatures of}} dilute aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, 2 -propanol, butanol, t-butanol, cyclohexanol and ethylene glycol were measured over the concentration range 0. 1 to 1 mol kg– 1. Osmotic coefficients at 0 °C were calculated. The limiting pairwise interaction coefficients of the alcohols, plus {{a variety of}} <b>polyhydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> and carbohydrates, were calculated at 25 °C from the available data and then correlated using the additivity principle of Savage and Wood. This correlation approximates effective free energies of CH 2 and CHOH group interactions with themselves and with each other. Literature data were used to estimate interactions between CONH and C[double bond]C groups. The CONH—CONH interaction appears to be large, consistent with a strong stabilizing effect of these on native protein structures. The CH 2 …CH 2 interaction also indicates attractive forces between these groups. The present model for the hydrophobic interaction is most appropriate for small molecular interactions whereas previous treatments are best for situations involving site binding. The CHOH…CHOH and CH 2 …CONH interactions are small, while the CHOH…CH 2 free energy of interaction is positive, due either to volume exclusion or net repulsive forces. The entropy change associated with the CH 2 …CH 2 interaction is large and positive as expected and is not completely compensated by a corresponding enthalpy change. The entropy change associated with the CONH…CONH interaction indicates that few degrees of freedom are involved, {{which is consistent with}} the formation of a strong hydrogen bond. The correlation can be used to estimate thermodynamic properties of dilute non-electrolyte solutions and can also predict the effect of solutes on the solubility of solids and gases...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1957 The {{oxidation}} of sorbitol by soluble extracts of A. suboxydans proceeds by two pathways {{depending upon}} which pyridine nucleotide is present. In {{the presence of}} TPN, sorbose is formed. In the presence of DPN fructose is produced. Both products of the oxidation of sorbitol have been identified by paper chromatography, optical rotation, crystaline form and melting point of the phenylosazones. The fructose can then be phosphorylated and further oxidized by cell-free extracts {{by means of the}} Horecker pentose cycle. Both hexose and pentose were shown to accumulate in digestion mixtures, when TPP was removed from transketolase. The oxidation of a number of synthetic <b>polyhydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> {{has been shown to be}} catalyzed by non-specific dehydrogenase systems of A. suboxydans. DPN-specific sorbitol dehydrogenase has been purified a minimum of 13 fold by a three step procedure. This enzyme has been shown to be sorbitol specific.

Mannitol dehydrogenase is TPN specific and may be the same enzyme as the TPN-sorbitol dehydrogenase. Both theseenzymes proportionately lose activity in the purification of the DPN sorbitol dehydrogenase. Mannitol is three times as active as sorbitol toward the preparations studied. All attempts to separate the TPN-activity from the DPN-activity failed. Both these enzymes have a pH optimum of 8. 5 and are stimulated by Mg+ + and Mn+ +. However, the TPN enzyme is more fragile, and the DPN enzyme has a much broader range of activity with pH. A heat denaturation method involving protection of the enzyme by both the cofactor and substrate was used for the DPN linked sorbitol dehydrogenase. This effect has not previously been shown...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Certain {{anthraquinone}} compounds {{are effectively}} used {{for treatment of}} cancer. The present study describes the inhibitory activity of lac dye, a mixture of <b>polyhydroxy</b> anthraquinone <b>compounds</b> (Laccaic acid A, B, C, D and E), produced by the Indian lac insect, Kerria lacca (Kerr). Materials and Methods: In vitro testing for anticancer activity of lac dye was done at four concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80 μg/ml) on ten human malignant cell lines including six human leukemia cell lines, U 973, Raji, K 562, Jurkat, MOLT 4 and HL 60 using SRB assay. Results and Conclusion: Both crimson and yellow lac dye inhibits proliferation of Human leukemia cell lines, Raji, U 937, K 562, HL 60 and Jurkat, therefore {{can be considered as}} a potential anticancer agent for leukemia...|$|R
40|$|Hydrolytically stable, low- and high-pI isoelectric {{hydrogel}} membranes {{were prepared}} from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as alternatives to polyacrylamide-based isoelectric membranes that hydrolyze in acidic and basic solutions. Low-pI membranes {{were made by}} attaching an isoelectric buffer of a welldefined pI value (such as iminodiacetic acid, IDA, aspartic acid, ASP or glutamic acid, GLU) to the PVA backbone and crosslinking the PVA strands, in situ. The pH in these membranes does not change significantly with slight variations {{in the amount of}} isoelectric buffer that gets incorporated. The pI values of these membranes were pI is greater then 1. 7 but less then 2. 0 (IDAPVA), pI is greater then 2. 0 but less then 2. 6 (ASPPVA) and pI was greater then 2. 6 but less then 3. 4 (GLUPVA). The membranes were used as anodic membranes in isoelectric trapping (IET) experiments. Sugars, cyclodextrins (CDs), and certain <b>polyhydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> have pKa values between 11. 5 and 14. Thus, high-pI hydrogels were obtained by incorporating (i) quaternary ammonium derivatives of Beta-CD (QCDPVA) (ii) quaternary ammonium groups and Beta-CD (CDQPVA) and (iii) quaternary ammonium groups alone (QPVA) into the crosslinked PVA hydrogels. All three membranes had pI values greater than 11 and served as effective cathodic membranes for the IET of small ampholytic molecules and proteins. In pH-biased IET, proteins are collected into solutions of isoelectric buffers that set the pH to keep the proteins in a charged state affording high solubility and preventing precipitation. Thus, a series of isoelectric buffers (biasers) with high buffering capacity, high conductivity, and pI values covering the useful pH 2 - 10 range are needed. Two sets of such buffers were designed (i) with pI values between the pKa values of two carboxylic acid groups and (ii) with pI values between the pKa values of the conjugate acid form of two amine groups. Six of these buffers were synthesized and their synthesis was optimized. The products were obtained in their pure, isoelectric form and were extensively characterized...|$|R
30|$|The role of {{antioxidants}} {{is their}} interaction with oxidative free radicals. The essence of DPPH method {{is that the}} antioxidants react with the stable free radical 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (deep violet color) and convert it to 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazine with discoloration. The degree of discoloration indicates the scavenging potentials of the sample antioxidant. In the present study, the extracts of C. pallida stem were able to decolourise DPPH and the free radical scavenging potentials of the extracts {{were found to be}} in order of PEE > ME > CE > AE. It has been found that cysteine, glutathione, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, <b>polyhydroxy</b> aromatic <b>compounds</b> (hydroquinone, pyrogallol, etc.), and aromatic amines (p-phenylene diamine, p-aminophenol etc.), reduce and decolourise DPPH by their hydrogen donating ability [26]. It appears that the extracts from the C. pallida stem process hydrogen donating capabilities to act as antioxidant.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{polyphenols}} (LSP) {{were obtained}} from the fermentation broth of Lachnum singerianum. Two fractions were isolated by Sephadex LH- 20 chromatographic column, and the primary fraction (LSP- 1) was collected. The comprehensive physicochemical properties of phenolic acids and <b>polyhydroxy</b> phenolic <b>compounds</b> of LSP- 1 were determined by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Results of anticoagulant activity assay in vitro showed that LSP- 1 could lengthen prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time of mouse plasma. In addition, anticoagulant activity results in vivo showed that high dose of LSP- 1 could significantly prolong bleeding time, coagulation time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time of hypercoagulable mice induced by adrenaline, reduce the content of fibrinogen and enhance antithrombin III activity. All results indicated that the LSP- 1 could serve well as an anticoagulant, and might be used as a potential natural drug candidate for thrombosis...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative stress plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{progression}} of diabetic nephropathy in hyperglycemic conditions. It has already been reported that mangiferin, a natural C-glucosyl xanthone and <b>polyhydroxy</b> polyphenol <b>compound</b> protects kidneys from diabetic nephropathy. However, little is known about the mechanism of its beneficial action in this pathophysiology. The present study, therefore, examines the detailed mechanism of the beneficial action of mangiferin on STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy in Wister rats as the working model. A significant increase in plasma glucose level, kidney to body weight ratio, glomerular hypertrophy and hydropic changes as well as enhanced nephrotoxicity related markers (BUN, plasma creatinine, uric acid and urinary albumin) were observed in the experimental animals. Furthermore, increased oxidative stress related parameters, increased ROS production and decreased the intracellular antioxidant defenses were detected in the kidney. Studies on the oxidative stress mediated signaling cascades in diabetic nephropathy demonstrated that PKC isoforms (PKCa, PKCb and PKCe), MAPKs (p 38, JNK and ERK 1 / 2), transcription factor (NF-kB) and TGF-b 1 pathways were involved in this pathophysiology. Besides, TNFa was released in this hyperglycemic condition, which in turn activated caspase 8, cleaved Bid to tBid and finally the mitochorndia-dependent apoptotic pathway. In addition, oxidative stress also disturbed the proapoptotic-antiapoptotic (Bax and Bcl- 2) balance and activated mitochorndia-dependent apoptosis via caspase 9, caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. Mangiferin treatment, post to hyperglycemia, successfully inhibited all of thes...|$|R
