5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow <b>and</b> <b>ice.</b> Questions were raised at the time about the ability of the train and tunnel electronics to withstand the mix of snow, salt <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> which collect in the tunnels during periods of extreme cold.|$|E
5|$|Håkons Hall, {{sometimes}} anglicized as Håkon Hall and Haakons Hall, is {{an arena}} located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, Norway. With a spectator capacity of 11,500 people, {{it is the}} largest handball <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> hockey venue in the country. Håkons Hall is regularly used for handball <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> hockey tournaments, concerts, exhibitions, conferences and banquets. The venue is owned by Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiapark, which owns all the Olympic venues in Lillehammer. The Norwegian Olympic Museum is located in the arena, which is located next to the smaller Kristins Hall.|$|E

40|$|Measuring <b>icing</b> load <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> rate are {{important}} parameters for an atmospheric icing sensor. A new icing sensor {{has recently been}} designed and developed at Narvik University College for measuring atmospheric icing rate, <b>icing</b> load <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> type. Unlike the existing atmospheric icing sensors commercially available in market, which uses the axial loading for measuring <b>icing</b> load <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> rate, this new sensory system measures <b>icing</b> load <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> rate using the torque loading physics. The performance of this new icing sensor has been tested and validated at cryospheric environment simulator Japan. This research work focus upon the lab based experimentation and evaluation of axial loading and torque loading sensory physics during an icing event. ...|$|R

5|$|Although Hudson {{anticipated}} that the trip would take less than a month, it took 56 days. Most of the journey was by water, <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> on the Niagara River, inclement weather <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> on Lake Erie, and unnavigable portions of the Cuyahoga River contributed to the travelers' slow progress. Although ice on Lake Erie and the Buffalo River near Niagara Falls destroyed one boat, the group reached Cleaveland (present-day Cleveland, Ohio) on June 9, 1799. After purchasing more supplies, they set off down the Cuyahoga River. Although Hudson believed that the river could carry their boats {{as far south as}} required, they only reached present-day Northfield on June 20. When the settlers arrived in the vicinity of their parcel they had difficulty locating its four boundary markers, finding the southwest marker in late June. Only one of the two groups herding cattle overland reached the settlement.|$|E

Women's club sports include rugby, cross country/track and field, Lacrosse, soccer, softball, equestrian, figure skating, and gymnastics. In recent years, the club rugby team has been very successful. Also, in April 2011, BGSU hosted the National Club Track and Field Championships at Whittaker Track on the east end of campus.|$|E

5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks <b>and</b> <b>ice.</b> Mammal species such as the grizzly, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but {{only a limited number}} of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the plane, <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E

5|$|David's {{first five}} books, {{particularly}} the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation {{and descriptions of}} people and places that inspired her.

5|$|Experiments <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E

5|$|Glacial debris <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> were {{probably}} {{present at the}} lake, with fan deltas at Tunupa overlapping the Lake Tauca shore. At Tunupa and Cerro Azanaques, glaciers reached their maximum size shortly before the lake level peaked and probably contributed to water levels when their retreat began. Two minor glacial advances, over 12,000 BP and about 11,000 BP, appear to coincide with Lake Tauca.|$|E
