50|$|For general N, the Euclidean Steiner tree {{problem is}} NP-hard, and hence it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> whether an optimal {{solution}} {{can be found}} by using a polynomial-time algorithm.

5|$|Thebe is irregularly shaped, {{with the}} closest {{ellipsoidal}} approximation being 116×98×84km. Its surface area is probably between 31,000 and 59,000 (~45,000) km2.

5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>known,</b> but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E

5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form.

The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E

Osred returned from exile but was betrayed, and killed by Æthelred's command on 14 September 792. Æthelred himself was assassinated on 18 April 796, perhaps at Corbridge, by conspirators led by the dux Ealdred. Æthelred was followed as king by Osbald, whose antecedents are unknown: he was deposed after twenty-seven days and fled {{to the land of}} the Picts with a few supporters.|$|E
5|$|Exotic {{species of}} fauna {{such as the}} zebra and quagga mussels and the New Zealand mud snail are {{invasive}} species that can greatly impact fish species.

The New Zealand mud snail {{has been found in}} the Shoshone River east of the forest.

50|$|If a logic {{includes}} formulae {{that mean}} that something <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known,</b> this logic should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> monotonic.
