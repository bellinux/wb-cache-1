We analyze ATRs from the taxpayers' and tax authorities' perspectives. Investors request ATRs if the fee does not exceed a certain threshold. We integrate this finding into the tax authorities' decision whether to offer ATRs.

Otherwise, ATRs may be beneficial only if the tax authorities restrict them to classes of investments or use investment-specific fees.

40|$|Politicians and tax {{practitioners}} often {{claim that}} tax uncertainty negatively affects investment. In many countries, firms can request fee-based <b>Advance</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Rulings</b> (ATRs) to mitigate tax uncertainty. We analyze theoretically {{the circumstances under}} which investors request ATRs, how tax authorities should price them and how they can affect investment. We assume that tax authorities integrate investors' reasoning into their decisions. We find that it is often optimal for tax authorities to charge prohibitively high fees to discourage firms from requesting an ATR. However, we find that revenue-maximizing tax authorities offer ATRs if the ruling enables them either to significantly reduce their tax audit costs or to increase the probability of detecting ambiguous tax issues. Under certain circumstances, ATRs may effectively foster investment and potentially benefit both the tax authorities and taxpayers. Our results provide new explanations for why taxpayers that face high levels of tax uncertainty often do not request ATRs, even when the fee is rather low. Our results also hold when the tax authority maximizes social wealth instead of its revenues. Regulatory changes in ATR requirements might serve as a natural quasi-experiment for an empirical study of our predictions regarding investment decisions.

40|$|Traditional {{tax control}} {{has proven to}} be an insufficiently {{effective}} means of verifying the overall real economic power of large taxpayers (multinational corporations and wealthy individuals). As compared to the increasing mobility of taxpayers, tax administration activities are limited by the territorial jurisdiction of the fiscal sovereignty. The crisis of public finances has forced many countries to focus on the prevention of tax evasion and aggressive tax planning, particularly in international tax matters. In this sense, the traditional forms of tax control are supplemented by some additional strategies which are to provide tax authorities with more data on tax payers' business operations, profit, income, expenses and property. In practice, some developed tax administrations already apply a number of specific measures: the disclosure of information about aggressive <b>tax</b> planning schemes, <b>advance</b> pricing agreement, <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rulings,</b> the use of financial intermediaries in data exchange processes, improved taxation relations, automatic exchange of tax information, etc. These specific measures are intended to help tax administrations to overcome the discrepancy between the information at their disposal and the information held by the taxpayers, which facilitates a more realistic assessment of tax liabilities. This will ensure a better management of tax risk and better tax compliance, which will ultimately contribute to a more efficient development of tax systems in the contemporary global business environment...|$|R
40|$|Tax {{uncertainty}} often negatively affects investment. <b>Advance</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> (ATRs) {{are commonly}} used as a measure to provide <b>tax</b> certainty. <b>Rulings</b> are currently controversially discussed {{in the context of}} tax planning activities of multinational firms (Luxembourg Leaks). We analyze ATRs as tax uncertainty shields from both the taxpayers' and the tax authorities' perspectives. In general, tax authorities charge ATR fees and investors request ATRs provided the fee does not exceed a certain threshold. We assume risk neutral investors and that tax authorities integrate investors' reasoning in their decision on whether and at what price to offer ATRs. We find for uniformly distributed cashflows that tax authorities offer ATRs at a prohibitively high fee. However, extending our model framework we find that ATRs are offered if the ATR enables tax authorities either to significantly reduce their tax audit costs, or to increase the probability of detecting ambiguous tax issues, or to increase their revenues by attracting more investment. ATRs may foster investment and are hence potentially beneficial for both tax authorities and taxpayers if the investment projects in question generate relatively small net returns but high tax uncertainty. This pattern is typical for aggressive tax planning strategies, e. g., in tax havens. Our findings are threefold. First, we find that even risk neutral investors will pay for tax certainty. Second, they enable us to explain the enormous demand for rulings for tax-aggressive strategies and illustrate the tax authorities' opportunity cost of offering ATRs free of charge to attract taxaggressive foreign MNGs. Third, our results provide new explanations for why ATRs, even if the fee is rather low, are not as frequently requested by taxpayers with substantial investments, as expected in settings with high tax uncertainty. Our paper elaborates the theoretical foundation that is essential when planning to use ATR fees as a new measure for tax uncertainty in future empirical tests...|$|R
40|$|Fairness in the {{administration}} of the tax law is the subject of intense debate in the United States. As recent headlines reveal, the Internal Revenue Service has been accused of failing to enforce the tax law equitably in its review of tax-exempt status applications by political organizations, the international tax structures of multinational corporations, and the estate tax returns of millionaires, among other areas. Many have argued that greater “tax transparency” would better empower the public to hold the IRS accountable and the IRS to defend itself against accusations of malfeasance. Mandatory public disclosure of taxpayers’ tax return information is often proposed as a way to achieve greater tax transparency. Yet, in addition to concerns regarding exposure of personal and proprietary information, broad public disclosure measures pose potential threats to the taxing authority’s ability to enforce the tax law. Given the competing values of accountability and enforcement, what tax return information should be observable by the public? This Article argues that timing matters. The IRS continually engages in enforcement actions ex post, after taxpayers have pursued transactions and claimed tax positions, such as by conducting audits or settlements. But it also frequently engages in actions ex ante, before taxpayers pursue transactions and claim tax positions, by issuing <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> to and entering into agreements with specific taxpayers. While current law appears to require public disclosure of certain types of ex ante tax administration, many forms of ex ante tax administration remain concealed from public view. This Article argues that documents related to a specific taxpayer’s tax affairs that reflect ex ante tax administration should be publicly accessible as a means of accountability, but that documents that reflect ex post tax actions should remain private in order to preserve effective tax enforcement. Further, this Article proposes that the public should have access not only to ex ante tax administration actions where the taxing authority grants taxpayers’ requests, but also to those actions where the taxing authority denies such requests, even if it does so without issuing an official written determination, a concept it defines as “dual tax transparency. ” The Article then applies this analysis to several types of ex ante tax administration that are currently obscured by the curtain of tax privacy: withdrawn private letter ruling requests, adverse tax-exempt determination letters and advance pricing agreements. It concludes by exploring approaches to improving the accountability of the IRS regarding its ex post tax enforcement other than public disclosure of tax return information...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>rulings</b> are binding {{decisions}} that taxpayers may seek from tax authorities to determine in advance how certain transactions {{will be treated}} fiscally.

40|$|An Intermediary Holding Company (“IHC”) is {{a company}} that is {{interposed}} between an ultimate holding company and the operating subsidiaries of a group of companies. The IHC operates at an international level such that either its holding company or its subsidiaries or both are located in a country foreign to the IHC. Its main functions are to acquire, manage and dispose of the assets of the group of companies and to facilitate structural flexibility of a group of companies. Investors have tax and non-tax reasons for conducting business using an IHC, and, depending on the reasons, they determine the location of the IHC based on the characteristics of potential host countries. This thesis analyses the suitability of the South African corporate tax regime for the use of South African-resident Intermediary Holding Companies. The South African government has the objective of promoting South Africa as a gateway for investment in Africa and for this reason the present research is important. Such an objective could be adversely affected by a corporate tax regime that is not suitable for the operations of an IHC. Furthermore, the Katz Commission recommended in 1997 that South Africa should consider introducing a regime that is suitable for the location of holding companies. In discharging its functions the IHC attracts liability for corporate income tax, capital gains tax, controlled foreign company tax and dividends tax. It also exposes itself to anti-avoidance measures such as thin capitalisation and transfer pricing provisions. The existence of such taxes and anti-avoidance measures in the tax system of a country may deter investors from locating an IHC in such country. Exchange control regulations could also adversely affect the ability of the IHC to perform its functions effectively, as their purpose is to restrict the movement of capital out of the country. The South African legal system contains all these taxes and anti-avoidance measures as well as exchange control provisions. However, it also contains tax instruments that alleviate the tax burden on an investor using an IHC such as the participation exemption, <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> and a network of tax treaties. Against this background this thesis analyses the South African corporate tax system to determine whether it is suitable for locating an IHC. In the analysis, a comparative study is done of the tax systems of two of the most effective IHC host countries, namely the Netherlands and Mauritius. In addition, a brief discussion of the special features contained in the tax systems of Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom outlines why these jurisdictions are not necessarily successful in attracting IHCs. The thesis also discusses harmful tax practices and the attitude of the international community towards countries that engage in harmful tax competition {{in order to determine the}} limits to which a country should use the tax system to attract investment. Finally, the thesis makes recommendations as to what adjustments could be made in order to enhance the suitability of South Africa to host an IHC. The thesis recommends a special dispensation as regards corporate income tax and exchange control that would apply to wholly-owned South African companies that own foreign subsidiary shares and loans that consist of 80 % of the gross asset total of these companies.

40|$|The Australian <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> {{system has}} been decades in the making. At each stage during its {{development}} the concept of taxpayer certainty has been invoked as the catalyst for change, but rarely has that concept been defined beyond the idea that certainty is obtained from knowing what the Commissioner of Taxations views are. The system now in operation is claimed by the Australian Taxation Office to give certainty to taxpayers that is unrivalled. In that respect, certainty is meant to encompass the ability to bind the Commissioner {{and to have a}} private ruling reviewed by the judiciary. The history of Australian <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> includes developments desiring taxpayer certainty as a consequence, not as their driver. Thus the major aim of the thesis was to thoroughly test the proposition that certainty has not {{been at the forefront of}} change. This was carried out by undertaking a study of the history of the Australian <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> system, with extensive discussions of the causes and effects of each major development. The result of that aspect of the research was that at every stage of the development of Australias <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> system, the <b>Tax</b> Office has displayed an entrenched and reactive approach, and that this lack of proactivity, including the failure to at any stage develop or consider a strategic and conceptual framework for <b>tax</b> <b>rulings,</b> has been a major contributor to the ongoing quest by taxpayers for certainty via <b>tax</b> <b>rulings.</b> An ancillary aim of the research was to investigate the extent to which certainty is prevalent in the current <b>tax</b> <b>rulings</b> system.
