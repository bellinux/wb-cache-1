40|$|Ischaemic {{heart disease}} remains {{the leading cause}} of death worldwide. Following an ischaemic event, the primary {{strategy}} is to restore blood flow (reperfusion). However, this triggers release of reactive oxygen species, activation of stress-related gene transcription, autophagy and cell death processes leading to further injury (reperfusion injury). Elevated plasma aldosterone levels produce adverse cardiac effects, while mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) reduce mortality, although mechanisms have not been defined. The aim of this thesis was to determine the role of MR regulation during experimental myocardial infarction (MI). This was achieved by using an ex-vivo isolated rat heart model and occluding a branch of the left coronary artery (30 min) followed by reperfusion (150 min). Increased levels of oxidative stress with activated autophagy and apoptosis confirmed our model of MI. Since there are sex differences in cardiac damage during MI, our studies show that androgens downregulate anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, which shifts the balance towards apoptosis leading to <b>aggravated</b> cardiac <b>damage</b> in males compared to females. Expression levels of MR have been reported to be upregulated during MI in males, which could contribute to the <b>aggravated</b> <b>damage,</b> we did not find any significant change in MR expression between male and female rats and hence male rats were used for subsequent studies. Activation of MR by aldosterone (10 nM) increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and aggravated infarct size during MI; prevented by low-dose MR antagonists. Low-dose (10 nM) spironolactone alone maintained redox balance, prevented activation of stress-related gene transcription and degradation of anti-apoptotic protein ARC, which prevented initiation of apoptosis. These studies provide direct evidence that MR activation <b>aggravates</b> cardiac <b>damage</b> during MI and provide mechanisms for the cardioprotective action of low-dose MR antagonists clinically...|$|R

In its motion to remove Hill from the search warrant proceedings, it implied that he was not trustworthy and might act in those proceedings in a manner that would benefit him in his libel action. It pleaded justification or truth of its statement when it knew it to be false. It subjected Hill to a demeaning cross-examination and, in its address to the jury, depicted Hill as a manipulative actor.|$|E

40|$|Chronic stress {{has been}} linked to severe declines in health and {{dramatically}} decreased longevity. It causes the death of neurons in the hippocampus, a region of the brain heavily involved in memory formation [1] and <b>aggravates</b> <b>damage</b> caused by cerebral ischemia in stroke [2, 3]. Prolonged stress suppresses the immune system, leading to compromised wound healing, reactivation of previously latent viral infections, increased susceptibility to new infections, and decreased efficacy of administered vaccines [4, 5]. Chronic stress has also been linked to a host of systemic diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypertension [4, 6]. Many of these adverse health outcomes are mediated by glucocorticoids, hormones synthesized in the adrenal cortex (for a comprehensive review of glucocorticoid actions in the stress response, see Sapolsky et al.

40|$|Transglutaminase 2 (TG 2) {{is highly}} {{expressed}} during chondrocyte maturation {{and contributes to}} the formation of a mineralised scaffold by introducing crosslinks between extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In healthy cartilage, TG 2 stabilises integrity of ECM and likely influences cartilage stiffness and mechanistic properties. At the same time, the abnormal accumulation of TG 2 in the ECM promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage calcification, which might be an important aspect of osteoarthritis (OA) initiation. Although excessive joint loading and injuries are one of the main causes leading to OA development, it is now being recognised that the presence of inflammatory mediators accelerates OA progression. Inflammatory signalling is known to stimulate the extracellular TG 2 activity in cartilage and promote TG 2 -catalysed crosslinking of molecules that promote chondrocyte osteoarthritic differentiation. It is, however, unclear whether TG 2 activity aims to resolve or <b>aggravate</b> <b>damages</b> within the arthritic joint. Better understanding of the complex signalling pathways linking inflammation with TG 2 activities is needed to identify the role of TG 2 in OA and to define possible avenues for therapeutic interventions...|$|R
