5|$|Canadian {{country singer}} Shania Twain helped launch the new red Raptors {{alternate}} road uniform {{at the start}} of the 2003–04 season, and the jerseys made their debut in a 90–87 season-opening victory on October 29, 2003 against the defending Conference Champion New Jersey Nets. Davis and Jerome Williams were traded early in the season for Jalen Rose and Donyell Marshall. After 50 games, Toronto was 25–25 and in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs, but injuries to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8–24 in their remaining games. The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg, Marshall's 10.7 rpg, and rookie Bosh, a 6–10 forward-centre, averaging 11.5ppg and 7.4rpg and being named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. Williams' knee injury turned out to be career-ending.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{campaign}} in Croatia {{ended in a}} stalemate, leading both sides to accept an internationally supervised ceasefire. By late November, the JNA {{was no longer in}} <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> substantial advances, while Milošević refused to pursue objectives that he no longer considered achievable. Between September and December 1991, the HV captured many weapons and significantly increased its capabilities. In mid-January 1992, it commanded 155,772 troops and had 216 tanks, 127 other armoured vehicles and 1,108 artillery pieces at its disposal. Even though JNA positions in western Slavonia were on the brink of military collapse, the HV struggled elsewhere and its munitions stockpiles were depleted, while the UN arms embargo prevented its quick resupply. By the end of 1991, the conflict had killed 6,000 Croatians. Another 23,000 were wounded and 400,000 became internally displaced persons (IDPs). Some sources report that there were as many as 600,000 IDPs. The 6,000 killed include 3,761 soldiers. JNA losses were officially reported at 1,279 killed in action, but the figure may have been considerably higher because casualties were consistently under-reported during the war. The HV counter-offensive in western Slavonia created 20,000 Serb refugees. They fled from the area when the JNA ordered the Croatian Serb forces to withdraw, and were subsequently settled in JNA-held Baranja.|$|E

25|$|Writers in a {{specialized}} field {{or with a}} narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market {{in the form of}} small presses and self-publishing.

These publishing alternatives provide an avenue for authors who believe that mainstream publishing will not meet their needs or who are in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more money from direct sales than they could from bookstore sales, such as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.|$|E

25|$|With new {{national}} Bundestag (West Germany's parliament) elections coming up, the Social Democratic Party was coming into power, first in 1966 {{as part of}} a broad coalition, and by 1969, with a parliamentary majority. With the Social Democrats holding the power, they were finally in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> key appointments in the Ministry of Justice and start implementing reform. In addition, demographic anxieties such as fear of declining birth rate no longer controlled the 1960s and homosexual men were no longer seen as a threat {{for not being able to}} reproduce. The role of the state was seen as protecting society from harm, and should only intervene in cases that involved force or the abuse of minors.|$|E

If they were to win the last game or either one of the two teams ahead of them lose there will be a tie in for fourth place with the playoffs at stake. But on July 9 Lindsay and the team were defeated. Lindsay cited the point {{differential}} of 20 points was too great to make up. As a result, they did not make the playoffs.

A few years later, he killed Ragnachar, the Frankish king of Cambrai, and his brothers. By the 490s, he had conquered all the Frankish kingdoms {{to the west of}} the River Maas except for the Ripuarian Franks and was in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the city of Paris his capital. He became the first king of all Franks in 509, after he had conquered Cologne.

25|$|Spurrier's first {{extended}} opportunity came in 1972, when {{an injured}} ankle left Brodie unable {{to play for}} over a month. San Francisco was 2-3 when Spurrier became the starter, and he led the team to a 6-1-1 record, throwing sixteen touchdowns over eight games and putting them in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs. Spurrier continued to start even after Brodie had recovered. However, when he threw three interceptions {{in the first half}} of the regular season finale, Brodie entered the game and led a second half comeback that clinched a playoff spot. Head coach Dick Nolan chose to start Brodie in the first round of the playoffs against the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers had beaten 31-10 on Thanksgiving Day with Spurrier starting. Spurrier did not make an appearance in the playoff rematch, and the Cowboys intercepted Brodie twice on their way to a 30-28 victory that ended the 49ers' season.|$|E
500|$|Though {{scientists}} made headway in decreasing {{mercury and}} phosphorus levels in water, {{the natural environment}} of South Florida continued to decline in the 1990s, and life in nearby cities reflected this downturn. To address {{the deterioration of the}} Miami metropolitan area, Governor Lawton Chiles commissioned a report on the sustainability of the area. In 1995, Chiles published the commission's findings in a report that related the degradation of the Everglades ecosystems to the lower quality of life in urban areas. The report noted past environmental abuses that brought the state to <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a decision. Not acting to improve the South Florida ecosystem, the report predicted, would inevitably cause further and intolerable deterioration that would harm local tourism by 12,000jobs and $200million annually, and commercial fishing by 3,300jobs and $52million annually. Urban areas had grown beyond their capacities to sustain themselves. Crowded cities were facing problems such as high crime rates, traffic jams, severely overcrowded schools, and overtaxed public services; the report noted that water shortages were ironic, given the [...] of rain the region received annually.|$|E
500|$|By early December, Howe decided, {{despite having}} written to Colonial Secretary Lord George Germain {{requesting}} to be relieved of his command, {{that he was}} in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one last attempt to destroy Washington's army before the onset of winter, and he began preparations for an attack on the American forces. Washington's intelligence network in Philadelphia, led by Maj. John Clark, became aware of British plans to surprise the Americans. According to a historically unsubstantiated story, Howe's movements were revealed to the Americans by a Quaker woman named Lydia Darrah, who overheard British officers quartered in her house discussing Howe's plan, and crossed the British lines to deliver this information to Col. Elias Boudinot of the Continental Army, who was at the Rising Sun Tavern between Germantown and Northern Liberties, (located at the present day intersection of Germantown Avenue and Old York Road [...] ) attempting to secure provisions. Boudinot immediately relayed this information to Washington, and the Continental Army was ready when Howe, with a force of approximately 10,000 men, marched out of Philadelphia just prior to midnight on December 4. [...] The advance column, led by Lt. Gen. Lord Cornwallis, headed up Germantown Pike. A second column, led by Lt. Gen. von Knyphausen, marched toward the American left.|$|E

500|$|The Bonanno {{family had}} been in decline {{for the better part}} of the last quarter century since Joseph Bonanno's ouster in the 1960s, and it was kicked off the Commission {{altogether}} following Pistone's infiltration. By the late 1990s the situation was reversed, and the Bonanno family was now reckoned as the most powerful crime family in New York and the nation, in no small part because Massino was the only full-fledged New York boss who was still on the streets. [...] As it turned out, being thrown off the Commission actually worked in the Bonannos' favor; they were the only family whose leadership wasn't decimated in the Mafia Commission Trial. Wary of surveillance, Massino generally avoided meeting with members of other Mafia families and encouraged his crews to operate independently as well. In January 2000, however, Massino did preside over an informal Commission meeting with the acting bosses of the other four families. As the most powerful Mafia leader in both New York and the nation, Massino was in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> general policies for the Five Families.
