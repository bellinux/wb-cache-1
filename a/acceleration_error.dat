This strategy ensures that the ensemble-average <b>acceleration</b> <b>error</b> is minimal at a small radius r 0, and that the error never exceeds the optimal value beyond r 0.

The antenna system consists of a dual S/X-band telemetry tracking feed in a Cassegrain configuration with a 10 -meter parabolic reflector designed for 100 mph wind loading and 10 deg/sec accelerations. The 2 antenna system is mounted to a newly-developed elevation-over-azimuth tracking pedestal, which incorporates the latest technology in a dual brushless d. c. servo motor torque-biased drive train for each axis. This drive train provides an exceptionally wide dynamic range in trlcking velocities for very slow horizon tracking and very fast velocities for near-overhead passes. A microprocessor-based servo control system using the latest state variables feedback and adaptive control techniques is used to provide accurate tracking for both slow and fast rates.

40|$|Abstract—Acquiring instant {{vehicle speed}} is {{desirable}} and a corner stone to many important vehicular applications. This paper utilizes smartphone sensors {{to estimate the}} vehicle speed, especially when GPS is unavailable or inaccurate in urban environments. In particular, we estimate the vehicle speed by integrating the accelerometer’s readings over time and find the <b>acceleration</b> <b>errors</b> can lead to large deviations between the estimated speed and the real one. Further analysis shows that the changes of <b>acceleration</b> <b>errors</b> are very small over time which can be corrected at some points, called reference points, where the true vehicle speed is known. Recognizing this observation, we propose an accurate vehicle speed estimation system, SenSpeed, which senses natural driving conditions in urban environments including making turns, stopping and passing through uneven road surfaces, to derive reference points and further eliminates the speed estimation deviations caused by <b>acceleration</b> <b>errors.</b> Extensive experiments demonstrate that SenSpeed is accurate and robust in real driving environments. On average, the real-time speed estimation error on local road is 1. 32 mph, and the offline speed estimation error is as low as 0. 75 mph. Whereas the average error of GPS is 3. 1 mph and 2. 8 mph respectively. I...|$|R

The orbit of GNSS satellites are modelled, in the first instance, based on Keplerian motion. However in reality, a number of small; complex; and difficult to model forces act on the satellite, causing slight accelerations and thus deviations from the predicted orbit. Various groups have analysed satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals and shown a consistent intractable range bias of around - 5 cm. A radial error of 5 cm equates to an <b>acceleration</b> <b>error</b> of around 2. 2 x 10 - 9 ms- 2. Assuming that this acceleration did not increase over time (which it would) and there were no methods to correct the predicted orbit (which generally there are) this tiny <b>acceleration</b> <b>error</b> will map into a minimum along-track position error of around 2 metres after one 12 hour orbit revolution. The results of this paper have shown that failure to model Earth radiation pressure and antenna thrust and an error in the published value of the offset between the phase centre of the satellite laser retroreflector array and the satellite centre of mass (for GPS 35 and GPS 36) could be the cause of up to 41 mm of the reported 5 cm bias. The remainder may be due to other deficiencies in the microwave orbit modelling process, for example simplification of the satellite structure used in orbit models; mismodelling of non-conservative forces; mismodelling spacecraft attitude or most likely a combination of these factors. Difficulties for orbit modelling still remain during the spacecrafts pass through the Earth’s shadow, as attitude control is lost and the non-conservative forces acting on the spacecraft will be affecting it differently than when nominal attitude is maintained. It is likely that a specialist shadow model will be required to deal with this problem...|$|E

Moreover, the proposed approach was tested in a kinematic vehicle experiment as well. Using the designed simulations and kinematic vehicle experiments, {{it has been shown}} that the disturbance acceleration of each mode can be accurately estimated and corrected.
