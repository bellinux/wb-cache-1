25|$|Ecological {{succession}} {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} successive occupation of a site by different plant communities. In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the seral stages and finally by a climax community typical of the climatic zone. Robert Scott Troup suggested that succession began in the newly <b>accreted</b> <b>land</b> created by fresh deposits of eroded soil. The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is Sonneratia, followed by Avicennia and Nypa. As the ground is elevated {{as a result of}} soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is Excoecaria. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, Heritiera fomes begins to appear.|$|E
50|$|Mangroves are salt tolerant, {{complex and}} dynamic eco-systems {{that occur in}} {{tropical}} and subtropical inter-tidal regions. Bhitarkanika is one such location of rich, lush green vibrant eco-system lying in the estuarine region of Brahmani- Baitarani in the North-Eastern corner of Kendrapara district of Odisha. The area is intersected by a network of creeks with Bay of Bengal on the East. The alley between the meandering creeks and rivers, houses the second largest viable mangrove eco-system of India. Its 672 km². of mangrove forest & wetland, provides home to well over 215 species of birds including winter migrants from central-Asia and Europe. Giant salt water crocodiles {{and a variety of}} other wildlife inhabit this eco-system which is one of Asia's most spectacular wildlife sanctuaries.An area of 145 km². have been notified as Bhitarkanika National Park vide Notification No.19686/F & E dated 16.9.1998 of Forests & Environment Department, Government of Odisha. It has much significance with regard to ecological, geomorphological and biological background which includes mangrove forests, rivers, creeks, estuaries, back water, <b>accreted</b> <b>land</b> and mud flats. Bhitarkanika National Park is the core area of Bhitarkanika Sanctuary.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} the impact of {{morphological}} changes on storm surge disaster risks in coastal areas around the Meghna estuary of Bangladesh. Long term meso scale features of bathymetry change in the target area are first investigated through analysis of shoreline profiles extracted from satellite images. More than 40 shoreline profiles within the past 40 years are extracted from satellite images. Difference of the tidal phaseduring the period when satellite image was acquired is taken into consideration. Based on Cyclone Sidr of 2007, several model cyclones are selected for numerical computations of storm surges around the Meghna estuary. Besides shoreline profiles, ground elevations of the newly accreted lands arealtered in the computation to compare the inundation area, inundation depth and hydrodynamic forces in each case. Results show that(i) 10 to 20 years of morphology change could alter local inundation height of the order of meters; (ii) elevation of newly created land affectsthe inundation time of surrounded area and 3 m higher <b>accreted</b> <b>land</b> tends to shorten the inundation time up to 100 minutes; (iii) newly created land reduces the damage levels behind itself while it increases the inundation area and height in the area located seaside of itself and (iv) newly created land significantly reduces the stormy waves and hydrodynamic forces especially in the area behind itself...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the role of technology to aquaculture farmers vulnerable to climate change and the study also identified common categories of aquaculture practices in the coastal district Noakhali, Bangladesh and the vulnerabilities associated with such aquaculture practices. The study focused on the sustainability of farmers’ livelihood. The study used extensive field visits, interviews with the key informants of Regional Fisheries and Livestock Development Component (RFLDC) and farmers, personal communications and focus group discussion as the main procedures to collect data and information. The study also used the sustainable rural livelihood framework to show farmers’ livelihood resources and transforming strategies to resilient livelihood outcome. The study found four common categories of aquaculture in the mainland, accreted and newly <b>accreted</b> <b>lands</b> of Noakhali and characterized those with technology level, size, dependencies, markets, ownership, species mix, constraints and vulnerabilities to changing climate. Average net returns from the technology induced aquaculture in community based ponds and waterlogged paddy lands were 905. 33 and 362. 78 USD/ha/year respectively. The study found the pond aquaculture in the newly <b>accreted</b> <b>lands</b> more vulnerable to climate change than other types. RFLDC which is a joint collaboration project of Government of Bangladesh and DANIDA, {{had been involved in}} extending technology to the poor farmers for sustainable development of the farmers’ livelihood through agricultural activities. Farmer Field Schools, Community Based Organizations (CBOs), CBO associations and Union Parishad {{have been found to be}} playing very effective role for the development of aquaculture and livelihood diversification. Diversification in the culture systems has been suggested as a management practice in the study area which can increase farmers’ resilience to the vulnerabilities...|$|R

40|$|Pacific GeoScience has {{completed}} a revised {{study of the}} erosion of Tribal lands (tracts) located along the Missouri River within the yankton Sioux Reservation. This riverbank erosion {{is related to the}} construction and operation of Fort Randall Dam. This study evaluated the erosion and accretion of Tribal tracts from 1941 through 1998 (the study period), and estimates the value of the net land eroded as a result of dam construction and operation. This report supersedes the ENVIRON report of 1992 and presents a more comprehensive evaluation of the monetary value of the lost acreage. This study utilizes the current tract identification numbers that are consistent with the Bureau of Indian Affairs 2 ̆ 7 (BIA) database. The background and principal findings of this study are as follows: • The Army Corp of Engineer 2 ̆ 7 s (COE) report entitled, Missouri River Review Report/or Water Resources Development completed in the late- 1970 s, shows that during the 1946 - 1952 construction period of the Fort Randall Dam, 945 acres were lost on the 36. 3 mile reach of the Missouri River between Fort Randall Dam and Niobrara, Nebraska. During the following period, 1953 - 1975, an additional 1, 058 acres were lost to erosion. This reach of river includes most of the western boundary of the yankton Sioux Reservation. • In October 1981, the COB, {{at the request of the}} Tribe, provided a Section 55, Streambank Erosion Protection Technical Assistance Report. The COE report stated that during the 1953 - 1976 period the entire reach, which contains the study areas of our report, has 2 ̆ 2 [...] . experienced severe erosion; and it is not likely to cease in the forseeable future. 2 ̆ 2 • The severe erosion that has occurred along 17 Tribal tracts of land, that is related to the construction and operation of Fort Randall Dam, has resulted in a loss of 450. 3 acres, of which 427. 1 acres is prime arable land. • There are 18. 7 acres of arable <b>accreted</b> <b>land</b> at tract T 2016, resulting in a net loss of 408. 4 acres of arable Tribal land (427. 1 - 18. 7 acres). • The potential economic value of the lost Tribal land Was estimated based on returns from dryland alfalfa crop production uwested at 7 percent average annual yield for the period since the principal erosion occurred (either 1953 or 1976, as discussed in the text). •The dryland alfalfa crop returns were estimated to be 122. 37 per acre, assuming above average farm management practices and no land charges or management fees. • The present day value of the lost Tribal landis estimated to be approximately 1, 000 per acre. Given these figures, the estimated present day value of the net Tribal lands lost to erosion during the period from 1953, at the completion of the Fort Randall Dam,to 1998 is approximately 11, 300, 000. • This evaluation does not take into consideration the future value of the eroded Tribal lands...|$|E
50|$|As of 2004, {{population}} estimates in Bangladesh {{ranged from}} 200 to 419, {{mostly in the}} Sundarbans. This region is the only mangrove habitat in this bioregion, where tigers survive, swimming between islands in the delta to hunt prey. Bangladesh's Forest Department is raising mangrove plantations supplying forage for spotted deer. Since 2001, afforestation has continued {{on a small scale}} in newly <b>accreted</b> <b>lands</b> and islands of the Sundarbans.From October 2005 to January 2007, the first camera-trap survey was conducted across six sites in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to estimate tiger population density. The average of these six sites provided an estimate of 3.7 tigers per 100 km2. Since the Bangladesh Sundarbans is an area of 5770 km2 it was inferred that the total tiger population comprised approximately 200 individuals. In another study, home ranges of adult female tigers were recorded comprising between 12 and 14 km2., which would indicate an approximate carrying capacity of 150 adult females. The small home range of adult female tigers (and consequent high density of tigers) in this habitat type relative to other areas may be related to both the high density of prey and the small size of the Sundarbans tigers.|$|R
30|$|Nanomechanical {{resonators}} (NRs) {{with very}} high frequency have a great potential formass sensing with unprecedented sensitivity. In this study, we propose a scheme formass sensing based on the NR capacitively coupled to a Cooper-pair box (CPB) drivenby two microwave currents. The <b>accreted</b> mass <b>landing</b> on the resonator can be measuredconveniently by tracking the resonance frequency shifts because of mass changes inthe signal absorption spectrum. We demonstrate that frequency shifts induced byadsorption of ten 1587 bp DNA molecules can be well resolved in the absorptionspectrum. Integration with the CPB enables capacitive readout of the mechanicalresonance directly on the chip.|$|R
40|$|The undeveloped {{southern}} tip of Topsail Island, NC, known as South Topsail Beach, has been <b>accreting</b> <b>land</b> and extending southwest into New Topsail Inlet {{at the rate of}} approximately 100 feet per year for the past decade, growing to its current size of roughly 135 acres. The dynamic coastal processes that dominate this landscape create habitat that the federally threatened shorebird the piping plover (Charadrius melodus), the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), and the annual plant seabeach amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus) depend on for survival. Human disturbance and loss of habitat due to shoreline stabilization are among the biggest threats to success of these species throughout their habitat range. This Masters Project, {{in the form of a}} management plan, seeks to address the needs of these threatened species, while allowing for traditional and passive recreational uses at South Topsail Beach. In an effort to better understand shoreline change at this location, and to inform management recommendations for South Topsail Beach, a geospatial analysis using LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data was performed. Areas of erosion and accretion on both sides of New Topsail Inlet were identified and volumetric change was calculated for the years 1996 through 2005. Beach profiles were created to more closely examine spatial changes. Monitoring shoreline change over time can be used as a management tool to indicate habitat size and quality on a local level. On a broader scale, this type of analysis may be used to identify additional undeveloped dynamic inlet habitat appropriate for conservation...|$|R
40|$|Following {{closure of}} Ft. Peck dam in 1937, the Missouri River {{degraded}} and widened for about 75 km downstream of the dam, triggering a complex response that affected {{the river for}} hundreds of kilometers downstream. Most of the degradation near the dam occurred between 1945 and 1955. Between 1949 and 1967, a reach about 290 river km downstream widened and shallowed, apparently in response to degradation and bank erosion upstream. The episode of widening on the downstream reach was followed by entrenchment after 1967, and channel widths decreased to near pre-dam values. As the channel began to narrow, a series of mid-channel bars formed, many of which eventually attached to the bank on both sides, forming a terrace below the floodplain. When oil was discovered in the 1980 s underlying the floodplain just upstream of the North Dakota border, the State of Montana initiated legal proceedings to claim portions of the young terrace and the underlying oil. River law in Montana and other states awards the state all islands and "accumulations of land " formed within the beds of streams. Although the district court decided {{in favor of the}} landowners, the Montana Supreme Court overturned the verdict, accepting the state's argument that the terrace consists of <b>land</b> <b>accreted</b> to islands rather than <b>land</b> <b>accreted</b> to the banks...|$|R
30|$|From the study, it {{was found}} that from 1973 to 2011, about 189.4  km 2 lands was eroded from the left bank section and only 23.66  km 2 was accreted with a net loss of 155  km 2. Instead, right bank of the Padma River behaved in the {{opposite}} manner with 166.53  km 2 erosion and 134.45  km 2 accretions. Comparing to the right bank, left bank was more vulnerable to erosion which destroyed the permanent stable lands. However, the value of the newly <b>accreted</b> char <b>land</b> is very low compare to the main land. Thus this hazard creates a great loss in the local economy. Within the studied time range the monetary loss is about 1414.81 million BDT (17, 422, 937.16 $). Many wealthy farmers of the study area turn into marginal farmer and even landless due to the erosional hazard. Agricultural land becomes barren land by huge siltation and the cropping pattern has been changed significantly. In addition, the infrastructure and property losses are enormous. From the results of vulnerability index (IPCC-VI) it suggests that the most vulnerable areas are identified as Boyra (0.061), Kanchanpur (0.062), Lesragonj (0.064), Azimnagar (0.067), Sutalori (0.071) and Dhulsonra (0.076) because of more sensitivity and less adaptive capacity. On the other hand, Balara (−  0.017) and Balla (−  0.019) are comparatively least vulnerable comparing to the previous sites.|$|R
30|$|The basic superconducting CPB {{consists}} of a low-capacitance superconducting electrodeweakly linked to a superconducting reservoir by a Josephson tunnel junction. Owing toits controllability [11 – 14], a CPB has been proposed to couple to the NR to drive an NR into asuperposition of spatially separated states and probe the decay of the NR [15], to prepare the NR in a Fock state and perform a quantum non-demolitionmeasurement of the Fock state [16], and to cool the NR to its ground state [17]. Recently, this coupled CPB-NR system has been realized in experiments [18, 19] and the resonance frequency shifts of the NR could be monitored by performingmicrowave (MW) spectroscopy measurement. Based on the above-mentioned achievements, inthis article, we investigate the signal absorption spectrum of the CPB qubitcapacitively coupled to an NR in the simultaneous presence of a strong control MWcurrent and a weak signal MW current. Theoretical analysis shows that two sideband peaksappear at the signal absorption spectrum, which exactly correspond to the resonancefrequency of the NR. Therefore, the <b>accreted</b> mass <b>landing</b> on the NR can be weighedprecisely by measuring the frequency shifts because of mass changes of the NR in thesignal absorption spectrum. Similar mass sensing scheme has been proposed recently in ahybrid nanocrystal coupled to an NR by our group [20], {{which is based on}} a theoretical model. However, recent experimentalachievements in the coupled CPB-NR system [18, 19] make it possible for our proposed mass sensing scheme here to be realized infuture.|$|R
