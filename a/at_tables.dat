The equipment delivered included eight 18-roomette sleeping cars; two sleeper-bar-lounges; four 4-compartment, 2-drawing room, 4-double bedroom sleeping cars; two 13-double bedroom sleeping cars; and two View series sleeper-buffet-lounge-observation cars. The dining car seated 24 <b>at</b> <b>tables</b> (in both 1x1 and 2x2 configurations) and featured a small bar at one end with seating for two. The sleeper-bar-lounge included a secretary's room, barber shop, shower-bath, and a bar/lounge with both booth and chair seating.|$|E
5|$|Honorees are {{inducted}} {{for work}} in any area of wrestling, including competing in the ring, managing, refereeing, promoting, and announcing. During the ceremony, personalities from the NWA deliver speeches and present the inductees with plaques. These plaques have the logo of the NWA Legends Fanfest and are identical aside from the year of induction and the inductee's name. Many presenters {{have been involved in}} the inductee's career; for example, Gary Hart, who managed Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson, inducted both men, and Buddy Roberts was inducted by Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin, both of whom were fellow members of The Fabulous Freebirds. Inductees and other former NWA wrestlers are seated <b>at</b> <b>tables</b> with fans to provide an intimate atmosphere. Although most people honored by the hall attend the dinner and induction ceremony, some are inducted posthumously and others are unable to attend for medical reasons.|$|E
25|$|The green room, {{where the}} artists rested after their performances, was altered from {{previous}} contests.

25|$|Students usually sit <b>at</b> <b>tables,</b> not desks (usually two at one table), {{sometimes}} {{arranged in}} a semicircle or another geometric or functional shape.

25|$|Cabaret is {{a typical}} form of French musical {{entertainment}} featuring chanson, music, dance, comedy and spectacles. The audience usually sits <b>at</b> <b>tables,</b> often dining or drinking, and performances are sometimes introduced by a master of ceremonies. The first cabaret was opened in 1881 in Montmartre, Paris, by Rodolphe Salis and was called Le Chat Noir (The Black Cat). Built in 1889, Moulin Rouge is famous for the large red windmill on its roof. Other popular French cabarets include the Folies Bergère and Le Lido. Cabarets were a key venue in the careers of many singers such as Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Charles Trenet and Edith Piaf. More recently, Patricia Kaas embodies {{the revival of the}} French cabaret style.|$|E

James was granted a match for the Women's Championship at , after winning a triple threat match on the December 4 episode of SmackDown, with James defiantly refusing to leave the SmackDown brand despite continued harassment from LayCool. <b>At</b> <b>Tables,</b> Ladders & Chairs, Layla interfered in the match to help McCool retain the championship. Despite the win, LayCool continued to torment James {{as they tried to}} make her leave, buying her a Jenny Craig gift certificate for the Christmas Day episode of SmackDown, but gained some revenge by pinning Layla in a tag team match in the same episode.|$|E
25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill was {{purchased}} on June 16, 1970, at a tax sale by the Stuart Davidson and John Laytham, co-owners {{of the restaurant}} Clyde's of Georgetown. Clyde's was founded in 1963 by Davidson (then an investment banker) after new legislation made it legal to consume liquor to patrons standing at bars. (Since 1917, liquor could be consumed only while sitting <b>at</b> <b>tables.)</b> Davidson and Laytham bid in the tax sale hoping to buy beer steins and the mahogany bar, but {{ended up with the}} entire restaurant. The IRS offered the entire restaurant for sale after an auction of individual items failed to raise more than $6,639. The sale price was $11,250. Among the items they purchased were a 200-year-old clock (which used carved wooden gears for its mechanism), a carved wooden grizzly bear once owned by Alexander Hamilton, crystal decanters dating to 1575, and stuffed boar's head, swordfish, alligator, and walrus head.|$|E
5000|$|In a teams tournament, {{two pairs}} {{normally}} constitute a team. (Teams {{of five or}} six members are often permitted, but each set of boards will only be played by two pairs in the team, i.e. four members of the team.) If there are just two teams, they compete using two tables and having one pair from each team seated <b>at</b> each <b>table,</b> in opposite directions. (For example, Team A may sit North-South <b>at</b> <b>table</b> 1 and East-West <b>at</b> <b>table</b> 2; then Team B would sit East-West <b>at</b> <b>table</b> 1 and North-South <b>at</b> <b>table</b> 2.) Similar arrangements apply if there are more than two teams in the competition. Depending on the number of teams competing and the structure of the tournament, a relatively larger number of boards may be played in each round of the movement (usually six to eight for [...] "Swiss teams", usually 12, 24, or more for knockout events). The boards are moved (sometimes by a caddy) so that they are all eventually played <b>at</b> both <b>tables</b> (or more if there are four teams or more).|$|R

25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 <b>at</b> <b>tables</b> and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the main bar and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Digging Your Scene" [...] {{was released in}} 1986.

The video was featured and debuted at the first International Music & Media Conference that took place in Montreux, Switzerland between 7-10 May 1986. It also received heavy rotation on MTV's lineup of music videos in mid 1986.|$|E
500|$|Cynicism {{came to be}} seen as an {{idealised}} form of Stoicism, a view {{which led}} Epictetus to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse. [...] According to Epictetus, the ideal Cynic [...] "must know that he is sent as a messenger from Zeus to people concerning good and bad things, to show them that they have wandered." [...] Unfortunately for Epictetus, many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal: [...] "consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait <b>at</b> <b>tables,</b> and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breaking wind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Altered payout for {{a winning}} {{blackjack}}: In many casinos, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 {{instead of the}} usual 3:2. This is most common <b>at</b> <b>tables</b> with lower table minimums. Although this payoff was originally limited to single-deck games, it has spread to double-deck and shoe games. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay 1:1 payout for a blackjack.|$|E
2500|$|A Cabaret Guide {{issued in}} 1956 {{described}} The Tropicana as:"the {{largest and most}} beautiful night club in the world. Located on {{what was once a}} 36,000-square-meter estate, Tropicana has ample room for two complete sets of stages, table areas and dance floors, in addition to well-tended grounds extending beyond the night club proper. Tall trees rising over the tables and through the roof in some spots lend the proper tropical atmosphere which blends well with the ultra-modern architecture of the night club. Shows include a chorus line of 50 and the dancers often perform on catwalks among the trees. Rhythms and costumes are colorfully native, with voodooism a frequent theme. Top talent is imported from abroad. Minimum <b>at</b> <b>tables</b> is $4.50 per person, but this can be avoided by sitting at central bar which has a good view of both stages." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 South African artist Jonty Hurwitz {{created a}} chrome and resin {{anamorphic}} sculpture of Kaspar, the hotel's cat mascot, titled [...] "The 14th Guest", {{found at the}} entrance to the hotel's newest restaurant, Kaspar's Seafood Bar & Grill. Kaspar's story begins with the legend of an 1898 dinner at the Savoy given for 14 guests by Woolf Joel, a South African diamond tycoon. One of the diners was unable to attend, leaving the number of guests an unlucky 13, and another diner predicted that whoever first left the table would soon die. The first to leave was Joel, who was shot dead a few weeks later in Johannesburg. After this, the hotel offered to seat a member of its staff <b>at</b> <b>tables</b> of 13 to ward off bad luck. Finally, in 1926, the designer Basil Ionides sculpted a 3-foot high art-deco black cat called Kaspar, which is used as the 14th guest. Kaspar is given a full place setting, a napkin is tied around his neck, and he is served each course. Winston Churchill liked Ionides's Kaspar so much that he insisted that the sculpture join his parties of any size when dining at the Savoy.|$|E
