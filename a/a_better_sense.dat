Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> of smell.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes {{the use of a}} variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

30|$|Considering both optical sensors, {{the table}} model {{presents}} <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sensing</b> capability than the portable sensor namely, the signal from D[*]+[*] 10 %K liquid plateaus {{for both the}} smooth and rough glass slides of the PS after a few minutes. One would, therefore, assume a constant variation in the liquid behavior. However, for the same liquid, the TM senses the variation in the liquid spreading making it a more sensitive optical sensor. Additionally, in Fig. 4 a, the PS signal from kerosene also plateaus {{after the first few}} minutes on the smooth glass. On the reverse, the TM signal from the relatively smooth metal surface, Ra[*]=[*] 0.05  μm, suggests detectable variations in the liquid drop spreading. Despite the different resolution of the TM and PS sensors, the irregularity of the D[*]+[*] 10 %K is apparent with distinct features in the signal from both devices.|$|R

The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eye pieces, which were easier to remove.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{youth of}} this field {{means there is}} still much progress to be made in characterizing all modifications to the transcriptome and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Once these questions are answered and biologists have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> of the amount of variation in RNA modification, the focus will turn to each modification’s biological function. This has already been investigated in a select few proteins such as adenosine deaminase, which acts on RNA (ADAR). ADAR has been shown to affect antibody production and the innate immune system as well as transcripts encoding important receptors for the central nervous system. This plurality in function has caused some scientists to speculate that the epitransciptome may be even more expansive than the better defined epigenome.|$|E

40|$|Mutual {{information}} and its causal variant, directed information, {{have been widely}} used to quantitatively characterize the performance of biological sensing and information transduction. However, once coupled with selection in response to decision-making, the sensing signal could have more or less evolutionary value than its mutual or directed information. In this work, we show that an individually sensed signal always has <b>a</b> <b>better</b> fitness value, on average, than its mutual or directed information. The fitness gain, which satisfies fluctuation relations (FRs), is attributed to the selection of organisms in a population that obtain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sensing</b> signal by chance. A new quantity, similar to the coarse-grained entropy production in information thermodynamics, is introduced to quantify the total fitness gain from individual sensing, which also satisfies FRs. Using this quantity, the optimizing fitness gain from individual sensing is shown to be related to fidelity allocations for individual environmental histories. Our results are supplemented by numerical verifications of FRs, and a discussion on how this problem is linked to information encoding and decoding. Comment: 5 figure...|$|R
25|$|The 2000s saw {{the growth}} of digital {{distribution}} {{and the arrival of}} smart phones and tablet computers, with touch-screen interfaces well-suited to point-and-click adventure games. The introduction of larger and more powerful touch screen devices like the iPad allowed for more detailed graphics, more precise controls, and <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> of immersion and interactivity compared to personal computer or console versions. In gaming hardware, the handheld Nintendo DS and subsequent units included a touch-screen, and the Nintendo Wii console with its Wii Remote allowed players to control a cursor through motion control. These new platforms helped decrease the cost of bringing an adventure game to market, providing an avenue to re-release older, less graphically advanced games The Secret of Monkey Island, King's Quest and Space Quest and attracting a new audience to adventure games.|$|E
25|$|A {{black bear}} has better {{eyesight}} and <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> of hearing compared to humans. Their keenest sense {{is the sense}} of smell, which is about seven times greater than a dog's. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies, and hibernate. Half of bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. Black bears may be active at any time of the day or night although they mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal, and bears living near brown bears tend to be more extensively diurnal. Their social behavior is somewhat similar to that of canids.|$|E

30|$|It is {{suggested}} that the excellent sensing properties of Py-rGO-based sensors are governed by the intrinsic properties of rGO as well as adsorbed PPy molecules. On one hand, rGO sheets still have parts of oxygen-based moieties and structure defects after chemical reduction process, which can generally lead to the p-type semiconducting behavior of the resultant rGO[29]. NH 3, as a reducing agent, has a lone electron pair {{that can be easily}} donated to the p-type rGO sheets, leading to the increase of the resistance of the rGO devices. Since the rGO-based sensing devices studied in our work are fabricated by self-assembly technique, NH 3 gas can interact with rGO sheets completely and result in excellent sensing performance of the devices during the testing process. On the other hand, PPy molecules, as conducting polymers, can be generally considered as excellent NH 3 gas sensing materials. Hence, the PPy molecules, which are attached on the surfaces of rGO sheets, play important roles in the enhancement of the sensing performance of the rGO devices and consequently show <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sensing</b> performance than that of Hy-rGO devices.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) mechanisms in three-hop cognitive wireless relay networks (CWRNs). The data transmission from a source to a destination is realised {{with the aid of}} two layers of cognitive radio (CR) users which are in the transmission coverage of two primary users. In this paper, we first propose a new CSS scheme for a layer of CR users to improve the spectrum sensing performance by exploiting both local decisions at the CR users and global decisions at the fusion centre. Particularly, we derive the probabilities of missed detection and false alarm for a practical scenario where all sensing, reporting, and backward channels suffer from Rayleigh fading. The derived expressions not only show that our proposed CSS achieves <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sensing</b> performance than the conventional scheme but also characterise the effects of the fading channels on the sensing reliability. Furthermore, we propose a CSS scheme for two CR layers in a three-hop CWRN using binary XOR operator to help reduce one phase of sensing for a higher system throughput...|$|R

500|$|Overall, the MediEvil {{series has}} {{received}} positive to mixed reviews from critics. MediEvil and MediEvil 2 were mostly praised upon release, with the atmosphere, visuals and music of both games being the prominently commended aspects. Chris Roper of IGN praised the game's sense of humour and unique presentation, but was sceptical concerning the game's [...] "sloppy" [...] controls, [...] "disjointed" [...] level designs {{and noted that}} the game's graphics did not age well over time, {{in comparison to the}} graphically superior PSP remake. Joe Fielder of GameSpot credited the first MediEvil for its original look and number of unique puzzles, but criticised the camera work.

500|$|For the game's artistic style, {{the team}} drew {{on a variety}} of influences: the work of film {{directors}} David Cronenberg, David Fincher, David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock, along with films similar to the 1990 psychological thriller/horror film Jacob's Ladder, and painters such as Francis Bacon, Rembrandt and Andrew Wyeth. Early in the project, they studied the 1996 video game Tomb Raiders creation of 3D environments. Other influences on the game included the 1992 survival horror video game Alone in the Dark, the first Silent Hill game, and the Japanese comic Whirr by Morohashi. While working on the character designs, Sato and his team sketched human faces and various expressions. To gain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> of the characters' facial structures, they drew the characters' profiles from various angles, before creating wire-frame models, each consisting of six thousand polygons; they then completed the model with textures. Data for the character animation was taken through motion capture, and using Softimage, they animated the characters. Masahiro Ito designed the monsters in Silent Hill 2; [...] "soured flesh" [...] was the concept behind their appearance. The monsters were also to incorporate [...] "an element of humanity". For the most part, the monsters reflect the protagonist's subconscious. For example, the monster Pyramid Head was based on the executioners of the town's fictional history and is intended to be a punisher for James. Two exceptions to this theme are the [...] "Abstract Daddy", a reflection of Angela's subconscious and memories, and the [...] "Creepers", which are also seen in the first game.|$|E
