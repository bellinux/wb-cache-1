5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in China, MacMurray fell into disagreement with Washington over U.S. policy towards the ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist) government, which had been demanding immediate revisions to or a cessation of the treaty system in place between the two countries. Whereas Washington wished to make concessions to the Nationalist government, MacMurray favored the enforcement of existing treaties. These differences of opinion led him to resign in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> University.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Leak Warren {{was born}} in Maxwell, New Mexico on June 19, 1896. He {{attended}} the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. He married Viola Lockhart on May 22, 1920. Their marriage produced two sons and a daughter. He went to medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, graduating with his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1922. He then did post-doctoral work <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> School of Medicine and Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{interest}} in quantum mechanics <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins,</b> but Goeppert Mayer worked with Karl Herzfeld, collaborating {{on a number of}} papers. She also returned to Göttingen in the summers of 1931, 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born, writing an article with him for the Handbuch der Physik. This ended when the NSDAP came to power in 1933, and many academics, including Born and Franck, lost their jobs. Goeppert Mayer and Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the strong}} win, bitter {{feelings}} <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> {{continued to grow}} into the next season. The school's attitude towards the series worsened {{to the point where}} the 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to terminate the series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Said joined Columbia University, as {{a member}} of the English and Comparative Literature faculties, where he taught and worked until 2003.

5|$|Lacks {{was treated}} with radium tube inserts as an {{inpatient}} and discharged {{a few days later}} with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks's cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins.</b> The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, a commonly used cell line in contemporary biomedical research.|$|E
5|$|The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made Wheeler an {{associate}} professor in 1937, but he wanted to be able work more closely with the experts in particle physics. He turned down an offer in 1938 of {{an associate}} professorship <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> University in favor of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. Although it was a lesser position, he felt that Princeton, which was building up its physics department, was a better career choice. He remained a member of the faculty there until 1976.|$|E
