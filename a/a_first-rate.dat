5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It {{would be foolish to}} claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|Dystopia has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, and holds a Metacritic rating of 69/100. Commending the band's {{return to a}} more aggressive style, Calum Slingerland of Exclaim! wrote that Dystopia put the band back on track and started {{a new chapter in}} the band's storied career. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe liked the combination of energetic riffs and cynical lyrics {{about the state of the}} world. Loudwires Chad Bowar said Dystopia was <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> Megadeth album and praised the interplay between Mustaine and Loureiro.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1913 he {{was posted}} to No. 3 Squadron RFC. He managed a flight in a Blériot {{aircraft}} while there and gradually won {{a reputation as}} <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> mechanic. By Christmas his frequent requests for trips in the aircraft had met with so much success that McCudden had logged nearly 30 hours, mostly in the Blériot monoplanes.

5|$|In 1848, {{at the age}} of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was {{admitted}} to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.|$|E
5|$|The third British ship {{into action}} was HMS Orion under Captain Sir James Saumarez, which rounded the {{engagement}} {{at the head}} of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore. As he did so, the frigate Sérieuse opened fire on Orion, wounding two men. The convention in naval warfare of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain Claude-Jean Martin had negated the rule. Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying. Orion needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin's disabled ship drifted away over the shoal. During the delay this detour caused, two other British ships joined the battle: Theseus, which had been disguised as <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> ship, followed Foley's track across Guerriers bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship, Spartiate. Anchoring to port, Miller's ship opened fire at close range. HMS Audacious under Captain Davidge Gould crossed the French line between Guerrier and Conquérant, anchoring between the ships and raking them both. Orion then rejoined the action further south than intended, firing on the fifth French ship, Peuple Souverain, and Admiral Blanquet's flagship, Franklin.|$|E

25|$|Selected for Ireland's inaugural One Day International against England at Stormont {{despite a}} series of low scores in the {{preceding}} C Trophy matches, Botha vindicated the selectors' judgement by top-scoring with 52 against <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> attack including Steve Harmison, Liam Plunkett and Sajid Mahmood. Since then, Botha has evinced a marked aptitude for One Day Internationals, averaging 39.66 in three ODIs to date, with a top score of 56 achieved against the Netherlands during Ireland's victorious 2006 European Cricket Championship campaign.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the work was helped by <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> cast and the luxury of the spectacle. Among the star singers were Madame Branchu, Henri-Étienne Dérivis and Louis Nourrit.

Arthur Pougin calculated that the whole production cost 150,000 francs, including 90,000 francs on costumes, a considerable sum for the day. Jean-Baptiste Rey was due to conduct but he died in July. His replacement was Persuis.|$|E

His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the Stuart rising, resolved that he should receive <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> education, and sent him first to the parish school {{and then to the}} Montrose Academy, where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half.

Considered semi-barbarous by some metropolitan Greeks, the Macedonians were a martial people; they drank deeply of unwatered wine (the very mark of a barbarian) and no youth was considered to be fit to sit with the men at table until he had killed, on foot with a spear, a wild boar.|$|E

25|$|Austria was {{not able}} to retake Silesia or realize any other {{territorial}} gains. However, it did preserve Saxony from Prussian control, slowing the growth of its new northern rival. Its military performed far more respectably than during the War of the Austrian Succession, which seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms since that war. Thus, the war in great part restored Austria's prestige and preserved its position as {{a major player in the}} European system. Also, by promising to vote for Archduke Joseph in the Imperial election, Frederick accepted the continuation of Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire. Prussia's confirmation as <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> power and the enhanced prestige of its king and army, however, were long-term threats to Austria's hegemony in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{submerged}} hull {{was split}} into forty watertight compartments. Four housed the steam engines, placed forward, the boilers, electrical systems and store room. The rest were allocated to coal storage. A belt of forty smaller compartments {{wrapped around the}} hull, forming a rigid structural frame. Popov sent the drawings to the Dutch naval architect Bruno Tideman, who ran {{a series of tests}} of a paraffin wax model in a ship model basin and concluded that the design was feasible. According to Tideman, the ship could reach 14 knots with 8,500 indicated horsepowers, below Popov's earlier estimate of at least 10 thousand horsepower (the first Livadia could make 13 knots on mere 460 horsepower). Tideman insisted that the contract must be awarded to <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> firm and that the plans be approved by him.|$|E
25|$|William Henry Scotton (15 January 1856 in Nottingham, England – 9 July 1893 in St John's Wood, London, England) was a cricketer {{who played}} for Nottinghamshire and England. Scotton played his first match at Lord's for Sixteen Colts of England against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 11 and 12 May 1874, scoring on that {{occasion}} 19 and 0. He was engaged as a groundman by the MCC in that year and in 1875, and after an engagement at Kennington Oval returned {{to the service of}} the MCC, of whose ground staff he was a member {{at the time of his}} death. His powers were rather slow to ripen, and he had been playing for several years before he obtained anything like <b>a</b> <b>first-rate</b> position. At one period of his career, however, and more particularly during the seasons of 1884 and 1886, he was beyond all question the best professional left-handed batsman in England.|$|E
