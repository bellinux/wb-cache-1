5|$|During his patrol, Spider-Man stops a {{group of}} thieves who <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> into a bakery. Simultaneously, Spider-Man takes {{pictures}} {{to give to the}} Daily Bugle. He happily leaves and returns home before his curfew. However, upon reviewing the photos, he discovers they are unfortunately unusable. Meanwhile, Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with an experimental serum, in an attempt to regrow his missing arm, before going to bed. Later, he awakens to discover his arm has indeed regrown. His wife, Martha, is furious that he experimented on himself without her knowledge, but softens upon seeing their son's reaction.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E

Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.|$|E

25|$|Palos (formerly {{known as}} cantes) are flamenco styles, {{classified}} by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, mode, chord progression, stanzaic form and geographic origin. There are over 50 different palos, some are sung unaccompanied {{while others have}} guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> down: the Farruca, for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other little tactics used {{in the game of}} hockey. Cycling moves the puck along the boards in the {{offensive}} zone to create a scoring chance by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. Pinching is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A saucer pass is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> down. Barristers once enjoyed {{a monopoly on}} appearances before the higher courts, but in Great Britain this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, {{are not prepared to}} provide general advice to members of the public.|$|E

500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the published screenplay, Dear {{said he was in}} part attracted to adapt Persuasion because it depicted a [...] "world in transition". To him, the novel showed [...] "an old order fading away into decadence, and a new tribe, a meritocracy, coming to the fore". While directing, Roger Michell felt that the story included [...] "the prototype of the postmodern family"—Anne's mother is dead, her father is bankrupt, and [...] "the old social orders <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> down". Root described Anne as a [...] "feminist in a prefeminist period" [...] and a [...] "strong, independent character", to whom modern viewers can relate despite the story's period setting.|$|E

After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck. [...] To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies. The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room {{in the beginning of the}} game.|$|E
500|$|Irving Louis Horowitz, in his The Decomposition of Sociology (1994), {{has argued}} that the discipline, while {{arriving}} from a [...] "distinguished lineage and tradition", is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: [...] "The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs." [...] Furthermore: [...] "A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential." [...] Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. Randall Collins, the Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania {{and a member of the}} Advisory Editors Council of the Social Evolution & History journal, has voiced similar sentiments: [...] "we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we <b>are</b> <b>breaking</b> up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other." ...|$|E

Uber's official response indicated that the company would continue to offer the service, despite the €100,000 fine and the €40,000 fine for drivers who are apprehended.|$|E

The two fight their way through an army of half-demons and exorcise a possessed Angela. However, Chas is killed by the invisible entity, which turns out to be Gabriel. Resenting God’s favoritism towards humans, Gabriel plans to unleash Hell on Earth to weed out those deemed [...] "unworthy" [...] of God’s love. Gabriel casts Constantine from the room and prepares to use the Spear to cut Mammon free from Angela.|$|E
