40|$|The {{construction}} of mirror symmetry in the heterotic string is reviewed {{in the context}} of Calabi– Yau and Landau–Ginzburg compactifications. This framework has the virtue of providing a large subspace of the configuration space of the heterotic string, probing its structure far beyond the present reaches of solvable models. The construction proceeds in two stages: First all singularities/catastrophes which lead to ground states of the heterotic string are found. It is then shown that not all ground states described in this way are independent but that certain classes of these Landau–Ginzburg/Calabi–Yau string vacua can be related to other, simpler, theories via a process involving fractional transformations of the order parameters as well as orbifolding. This construction has far reaching consequences. Firstly it allows for a systematic identification of mirror pairs that <b>appear</b> <b>abundantly</b> in this class of string vacua, thereby showing that the emerging mirror symmetry is not accidental. This is important because models with mirror flipped spectra are a priori independent theories, described by distinct Calabi–Yau/Landau–Ginzburg models. It also shows that mirror symmetry is not restricted to the space of string vacua described by theories based on Fermat potentials (corresponding to minimal tensor models). Furthermore it shows the need for a better set of coordinates of the configuration space or else the structure of this space will remain obscure. While the space of Landau–Ginzburg vacua is not completely mirror symmetric, results described in the last part suggest that the space of Landau–Ginburg orbifolds possesses this symmetry.

40|$|While {{having a}} close look at the concept of stopwords, the {{researchers}} examined 30 chemistry scientific articles published in high ranking Persian journals to find an answer to the following research questions: (1) Should all punctuation marks, numbers, and English letter combinations (letter-number and letter-punctuationnumber combinations) be included in the stoplist and thus be eliminated as candidates for indexing? (2) Is it correct to change all upper case letters into lower case letters, i. e., to downcase letters? And (3) Could Persian be dealt with in automatic indexing without making reference to the characteristics of English? The manual analysis of the sample revealed that the omission of all punctuation marks, numbers, etc. will have a negative effect on recall, since punctuation marks, particularly ‘dot ’ and ‘hyphen ’ appear in the structure of content-bearing elements and even <b>appear</b> <b>abundantly</b> in titles and abstracts of scientific articles. With regard to downcasing, or unifying all upper and lower case letters, the conclusion was that it is much more restricted in Persian compared to English and that some possible places where it may cause problems are the structure of formulas, names of chemical substances, acronyms and proper nouns. Finally, it was found that because of the appearance of English letters, words, numbers, etc. in the body of Persian articles, some characteristics of the English language must also be considered while working on automatic indexing of Persian articles. The overall conclusion was that some sort of compromise is required in labeling numbers, punctuation, acronyms, etc. as either stopwords or content-bearing elements and thus as potential index candidates...|$|E

The healing response in a scenario of CD 36 agonistic stimulation had not been previously investigated. Excisional full-thickness wounds (6 [*]mmØ) were created in the dorsum of Wistar rats and topically treated twice a day for 5 days. The universal model of rabbit’s ears hypertrophic scars was implemented and the animals were treated daily for 30 days. Treatments for both species were based on a CMC jelly composition containing GHRP- 6 400 [*]μg/mL. Wounds response characterization included closure dynamic, RT-PCR transcriptional profile, histology, and histomorphometric procedures. The rats experiment indicated that GHRP- 6 pharmacodynamics involves attenuation of immunoinflammatory mediators, their effector cells, and the reduction of the expression of fibrotic cytokines. Importantly, in the hypertrophic scars rabbit’s model, GHRP- 6 intervention dramatically reduced the onset of exuberant scars by activating PPARγ and reducing the expression of fibrogenic cytokines.

Fibrosis is an accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) synthesized by cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts are the most prevalent cell type in the heart, comprising 75 % of cardiac cells. Myofibroblasts are hardly present in healthy normal heart tissue, but <b>appear</b> <b>abundantly</b> in diseased hearts. Cardiac fibroblasts are activated {{by a variety of}} pathological stimuli, such as myocardial injury, oxidative stress, mechanical stretch, and elevated autocrine-paracrine mediators, thereby undergoing proliferation, differentiation to myofibroblasts, and production of various cytokines and ECM proteins. A number of signaling pathways and bioactive molecules are involved and work in concert to activate fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the fibrogenesis cascade. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are not only principal ECM producers, but also {{play a central role in}} fibrogenesis and myocardial remodeling in fibrotic heart disease. Thus, understanding the biological processes of cardiac fibroblasts will provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of fibrosis and provide potential targets for developing anti-fibrotic drugs. Recent studies demonstrate that Ca 2 + signal is essential for fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, and ECM-protein production. This review focuses on the recent advances in understanding molecular mechanisms of Ca 2 + signaling in cardiac fibrogenesis, and potential role of Ca 2 +-permeable channels, in particular, the transient potential (TRP) channels in fibrotic heart disease. TRP channels are highly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts. TRPM 7 has been shown to be essential in TGFβ 1 mediated fibrogenesis, and TRPC 3 has been demonstrated to play an essential role in regulating fibroblast function. Thus, the Ca 2 +-permeable TRP channels may serve as potential novel targets for developing anti-fibrotic drugs...|$|E

40|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} active role in {{maintaining}} skeletal muscle homeostasis. Its deregulation is involved in several skeletal muscle disorders such as dystrophies, myopathies, disuse and sarcopenia. The aim of this work was to study in vitro the apoptotic behavior induced by etoposide, staurosporine and hydrogen peroxide in the C 2 C 12 skeletal muscle cell line, comparing myoblast vs myotube sensitivity, investigated by means of morphological and cytofluorimetric analyses. Myotubes appeared more resistant than myoblasts to apoptotic induction. In myoblasts treated with etoposide, nuclei with chromatin condensation were observed, {{in the presence of a}} diffuse DNA fragmentation, as shown by confocal microscopy. The latter also appeared in myotubes, where apoptotic and normal nuclei coexisted inside the same syncytium. After staurosporine treatment, myobalsts evidenced late apoptotic features and a high number of TUNEL-positive nuclei. Secondary necrosis appeared in myotubes, where myonuclei with cleaved DNA again coexisted with normal myonuclei. After H 2 O 2 exposure, myotubes, differently from myoblasts, showed a poor sensitivity to cell death. Intriguingly, autophagic granules <b>appeared</b> <b>abundantly</b> in myotubes after each treatment. In myotubes, mitochondria were better preserved than in myoblasts since those which were damaged were probably degraded through autophagic processes. These findings demonstrate a scarce sensitivity of myotubes to apoptotic stimuli due to acquisition of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype during differentiation. The presence of nuclear-dependent "territorial" death domains in the syncytium could explain a slower death of myotubes compared to mononucleated cells. In addition, autophagy could preserve and protect muscle cell integrity against chemical stimuli, making C 2 C 12 cells, in particular myotubes, more resistant to apoptosis induction...|$|R

Using selective markers, we also evaluated the distribution of peptidergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic fibers. Facial skin <b>appeared</b> <b>abundantly</b> innervated and rich in annexes.

Finally, in perioral skin samples, we observed striated muscle fibers with their motor nerves and motor endplates. Our work provides the first morphological study of human facial cutaneous innervation, highlighting some unique features of this territory.
