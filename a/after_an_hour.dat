5|$|Captain Warburton-Lee {{was brought}} ashore but died <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{from his head}} wounds. 139 other men managed to get ashore, {{although}} 26 were seriously wounded. Captain Warburton-Lee was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Hardy was lifted off the beach at high tide and drifted {{to the head of}} Skjomen fjord where she capsized in shallow waters. The wreck was still visible as late as 1963.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 27 October Thomas {{attended}} his 39th birthday party but felt unwell {{and returned to his}} hotel <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> The next day he took part in Poetry and the Film, a recorded symposium at Cinema 16, with panellists Amos Vogel, Arthur Miller, Maya Deren, Parker Tyler, and Willard Maas.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> on the ground, the {{helicopters}} {{left with the}} first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets {{on one of the}} flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
50|$|Douglas ordered action stations, and the Chatham hove to and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> few <b>hours</b> chase {{opened the}} action; she overtook the French frigate. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour's</b> action, the Chatham {{got the better}} of the French and Magicienne soon struck.|$|R

5|$|His {{body was}} cut down <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings {{according to his}} rights. The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{and a half}} {{had gone}} (and twenty minutes had passed since the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan next turned Virginia on Congress. Seeing {{what had}} {{happened}} to Cumberland, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of Congress, ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on Congress. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of unequal combat, the badly damaged Congress surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered Congress fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. Congress caught fire and burned {{throughout the rest of the}} day. Near midnight, the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.|$|E

5|$|During the summer, he had trials {{with fellow}} Conference side Gateshead, scoring a penalty in a {{friendly}} against Carlisle United on 16 July 2011, before the game was abandoned <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> due to torrential rain. Two weeks later, Nix signed an initial six-month contract with Gateshead. He made his debut as a second-half substitute on 13 August 2011 in Gateshead's 3–2 win over Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough. He made his first start for Gateshead on 22 October 2011 in a 3–1 win against Telford United at New Bucks Head. Having started only two games in five months with Gateshead, Nix is due to be released when his contracts expire on 24 January.|$|E
5|$|Nebiu Demeke {{was arrested}} and charged with air piracy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. He was arraigned on February 12, 1993; Judge Allyne Ross ordered him held without bail until his trial. Demeke {{remained}} convinced that he would not spend any time in prison and that he would be granted asylum. During the course of his trial, he was twice found to be incompetent to stand trial and was prescribed medication for depression and hallucinations. He represented himself during the course of his four-day trial. He was found guilty in a jury trial <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of deliberation, and Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. sentenced him to prison until 2013.|$|E
5|$|Portias' venom {{is unusually}} {{powerful}} against spiders. When a Portia stabs a small to medium spider (up to the Portia′s weight), including another Portia, the prey usually runs away for about 100 to 200millimetres, enters convulsions, becomes paralysed after 10 to 30seconds, and continues convulsing for 10seconds to 4minutes. Portia slowly approaches the prey and takes it. Portia usually needs to inflict up to 15stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider(1.5 to 2times to the Portia′s weight), and then Portia may wait about 20 to 200millimetres away for 15 to 30minutes from seizing the prey. Insects {{are usually not}} immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle, sometimes for several minutes. If Portia cannot make further contact, all types of prey usually recover, making sluggish movements several minutes after the stabbing but often starting normal movement only <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|Walsh missed {{two weeks}} of the 1991–92 {{pre-season}} with a groin injury, and on his first game back for the reserves at White Hart Lane punched reserve team manager Ray Clemence in the face after Clemence substituted him off <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Walsh was suspended for two weeks and upon his return was loaned out to Queens Park Rangers for a month. QPR manager Gerry Francis wanted to make the signing a permanent one, but the club were unable to afford the £800,000 fee Spurs had asked for. After returning to Spurs he again punched someone in the face, this time a supporter who had shouted abuse to Walsh on the pitch after a game against Norwich City. He ended the campaign with three goals in 22 starts and 15 substitute appearances.|$|E
5|$|As Ethalion subdued Thetis the {{remainder}} of the British squadron continued southwards in pursuit of Santa Brigida. Pillon was an experienced officer with a good knowledge of the Northern Spanish coast and he intended to lose his pursuers in the rocky channels of Cape Finisterre. Early on 17 October he reached Spanish coastal waters, rounding Finisterre just beyond the Monte Lora rocks. Captain Gore on Triton, which was in full flow at seven knots, was unaware of the obstacle and at 05:00 crashed into them, coming to a juddering halt and inflicting severe damage to his ship's hull. Gore was able however to bring Triton off soon afterwards and continued pursuit, assisted by Digby on Alcmene who was able to block Pillon's route into Porte de Vidre. Both frigates opened fire on Santa Brigida at 07:00 as the Spanish ship sought shelter in the rocks at Commarurto close to the safe harbour at Muros, Pillon's movement hampered by the coastal rias that blocked the wind. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of resistance, with Naiad belatedly approaching, Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces. Santa Brigida had lost two men killed and eight wounded, Alcmene one killed and nine wounded and Triton a single man wounded.|$|E

5|$|Aware {{that his}} ship was {{suffering}} {{the worst of}} the casualties, L'Héritier ordered his men to attempt to board the British ship of the line, but first one and then another attempt to do so was driven back with heavy casualties. The lighting of Hercule had gone out {{at the beginning of the}} engagement, leaving her crew confused, and as a result, only around 40 men answered when L'Héritier ordered the boarding; he was himself injured twice, to the head by a sabre and to the thigh by a pike, while leading the assault. At 10:30, <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of continual bombardment L'Héritier surrendered: Hercules hull had been torn open, five guns were dismounted with others damaged and more than two fifths of the crew killed or wounded. Jason was approaching fast and the rest of Bridport's fleet was close enough to see the muzzle flashes from the battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Alceste {{entered the}} Adriatic and on 4–5 May, she and Belle Poule {{participated in a}} raid at Parenza, (Istria). Having chased a brig into the harbour, but unable to follow due to the rocks and shallow water, the two frigates stood outside and opened fire on her and the battery {{protecting}} her. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> the brig was forced to move nearer the shore, out of range. At 23:00, the British landed 200 seamen and all their marines on an island nearby, and also landed two 9-pounders and two howitzers that they placed in one battery, and a field piece that they placed further away. From there, {{they were able to}} engage the French in Parenza in a five-hour mutual bombardment. The brig was eventually destroyed and the men and cannons returned to their ships. Belle Poule had one man killed and three wounded, and Alceste had two men killed during the action. All casualties occurred ashore.|$|E
5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain {{planned to}} stay there for at least 20 days to {{complete}} the most urgent repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus. There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of target practice. The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 5 May 1794 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the Indian Ocean during the French Revolutionary Wars. A British squadron had been blockading the French island of Isle de France (now Mauritius) since early in the year, and early on 5 May discovered two ships approaching their position. As the strange vessels came closer, they were recognised as the French frigate Duguay Trouin, which had been captured from the East India Company the year before, and a small brig. Making use of a favourable wind, the British squadron gave chase to the new arrivals, which fled. The chase was short, as Duguay Trouin was a poor sailor {{with many of the}} crew sick and unable to report for duty. The British frigate HMS Orpheus was the first to arrive, and soon completely disabled the French frigate, successfully raking the wallowing ship. <b>After</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and twenty minutes the French captain surrendered, Captain Henry Newcome of Orpheus taking over the captured ship and bringing his prize back to port in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an {{introduction}} and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the green flash, the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night {{with a focus on}} bats, nighthawks, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street lights, and the impacts of light pollution. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology of sleep and dreams.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; they asked for it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and <b>after</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E
