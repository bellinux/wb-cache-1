This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|They {{climb up}} and {{eventually}} reach a small abandoned house. While there, {{the man is}} attacked by a big cat, which the woman strikes away with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards {{the top of the}} mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E

25|$|In December 1821, Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer {{looking for}} seal {{breeding}} grounds, sighted {{what is now}} known as the Antarctic Peninsula, located between 55 and 80 degrees west. In 1823, James Weddell, a British sealer, sailed into what {{is now known as}} the Weddell Sea. Until, the twentieth century, most expeditions were for commercial purpose, to look for the prospects of seal and whale hunting. <b>A</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> from the South Shetland Islands, was the first fossil ever recorded from Antarctica, obtained during a private United States expedition during 1829-31, commanded by Captain Benjamin Pendleton.|$|E

During the course of the battle, the ships fought from the west end of the strait all the way across to the east end, almost to the open water. The Japanese sustained heavy damage and began to retreat along the south coast of Namhae Island, towards Pusan.|$|E

25|$|Tree weta (Hemideina) {{are those}} most {{commonly}} encountered in suburban settings in the North Island. They {{are up to}} 40mm long and most commonly live in holes in trees formed by beetle and moth larvae or where rot has set in after a twig has broken off. The hole, called a gallery, is maintained by the weta and any growth of the bark surrounding the opening is chewed away. They readily occupy a preformed gallery in <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> (a weta motel) and can be kept in a suburban garden as pets. A gallery might house a harem of up to 10 juveniles of both sexes, females and one male. Tree weta are nocturnal. Their diet consists of plants and small insects. The males have much larger jaws than the females, though both sexes will hiss and bite when threatened.|$|E

25|$|Totem poles can {{symbolize the}} {{characters}} and events in mythology, or convey the experiences of recent ancestors and living people. Some of these characters may appear as stylistic representations of objects in nature, while others are more realistically carved. Pole carvings may include animals, fish, plants, insects, and humans, or they may represent supernatural beings such as the Thunderbird. Some symbolize beings that can transform themselves into another form, appearing as combinations of animals or part-animal/part-human forms. Consistent use of a specific character over time, with some slight variations in carving style, helped develop similarities among these shared symbols that allowed people to recognize one from another. For example, the raven is symbolized by a long, straight beak, while the eagle's beak is curved, and a beaver is depicted with two large front teeth, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> held in his front paws, and a paddle-shaped tail.|$|E
25|$|According to Verrier Elwin, a Christian missionary {{and colonial}} era historian, Jagannatha {{in a local}} legend was a tribal deity who was coopted by a Brahmin priest. The {{original}} tribal deity, states Elwin, was Kittung which too is made from wood. According to the Polish Indologist Olgierd M. Starza, {{this is an interesting}} parallel but a flawed one because the Kittung deity is produced by burning <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and too different in its specifics to be the origin of Jagannath. According to another proposal by Stella Kramrisch, log as a symbol of Anga pen deity is found in central Indian tribes and they have used it to represent features of the Hindu goddess Kali with it. However, states Starza, this theory is weak because the Anga pen features a bird or snake like attached head along with other details that make the tribal deity unlike the Jagannath.|$|E
25|$|One {{analogy is}} to think of helium-4 as ash, {{and the amount of}} ash that one forms when one {{completely}} burns <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by stellar nucleosynthesis. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.|$|E
