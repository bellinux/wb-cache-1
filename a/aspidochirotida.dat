50|$|The {{most common}} way to {{separate}} the subclasses is by looking at their oral tentacles. Order Apodida have a slender and elongate body lacking tube feet, with up to 25 simple or pinnate oral tentacles. <b>Aspidochirotida</b> {{are the most common}} sea cucumbers encountered, with a strong body and 10-30 leaf like or shield like oral tentacles. Dendrochirotida are filter-feeders, with plump bodies and 8-30 branched oral tentacles (which can be extremely long and complex).|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} coral-reef sea {{cucumbers}} within the order <b>Aspidochirotida</b> can defend themselves by expelling their sticky cuvierian tubules (enlargements of the respiratory tree that float freely in the coelom) to entangle potential predators. When startled, these cucumbers may expel {{some of them}} through a tear in {{the wall of the}} cloaca in an autotomic process known as evisceration. Replacement tubules grow back in one and a half to five weeks, depending on the species. The release of these tubules can also be accompanied by the discharge of a toxic chemical known as holothurin, which has similar properties to soap. This chemical can kill animals in the vicinity and is one more method by which these sedentary animals can defend themselves.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Conand {{obtained}} her PhD {{in biological}} oceanography at University of Western Brittany in Brest in 1988. Her thesis focused on <b>Aspidochirotida</b> of the New Caledonia Barrier Reef (Les Holothuries aspidochirotes du lagon de Nouvelle-Calédonie). In January 1993, {{she joined the}} marine ecology laboratory (ECOMAR) at the University of La Réunion and eventually became its chief scientist. Her expertise extends to all echinoderms of the Indo-Pacific, but her work has focused on sea cucumbers, but also on other echinoderms of la Réunion. Her other work has included studies of the crown-of-thorns starfish, which preys upon hard, or stony, coral polyps (Scleractinia). She {{was a member of}} the scientific committee of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association from 2001 to 2004. She has since retired and become emeritus faculty.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aspidochirotida</b> are {{distributed}} through the reef flat of Heron Island, contributing 34 - 44 g wet biomass per square metre. On the reef flat, feeding by Holothuria edulis and Stichopus chloronotus is concentrated on sediments 2 - 5 cm from coral outcroppings, while Holothuria atra and Holothuria leucospilota feed at 5 - 16 cm from coral outcroppings. Reef flat sediments actively fed upon by <b>Aspidochirotida</b> {{do not differ}} significantly (p> 0. 05) in total organis, chlorophyll a, or phaeophytin from sediments not fed upon. Spatial variation in the apparent food quality of sediment is low and probably does {{not contribute to the}} distribution of <b>Aspidochirotida</b> on the reef flat. In the lagoon, <b>Aspidochirotida</b> are highly aggregated around the bases of coral patch reefs, where their biomass is 214 g wet weight per square metre. Biomass of <b>Aspidochirotida</b> approaches zero beyond 15 m from coral patch reefs. Sediments at the bases of coral patch reefs in the lagoon do not differ in total organic, chlorophyll a, or phaeophytin from sediments at 20 m distant. However, sediments at the bases of coral patch reefs contain significantly more protein and are significantly skewed toward the coarser grain sizes (phi - 1. 5 to 1. 0). This suggests either that <b>Aspidochirotida</b> in the lagoon aggregate in areas of higher quality sediment, or that intense feeding by <b>Aspidochirotida</b> alters the composition of sediment near coral patch reefs. Most <b>Aspidochirotida</b> feed continuously. Holothuria atra, H. edulis, H. leucospilota and Stichopus variegatus do not exhibit any diel rhythm in feeding or the passage of sediment through the gut, whereas S. chloronotus demonstrates a clear diel rhythm, extending oral tentacles more frequently and passing more sediment late in the day. The aggregated spatial distribution of <b>Aspidochirotida,</b> and the spatial separation of some species, is not driven by resource availability and niche partitioning, but rather some other factor, such as the availability of shelter...|$|E

40|$|<b>Aspidochirotida</b> are {{abundant}} deposit-feeders in the lagoon (0. 17 plus/minus 0. 53 ind per square metre; mean plus/minus 1 SEM) {{and on the}} reef flat (0. 68 plus/minus 0. 06 ind square metre) of Heron Island. Granulometry of sediment and faeces indicates minimal feeding-niche separation between species. Electivity (E) for grain sizes ranges from - 0. 74 plus/minus 0. 14 to 0. 43 plus/minus 0. 19. Coarser grain sizes (0. 3) included disproportionally in the diet. However, each species ingests all available sediment grain sizes and all species ingest each grain size in roughly the same proportions. Feeding-niche breadth (FT) for all species ranges from 0. 97 plus/minus 0. 01 to 0. 99 plus/minus 0. 01 and feeding-niche overlap (L) for each species pair ranges from 0. 78 to 1. 15. Spatial separation of species occurs. Holothuria atra and Holothuria leucospilota have aggregated distributions, with H. atra found more commonly on the inner reef flat, at a mean of 34 plus/minus 2 % of {{the distance from the}} low tide line to the reef crest, and H. leucospilota more commonly found on the outer reef flat, at a mean relative distance of 67 plus/minus 3 %. In the lagoon, H. atra and H. leucospilota forage at a distance (1. 7 to 3. 0 m) from coral patch reefs, while Holothuria edulis, Stichopus chloronotus and Stichopus variegatus forage nearer (0. 8 to 1. 3 m). However, active exclusion is unlikely. Coefficients of association (C subscript 7) for most species pairs indicate co-occurrence at frequencies predicted simply by distributions of these species. Only Holothuria impatiens and Stichopus horrens are significantly associated (C subscript 7 = 0. 34) on the reef flat, reflecting their shared cryptic habitat. Only H. edulis and S. chloronotus are significantly associated (C subscript 7 = 0. 76) in the lagoon. Total consumption by <b>Aspidochirotida</b> in the lagoon and reef flat (3. 93 and 12. 76 g dry sediment metres squared per day, respectively) represents {{only a small fraction of}} the available surface sediment (0. 06 % and 0. 22 %, respectively).

The paraphyletic status of the latter, large (148 assumed valid species) and morphologically diverse genus has recently been recognized and is here confirmed and discussed. Nevertheless, we adopt a Darwinian or eclectic classification for Labidodemas, which we retain at generic level within the Holothuriidae.

40|$|Abstract—Echinoderms are {{conspicuous}} {{components of}} the tropical fauna and play important roles in the functioning of coral reefs. However, their diversity is not as well documented as that of other conspicuous reef organisms such as corals or fish. We review current knowledge {{of the diversity of}} the class Holothuroidea at La Réunion. Several recent initiatives that include MASMA (Conand & Muthiga 2007) and BIOTAS projects have considerably augmented the number of species recorded for the island. As a result of these surveys, the recorded holothuroid fauna has doubled. Thirty-seven species are presently recognized, 18 of which are new records for the island. The order <b>Aspidochirotida,</b> which includes the largest and most conspicuous holothuroids, is the most diverse, with 28 species. Seven species of Apodida and two species of Dendrochirotida constitute the balance of the fauna. These latter groups may prove more diverse with further investigation. The island’s holothuroid fauna is compared with data available from other areas of the Western Indian Ocean and the Indo-west Pacific to evaluate their biogeographic relationships...|$|E

We also summarise findings from a recent publication about the drivers of extinction risk in these sea cucumbers. The IUCN listing sends a stern message to resource managers for the conservation of threatened species. The IUCN Red List may also serve to guide future evaluation by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) for listing some of the species on Appendix II or III in order to set conditions on the trade of those species.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} phylogenetic relationship {{between and among}} selected species of sea cucumbers (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) using 16 S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Phylogenetic analyses of 37 partial sequences of 16 S mitochondrial rRNA gene using three main methods namely neighbour joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) showed the presence of five main genera of sea cucumbers: Molpadia from order Molpadiida and four genera of order <b>Aspidochirotida</b> namely Holothuria, Stichopus, Bohadschia and Actinopyga. All of the 17 species obtained from Malaysia distributed among the main genera except within Interestingly, Holothuria excellens was out of Holothuria group causing Holothuria to be paraphyletic. High bootstrap value and consistent clustering made Molpadia, Stichopus, Bohadschia and Actinopyga monophyletic. The relationship of with the other genera was unclarified and Stichopus was sister to Molpadia. The latter finding caused the resolution at order level unclear. The pairwise genetic distance calculated using Kimura 2 -parameter model further supported and verified findings from the phylogenetic trees.

40|$|Traditional Chinese Marine Medicine (TCMM) {{represents}} one of the medicinal resources for research and development of novel anticancer drugs. In this study, to investigate the presence of anticancer activity (AA) displayed by cold or hot nature of TCMM, we analyzed the association relationship and the distribution regularity of TCMMs with different nature (613 TCMMs originated from 1, 091 species of marine organisms) via association rules mining and phylogenetic tree analysis. The screened association rules were collected from three taxonomy groups: (1) Bacteria superkingdom, Phaeophyceae class, Fucales order, Sargassaceae family, and Sargassum genus; (2) Viridiplantae kingdom, Streptophyta phylum, Malpighiales class, and Rhizophoraceae family; (3) Holothuroidea class, <b>Aspidochirotida</b> order, and Holothuria genus. Our analyses showed that TCMMs with closer taxonomic relationship were more likely to possess anticancer bioactivity. We found that the cluster pattern of marine organisms with reported AA tended to cluster with cold nature TCMMs. Moreover, TCMMs with salty-cold nature demonstrated properties for softening hard mass and removing stasis to treat cancers, and species within Metazoa or Viridiplantae kingdom of cold nature were more likely to contain AA properties. We propose that TCMMs from these marine groups may enable focused bioprospecting for discovery of novel anticancer drugs derived from marine bioresources...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSea {{cucumbers}} (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) {{are large}} and abundant members of marine benthic communities. Overexploitation worldwide has raised concern because they have important functions within ecosystems. The ecological roles of commercially exploited sea cucumbers (<b>Aspidochirotida</b> and Dendrochirotida) are reviewed here, focusing on recent literature. Of the more than 70 species commercially exploited, at least 12 regularly bury into sand and mud, playing major roles in bioturbation. Most aspidochirotids are deposit-feeders, reducing the organic load and redistributing surface sediments, making them bioremediators for coastal mariculture. Sea cucumbers excrete inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, enhancing the productivity of benthic biota. This form of nutrient recycling is crucial in ecosystems in oligotrophic waters such as coral reefs. Feeding and excretion by sea cucumbers also act to increase seawater alkalinity which contributes to local buffering of ocean acidification. Sea cucumbers host more than 200 species of parasitic and commensal symbionts from seven phyla, thereby enhancing ecosystem biodiversity. They are preyed on by many taxa, thereby transferring animal tissue and nutrients (derived from detritus and microalgae) to higher trophic levels. Overexploitation of sea cucumbers is likely to decrease sediment health, reduce nutrient recycling and potential benefits of deposit-feeding to seawater chemistry, diminish biodiversity of associated symbionts, and reduce the transfer of organic matter from detritus to higher trophic levels.

However, this beach does not have informationof beach profi le which is very {{important}} for managing coastal and marine resources. The aims of this research are to make beachprofi les based on substrate, presence of seagrass, coral lifeforms, and Echinodermata. This researchâ€™s method is qua 1 drate transect. Five transects were made, roll meter pulled from the highest tides zone to the reef crest. The distance between each transect around 35 â€“ 40 m. Plots 1 x 1 m 2 were placed along each transect with 8 - 15 m gap between each plot. Geographical coordinates were noted foreach plot so the results are data in those plots. The results are the dominant substrate in Bama Beach is sand and always mixed withgravel. Boulders specifi cally found in the highest tides zone and close to the reef crest. Seagrass can be found almost in all plots, about 10 to 250 m from the highest tides zone. The dominant coral lifeform on reef fl at is coral submassive; then approaching the reef crest,the coral massive is the dominant one. At Bama Beach, was found 5 classes and 9 orders of Echinodermata.

40|$|There {{are more}} than 47 species of holothurians used for bêche-de-mer production, {{many of which are}} locally overfished. With three exceptions, all bêche-de-mer species are <b>Aspidochirotida</b> and species {{identification}} of many of these is difficult. We analysed available genetic information and newly generated sequences to determine if genetic barcoding with the mitochondrial COI gene can be used to identify bêche-de-mer species. Although genetic data were available for ∼ 50 % of bêche-de-mer species, sufficient information and within-species replication were only available for six species. We generated 96 new COI sequences extending the existing database to cover most common species. COI unambiguously identified most bêche-de-mer species providing a genetic barcode for the identification of known species. In addition, conspecific (1. 3 %) variation and congeneric (16. 9 %) divergence were well separated ('barcoding-gap') albeit with a small overlap, which may lead to some error if genetic sampling alone was applied for species discovery. In addition to identification of adults, COI sequences were useful to identify juveniles that are often morphologically different. Sequence data showed that large (deep) and small (shallow) morphotypes of Holothuria atra are the same species, but suggested potential cryptic species within this taxon. For bêche-de-mer, the COI barcode proved useful in species clarification and discovery, but further genetic and taxonomic work is essential for several species. Some bêche-de-mer clades were problematic with morphologically disparate specimens sharing the same barcode.

40|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} {{belong to}} phylum Echinodermata, order Holothuroidea are an abundant and {{diverse group of}} Invertebrates, with over 1400 species occuring from the intertidal to the deepest oceanic trenches. Sea cucumbers are important components {{of the food chain}} in temperate and coral reef ecosystems and they play an important role as deposite feeders and suspension feeders. Rapid decline in populations may have serious consequences for the survival of other species {{that are part of the}} same complex food web,as the eggs, larve and juveniles constitute an important food source for the other marine species including crustaceans, fish and mollusks. In addition sea cucumbers are often called the earthworms of the sea, because they are responsible for the extensive shifting and mixing of the substrate, and recycling of detrital matter. Sea cucumbers consume and grind sediment and organic material into finer particles, turning over the top layers of sediment in lagoons, reefs and other habitats and allowing the penetration of oxygen. While the taxonomy of the holothurian families is generally well known, the distinction of similar species is difficult. There are relatively few holothurian taxonomist. Most sea cucumber species can be identified by Holothurin taxonomists by using the calcareous skeletal ossicles found in the body wall. In this study, at first a sea cucumber from Kish island in Persian gulf has recognized. Individuals collected from west and east extend far away into north and south of coral reefs by diving. I have checked them morphologically and anatomically. Then with key to the orders of the Holothuroidea, They belong to the <b>Aspidochirotida</b> with key to the families of <b>Aspidochirotida,</b> they were in Stichopodidae families and with key to the genus of Stchopodidae, they were Stichopus. Then ossicles were extracted at National Museum of Natural History, by Dr David Pawson. The ossicles were measured on a transect across a slide prepared from the mid-dorsal region of each specimen. The one we have in the shallow waters of Kish island, is Stichopus hermanni, a massive holothurian, body broad, considerably flattened ventraly,the dorsal side slightly arched and the lateral sides almost vertical; body wall fairy thick and soft; mouth subterminal; anus central; tentacles usually 20 in number of length and leaf shaped. Numerous ossicles consisting of table with large discs having usually 7 to 15 peripheral holes, but often irregular or incomplete and spire of moderate height ending in a group of spinelets, rosettes of variable development, and c-shaped rods. Color (exept papillae) partly remained after preservation in alcohol which is found at the depth of 4 to 8 meters, on coral reef. Furthermore, the sexual reproductive cycle was described using standard methods. Gonads were removed and transferred to Bouin's fixative for four weeks and then processed according to standard embedding technique. To prevent the loss of tubule contents during embedding, the tubule sections, were cut well beyond the segment selected for sectioning. For each individual, six sections, each section with 5 µm diameter by microtome were cut from tubules. These sections were first placed on gelatin coated slides (the gelatin was heated to 42 °c) and then transferred to the oven at 37 °c for one hour. This technique usually prevents the fragil tubules from breaking and the loss of gametes. The slides were stained with Eosin and Hematoxylin, and good resolution of the various cell types achieved. A second series of slides was stained with the Periodic Acid Schiff(PAS) to identify polysaccharides(glycogen). Monthly sampling was occurred. The sexual reproductive cycle was defined through the combined use of these criteria: Monthly percentages of the gonad stages for each sex, the monthly gonad index (GI), given as the ratio of the wet gonad weight (G) to the dray weight (DW) and the monthly percentage of individuals that undetermined sex. The gonad consists of two tufts of tubules on which saccules develop. Gonadal development was classified into five stages: post spawning, recovery, growth, advanced growth, and mature stage that were adapted from the earlier studies of holothurians. Histological preparations showed that the sex of larger individuals could be identified by the presence of oogonia and young oocytes in females, and spermatogonic stages in males. The mean diameter of the tubules and gonadal mass follow annual cycles, increasing from late winter through spring, and dropping abruptly after spawning in the summer. Gametogenesis is generally a prolongate process and begins in March. By summer the ovarian tubules contain oocytes with diameter of 120 - 240 pm and the testicular tubules contain an abundance of spermatozoa (diameter 5 - 6 gm). Following spawning the predominant activity within the spent tubules is phagocytosis of the residual gamets. The active phase of gametogenesis (March to July), coincides with an increasing photoperiod regim, and an accelerated gametogenesis occurs in July when temperature is high. Throughout the year, the gonad of Stichopus hermanni is larger in males than in females, and this is due to the number of tubules in the testis rather than to tubules length or diameter...|$|E
