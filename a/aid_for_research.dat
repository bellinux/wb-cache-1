40|$|Algorithms {{that are}} used in {{real-time}} hearing devices, such as hearing aids or cochlear implants, need to work with a short time latency in the order of 10 ms and must be efficient enough to run on battery power. Furthermore, in order to evaluate ecological validity such algorithms often need to be validated in the development stage using real-time processing of environmental sounds. However, researchers often lack the ability to access to the technology and they use offline schemes instead. In order to allow more and less specialised researchers access to the necessary technology and make it as easy and straightforward to develop real-time algorithm, we have developed an auditory real-time processing algorithm platform (“Open Development Platform”, ODP). The ODP is designed to help the development from existing offline algorithms to novel real-time algorithms by introducing a clear set of rules for development and evaluation. ODP has a software component that works in MATLAB/Simulink and a hardware component that works on the Speedgoat® Target machine. We also explain several algorithms from the available library that have low latency and low power consumption: filter bank, envelop power estimator, frequency shifter, and adaptive feedback canceller. As example of a complete project, we demonstrate here, how they can be combined to a fully functional hearing <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>research</b> purpose...|$|E

Under the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU Croatia has accepted certain obligations concerning the allocation and control of state aid. The objective of this research project was to assess the size and structure of state aid in Croatia and to compare it with the aid provided by Member States (and candidate countries). In 2001, State aid in Croatia represented 5. 25 % of GDP, and was five times the size of aid in the EU. At the same time, Croatia provided a much stronger support to certain economic sectors than the EU, particularly agriculture, transport, tourism and shipbuilding. On the other hand, the <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>research</b> and development, small and medium-size enterprises or environmental protection, which are in the EU the main recipients of the so-called ‘horizontal aid’, the aid used by all enterprises and sectors and not only selected ones, was much smaller. It should therefore be expected that Croatia would have to reduce the volume of its state aid in the course of its adjustment to the EU, and gradually redirect the aid from selected sectors to all enterprises, through horizontal forms of aid. At the same time, it should improve its system of allocation and control of state aid. state aid, state intervention, Croatia, European Union. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The Commonwealth of Nations is {{a unique}} {{congregation}} of 53 countries providing a platform for realistic collaboration on several social and health care issues. Ethical migration of health professionals from developing to developed countries is a key priority of the Commonwealth and several ethical codes have been put into practice. However, these codes have been mainly developed {{in regard to the}} medical workforce (physicians and nurses), and can have some limitations when applied to the dental profession. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the role of the Commonwealth in influencing ethical migration of dentists from developing to developed countries, by examining the case of Indian-trained dentists migrating to Australia. Methods: The research design involved interviewing key health care or oral health leaders in India and Australia. A semi-structured interview process was designed. Grounded theory techniques were used in data collection and analysis. Findings: Both the Indian and Australian participants expressed serious doubts on the Commonwealth or any of its Associations in influencing ethical migration of Indian trained dentists to Australia. Three reasons emerged: indifferent priorities, lack of funds and the rise of other international organisations. Bilateral cooperation between concerned countries was considered as a feasible alternative. Conclusion: The role of the Commonwealth as a custodian of dental migratory ethics is limited. Further research is required as to how bilateral cooperation between India and Australia could be improved. There is also an urgent need for targeted funding allocations in oral health, especially in the form of international <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>research</b> and development both in India and Australia.

40|$|Originally, the Lomé {{convention}} {{aimed to}} be the framework for genuine development cooperation between the Old Continent and its former colonies. It was an instrument which, without being a cure for all ills, provided substantial guarantees for countries that had been exhausted by years of economic, political and cultural domination by Europe. However, from the 80 's onwards, the demands made by neo-liberalism and the priority given to the market economy overrode the research effort and support deployed in favour of autonomous and balanced development of countries which nevertheless make up {{a majority of the}} so-called "lesser developed countries" (LDC's). The fishery Accords in particular, despite the financial compensation they bring with them and the additional aid for training and research, do not contribute to any real development of ACP countries' fisheries. There is a simple reason for this: they are commercial, rather than development agreements. They are a god-send for the industrial fleets of the European Community which, thanks to the Accords, are granted the enormous advantage of being able to exploit for their own profit waters which are rich in both fish and shell-fish of high commercial value. Without these Accords, the fishing fleets of the rich countries of Europe would be forcibly laid up and their crews dismissed on account of the over-fishing in Northern waters. Moreover, the <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>research</b> and training is largely piecemeal and the stipulations of the Accords are by no means obeyed as they should be. For example, very few fishermen from ACP countries have found a berth on board European Community vessels for training purposes, as the Lome Convention gives them the right to expect. The new Lome Accords signed in 1990 give {{no reason to believe that}} the EC is moving towards a more committed policy of development cooperation. The economic demands of the 1993 Single Market, the channelling of aid towards the new democracies in the East, the search for more lucrative markets with more credit-worthy partners [...] . are all ominous portents for the world's poorest countries. After being the most colonial of continents in the history of mankind, can it be that present-day Europe, or what will very soon become of it with the probable integration of certain countries from the East, is once again going to miss one of the great opportunities of History? As the third millenium dawns, Europe is being given a great chance : to make a full assessment of the poor countries' demo-graphic importance in the very near future, and to reply generously to their most basic needs. From this point of view, the development of small-scale fisheries in Third World countries is a vital issue. Will Europe meet this challenge? The future of relations between North and South is at stake. (53 pp. ...|$|E
