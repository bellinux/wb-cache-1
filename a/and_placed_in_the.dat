5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles.

The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have.
