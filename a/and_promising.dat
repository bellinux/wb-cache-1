5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters <b>and</b> <b>promising</b> his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith {{approached}} the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington Pump and Machinery but they turned it down, {{saying that it}} could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed to build a new factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories came up with a design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company came up with a revolutionary <b>and</b> <b>promising</b> design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E

5|$|On March 17, Campbell {{appeared}} at the Montreal Forum for the Canadiens' first game after Richard's suspension. His presence provoked a riot at the Forum that spilled into the streets.

Tensions eased after Richard made a personal plea accepting his punishment <b>and</b> <b>promising</b> to return the following year to help the team win the Stanley Cup. The incident likely cost Richard the 1954–55 scoring title (an honour Richard never achieved in his NHL career) and {{played a role in}} the off-season departure of longtime Canadiens head coach Dick Irvin.|$|E

5|$|The early 1940s was of {{particular}} importance in American art as American scene painting (Regionalism) {{came to be seen}} as an inadequate mode of artistic expression in a tumultuous time.

5|$|A 1980 US {{indictment}} {{said that}} Francisco Rafael was {{under investigation by}} the DEA for alleged cocaine and heroin distribution in the San Diego area. The DEA had identified him as one of the cocaine suppliers and set up an undercover operation to arrest him and his associates by purchasing multi-ton shipments of cocaine. He admitted to have worked with drug distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of cocaine to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond <b>and</b> <b>promising</b> to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E
5|$|After a {{bruising}} primary {{battle with}} another incumbent whose district was combined with his, in which McEwen faced charges of bouncing checks on the House bank, he narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland. Following an unsuccessful {{run in the}} adjacent Second District in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade, until in 2005 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress in the Second District special election to replace Rob Portman, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, Jean Schmidt. McEwen's 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a pro-life stance, defending Second Amendment rights, <b>and</b> <b>promising</b> to limit taxes and government spending. In 2006, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the Second District.|$|E
5|$|As {{the civil}} war in England {{developed}} into a long and protracted conflict, both the King and the English Parliamentarians appealed to the Scots for military aid. The Covenanters opted to side with Parliament and in 1643 they entered into a Solemn League and Covenant, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement <b>and</b> <b>promising</b> further reform in England. In January 1644 a Scots army of 18,000 foot and 3,000 horse and guns under Leslie crossed the border. It helped turn the tide of the war in the North, forcing the royalist army under the Marquis of Newcastle into York where it was besieged by combined Scots and Parliamentary armies. The Royalists were relieved by a force under Prince Rupert, the King's nephew, but the allies under Leslie's command defeated the Royalists decisively at Marston Moor on 2 July, generally seen as the turning point of the war.|$|E
