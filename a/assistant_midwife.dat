The reported study examined patterns of service utilization across the rural population of four districts of Orissa, with special reference to perceptions of the availability and quality of state services at the primary care level. Within the selected districts, 219 interviews were conducted across 66 villages. Households reported utilizing {{a wide range of}} health care providers, although hospitals constituted the most frequently–and primary health care centres (PHCs) the least frequently–accessed services. Private practitioners (qualified and unqualified) represented a major sector of provision. This included high rates of access by scheduled tribes and castes (running at approximately twice the rate of access to both local and PHC provision). Key factors guiding patterns of utilization were reputation of the provider, cost and physical accessibility. Local health provision through <b>assistant</b> nurse <b>midwives</b> and male health workers was generally perceived of poor quality, with the lowest rates of resolution of health problems of all service providers. The location of a sub-centre base for <b>assistant</b> nurse <b>midwives</b> within a village had no demonstrable impact on access to services. Acknowledging constraints on broader generalization, the implications of the findings for informing health policy and programming within Orissa are noted.

40|$|CONTEXT: Several {{countries}} have reported {{a resurgence of}} pertussis in the last decades. This puts infants (especially < 6 months) at risk of severe complications, because they {{are too young to}} be fully protected by vaccination. The global pertussis initiative has proposed pertussis vaccination of young infants' close contacts, in order to reduce pertussis transmission and the burden of the disease on infants. Our aim is to explore the perceived determinants (barriers and facilitators) of intention to accept vaccination among the possible target groups of pertussis vaccination for cocooning. Consideration of these determinants is necessary to optimise the uptake of the vaccination. METHODS: We conducted 13 focus groups and six individual semi-structured interviews with members of possible target groups for pertussis cocooning (i. e. parents, maternity <b>assistants,</b> <b>midwives,</b> and paediatric nurses) in the Netherlands. Here, both maternal pertussis vaccination as well as pertussis cocooning has not been implemented. The topic list was based on a literature review and a barrier framework. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and two researchers performed thematic content analysis. FINDINGS: The participants' risk perception, outcome expectations, general vaccination beliefs, moral norms, opinion of others, perceived autonomy, anticipated regret, decisional uncertainty, and perceived organisational barriers were all factors that influenced the intention to accept pertussis vaccination for cocooning. DISCUSSION: This study has identified nine perceived determinants that influence the intention to accept pertussis cocooning vaccination. We add the following determinants to the literature: perceived cost-effectiveness (as a concept of outcome expectations), justice (as a concept of moral norms), anticipated regret, and decisional uncertainty. We recommend considering these determinants in vaccination programmes for pertussis cocooning vaccination. Experience, information and trust emerged as predominant themes within these determinants. These themes require particular attention in future research on vaccination acceptance, especially with regard to their role in use and implementation in policy and practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Antibiotics {{have played}} an {{essential}} role in decreasing morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. However, indiscriminate use and unrestricted access is contributing to the emergence of bacterial resistance. This paper reports on a situational analysis of antimicrobial use and resistance in Ghana, with focus on policy and regulation. Methods Relevant policy documents, reports, regulations and enactments were reviewed. PubMed and Google search engines were used to extract relevant published papers. Websites of stakeholders such as Ministry of Health (MOH) and its agencies were also reviewed. An interview guide was used to elicit responses from selected officials from these sectors. Results Laws and guidelines to control the use of antimicrobials in humans were available but not for animals. There was no National Antimicrobial Policy (NAP). A health practice regulatory law mandates Physicians, Physician <b>Assistants,</b> <b>Midwives</b> and trained Nurses to prescribe antimicrobials. However, antibiotics are widely prescribed and dispensed by unauthorised persons, suggesting weak enforcement of the laws. Antibiotics were also supplied to and from unapproved medicine outlets. The Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG), Essential Medicines List (EML) and the National Health Insurance Scheme Medicines List (NHISML) provide restrictions regarding levels of prescribing of antimicrobials. However, existing guidelines on antibiotic use are mostly not adhered to. The use of Automatic Stop Orders to avoid wastage in the hospitals is also not practiced. Data on use of antibiotics for individuals are not readily available in most facilities. Again, there are no standards or guidelines on veterinary use of antibiotics. Surveillance systems for consumption of antibiotics and resistance monitoring were not in place in most health facilities. However, there is an ongoing national action to create awareness on bacteria resistance, strengthening knowledge through research and surveillance and development of NAP in line with global action plan on antimicrobial resistance. Conclusion Absence of national antimicrobial policy, weak regulatory environment and non-adherence to practice standards may have contributed to increased and unregulated access to antimicrobials in Ghana, a catalyst for development and spread of antimicrobial resistance...|$|R

40|$|Promoting {{resilience}} in mothers’ emotions’ (PRIME) was a large, team-based NHMRC funded randomised control trial (RCT) {{aimed at}} determining {{the effectiveness of}} a midwife-led counselling intervention in minimising psychological distress in childbearing women. Midwives were employed as research assistants and trained to deliver a counselling intervention to distressed postnatal women. This present study made use of an opportunity to explore and describe these midwives’ experiences. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive exploratory study was to explore and describe midwives’ (n= 18) experiences of working as research assistants in the PRIME project as well as their experiences of learning and delivering a midwife-led counselling intervention to distressed postnatal women. In-depth interviews, midwife diary entries and their postings on the PRIME midwifery forum were the methods of data collection employed for this study. Data was analysed using manual thematic analysis techniques. There were two distinct findings elicited from the midwives’ descriptions. The first related to the challenging but worthwhile nature of their role as research <b>assistants.</b> <b>Midwives</b> in this study considered their preparation for and work as a research assistant in the RCT a challenging experience. In part, they attributed this to learning the counselling intervention, having their practice critiqued and being daunted by the level of commitment the research role required of them. The support of the collegial team members of the project was therefore fundamental to the midwives perceiving this experience positively. Despite these challenges, midwives expressed that overall PRIME was a worthwhile experience that enhanced their knowledge of the research process. The second finding was the level of confrontation midwives experienced as they came to appreciate the level of emotional distress some women suffered as a consequence of their birth experience. A desire to improve the emotional care provided to women in the postpartum was the midwives’ primary motivation to contribute to the PRIME project. Midwives wanted to be more actively involved in the care of women distressed by their birthing events, however it was evident that prior to PRIME many were not confident in their ability to perform this role. For the most part, they attributed this lack of confidence on insufficient counselling education received in their midwifery training, limited opportunity to impart emotional care in practice and the subsequent delegation of women’s emotional care to other health professionals. Although considered challenging for most of the midwives to learn, the advanced counselling skills they acquired in PRIME provided them the confidence to care for women distressed by their birthing experience and to personally deal with any stressful situations they may encounter in practice. The findings of this study contribute to developing a better understanding of midwives’ experiences of participating in research and working with distressed women in practice...|$|R

The main obstacles to the expansion of care are the dire scarcity of skilled providers and health-system infrastructure, substandard quality of care, and women's reluctance to use maternity care where there are high costs and poorly attuned services. To increase the supply of professional skilled birthing care, strategic decisions must be made in three areas: training, deployment, and retention of health workers.
