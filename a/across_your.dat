500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth <b>across</b> <b>your</b> skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
2500|$|Django is the {{inspiration}} for the 1969 song and album Return of Django by the Jamaican reggae group the Upsetters. Additionally, Django is the subject of the song [...] "Django" [...] on the 2003 Rancid album Indestructible. The music video for the Danzig song [...] "Crawl <b>Across</b> <b>Your</b> Killing Floor" [...] is inspired by the film and shows Glenn Danzig dragging a coffin.|$|E
2500|$|The Red Chord {{was formed}} in Revere, Massachusetts in 1999 by vocalist Guy Kozowyk and guitarist Kevin Rampelberg. One year later, the band was joined by second guitarist Mike [...] "Gunface" [...] McKenzie, bassist Adam Wentworth and drummer Mike Justian. The band's name is derived from Alban Berg's opera Wozzeck, in which a {{schizophrenic}} man slits his lover's throat, then reverts to his normal self and asks, [...] "My love, what is that red cord <b>across</b> <b>your</b> neck?" [...] The debut album Fused Together in Revolving Doors was recorded with producer Andrew Schneider in December 2001 and released by the Robotic Empire record label. With the debut album, The Red Chord gained a substantial fanbase.|$|E

2500|$|Former pairing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez incited {{unprecedented}} {{media attention}} for an American modern-day supercouple during their 2002-2004 courtship. The two {{were referred to}} as the first superstar couple of the Internet age, [...] and the pairing's popularity resulted in their being known by the portmanteau [...] "Bennifer" [...] (for Ben and Jennifer) to the media, as well as to fans using the name combination. The term Bennifer itself became popular, and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other's first names. The pairing eventually succumbed to overexposure, which caused public interest in their romance to result in less admiration and negatively affected their careers. In 2007, Affleck stated: [...] was probably bad for my career. What happens is this sort of bleed-over from the tabloids <b>across</b> <b>your</b> movie work. You go to a movie, you only go once. But the tabloids and Internet are everywhere. You can really subsume the public image of somebody. I ended up in an unfortunate crosshair position where I was in a relationship and [...] mostly lied and inflated a bunch of salacious stuff for the sake of selling magazines. And I paid a certain price for that. Then, in concert with some movies that didn’t work...|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{said the}} officer. [...] "In fact, {{we heard the}} detonation. Still, I daresay there are several things we should like to ask each other about, and you {{suggested}} going <b>across</b> to <b>your</b> steamer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a whit, sir--not one particle; besides, you can't haul {{back your}} fore-top-sail--your fore-mast is lying <b>across</b> <b>your</b> forecastle." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have come, madam," [...] he said, [...] "to {{know what}} is the matter. To know why my name is written <b>across</b> <b>your</b> garden. Not {{amicably}} either." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But wouldn't it be on {{the main}} road, or next door to a woman with six squalling children, who'd always be hanging her washing out to dry <b>across</b> <b>your</b> garden?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will call}} here," [...] he replied, [...] "at ten o'clock of every morning that follows a {{performance}} of Le Rêve. We can complete our transaction then <b>across</b> <b>your</b> office desk." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Then I {{think we}} may dismiss that idea,' said the Head with visible relief. The idea of such a scandal {{occurring}} at St Austin's had filled him with unfeigned horror. 'And now I {{think it would be}} as well to go <b>across</b> to <b>your</b> House and hear what Welch has to say about the matter.

6000|$|While the ill-humour {{excited by}} the {{insolence}} of the young aristocrat was thus evaporating in empty menace, Roland Graeme had to control the far more serious indignation of Adam Woodcock.
