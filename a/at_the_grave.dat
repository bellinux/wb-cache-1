5|$|Many rituals {{were used}} to {{identify}} a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> in question. Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken {{as a sign of}} vampirism.|$|E

5|$|Other methods {{commonly}} practised in Europe included severing the tendons at {{the knees}} or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on the ground <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, {{it would have to}} count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E
5|$|The 150th {{anniversary of}} the ship's loss {{prompted}} several events in commemoration. A memorial to Monitor and her lost crew members was erected in the Civil War section of Hampton National Cemetery by NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, together with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and dedicated on 29 December 2012.

5|$|Jones is {{approached}} by greaser Mutt Williams, who {{tells him that}} Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru, suffered a mental breakdown and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles {{on the walls and}} floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, a Conquistador who searched for Akator. They discover the skull <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave,</b> with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there.|$|E

5|$|Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She {{tells them}} both {{she will not}} kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides {{she wants to be}} remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ten {{years later}} in 1963, Srintil (Prisia Nasution) and Rasus (Nyoman Oka Antara) are fast friends. Rasus also has romantic {{feelings}} for her. With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation.

She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk.

25|$|The {{period when}} the two men lived in Naples would later become controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas.

When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle would preview the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese Augustinians {{were the}} next missionaries to follow; they {{took charge of}} the oratory built over the grave of the Apostle, and built their priory and church {{adjoining}} it.

There is nothing to show when the Fathers of the Society of Jesus settled at Saint Thomas, but by 1648 they had a college in the place and a church and residence at Mylapur, while St. Francis Xavier spent three months in 1545 at Saint Thomas praying <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> of the Apostle for light in regard to his projected mission to Japan.|$|E

Three of his children, Placido (died 1910), Faustin (died 1912), and Ethiopia (died 1920) were subsequently buried alongside their parents. Every grave except Martin's remained unmarked.
