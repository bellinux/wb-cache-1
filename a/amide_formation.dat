40|$|Despite the <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> {{reaction}} being a key {{reaction in}} organic chemistry, the direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> reaction is both little used and little explored. Acceptance of the feasibility and general applicability of this reaction {{depends upon the}} development of both {{an understanding of the}} mechanism of the reaction, and the design of catalysts, which can promote the reaction {{on a wide range of}} substrates and under ambient conditions. Investigations into uncatalysed direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> began with calorimetric studies of the mixing of a series of carboxylic acids and amines in order to measure heat output, which has been compared with their ability to react to form carboxylate ammonium salts and amides. In order to identify which species (salt or H-bonded species) were formed, 1 H NMR studies were also carried out by mixing the substrates in d 8 -toluene and monitoring the resulting reactions. These experiments were also compared to DFT computational studies, from which the relative merits of different mechanistic schemes for direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> could be assessed. A neutral intermediate pathway, involving carboxylic acid dimerisation via mutual hydrogen bonding was found to be accessible and may explain how the direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> reaction occurs. The synthesis of novel boronic acid compounds, which display the potential to act as catalysts for direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation,</b> has been attempted. Although the formation and purification of a reasonable amount of material for catalytic screening proved to be extremely difficult, progress towards the synthesis of these potential catalysts has been made. The application of direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> to the synthesis of key intermediates for some economically important, commercial syntheses has been assessed. The results of these reactions display a varying degree of success and largely depend on the properties of the substrates used. Further investigations are therefore required to ensure that direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> becomes a general tool for a wide range of carboxylic acid and amine partners. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} devoted to boron {{chemistry}} in two ways. Firstly, {{the development of the}} boron – nitrogen “Frustrated” Lewis Pairs (FLPs) was investigated by combining the principles of this approach with known bifunctional catalytic methods. This also included design and synthetic efforts towards new bifunctional catalysts 108 and 157 on the basis of L-proline connected to Lewis acidic borane or borinic derivatives, which revealed multiple peculiarities of boron chemistry. Catalyst 176 was successfully utilised in nitro-Michael addition reaction. Secondly, boronic acids are promising catalysts for the important process of direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation,</b> which is a much more atom efficient and sustainable alternative to the current industrial approaches to amide synthesis. However, the mechanism of action of boronic acids in this process is not yet well understood, while this is crucial for effective design and future application of catalysts for direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation.</b> Thus the roles of both borinic and boronic acids in direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> reactions were investigated. This included isolation of multiple Lewis adducts formed as intermediates or byproducts in different reaction mixtures between amines, carboxylic acids and boron-containing compounds. These results have helped to better understand the reactivity of boron-based catalysts and allowed development of the new mechanistic understanding of boronic acids in direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation.</b> These finding underlined the complexity of boron-containing systems, the importance of boron-nitrogen Lewis adduct interactions and the high possibility of multiple boron atoms orchestrating the investigated processes. The non-catalytic thermal direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> reaction was also studied both in flow and microwave reactors in order to better understand these complex multicomponent systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{significance}} of amides {{as a component}} of biomolecules and synthetic products has triggered the development of catalytic direct amidation methods which involve reaction of a carboxylic acid and amine to form an amide with water as the only by-product. These methods evade the need for stoichiometric activation or coupling reagents and hence, are important green chemical processes. Investigations into direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> began with the development a mild reaction conditions for the direct amidation reaction with known arylboronic acid catalysts in two different model reactions and compared with both reported and potential organometallic catalysts (Zr and Fe based). After a systematic evaluation of solvent, temperature and catalyst, ambient reaction conditions were applied in the direct amidation of amino-acid derivatives in order to exploit these more economical reagents for peptide synthesis which is both little used and little explored. Protected amino acid derivatives showed slow reactivity compared to simple amine-carboxylic acid combinations and hence high catalyst loadings were required, though did proceed at 65 68 °C generally avoiding racemisation. However, an interesting synergistic catalytic effect was observed during dipeptide formation using mixture of two arylboronic acid catalysts (1 : 1) in the direct amidation reaction at lower temperatures, although the process was particularly slow. This impressive result led to explore more about the effect of ‘Cooperative Catalysts’, particularly, on the less reactive acid-amine combination. As a consequence, some commercially important synthesis has been reviewed through this novel cooperative catalysis to ensure their real applicability in industries. Acceptance of the practicability and general applicability of this new approach depends upon the understanding of the mechanism of the cooperative catalysis. In order to reveal the mechanism of the cooperative catalysis the direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> reactions were followed by the real time monitoring technology (React-IR) and HPLC. However, further investigations are required to understand the mechanistic intricacies of this cooperative catalysis. Further, the role of H-bonding in the amide bond formation with significantly inert acid (pivalic acid) towards the amine to form amide has been attempted. In order to accelerate the catalytic activity the use of a potential catalyst promoter, ‘ANB 209 ’ in the direct amidation reactions was also examined. Improvements in catalysts activity or alterations in catalyst would need further study so that the direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> becomes a common tool {{for a wide range of}} carboxylic acid and amine partners. The effect of different substituents on the α-position of carboxylic acid with various amine substrates was investigated to understand the exceptional direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> of the synthesis of mandipropamid, a well known fungicide. Both uncatalysed and catalysed direct amidations of mandelic acid was done with different amine substrates at different temperatures, resulting different rate of <b>amide</b> <b>formation.</b> Finally, the application of two novel borinic acid (R 1 RBOH) compounds in the direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation</b> reactions has been assessed for the first time, which displayed in some cases the potential to act as catalysts for direct <b>amide</b> <b>formation.</b> Further research will likely to accelerate the developments of this type of catalysts in direct amidations. ...|$|E

One major limitation of peptides is the instability of their interactions with biomolecules, because of the limited accessible surface area for noncovalent interactions and the intrinsic flexibility of peptides. Peptide tags are nonetheless fundamental for protein detection and purification, because their small size minimizes the perturbation to protein function. Here we have designed a 16 amino acid peptide that spontaneously forms an amide bond to a protein partner, via reaction between lysine and asparagine side chains. This depended upon splitting a pilin subunit from a human pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes, which usually undergoes intramolecular <b>amide</b> bond <b>formation</b> to impart mechanical and proteolytic stability to pili.
