40|$|International audienceContext The lower spinal {{vertebrae}} {{are often}} repaired through an incision {{directly over the}} spine, called the posterior lumbar approach. In spinal fusion, surgeon stabilizes the back by fusing certain vertebrae together with bone grafts or metal rods. For doing the surgery in minimally invasive approaches, different tools and system are designed to allow cannulated pedicle screws to be placed appropriately in a true percutaneous fashion. However, the rod insertion still has problems and difficulties that prevent the procedure to be in minimally invasive. Purpose The {{purpose of this paper}} is to address the difficulties of the surgical tasks for rod insertion, to review the existing system and procedures for rod insertion, and to propose a new designed system that enables surgeon to insert the rod and guide it through the pedicle screws in MIS conditions. Materials and methods With the collaboration of the Hospital of Grenoble, France, the study started and some spinal fusion operation in open and minimally invasive procedure have been observed and analysed. Based on the extracted task list, a scenario for orthopaedic traumatology was prepared. The main objective for the design was to have a universal recipient rod holder (independent to the rod type), an easy load and unload system, and simple assembly after which fit with the sterilisation procedure. A first prototype have been fabricated and tested on a phantom. With some modification the second prototype have been designed and tested by surgeons on cadaver. Results The result of both ex-vivo and cadaver tests seems promising. The rod holder submitted for patent and a series of clinically <b>approved</b> <b>prototypes</b> are fabricated to be used in operations by different surgeons and Genoble Hospital to have the enough evidences for clinical validation of the instrument...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Raytheon Australia is {{currently}} engaged {{in developing a}} system user interface rapid prototyping environment {{in the form of}} a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Laboratory. This paper will explore the process and tools that Raytheon are using to this end and how they have been applied to projects to date. The HCI Lab provides a mechanism whereby the display subsystem of any new or existing system may be specified or re-specified in an efficient manner, maximising customer input and minimising risk. The approach of the HCI Lab aims to maximise flexibility so that it can efficiently and rapidly specify HCI's for systems ranging from small scale applications to complex military platforms and/or simulators. The key to this flexibility is a focus on the high level HCI Lab process, requiring a tailored approach for each task the HCI Lab undertakes. The rapid prototyping approach is dependent upon the scale and nature of the display system and could simply revolve around a throw-away software mockup or include a demonstration suite that is capable of generating software code to be deployed on the actual platform system. User comment is captured at HCI workshops where prototype displays are demonstrated and comments elicited. All feedback is itemised and kept in a tracking database providing a trace to comments addressed through progressive prototypes. Customer representatives are present at workshops and are empowered to <b>approve</b> <b>prototypes</b> demonstrated. The focus of the workshops is on maximising the usability as well as the utility of Human-Machine interfaces. It has been found that this process provides rapid convergence to user community requirements. Raytheon are currently engaged in using this process for the Collins Class Combat System Simulator display subsystem to enable software changes within customer management requirements, resource and time constraints. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the dynamics of architecture development processes. The MBASE (Model-Based Architecting and Software Engineering) approach establishes four distinct phases, each separated by a milestone or an anchor point. During each distinct phase, the architecture of a system is successively refined to cover a larger system scope. Our model focuses on the dynamics of architecting processes in MBASE during its early phases i. e. Inception and Elaboration. The model also considers the impact of RAD (Rapid Application Development) factors such as collaboration and prototyping on the process of architecting. The models described show that initial completion rates for the requirements identification and architecture development activities significantly impact the number of <b>approved</b> items. <b>Prototyping</b> factors such as IKIWISI and collaboration also significantly affect the rates of completion and approval. The model also produces a declining curve for staffing analysts and a linear growth for architecting and design personnel. The architecture development process model developed successfully models the activities during the initial phases of MBASE. This model is able to replicate the effort profiles for requirements and architecture/design activities based on a concurrent development model and a dynamic resource allocation scheme...|$|R

The design was said by lead designer Bruno Sacco {{to be influenced by}} Jaguar's XJ40 sedan and BMW's E32 7-Series. Before production started, the exterior appearance of the W140 was revised {{in the form of the}} grille on all W140s being recessed as opposed to a planned exclusive grille on the top model, a feature which later spread to the rest of the Mercedes-Benz range. In 1987, an 18-month delay was made from 1989 to 1991 to accommodate a V12 engine and a high-performance braking system. This resulted in the final development prototypes being completed in June 1990. Pilot production models were made from June 1990 to January 1991. In 1989, Lexus introduced the LS 400 luxury sedan.

Design work on the Mi-28 began under Marat Tishchenko in 1980. In 1981, a design and a mock-up were accepted. The prototype (no. 012) was first flown on 10 November 1982. In this same time frame, Kamov was also attempting to submit its own designs for a new helicopter to the military, which they had designed throughout the early and mid 1980s. In 1984, the Mi-28 completed {{the first stage of}} state trials, but in October 1984 the Soviet Air Force chose the more advanced Kamov Ka-50 as the new anti-tank helicopter. The Mi-28 development was continued, but given lower priority. In December 1987 Mi-28 production in Rosvertol in Rostov on Don was <b>approved.</b> After several <b>prototypes</b> were built, production ceased in 1993 with additional development continuing into the 21st century. Changes in the military situation after the Cold War made specialized anti-tank helicopters less useful. The advantages of the Mi-28N, like all-weather action ability, lower cost, and similarity to the Mi-24, have become more important.

This project focused on the non-technical side of security and the management practices {{that can be used}} to establish an important layer in a comprehensive security solution. A security planning matrix was developed by drawing from the theoretical and practical body of knowledge in the information systems security field. The matrix was designed to support generally accepted security principles, standards, and legislation so that information systems management can use the product to protect information systems using non-technical controls and techniques such as people, policies, practices, training, awareness, and the organizational structure and culture. A hybrid waterfall/spiral process model, Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) was used to develop the security planning matrix. Specific procedures emulated those used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) based on their experience and expertise in developing security guidelines and other security tools. A prototype of the product was developed early in the process based on requirements abstracted from security standards, legislation, and industry best practices. The prototype was then reviewed by an expert panel to refine both product requirements and design. One round of feedback and two versions of the prototype were required before the panel <b>approved</b> the <b>prototype</b> for use in the pilot study. The pilot was performed in a real-world setting at Republic Mortgage Insurance Corporation (RMIC), where user acceptance testing, success criteria evaluation, and security performance improvement testing were all performed to evaluate and stabilize the product. The research improved professional practice and added to the body of information systems security knowledge by identifying and demonstrating methods for defining requirements of, developing, and evaluating a product such as the security planning matrix. Results of the research also showed that the product 2 ̆ 7 s features and functions were acceptable to both subject matter experts and real-world users and that implementation and use of the security planning matrix could improve the level of security preparedness as evidenced by pilot study results at RMIC...|$|R

After management <b>approved</b> making the <b>prototype</b> into a full game, the team started expanding its concepts, creating the ability to hide in ink, and wanted to somehow incorporate squids. After coming up with these ideas, the developers had trouble [...] "filtering it down" [...] to a [...] "simple, fun game." [...] Shigeru Miyamoto told the team that there was [...] "no appeal" [...] to the game in that state. Afterwards, the developers added the ability to hide in ink and verticality to the maps, but it still felt unfocused. The art director sketched different ideas for the player character, including animals, [...] "macho men," [...] robots, and Mario, but the co-directors wanted to include a playable squid. They also needed the character to be human in order to hold weaponry, but thought that a squid-human hybrid [...] "wouldn't sell". In January 2014, they realized they could make the player character switch between human and squid forms, which allowed them to come up with other ideas, such as swimming through ink or sustaining damage while maneuvering in enemy ink. From the beginning, the GamePad could display a real-time overview of the map so the player could see which team was ahead, and at some point, the team considered using urinals and sinks as warp points. The development team was determined to make interesting sound effects, so they repeatedly pounded slime to create the sound of a squid diving into ink.|$|R
40|$|As {{environmental}} awareness increases, cleaner burning fuels are desired {{for use in}} power plants. Fuels such hydrogen, methane and syngas are cleaner and leaner burning, which causes combustion instabilities. The Active Combustion Throttle (ACT) project {{is sponsored by the}} Department of Energy's National Energy Technologies Laboratory (NETL) and aspires to create a valve capable of modulating the flow of fuel administered to gas turbines by +/- 10 %. Development of such a valve will require an integrated valve and actuator design that can withstand the harsh environment of a power plant as well have a closed loop feedback control system in order to avoid combustion instabilities. In this thesis, an in-depth survey of current actuator and valve technologies revealed there are not any commercially available integrated valve assemblies capable of performing such a task. Two valve designs and one actuator design were devised to meet a list of specifications from NETL. Both valve designs as well as the actuator design underwent a rigorous battery of electromagnetic, stress, thermal, finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses using contemporary mechanical, electrical and physical theory and commercially available computer-aided design (CAD) programs. Prototype valve designs were designed, machined, cold flow tested and <b>approved</b> for further <b>prototype</b> design and testing. Initial cold flow testing revealed that both valve designs had linear ranges, were quick opening and demonstrated adequate flow coefficients (Cv). Further testing will continue to refine the valve designs in preparation for creating integrated valve/actuator assemblies for more aggressive testing. The primary contribution of this thesis are the two valve designs and actuator design that have thus far proven to be capable of fulfilling the requirements set forth by NETL for the ACT project. Further research and analyses of these designs will provide more robust prototype valve and actuator assemblies for eventual live testing at NETL. The framework provided by this thesis will allow those involved with the project to make changes to the current designs as needed since the same analyses can be more efficiently executed for subsequent changes throughout the remaining stages of development...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} prototyping {{process for}} the derivation of complex medical models is introduced. The use of medical models can support today’s medicine by improving diagnosis and surgical planning, teaching and patient information. To withstand the challenges of time and accuracy, a process for generating accurate virtual and physical medical models is needed. The introduced process offers the possibility to derive virtual and physical models for biomedical engineering applications. Reviewing the current situation of medical virtual prototyping and rapid prototyping applications, limitations were found related to the influential variables of data acquisition, data processing, virtual reality use, and rapid prototyping manufacturing. An integrated prototyping concept (MPP) is introduced for embedding virtual prototyping and rapid prototyping in biomedical applications. Data processing and 3 D modeling of complex anatomical structures from computerized image data were investigated and discussed in detail. Finally, parameter analyses were evaluated to derive optimal parameters needed for preparing 3 D models for virtual prototyping and rapid prototyping processing in medicine. Summarizing from the accuracy analysis, the present investigation {{is the first to}} examine tomographic scanning as decisive factor for inaccuracy of medical prototyping models. The human nose {{is an example of a}} complex anatomical geometry, which has been an object of scientific research interest for several years. One of the applications introduced here uses the developed MPP concept as basis for a procedure that generates animated medical models in a virtual reality environment. Although, attempts are being made to reconstruct the human nose as an experimental rapid prototyping model, a process for accurate reconstruction as a transparent rapid prototyping model is still missing. The MPP concept allows fabricating individual models of the human nose with a high level of accuracy and transparency. Finally, temporal analysis revealed major time improvements in modeling complex anatomical models compared to approaches without optimized process sequences and <b>approved</b> parameters. The <b>prototyping</b> of the human hip was the second example used. The results of this particular example emphasized the strengths of the medial prototyping process in preparing hip models for presurgery planning. Here, accuracy was enhanced considerably. Rapid prototyping hip models can provide assistance as a surgical planning tool in complex cases, especially in improving surgical results and implant stability. Thus, the accuracy and time of model generation is improved, thereby establishing a defined process for medical model generation. Considering the novel findings of broad improvements in accuracy and time, a new field of research is emerging, serving both virtual surgery applications and physical implant generation. The MPP developed in this work can be viewed as an initial approach for launching international standards of prototyping technologies in medicine...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Gıdaların uzun süreli muhafaza ihtiyacı, insanlık tarihi boyunca, bir amaç ve zorunluluk olmuştur. Bu doğrultuda uygulanan en yaygın yöntemler, kurutma, tuzla salamura yapma, konserveleme ve soğutmadır. Bütün muhafaza yöntemleri, gıdaların besin değerlerini ve kalite değerlerini en üst düzeyde tutmayı amaçlamaktadır. Ancak gıdaların gerek kurutma, gerekse salamura veya konserveleme işlemlerinde, besin değerlerinde (özellikle vitamin) meydana gelen kayıplar oldukça fazladır. Bu nedenlere bağlı olarak soğutma yöntemi bir çok gıdaya uygulanabilirlik, besin / kalite değerlerinin korunması ve uygulama kolaylığı bakımından en etkili yöntemdir. Günümüz teknolojik imkanları dahilinde en yüksek verimli soğutma sistemi dondurma / şoklama / derin dondurma teknolojisidir. Blast Freezer sistemlerine yönelik olarak günümüzde oda tipi ve buzdolabı tipi olmak üzere iki genel kullanım sınıfı bulunmaktadır. Mevcut durumda oda tipi sistemler ülkemiz genelinde de üretilebilir iken, buzdolabı tipi sistemlerin boyut ve ağırlık kriterleri nedeniyle teknik altyapısının daha zor olduğu görülmüştür. Dondurma teknolojisi ile muhafaza etmenin temel prensibi, - 18 〬C derece ve daha düşük sıcaklık değerlerinde gıdayı hızlı bir şekilde dondurarak, gıda bozulmasına sebep olabilecek mikroorganizmaların çalışma ve çoğalma faaliyetlerinin tam olarak durdurulmasıdır. Bu çalışmanın amacı Hesaplamalı Akışkanlar Dinamiği (HAD) tekniğini kullanarak Blast Freezer buzdolabında akışın kabin içerisinde hedeflenen şekilde homojen şekilde dolaşmasını ve gıda kütle merkezinin ısısını 270 dakikada 100 〬C dereceden - 18 〬C dereceye düşürülmesini sağlamaktır. Bu çalışmayı literatürdeki çalışmalardan farklı kılan özellik, şok dondurucu üzerinde deneysel ve HAD yöntemleri yardımı ile tasarımın doğrulanması ve daha verimli bir prototipin imalatıdır. Çalışmada ileriki aşamada farklı fan motorları kullanılarak alternatif incelemeler yapılmıştır. Bu analizlerin sonucunda toplam debi ve her bir fandan çıkan debi değerleri bulunmuştur. Ayrıca kabin içindeki sıcaklık dağılımları ve deneysel çalışmalarla uyumluluğu gösteren ölçüm paketlerinin sıcaklık dağılımları da sunulmuştur.   Yapılan deneyler ve bunları destekleyen analizler doğrultusunda görülmüştür ki kabin içinde sıcaklık duvarlara yaklaştıkça artmaktadır. En soğuk paketler orta şok dondurucuda bulunmuştur. Sıcaklığın hızlı şekilde çok düşük değerlere düşmesi nedeni ile üst ve alt taraflardaki sıcaklık farkı çalışmamızı etkileyen önemli bir parametredir. Ayrıca kontrol panellerini kullanmadan, uyguladığımız sınır şartları ile çekirdek sıcaklığını istediğimiz sürede - 18 C dereceye düşürülmesi mümkün kılınmıştır. Preserving {{food was}} {{historically}} one of man’s main challenges. The general methods of protection include drying, bedding in salt, conserving and freezing. All protection methods aim {{to maintain the}} content and quality of food at the highest possible level. However, drying, salting and conserving operations all result {{in the loss of}} some contents, especially the vitamins. Therefore, considering the quality and content of the food, freezing could be applied to many foods and this method is easier.   Regarding the modern technological possibilities, the highest level of quality could be achieved using freezing, blasting and deep-freezing where food is reserved safe for storage and later consumption. Blast freezing  is commonly used in food catering and recently, in preparation of 'instant' foods, as it ensures the safety {{and the quality of the}} food product. A blast freezer is an appliance which reduces the core temperature of a cooked food from 100 ° C to - 18 ° C in 270 minutes using 3 powerful fans and a cooling unit.   The main principle of using the freezing method is to freeze food in  - 18 ° C and to quickly  reduce the core temperature. This research aims to use the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) methods to reduce the temperature from 100 ° C to  - 18 ° C in 270 minutes so that activity and growth of microorganisms may be prevented which causes rinsing of the food. In the present research, the model is designed in Solidworks CAD (Computer Aided Design)  program, then analyzed in Ansys Fluent CFD program. The present research differs from the previous research work and literature mainly by  finding a relation between the CFD and the experimental results which led to manufacturing of an improved prototype. The air supply system is modelled as a closed-loop system while in former studies mass flow rates were given as boundary conditions. However, in this study the air supply system is completely modeled so that mass flow rates could be investigated numerically as well. Furthermore the CFD analysis was validated with experimental studies.   The layout of the thesis is roughly as follows. First and second chapters include literature review in which existing refrigerator analysis, principles, food placement and CFD modeling of fan and cooling units are presented. Third chapter encompasses presenting the purchased refrigerator, testing environment, equipment and data logger. In the next step, a numerical model was generated and transferred from CAD to CFD environment and analyzed in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, production line and prototype are presented in brief. Finally, the results are presented in the sixth chapter.    In this thesis work, Unilab commercial program is utilized to select evaporator and condenser. Mesh generation using  Moving Reference Frame (MRF) method for modeling of the fan and the experimental approach of this study are based on the similar research and literature. In experiments, the model was installed in a laboratory test room. The packages were placed in the Blast freezer in 14 1 / 1 GN trays. Then, the space between back of the model and rear wall of test room was adjusted to be 500 mm, as well as at least 1500 mm for space between sides of the refrigerator and side walls. The test was commenced at fixed 35 〬C as ambient temperature. A package of 1 kg was placed in each tray. In total there were 14 packages weighting 14 kg. During a 240 -minute period the temperature of packages were recorded simultaneously utilizing 14 sensors. During the experiments, core temperature of packages were recorded during a 4 -hour process using data logger. The laboratory is conditioned to ensure the ambient temperature and relative humidity with respect to the tropical environment standards.   For CFD, simplified CAD design of Blast freezer was exported to Ansys and was meshed using a number of meshing methods. In Fluent software, obtained meshed file was imported and boundary conditions were applied. The material specifications of air as a coolant and polyurethane as insulation material were applied in the CFD program.   Consequently, pressure based k-εturbulence model was used to solve for the Navier-Stokes and energy equations. Then the airflow analysis and both airflow and temperature analysis were obtained for empty and full Blast freezer respectively.   The research is carried out using different fan motors. Upon conclusion, the sum total debit (mass flow)  and the debit of each fan is given. In addition to debit, temperature distribution in the cabin and in measuring packs and its agreement with other experiments is presented. Based on experiments and analyses, the temperature in the cabin increase as we approach the walls. The effect of weight of cooling air can be neglected due to the high speed of the exiting stream from fans. These fans also avoid downeard movement of cold stream.   In terms of air circulation, the model refrigerator can be divided into three parts: The first part is affected by upper fan. Second part is under the influence of middle fan and the last part is affected by the bottom fan. The research shows that air stream is more dense in middle zone. The reason relates to the fact that one side of the upper and bottom fans are closed; while for the middle fan both sides are open and this leads to stream of more air and cooling middle pockets. Because of the decrease of temperature to very low levels, the difference of temperature in upper and lower parts will not influence our research. Moreover, without using the control system, - 18 ° C could be achieved until we use the boundary conditions for obtaining the core temperature. Validated from the computational analysis and the experimental studies, it is seen that the coolest packages are found to be in the middle regions while the warmest ones are in the upper and lower regions. The highest mass flow rates are at the fan outlet and the lowest rates are found at the fan inlet.   The maximum velocity of 31. 123 and 26. 91 m/s were obtained for empty and full refrigerator respectively. Core temperature reduction in CFD and experimental model were agreeable. The average difference was 0. 694 ° C which is a negligible value and it implies the CFD model is valid. Therefore the prototype production is carried out with the respect to the CFD solutions.   After the prototype was manufactured, some tests according to the EN 16825 have been performed and it is <b>approved</b> that the <b>prototype</b> complied with the performance requirements. Then, this Blast freezer is presented to the market. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
