I had started their laboratory and developed their plastic appliances for make-up. But my salary was $25 a week. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> union card." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by actor Bill Fagerbakke, who also does the voices of numerous other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea what was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." ...|$|E

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov socialized and {{discussed}} music {{with the other}} members of The Five; they critiqued one another's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with Alexander Borodin, whose music [...] "astonished" [...] him. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers' works, with preferred tastes running [...] "toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven's late quartets". Mendelssohn was not thought of highly, Mozart and Haydn [...] "were considered out of date and na√Øve", and J.S. Bach merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz [...] "was highly esteemed", Liszt [...] "crippled and perverted from a musical point of view... even a caricature", and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov [...] "listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination". Often, the musical works in question [...] "were played before me only in fragments, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea of the whole work". This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them [...] "as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth".|$|E
500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea what was in store there {{in terms of the}} remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
500|$|After she {{received}} Billboards Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium in 2000, Carey parted from Columbia Records {{and signed a}} record-breaking $100million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records America America (EMI). She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Tommy Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Just a few months later, in July, 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown, and her relationship with the Latin icon Luis Miguel ended. In an interview the following year, she said, [...] "I was with people who didn't really know me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> personal assistant. I'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that." [...] Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings. On July19,2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble. While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention.|$|E

2500|$|Dungan {{announced}} his retirement from baseball in January 1906 at age 39. Dungan later recalled: [...] "I was fed up on baseball although I had {{one of my best}} years in 1905.

Therefore, I had to continue the play and finish it myself." [...] He later complimented the fair play of the English team, saying, [...] "I don't think I could have done it against any other team because they all used to knock you down; they are probably the noblest in the world".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom {{left the}} bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong."

2500|$|... "I do not regret {{trying to}} get the message out to {{corporate}} America about unfair pricing and restrictive trade practices. That was the impetus for doing what I did; that's the reason I jammed HBO; that's the reason I sent them a polite message. What I do regret is that I was young and fairly na√Øve in the ways of the media. I didn't grasp the fact that no one understood my motives and that everyone would make assumptions. Had I known that up front I would have been much more fervent in explaining my motivations. I had no animus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> malice in my heart." ...|$|E

[...] "After that, I figured out the new ownership was no different than Ballard, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> use for it," [...] Keon later said.

2500|$|Reflecting on his {{decision}} to retire years later, Richardson remarked [...] "I resigned and retired because I was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, I was burnt out {{and it was a}} struggle to continue playing cricket.

2500|$|Guide Anatoli Boukreev's {{decision}} not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote The Climb) state that using bottled oxygen gives {{a false sense of}} security. Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend. They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams, but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in The Climb, [...] "For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> problems with that." ...|$|E

I was here in 1996 during Operation Grapes of Wrath. I was four at the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> concept that it was war," [...] Keynes told a reporter. [...] "I remember when the gravity of the situation dawned on me. It was during the 2006 July war, I was 14 then‚Ä¶ but it didn't really shake my view of Lebanon as effectively a second home, a place where I come to and I have family."

2500|$|Zilch bassist Paul Raven said [...] "I saw him a {{few days}} before he passed away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{indication}} from him that anything was wrong other than that he was exhausted", but commented that hide was [...] "under a lot of stress", due to the recording schedule for the Ja, Zoo album. He went on to question the ultimate degree of hide's involvement in the finished record, remarking that only three songs had been completed before he died. However, hide's brother and manager stated in his 2010 book that six songs were completed by the time of his death. This is supported by the fact that I.N.A is credited with additional arrangement on four of the album's ten tracks.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 October 2008, Brigadier general Mamuka Kurashvili, a Georgian MoD official, {{testified before}} the {{parliamentary}} commission studying the Russo-Georgian war and said that his remarks on the launch of military operations on August 7, describing it as an effort [...] "to restore constitutional order," [...] were not authorized by superiors and were [...] "impulsive." [...] Kurashvili's interview with a Georgian TV on 7 August was the first statement made by a Georgian official indicating that Tbilisi had launched an operation against the breakaway region. [...] "It [...] was not agreed with anybody <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> instruction from anybody ," [...] Kurashvili told the commission. He added that [...] "I had just come out from the battle when a journalist approached me... I was confused."
