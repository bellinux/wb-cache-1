5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Mawson and Mertz's {{illnesses}} remains {{in part a}} mystery. At the time, McLean—the expedition's chief surgeon {{and one of the}} men who had remained at Cape Denison—attributed their sickness to colitis; Mawson wrote in The Home of the Blizzard, his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and appendicitis. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A.

Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having such problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of polymeric computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing CAD/CAM materials on antagonistic primary tooth wear. Five CAD/CAM polymeric materials were examined: Vipi Block Monocolor (VBM), Yamahachi polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (YAP), Mazic Duro (MZD), Vita Enamic (ENA), and Pekkton (PEK). All of the specimens were tested in a thermomechanical loading machine with the primary canine as the antagonist (50 N, 1. 2 × 105 cycles, 1. 7 Hz, 5 / 55 °C). The wear losses of the antagonist tooth and the restorative materials were calculated using reverse modelling software and an electronic scale. VBM and ENA showed significantly higher antagonist tooth wear than PEK (p 0. 05). PEK showed the largest value in both material volumetric <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> <b>losses.</b> In terms of material volumetric losses, there was no significant difference between all of the groups (p > 0. 05). In terms of material <b>weight</b> <b>losses,</b> PEK was significantly larger than ENA (p 0. 05). Volumetric <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> <b>losses</b> of materials showed similar wear behaviour. However, the wear patterns of antagonists and materials were different, especially in PEK...|$|R

40|$|Normalization of resting energy {{expenditure}} (REE) for body composition using the 2 -compartment model (fat mass, FM and fat-free mass, FFM) has inherent limitations for {{the interpretation of}} REE and may lead to erroneous conclusions when comparing people {{with a wide range}} of adiposity as well as before <b>and</b> after substantial <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> We compared different methods of REE normalization: (i) for FFM and FM (ii) by the inclusion of %FM as a measure of adiposity and (iii) based on organ and tissue masses. Results were compared between healthy subjects with different degrees of adiposity as well as within subject before <b>and</b> after <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Normalizing REE from an REE vs. FFM and FM equation that (i) was derived in obese participants and applied to lean people or (ii) was derived before <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> applied after <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> leads to the erroneous conclusion of a lower metabolic rate (i) in lean persons <b>and</b> (ii) after <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> This is revealed by the normalization of REE for organ and tissue masses that was not significantly different between lean and obese or between baseline <b>and</b> after <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> There is evidence for an increasing specific metabolic rate of FFM with increasing %FM that could be explained by a higher contribution of liver, kidney and heart mass to FFM in obesity. Using REE vs. FFM and FM equations specific for different levels of adiposity (% fat mass) eliminated differences in REE before <b>and</b> after <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> in women. In conclusion, the most established method for normalization of REE based on FFM and FM may lead to spurious conclusions about metabolic rate in obesity and the phenomenon of weight loss-associated adaptive thermogenesis. Using % fat mass-specific REE prediction from FFM and FM in kg may improve the normalization of REE when subjects with wide differences in % fat mass are investigated...|$|R

Methods: 634 women with obesity, consecutively enrolled in <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> programmes, were included in the study. <b>Weight</b> <b>loss</b> goals were evaluated with the Goals <b>and</b> Relative <b>Weights</b> Questionnaire (GRWQ), reporting a sequence of unrealistic (‘dream' and ‘happy') and more realistic (‘acceptable' <b>and</b> ‘disappointing') <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> goals. Attrition was assessed at 12 months on the basis of patients' medical records. Results: At 12 months, 205 / 634 patients (32. 3 %) had interrupted their programme and were lost to follow-up. After adjustment for age, baseline <b>weight,</b> education <b>and</b> employment status, attrition was significantly associated with higher percent acceptable <b>and</b> disappointing <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> targets, not with dream <b>and</b> happy <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Conclusion: In ‘real world' clinical settings, only realistic expectations might favour attrition whenever too challenging, whereas unrealistic <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> goals have no effect. Future studies should assess the effect of interventions aimed at coping with too challenging weight goals on attrition...|$|R
