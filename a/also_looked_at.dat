5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Aviation Research Centre (ARC) is {{interested}} in acquiring four V-22 Ospreys for personnel evacuation in hostile conditions, logistic supplies, and deployment of the Special Frontier Force (SFF) in border areas. India had seen the Osprey perform in relief operations of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Elements of the Indian Navy have <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the V-22 rather than the E-2D for Airborne early warning and control to replace the short-range Kamov Ka-31. India {{is interested}} in purchasing six attack version V-22s for rapid troop insertion in border areas.|$|E

25|$|The Committee {{called as}} {{witnesses}} {{all the parties}} it considered relevant to its deliberations.

25|$|While Oliphant's group {{struggled}} {{to raise the}} power of their klystrons, they <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> alternate arrangements of the device. Two researchers in the team, John Randall and Harry Boot, had been given the task of making one such adaptation, but it quickly became clear it did not help matters. They were left with little to do and decided to consider alternative approaches to the problem.|$|E
25|$|During later {{planning}} phases {{the county}} <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the possibility for}} the line {{to be built in}} such a way that it at a later date could be converted to a tramway and connected to the Oslo Tramway. The alternative gave a large hike in the investment costs, while it provided no advantages during the initial operating phase. The structure's width and visual profile would increase and of these reasons the alternative was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{pioneering}} {{work in the}} field was made by Josiah William Russell in his 1948 British Medieval Population. Russell looked at inquisitions post mortem (IPMs) taken by the crown to assess the wealth of the greatest landowners after their death to assess the mortality caused by the Black Death, and from this arrived at an estimate of 23.6% of the entire population. He <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> episcopal registers for the death toll among the clergy, where the result was between 30–40%. Russell believed the clergy was at particular risk of contagion, and eventually concluded with a low mortality level of only 20%.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, while Sweden was {{deciding}} on its stance toward nuclear weapons, Swedish representatives, through their {{contacts with the}} American Department of Defense gained access to some secret information in the late 1960s. This information included nuclear weapons tactics, reconnaissance requirements, ideas regarding the necessity of quick decision-making, and nuclear physics data. Swedish representatives <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the MGR-1 Honest John weapons system that could utilize W7 or W31 nuclear warheads. For artillery purposes, the US developed a W48 projectile for 155mm artillery with 0.072 kiloton effect. Any plans for such a small Swedish nuclear device have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|The Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine's {{survey of}} more than 700 American schools ranked UIC's {{entrepreneurship}} program 9th (undergraduate) and 12th (graduate). In 2008 US News & World Report ranked UIC's undergraduate business program 58th and the undergraduate engineering program 57th in the United States. US News & World Report also ranked UIC's part-time MBA 24th out of over 300 programs nationally and the graduate finance program 19th; undergraduate program rankings were accounting (28th) and finance (17th in 2010). In 2010 Princeton Review ranked UIC in the top 50 undergraduate game design programs of 700 universities in the US and Canada. Criteria included the quality of the curriculum, faculty, facilities and infrastructure. The Princeton Review <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> data on scholarships, financial aid and career opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Plans for a {{light rail}} to Fornebu were first {{launched}} in 1919, {{but at the time}} there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line. A 1986 report from said agency <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale development of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established.|$|E

25|$|When {{developing}} EastEnders, both Smith and Holland {{looked at}} influential models like Coronation Street, {{but they found}} that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after EastEnders began, and featured the characters of Tony Carpenter and Kelvin Carpenter, did Coronation Street start to feature black characters, for example. They {{came to the conclusion}} that Coronation Street had grown old with its audience, and that EastEnders would have to attract a younger, more socially extensive audience, ensuring that it had the longevity to retain it for many years thereafter. They <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Brookside but found there was a lack of central meeting points for the characters, making it difficult for the writers to intertwine different storylines, so EastEnders was set in Albert Square.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} the rate of uninsured people in the US. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being {{conducted}} a survey {{and found that the}} uninsured rate is going down. 13 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (3 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of {{the report}} was {{dedicated}} to the navigational aids at Fornebu. The report underlined that false signals from the radio beacon were an important underlying cause. It noted that the beacon for runway 01 interfered with that for 06 and that up to three false signals could be transmitted. The commission recommended airlines enforce routines which ensured that multiple systems for determining position and bearing always be used, as a single system would never be reliable. It also recommended an extra radio beacon be installed in Drammen to aid approach to runway 06 and that airlines in the meantime not rely solely on radio beacons during approach to 06. The report <b>also</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the work-flow at the air traffic control. The airport had a radar system installed, but this was used solely for monitoring traffic and was not seen as a navigational aid. The commission commented that air traffic control could have prevented the accident had it recognized that the aircraft was on the wrong path and alerted the pilots. Sufficient equipment was installed, {{but there were no}} instructions for such activity.|$|E
