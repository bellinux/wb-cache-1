40|$|Warm mix asphalt (WMA) is an {{emerging}} technology that can allow asphalt {{to be produced}} and compacted at a significantly lower temperature. Several new processes {{have been developed to}} reduce the mixing and compacting temperatures without scarifying the quality of resulting pavement. One of the processes is by adding chemical additives in the mix. The additives added with the aggregates improve the compactibility of the mixture and reduces the rutting potential of the pavement. WMA offers many significant advantages such as energy saving, decreased emission and fumes, decrease binder aging and extend paving season into the cold-winter months and at places located at high altitudes. One of the WMA processes utilizes Sasobit®, a synthetic long chain Fischer-Tropsch wax. Sasobit ® can be blended with the binder at a terminal or in the <b>asphalt</b> <b>tank.</b> Sasobit ® was shown to improve the compactability of mixtures and overall reduction in air voids. The addition of Sasobit ® increases the rutting potential of asphalt mix. The rutting potential will increase with decreasing mixing and compaction temperatures. In this thesis warm mix asphalt is designed for Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) of grade 2 with the addition of Sasobit ® and test for compactability characteristics and property of asphalt mixture against deformation are carried out...|$|E

40|$|The great {{generation}} of urban solid {{has been a}} concern in several countries. This work presents a study with two materials: the asphalt binder oil residue accumulated {{in the bottom of}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>tanks</b> and the municipal solid waste ash, to be used, respectively, as a substitute of conventional binder in asphalt mi-xtures and for soil stabilization in pavements base layers. Were evaluated properties as the mechanical behavior of the mixtures through experimental tests. The results show the potential of incorporating these residues for low traffic roads, allowing the construction of low cost roads and an environmental use of the residue. Asphalt Binder Oil Residue All operations in the petroleum industry ge-nerate a great number of oily residues. The refi-neries are responsible for most of such residues. Some products are accumulated {{in the bottom of the}} oil tanks. The residue studied is basically com-posed of emulsions of heavy oil, water and solids...|$|R
25|$|Selenizza {{is mainly}} {{used as an}} {{additive}} in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot <b>asphalt</b> in <b>tanks,</b> but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for {{the oil and gas}} industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the mine}} is {{predominantly}} exploited {{in an open}} pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a methodology to theoretically assess the effectiveness of structural BMPs with regard to their treatment of selected stormwater pollutants (metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and erbicides). The result is a prioritisation, in terms of pollutant removal efficiency, of 15 different BMPs which can inform stormwater managers and other stakeholders of the best available options for the treatment of urban runoff pollutants of particular environmental concern. Regardless of the selected pollutant, infiltration basins and sub-surface flow constructed wetlands are predicted to perform most efficiently with lagoons, porous <b>asphalt</b> and sedimentation <b>tanks</b> being the least effective systems for the removal of pollutants. The limitations of the approach in terms of the variabilities in BMP designs and applications are considered...|$|R
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Mantenimiento Industrial). Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Electromecánica, 2015. This {{work was}} {{realized}} in Refinería Costarricense de Petróleo (RECOPE), {{specifically in the}} department of “Programación y Control de mantenimiento” {{it is based on the}} Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) this methodology is used to define preventive maintenance manuals for the pumping equipment of Off Site area, with the main objective to improve the operational reliability and availability of these equipment. Off Site area has a main function to perform all the movements of petroleum products to the sales department, circulation between <b>tanks,</b> <b>asphalt</b> discharge, and dosage of dyes. Products like asphalt are constantly recirculated, since their chemical and physical composition should not be stored without movement or at room temperature, the pumps responsible for these movements are within the area Off Site as well as petrol pumps, diesel, bunker, naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, dyes, IFO's and gasoline plane. In the area of Off Site, currently there are about 80 pumping equipment, including centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, electric motors, combustion engines, speed reducers and steam turbines. Initially work orders of the first half of 2014 were analyzed in order to know which equipment had more problems and required more maintenance later criticality analysis is performed to determine the equipment they must first be included in the analysis. The selection of equipment to study was made based on the criticality analysis, however subsequently obtained maintenance plans for such equipment were evaluated and applied to other equipment Off Site As it’s required by RCM methodology this analysis was reviewed and discussed with members of the working group, for it was discussed with staff maintenance workshops the probability of occurrence of each failure mode and proactive actions generated and their respective application frequencies. The work includes technical specifications for critical equipment and preventive maintenance plan, with details of the inspections carried out by maintenance personnel also detail areas for improvement including training of technicians.
