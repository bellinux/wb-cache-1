25|$|TC/EA {{method is}} quick with a {{relatively}} high precision (~ 1‰). It was limited to solid samples, however, liquid sample recently can also be measured in TC/EA-IRMS system by adapting an <b>autosampler</b> for liquids. The drawback of TC/EA is the relatively big sample size (~ mg), which is smaller than offline combustion/reduction but larger than GC/pyrolysis. It cannot separate different compounds as GC/pyrolysis does and thus only the average for the whole sample can be provided, {{which is also a}} drawback for some research.|$|E

40|$|For {{investigations}} of metalloproteins by speciation analysis, {{the integrity of}} the protein metal complexes before and during separation is crucial. Knowledge about potential alterations of the samples is thus essential to avoid misinterpretations of the analytical results. Chromatographic element profiles of different cytosolic samples from animal tissues were measured repeatedly to estimate the sample stability. The dependence of the signals on the dwell time of the sample in an <b>autosampling</b> device at 4 C for a period of 10 h was observed. Alterations in the element content of different metal containing fractions were quantified by means of recovery values. Some metalloprotein fractions e. g. amp; 8776; 27 kDa arsenic, amp; 8776; 27 kDa iron and different zinc fractions were stable or only minor alterations were observed and for their investigation an <b>autosampling</b> device is therefore suitable. However, most of the other metalloprotein fractions, especially nickel containing proteins, showed major alterations these samples should therefore be analysed immediately after preparation or directly after thawin...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the activities of}} a project initiated in September 2001 {{for the development of}} tools for the combinatorial analysis of materials with respect to the photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen. As this project is just beginning the majority of the initial effort has been in developing prototype analysis modules and assembling the necessary optical, electrochemistry, sampling and analysis equipment. The prototypes for the photoelectrochemical analysis of materials, has been divided into a module for the analysis of nano-particulate suspensions and for monoliths. In the case of the powder suspensions each photolysis cell contains a micropressure transducer and a sampling port for collection of headspace gas for GC analysis. The signal from the micropressure transducer will initiate the <b>autosampling</b> of the headspace gas by an in house modified Gilsen sample handler. In the case of the monolith samples a design that incorporates the ability to make an ohmic contact and hence monitor electrochemical response of the sample has been developed.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the condition of indoor pollution based on poisons, several pesticides, insecticides, antiseptics sold on the market were tested about each air pollution in a living room. Eighteen kinds of chemical poisons were classified halogenated organics, phosphorus organic sand pyrethloides, and the latter of which was now most used. Experiments were carried out by measuring the pollutants generated in time using each pesticide. <b>Autosampling</b> system was applied to obtain the relation between concentration level and time. As the result of this. the facts as follows were clarified. 1 ）Concentration level measured were 100 μg/m 3 to 0. 01 pg/μg,, and it was noteworthy that high level as 10 ～ 100 μg/m 3 continued to above 6 ～ 12 hours. On the other hand, low level below 1 μg/m 3 were long continued for many days. 2 ）Pesticides once scattered and adsorbed on the wall or the tatami mat had been vaporizing during it was staying there. 3) Two types of pollution were observed; One was the spray type which showed first high concentration and then decreasing, and the other was the powder or the tablet type which showed a constant concentration level and no decreasing. 4 ） It was considered that a kind of defective building and house, which is ill ventilated different from the usual Japanese one, is now popularizing.

40|$|Recent {{research}} in groundwater-dominated streams indicates that organic matter {{plays an important}} role in nutrient transformations at the surface-groundwater interface known as the hyporheic zone. Mixing of water and nutrient fluxes in the hyporheic zone controls in-stream nutrients availability, dynamics and export to downstream reaches. In particular, benthic sediments can form adsorptive sinks for organic matter and reactive nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) that sustain a variety of hyporheic processes e. g. denitrification, microbial uptake. Thus, hyporheic metabolism can have an important effect on both quantity (concentration) and quality (labile vs. refractory character) of organic matter. Here high-frequency nutrient monitoring combined with spectroscopic analysis was used to provide insights into biogeochemical processing of a small, agricultural stream in the NE England subject to diffuse nutrient pollution. Biogeochemical data were collected hourly for a week at baseflow conditions when in-stream-hyporheic nutrient dynamics have the greatest impact on stream health. In-stream nutrients (total phosphorus, reactive phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen) and water quality parameters (turbidity, specific conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, redox potential) were measured in situ hourly by an automated bank-side laboratory. Concurrent hourly <b>autosamples</b> were retrieved daily and analysed for nutrients and fine sediments including spectroscopic analyses of dissolved organic matter - excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorbance spectroscopy. Our results show that organic matter can potentially be utilised as a natural, environmental tracer of the biogeochemical processes occurring at the surface-groundwater interface in streams. High-frequency spectroscopic characterisation of in-stream organic matter can provide useful quantitative and qualitative information on fluxes of reactive nutrients in streams with extensive hyporheic zone...|$|R

50|$|The {{high cost}} of many {{laboratory}} robots has inhibited their adoption. However, currently there are many robotic devices that have very low cost, and these could be employed to do some jobs in a laboratory.

Alternatively, the <b>autosampler</b> of a device {{can be used with}} another device, thus avoiding the need for purchasing a different <b>autosampler</b> or hiring a technician for doing the job. The key aspects to achieve low-cost in laboratory robotics are 1) the use of low-cost robots, which become more and more common, and 2) the use of scripting, which enables compatibility between robots and other analytical equipment.|$|E

50|$|For most {{clinical}} methods using ICP-MS, {{there is}} a relatively simple and quick sample prep process. The main component to the sample is an internal standard, which also serves as the diluent. This internal standard consists primarily of deionized water, with nitric or hydrochloric acid, and Indium and/or Gallium. Depending on the sample type, usually 5 ml of the internal standard is added to a test tube along with 10-500 microliters of sample. This mixture is then vortexed for several seconds or until mixed well and then loaded onto the <b>autosampler</b> tray.For other applications that may involve very viscous samples or samples that have particulate matter, {{a process known as}} sample digestion may have to be carried out, before it can be pipetted and analyzed. This adds an extra first step to the above process, and therefore makes the sample prep more lengthy.|$|E
50|$|A {{sample is}} introduced, either {{manually}} or with an <b>autosampler,</b> into a sample loop of known volume. A buffered aqueous solution {{known as the}} mobile phase carries the sample from the loop onto a column that contains some form of stationary phase material. This is typically a resin or gel matrix consisting of agarose or cellulose beads with covalently bonded charged functional groups. Equilibration of the stationary phase is {{needed in order to}} obtain the desired charge of the column. If the column is not properly equilibrated the desired molecule may not bind strongly to the column. The target analytes (anions or cations) are retained on the stationary phase but can be eluted by increasing the concentration of a similarly charged species that displaces the analyte ions from the stationary phase. For example, in cation exchange chromatography, the positively charged analyte can be displaced by adding positively charged sodium ions. The analytes of interest must then be detected by some means, typically by conductivity or UV/visible light absorbance.|$|E
