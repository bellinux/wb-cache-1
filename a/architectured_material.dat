In addition, considerable effort {{has been devoted to}} extending the mesoporous family to transition metal oxides due to their potential applications ranging from catalysts, absorbents, and gas sensors to energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. Meso-structured transition metal oxides are expected to be an ideal solid-pore <b>architectured</b> <b>material</b> for energy storage devices because of their remarkably large internal surface area, narrow pore size distribution and thin wall thickness. Mesoporous structure provide a large surface area for a large number of reaction sites...|$|E
40|$|A {{sandwich}} panel {{based on a}} multiscale <b>architectured</b> <b>material</b> is developed for structural and EM absorption performances. At the nanoscale level, carbon nanotubes are dispersed in a polymer to obtain a conductive material. This composite is then foamed into a micro porous solid to improve EM absorption and to decrease the density. The foam is inserted in a millimeter scale hexagonal metallic honeycomb lattice. The combination of the metallic honeycomb and the polymeric foam provides high bending, impact and crushing performances and a moderate thermal conductivity. This hybrid is used as core for {{sandwich panel}}s, produced {{by the addition of}} two EM transparent face-sheets made of glass fiber reinforced polymers. EM absorption around 90 % is achieved in the 10 - 40 GHz frequency band with a 8. 8 mm thick sandwich panel...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{current work}} {{is an attempt}} of {{experimental}} study of higher-order behaviors. It comes from the noticing that such behaviors are up to now nearly exclusively studied from a theoretical and numerical point of view. Materials with coarse inner architecture can easily be design with modern production process (3 D printing, 2 D and 3 D corrugation). The question of the actual behavior of those architectured media rises. Do they behave like classical elastic continua, or do they exhibit extraneous higher-order effects ? Further, if present are those effects stable with respect to imperfections (geometry, constitutive material [...] .). In the present study a non-centro symmetric sample has been process. The geometrical anisotropy of the elementary cell has been chosen in order to detect strain-gradient effect. Samples are obtained by 3 D printing and are representative of industrial honeycombs used for aeronautic/aerospace composite material. To that aim, simple experiments based on load controlled tests with full-field kinematic measurement have been designed. The distributed load control reveals that the <b>architectured</b> <b>material</b> behave as an effective genuine strain-gradient materia...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWave {{propagation}} in architectured materials, or {{materials with}} microstructure, {{is known to}} be dependent on the ratio between the wavelength and a characteristic size of the microstructure. Indeed, when this ratio decreases (i. e. when the wavelength approaches this characteristic size) important quantities, such as phase and group velocity, deviate considerably from their low frequency/long wavelength values. This well-known phenomenon is called dispersion of waves. Objective of this work is to show that strain-gradient elasticity can be used to quantitatively describe the behaviour of a microstructured solid, and that the validity domain (in terms of frequency and wavelength) of this model is sufficiently large to be useful in practical applications. To this end, the parameters of the overall continuum are identified for a periodic <b>architectured</b> <b>material,</b> and the results of a transient problem are compared to those obtained from a finite element full field computation on the real geometry. The quality of the overall description using a strain-gradient elastic continuum is compared to the classical homogenization procedure that uses Cauchy continuum. The extended model of elasticity is shown to provide a good approximation of the real solution over a wider frequency range...|$|E
40|$|Two {{dimensional}} (2 D) nanomaterials {{with high}} gravimetric capacity and rate capability {{are a key}} strategy for the anode of a Li-ion battery, but they still pose a challenge for Li-ion storage due to limited conductivity and an inability to alleviate the volume change upon lithiation and delithiation. In this paper, we report {{the construction of a}} 3 D architecture anode consisting of exfoliated 2 D layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (CN-rGO) by hydrothermal synthesis. First, bulk g-C 3 N 4 is converted to nanosheets to increase the edge density of the inert basal planes since the edges act as active Li-storage sites. This unique 3 D architecture, which consists of ultrathin g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets sandwiched between conductive rGO networks, exhibits a capacity of 970 mA h g 1 after 300 cycles, which is 15 fold higher than the bulk g-C 3 N 4. The tuning of the intrinsic structural properties of bulk g-C 3 N 4 by this simple bottom-up synthesis has rendered a 3 D <b>architectured</b> <b>material</b> (CN-rGO) as an effective negative electrode for high energy storage applications...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue is an {{important}} mode of failure in mechanical engineering and accounting for {{it as soon as}} the early stage of design using topology optimization sounds primordial. Structures undergoing high-cycle fatigue can be described by the stress-based approach and then a stress-based topology optimization framework, which has received great interest since almost 20 years because of the innovative designs that can be achieved to answer strength requirements, can be used. Literature reports many good results for shape optimization [Mrzyglod & Zielinsky(2006) ] whereas in the eld of topology optimization several authors have shown that considering fatigue in an optimization framework leads to more relevant solutions where fluctuating loads are involved [Holmberg E. (2015), Collet et al(2016), Sv ard(2015) ]. The good behaviour of the implementation of an advanced fatigue criterion, i. e. the multiaxial Dang Van criterion [Dang Van et al(1989) ] is first investigated in the framework of a density-based topology optimization problem. The choice of this fatigue criterion is justifed by its good applicability in automotive or aeronautic industry as well as its relevancy with respect to experimental results. We present the sensitivity analysis with stress constraints and present some classical benchmarks to illustrate the behaviour of the optimized solution. In a second time, the fatigue resistance is introduced in the well-known microstructural design [Sigmund (2000) ] also know as <b>architectured</b> <b>material</b> design which are now considered in mechanical engineering because of their manufacturability thanks to additive manufacturing processes. Ensuring the fatigue resistance of the cellular material will by extension ensure the structural integrity of the overall structure itself. The optimization is performed by using the MMA optimizer [Svanberg(1987) ] whereas the singularity phenomenon of the stress constraints is circumvented by using the qp-relaxation [Bruggi(2008) ]. Both types of optimization framework are evaluated in term of their numerical performances and are compared to classical results generated by a regular stress-based topology optimization. Finally, the results are 3 D-printed to assess for their manufacturability...|$|E
