50|$|The first {{synthesis}} of thiosulfinates {{was reported in}} 1947 by Cavallito and coworkers by oxidation of the corresponding disulfides. One example of a moderately stable thiosulfinate is the tert-butyl derivative, (CH3)3CS(O)SC(CH3)3. This thiosulfinate can be obtained in optical purity by catalytic <b>asymmetric</b> <b>oxidation</b> of di-tert-butyl disulfide with hydrogen peroxide. Upon heating, (CH3)3CS(O)SC(CH3)3 decomposes into tert-butanethiosulfoxylic acid (CH3)3CSSOH) as shown by trapping studies. In a similar manner racemic methyl methanethiosulfinate (CH3S(O)SCH3) {{can be obtained by}} peracetic acid oxidation of dimethyl disulfide. Methyl methanethiosulfinate decomposes thermally giving methanesulfenic acid (CH3SOH), the simplest sulfenic acid, as well as thioformaldehyde (CH2=S). Methyl methanethiosulfinate can also disproportionate to a 1:1 mixture of dimethyl disulfide and methyl methanethiosulfonate (CH3SO2SCH3) and rearrange via a Pummerer rearrangement to CH3S(O)CH2SSCH3). An unusual three-membered ring thiosulfinate (a dithiirane 1-oxide) has been prepared through rearrangement of a 1,3-dithietane. A related compound, 3-(9-triptycyl)dithiirane 1-oxide, was prepared by the reaction of (9-triptycyl)diazomethane and S8O. The X-ray structure of the dithiirane 1-oxide reveals a significantly lengthened sulfur-sulfur bond (2.119(3)Å). Thiosulfinates have also been invoked as intermediates in the oxidation of thiols to sulfonic acids.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{demonstrate}} the coordination of oxygen regarding the hemophore HasApf expressed by Escherichia coli cells, which appears to create an unlikely oxygen-activating system in HasA due to the already-coordinated iron. In the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>oxidation</b> of rac- 1 -(6 -methoxynaphthalen- 2 -yl) ethanol (rac- 1) using dissolved oxygen, the signals at g-values of 2. 8, 2. 22, and 1. 72 in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra disappeared {{in conjunction with the}} promotion of oxoferric (FeIII−O–O−) species in the distal site. These results suggest that the iron of porphyrin/Fe may be oxidized in water, leading to exhibition of greater <b>asymmetric</b> <b>oxidation</b> activity in the promotion of oxoferryl (FeIV=O) species. A ketone (~ 50 % chemical yield) produced from (R) -(−) -sec-alcohol can be desymmetrized by NaBH 4 in aqueous medium at 40 °C (> 99 % enantiomer excess, ee, > 90 % chemical yield) in the absence of NAD(P). Therefore, HasA can be regenerated via successive asymmetric catalytic events through an incorporated iron electron-transfer system in the presence of oxygen: FeII + O 2 → FeIII−O–O− → FeIV=O (oxidizing rac- 1) → FeII + H 2 O. This process is similar to a Fenton reaction.
