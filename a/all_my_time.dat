5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved a}} very {{suitable}} and happy connexion, my wife {{being a woman}} of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to give <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> to the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station.|$|E
25|$|Harold Le Druillenec, {{brother of}} Louisa May Gould, {{was arrested on}} 5 June 1944 for trying to help an escaped Russian {{prisoner}} of war and having a radio, his sentence took him to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp for ten months {{and he was the}} only British survivor from that camp. He commented that: <b>All</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> here was spent in heaving dead bodies into the mass graves kindly dug for us by 'outside workers' for we no longer had the strength for that type of work which, fortunately, must have been observed by the camp authorities. Jungle law reigned among the prisoners; at night you killed or were killed; by day cannibalism was rampant.|$|E

500|$|Filming lasted 138 days, {{during which}} Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, {{three times the}} average for a Hollywood film. The {{locations}} were in and around Los Angeles, including most notably: The Promenade Towers, Melrose Avenue, St. Brendan's Catholic Church, and Michael Heizer's public art sculpture [...] Sets were also built in Century City. Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets. The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in Wilmington, California, while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters. Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA. Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his subsequent, less complex film Panic Room: [...] "I felt like I was spending <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{made his}} West Brom debut in a 4–0 home defeat to Manchester City on 10 March 1956. In 1957–58, {{he was the}} club's top league goalscorer; his tally of 24 goals {{included}} four in a 5–1 win against Burnley. Often playing as a midfielder, {{he went on to}} play 257 matches and score 61 goals for West Brom, and he captained the team for the 1960–61 and 1961–62 seasons. However, in August 1962, he returned to Fulham after a disagreement with West Brom vice-chairman Jim Gaunt over his salary. The ongoing dispute over both minimum and maximum wages in the game, instigated by Robson's teammate Jimmy Hill and the Professional Footballers' Association, combined with the birth of Robson's second son, prompted Robson to demand a higher salary. Gaunt refused to negotiate Robson's contract, so Robson placed a transfer request and was sold to Fulham for £20,000 in a deal which doubled his salary. Soon after Robson joined Fulham, the club sold Alan Mullery and Rodney Marsh, meaning Robson's chances of securing any significant honour there were substantially reduced. Robson himself stated, [...] "In <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> as a footballer, I didn't win a thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gabor {{was married}} nine times. She was {{divorced}} seven times, and one marriage was annulled. [...] "All in all— I love being married", {{she wrote in}} her autobiography. [...] "I love the companionship, I love cooking for a man (simple things like chicken soup and my special Dracula's goulash from Hungary), and spending <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> with a man. Of course I love being in love— but it is marriage that really fulfills me. But not in every case." [...] Her husbands, in chronological order, were: ...|$|E

2500|$|When she was {{ten days}} old, her mother was paralyzed from a stroke and died {{seventeen}} months later. Because bottle feeding was then unknown, Davis had to be fed with an eye-dropper, and later felt her interest in nutrition {{was due to the}} deprivation of oral feeding she lacked during her infancy. Early in her career she treated every patient as if they were herself. [...] "Every patient was me, and was mother, trying to get him healthy. I spent <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> making up for the mother I didn't have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis said, [...] "I didn't really {{understand}} {{how big it}} was. I really enjoyed <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> at work. The hard time was when I was not working. Fortunately, there were not many of those hours." [...] Geary stated, [...] "It just wasn't anything that I was {{prepared to deal with}} as an actor, because I was in daytime. We were international celebrities but still considered small-screen." [...] Geary continued, [...] "People didn't take it seriously and those that did took it too seriously. It was a very, very odd place to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the February 2010 National Prayer Breakfast, Obama commented, [...] "Surely you can {{question}} my policies without questioning my faith. Or {{for that}} matter my citizenship." [...] He directly addressed the issue in August 2010, {{in an interview with}} Brian Williams. Williams asked Obama about the fact that a fifth of the American people do not believe that he is either American born or a Christian. Obama responded that [...] "there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly". He then added [...] "I can't spend <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm {{going on}} with the law, now, for that very reason. I shall read law <b>all</b> <b>my</b> leisure <b>time.</b> I feel independent, and I shall not be anxious about the time I give, because I shall know that I can afford it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Not {{that he was}} a bad student, but {{he found}} early on that he would rather immerse himself in arts or {{football}} than attend to his studies. According to his own account: [...] "The good old socialist block of flats I lived in {{was in the middle of}} a magical Bermuda triangle in which I got lost – the stadium, the cinema and the circus. I spent <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> there – playing with a ball, wandering with my friends, sneaking into the ballerinas' trailers, acting scenes from films I'd just watched, so I often forgot to go home until late at night. The school was something in between, but never became a part of this triangle".|$|E

[...] I am enlisted for the war. [...] All my energies, <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>time,</b> my business experience, and knowledge of affairs I willingly and gladly give the State and nation. [...] I shall feel amply repaid if I can convince myself that I {{have been able to}} contribute something in behalf of the common cause in which the United States is engagedthe defeat of Prussianism and autocracy and the triumph of democracy as we understand it in America.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012, {{while at}} the World Economic Forum in Ethiopia, Times' {{journalist}} Lucy Bannerman asked Geldof how much taxes he paid, since Geldof had suggested that aid to developing nations could be increased through higher taxes.
