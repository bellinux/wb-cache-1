40|$|In this Paper, zone based {{features}} {{are used for}} recognition of handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numerals. The handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numeral images are normalized into 32 x 32 dimensions. Then normalized images are divided into 64 zones and their pixel densities are used as feature vector. Thus, the dimension of feature vector is 64. The handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numerals are tested for classifications on 4, 000 sample images as an experiment and obtained an accuracy of 95. 25 % for KNN classifier and 97. 05 % for SVM classifier for mixed numeral inputs with 2 -Fold cross validation for handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numerals. A total of 40 classes {{have been reduced to}} 19 classes pertaining to handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada numerals <b>and</b> handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> English numerals to enable to increase the recognition accuracy. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is thinning free, independent of slant of the characters...|$|R

5|$|In the 14th century, as Gothic art {{gave way}} to the International Gothic era, a number of schools {{developed}} in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold, Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined {{towards the end of the}} century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, <b>and</b> <b>prints,</b> both engravings and woodcuts, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
