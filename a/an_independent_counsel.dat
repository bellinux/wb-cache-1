500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> was unwarranted.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Kathleen Willey {{alleged that}} Clinton groped {{her in a}} hallway in 1993. <b>An</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> {{determined}} Willey gave [...] "false information" [...] to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.|$|E

Later that year, Freeh wrote a memorandum to Attorney General Janet Reno calling for <b>an</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> to investigate the fundraising scandal.

If the attorney general decided not to appoint <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> in response to such a request, they were only required to respond in writing with the reasons. Although under the statute the attorney general made the decision of whether or not to appoint <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel,</b> the actual selection of the individual to serve in this role was made by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals.|$|E

The extent to which the employment of post-assault coping strategies such as avoidance and denial diminishes the capacity of nurses to engage therapeutically with patients was another issue of concern...|$|R
5000|$|The name {{derives from}} the case of San Diego Navy Federal Credit Union v.

While Cumis is the best-known appellate {{precedent}} {{on the issue of}} the appointment of <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> for the defense of insureds when their insurance company has a conflict of interest, Cumis was not the first proponent of this principle. The Supreme Court of California approved the concept of <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> in <b>an</b> earlier 1964 case, which in turn was based upon a 1925 Kentucky case that laid the foundation for appointing <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> in the insurer-insured relationship. [...] Cumis innovated beyond existing precedent as of 1984 by holding that the insurer was required to pay for the insured's <b>independent</b> <b>counsel,</b> and that <b>a</b> merely theoretical conflict of interest could be ripened by the insurer's act of sending a reservation of rights letter into an actual conflict of interest, which in turn meant that the insured now had <b>a</b> right to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel.</b>|$|R
