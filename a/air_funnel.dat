50|$|A tubular grate heater is any grate or heat {{exchanger}} for a fireplace designed from metal tubing. Through the tubing is circulated home air that becomes heated by the fire. The air is then vented {{back into the}} room and home. It is a heat recovery device that improves the efficiency and ability of a fireplace to get the heat from the fire out and into the home. From simple to ornate, they can contribute significantly to the overall comfort of a room and potentially to a whole house. This in turn will reduce the amount of firewood needed to achieve the same comfort level, potentially reducing heating costs and expenses.Heaters increase the efficiency of a fireplace and hence the amount of heat that makes it from the fireplace out into the home. They work by having naturally convected and forced <b>air</b> <b>funneled</b> into the metal {{heat exchanger}} tubing that is then heated by the coals and/or fire. They draw in cold air from the floor and blow heated air back out into your home. This adds an element of conductive and convective heating to the radiant heat typical of a basic fireplace. Grate heaters have been called many things: heatilator, hearth heater, fireplace blower, fireplace grate heater, Fireplace Furnace, tubular grate heater, etc.|$|R

40|$|The use of semiochemicals for {{manipulation}} of the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) is being investigated for potential incorporation into a push-pull control strategy for this pest, which damages oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae), throughout Europe. The response of M. aeneus to non-host plant volatiles was investigated in laboratory assays to establish whether they {{have any effect on}} host plant location behaviour. Two approaches were used. First a novel, moving-air bioassay using <b>air</b> <b>funnels</b> was developed to compare the response of M. aeneus to several non-host plant essential oils. The beetles avoided the host plant flowers in the presence of non-host volatiles, suggesting that M. aeneus uses olfactory cues in host location and/or acceptance. The results were expressed as 'repellency values' in order to compare the effects of the different oils tested. Lavender (Lavendula angustifolia Miller) (Lamiaceae) essential oil gave the highest repellency value. In addition, a four-arm olfactometer was used to investigate olfactory responses, as this technique eliminated the influence of host plant visual and contact cues. The attraction to host plant volatiles was reduced by the addition of non-host plant volatiles, but in addition to masking the host plant volatiles, the non-host volatiles were avoided when these were presented alone. This is encouraging for the potential use of non-host plants within a push-pull strategy to reduce the pest colonisation of crops. Further testing in more realistic semi-field and field trials is underway...|$|R
40|$|A {{monitoring}} of shallow active layer temperature and DC resistivity soundings were {{performed in the}} Portette rock glacier, in a region which is considered the southern boundary of permafrost existence in the European Alps. The aim {{of the work is}} to recognize the most important seasonal processes that condition the existence or thaw of the permafrost. A one-dimensional geo-electrical survey was adopted to define the permafrost thickness. The active layer temperature was monitored hourly for four years using a digital data logger and a thermistor placed at 20 cm depth. The active layer temperature of three other rock glaciers in the surrounding area was monitored at the same depth and using the same instrumentation. The observed resistivities exceeding 100 k Omega m have been interpreted as permafrost affected layers, in accordance with other active rock glaciers in the Southwestern Alps. The thickness of the permafrost layer exceeds tens of metres both in the upper and middle part of the Portette rock glacier. The thermal behaviour of the active layer is strongly characterized by the occurrence of non-conductive and seasonal heat transfer processes, i. e. release of latent heat during phase change, snow melt infiltration and evidence of air circulation. Thermal events associated with these processes were synchronously registered in the shallow active layers of the other three rock glaciers, evidencing a common thermal behaviour of the Argentera rock glacier during the monitoring period. The ground-air temperature coupling/decoupling indicates that the thickness and establishment of snow cover strongly regulates the occurrence and intensity of these seasonal processes. Delayed and thin snow cover in autumn represents a forcing factor for permafrost maintenance/aggradation because it allows i) a strong cold penetration into the ground, ii) a lack/reduction of the Zero Curtain effect and iii) a downward cold and dense <b>air</b> <b>funnelling.</b> The comparison of the results with regional climatic data indicates that in the Argentera Massif only slight inter-annual variations in meteorological conditions, i. e. an early/delayed snowfall season and intense ground cooling before snow cover appearance, prompt a rapidly shifting morphoclimatic situation, from conditions favourable for permafrost presence/aggradation to unfavourable ones...|$|R
5000|$|Early on February 13, {{more snow}} {{began to develop}} on the {{northern}} side of the storm as the precipitation shield approached the Tri-State Area in colder air.

At the same time, warmer air was beginning to funnel into the storm system, and as a result the rain/snow line slowly creeped up the state of New Jersey as the warm air began to further intrude into the winter storm. By 10 a.m, most of the precipitation had moved north of New York City, and began to reach into areas like Boston.

50|$|If Central America were topographically flat, the air would flow {{uninterrupted}} {{from the}} Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean; however, the Cordillera mountains, which {{run along the}} west coast of Central America, block this flow. As a result, the <b>air</b> is <b>funneled</b> into a narrow mountain pass near Lake Nicaragua and the Gulf of Papagayo, creating the Papagayo jet. Again, the balloon example serves as an analogy of how the Papagayo jet forms; the air moving out of the balloon cannot escape all at once because there is only a small opening that allows for the release of air. The narrow opening of the balloon facilitates the creation of a wind because the air velocity increases through the balloon neck. Like the wind blowing through the balloon neck, the Papagayo winds reach high speeds as they travel through the break in the Cordillera. For context, Papagayo jet winds have mean speeds of 72 km/hr and can reach speeds of 108 km/hr through the pass, where trade winds have an annual average speed of 25 km/hr. Once the Papagayo jet winds reach the Pacific Ocean they slow considerably and merge with the trade winds. Papagayo wind jet surges can occur intermittently every few weeks and last several days during the Northern Hemisphere winter.|$|R

Below eight knots, the Ghost sits in the water on its centerline 38 ft-long module; faster than this, the marine aluminum buoyant hulls lifts the main hull {{out of the water}} by two 12 ft-long struts, achieving full stability and reducing the amount of area resisting the water. Each strut is attached to a 62 ft-long underwater tube that contains the engines. Four propellers are {{at the front of the}} tubes, which is more stable and allows for better control at high speeds; the propellers <b>funnel</b> <b>air</b> down through the struts, creating a gas bubble around each tube (the cavitation effect) for reduced drag and smooth motion. Propulsion on the prototype is provided by two T53-703 turboshaft engines providing 2,000 horsepower, there are plans to later adopt the General Electric T700 turboshaft engine. Since the tubes that contain the engines, fuel, and most computing systems are underwater, this lessens vulnerability because critical systems are protected by the water itself. The aircraft-style cockpit is outfitted with large windshields fashioned from two inch-thick glass; steering is provided via a throttle and joystick arrangement.

Measurement from slurry stores were performed {{by means of}} a specific system consisting of a 0. 138 m 2 captor, a trap containing 400 ml of a 1 % boric acid solution, a vacuum pump, an interceptor trap, a volume meter and a flow-meter. The device is arranged to suck the <b>air</b> from the <b>funnel</b> with a flow rate of 9 l/min.

The captors are let free to float on the slurry surface so that the area subjected to the measurement changes continuously. Measurements of ammonia emission from manure heaps were performed by means of Open Large Dynamic Chamber.

40|$|The Cloud is the {{new public}} utility of digital {{networks}} {{that can be found}} in urban and rural areas that reaches both locally and globally simultaneously. These low occupancy maximum security infrastructures collect virtual exchanges, encounters, and interactions into physical manifestations known as data centers. In return from their high degree of computational power, the data center servers exhaust an extreme amount of heat. This thesis argues that the mass amount of waste heat generated from the servers can be diverted from simply polluting the <b>air</b> and instead <b>funneled</b> into newly added civic programs that inhabit the spaces of the Cloud, turning the ultra-private architecture into public participants of the city they are embedded in. Although commonly found in large isolated buildings in the countryside, many data centers are actually in Manhattan along a single corridor adjacent to the Hudson river, all due to the landing of the transatlantic fiber optic network cable. Each year more square footage is being dedicated to housing these servers {{in one of the most}} densely populated cities in the world. The current trend is to create more security and fortify the servers against the city and its population, closing all physical relationships to the city. This demonstrates how our data is currently becoming prioritized spacially over the occupants of the immediate city that it is serving. This thesis reverses the trend by creating public space from the Cloud, not in spite of it, allowing both to benefit from the other. This research investigates a specific case by utilizing the construction eccentricities of the AT&T Long Lines building in Manhattan while consolidating and reorganizing its newly added data center servers to create a new thermodynamic symbiotic relationship. A new public promenade inhabits the building and captures the excess heat, winding upward and comprising itself with programs of leisure and surplus that are literally defined by their heat as a physical collection of biomes from around the world.

40|$|The {{building}} in XXX {{was constructed in}} XXX. It was designed using the International Building Code (IBC). This fire protection analysis report will be reviewing the building based on the 2015 edition of the IBC including several performance based fire scenarios involving the smoke exhaust system. The passive system section highlights the physical construction of the building. The building is a business occupancy with three separate stories including a penthouse which {{is included in the}} third story. The building has adequate fire ratings for a Type II-B construction except for heavy timber columns within the commons of the building. It seems likely that the designer obtained a waiver for construction with use of these heavy timber beams, but it still needs to be verified. In addition to the heavy timber construction issue, there was a concern with the egress requirements of the large conference room on the first floor. This conference room has the ability to be partitioned into three separate conference rooms. When this is achieved, the occupant load for each of these three separate smaller conference rooms is higher than an occupant load of 50. There is only one door per each of these smaller conference rooms. This is a violation of the IBC 2015 edition. The fire suppression section highlighted the capabilities of the sprinkler system. The fire flow test shows that there is a high enough water capacity at a high enough pressure for the worst case locations within the building to be supplied to meet NFPA 13. There is no need for a fire pump in this building. The fire alarm section highlights the construction of the fire alarm system. The fire alarm system uses Class A wiring as required by the AHJ for this type of construction. In addition to being a Class A wiring connection, additional provisions were included in the fire alarm system to an emergency voice notification system that notifies occupants {{in case of an emergency}} on the steps needed to maintain safety in emergency situations. Included in the fire alarm system are various panels including a Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP), 3 Transponder Panels (TP), 9 Notification Appliance Circuit Panels (NACP), and a Smoke Control Panel included in the fire alarm system. There is an issues with the placement of smoke detectors. There are no smoke detectors protecting the FACP and associated panels which does not meet NFPA 72 requirements. The smoke control system is interconnected to the fire alarm system via the smoke control panel. In the event of a fire, the smoke is exhausted through the ceiling through use of eight exhaust fans and make up <b>air</b> is <b>funneled</b> through inlets in the floors of the common areas and vents in the commons (conference rooms) through the use of five supply fans. This was a focal point in the performance based fire modeling section of the report. The performance based fire analysis focuses on two fire scenarios. The first scenario focuses an atrium fire and the second fire scenario focuses on a fire in the main conference room that removes the ability to egress through one of the three doors within the room. The two fire scenarios are not meant to verify acceptability based on NFPA 96 requirements for an exhaust system for an atrium. The fire scenarios shown to illustrate semi-realistic fires in the main conference room on the first floor and in the center of the atrium. The tenability requirements looked at for these fire scenarios were for visibility, CO (carbon monoxide) concentrations within the space, and the temperature of the air in within the space. The minimum tenability for visibility was determined to be 10 meters. Jin suggests that the criteria for visibility range from 13 ft to 46 ft (4 m to 14 m). Jin suggests a tenability limit of 10 m (33 ft) for occupants unfamiliar with a building based on his studies of people exposed to smoke. 10 m (33 ft) seems like a reasonable selection criteria for limiting visibility criterion in a non-complex building with reasonably sized rooms and square footage of the building. The minimum tenability for both the Oxbow building and the conference room on the first floor was determined due to this rational because there are periodic tours of the building and visitors that tend to join conferences within the conference room on the first floor. The minimum tenability requirement for CO concentrations was 0. 1 FED. This value was conservative enough for very low chances of affecting personnel that were sensitive to either toxic gases or asphyxiation because there are other contaminates in addition to CO concentration produced in fires depending on the materials burnt. “Hartzell [2] states that a (Ct) CO of 35, 000 ppm×min has the potential to cause serious harm to many occupants and therefore (Ct) CO = 35, 000 ppm×min would be a reasonable representation of an FED of 1. 0. If LC 50 data for rats is used, the value is 171, 000 ppm min. ” The value of 35, 000 was determined to be 1. 0 in this example. Using 35, 000 ppm, 0. 1 FED was determined to 1, 166 ppm of total exposure. The minimum tenability requirement for air temperature was determined to be 60 ° C. An exposure to a temperature of 60 º C was determined to be the worst case tenable condition for this fire model because exposure to a temperature of 60 º C air for 1 second will produce pain and 10 seconds or more will produce burns. The atrium based fire scenario shows that the building can be fully egressed with the all three of minimum required tenable requirements for visibility, CO concentration, and air temperature. Whereas, the fire scenario for egressing the conference room had visibility and CO concentration tenability issues. The analysis has determined the following conclusions and recommendations for meeting the IBC, 2015 edition: 1) The number of doors exiting the large conference room is not adequate. Recommendation: Add doors on the far sides of the conference room and include a type of interlock to the room separators to only allow one to be used at a given time. 2) Smoke detectors were not installed near the Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP), transponder panels, and the Notification Appliance Circuit (NAC) panels. Recommendation: If feasible, install smoke detectors in these locations. At minimum, a smoke detector should be installed near the FACP. 3) Heavy timber columns were installed in the atrium area. Recommendation: Verify waver from fire marshal for construction. If waver was not obtained, the heavy timber beams may need to be encased, replaced, or another alternative acceptable by the fire marshal...|$|R
