25|$|Butcher {{was born}} in Independence, Missouri, in 1971. He is the {{youngest}} of three children, having two older sisters. While he was sick with strep throat as a child, Butcher's sisters introduced him to The Lord of the Rings and The Han Solo Adventures novels to pass the time, thus beginning his fascination with fantasy and science fiction. As a teenager, he completed his first novel {{and set out to}} become a writer. After many unsuccessful attempts to enter the traditional fantasy genre (he cites J. R. R. Tolkien, Lloyd Alexander, and C. S. Lewis, among others, as major influences), he wrote the first book in The Dresden Files—about a professional wizard, named Harry Dresden, in modern-day Chicago—as <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>for</b> a writing course in 1996 at the age of 25.|$|E

Martha's initially positive wish to be liked by her oppressive and abusive husband push her to such an extreme that she becomes deranged leading to her own permanent physical paralysis.|$|E

She recalls her own Beowulf studies with [...] "a huge stack of dictionary and grammar books", and draws attention to Tolkien's comment that [...] "Perhaps the most important function of any translation used by a student is to provide not a model for imitation, but <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>for</b> correction." ...|$|E

Damon was a member of the Delphic Club, one of the University's select Final Clubs. In 2013, he was awarded the Harvard Arts Medal.

Captains Ramón Acha Caamaño and José Antonio Iriarte were among those who defended the city, from Castillo San Felipe del Morro. They had three batteries under their command, which were armed with at least three 15cm Ordóñez cannons. The battle lasted three hours and resulted in the death of Justo Esquivies, the first Puerto Rican soldier to die in the Puerto Rican Campaign.

500|$|A {{controversy}} emerged over {{changing the}} language of [...] "Baa Baa Black Sheep" [...] in Britain from 1986, because, it was alleged in the popular press, it was seen as racially dubious. This was based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery as <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>for</b> the children there and not on any local government policy. A similar controversy emerged in 1999 when reservations about the rhyme were submitted to Birmingham City Council by a working group on racism in children's resources, which were never approved or implemented. Two private nurseries in Oxfordshire in 2006 altered the song to [...] "Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep", with black being replaced {{with a variety of}} other adjectives, like [...] "happy, sad, hopping" [...] and [...] "pink". In 2012, a private nursery in Kingston upon Thames replaced [...] "black" [...] with [...] "little" [...] for their Easter show. Commentators have asserted that these controversies have been exaggerated or distorted by some elements of the press as part of a more general campaign against political correctness.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century {{revisionism}} of nursery rhymes became {{associated with the}} idea of political correctness. Most attempts to reform nursery rhymes on this basis appear to be either very small scale, light-hearted updating, like Felix Dennis's When Jack Sued Jill – Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times (2006), or satires written as if {{from the point of view}} of political correctness in order to condemn reform. The controversy in Britain in 1986 over changing the language of [...] "Baa Baa Black Sheep" [...] because, it was alleged in the popular press, it was seen as racially dubious, was apparently based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery, as <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>for</b> the children.|$|E

My Iambics were good, I expect, though not without two bad faults. In fact, I cannot look back upon a single paper, except my Latin prose, without a multitude of oversights and faults presenting themselves to me... I almost dread the giving out of the select. Think if my name was not there. It is some consolation that Hawtrey, yesterday, in giving me <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>for</b> good, asked how I liked the examination.

He has prepared a surprise for the citizens, and the present show will be different to anything ever before seen in London.

It will be built of wood, with battlements and towers, with a moat outside. As soon as the lists are over a large number of workmen will commence its erection; the pieces are all sawn and prepared. There will be machines, ladders, and other appliances. The ten champions on either side will fight as knights; you will have a hundred apprentices as men-at-arms, and the court party will have an equal number of young esquires. You, as winner of today's tourney, will have the choice of defence or attack. I should advise you to take the defence, since it is easier and requires less knowledge of war, and many of the other party have accompanied their fathers and masters in the field and have seen real sieges carried out." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Longdon, in the rain, {{which had}} come on since the morning, had betaken himself to church, and his other guest, with {{sufficiently}} marked good humour, had borne him company. The windows of the drawing-room looked at the wet garden, all vivid and rich in the summer shower, and Mitchy, after seeing Vanderbank turn up his trousers and fling back a last answer to the not quite sincere chaff his submission had engendered, adopted freely and familiarly the prospect not only of a grateful freshened lawn, but of a good hour in the very pick, as he called it, of his actual happy conditions. The favouring rain, the dear old place, the charming serious house, the large inimitable room, {{the absence of the}} others, the present vision of what his young friend had given him to count on--the sense of these delights was expressed in his fixed generous glare. He was at first too pleased even to sit down; he measured the great space from end to end, admiring again everything he had admired before and protesting afresh that no modern ingenuity--not even his own, to which he did justice--could create effects of such purity. The final touch in the picture before them was just the composer's ignorance. Mr. Longdon had not made his house, he had simply lived it, and the [...] "taste" [...] of the place--Mitchy in certain connexions abominated the word--was just nothing more than the beauty of his life. Everything on every side had dropped straight from heaven, with nowhere a bargaining thumb-mark, a single sign of the shop. All this would have been a wonderful theme for discourse in Buckingham Crescent--so happy <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>for</b> the votaries of that temple of analysis that he repeatedly spoke of their experience of it as crying aloud for Mrs. Brook. The questions it set in motion for the perceptive mind were exactly those that, as he said, most made them feel themselves. Vanderbank's plea for his morning had been a pile of letters to work off, and Mitchy--then coming down, as he announced from the first, ready for anything--had gone to church with Mr. Longdon and Nanda in the finest spirit of curiosity. He now--after the girl's remark--turned away from his view of the rain, which he found different somehow from other rain, as everything else was different, and replied that he knew well enough what she could make Mr. Longdon do, but only wondered at Mr. Longdon's secret for acting on their friend. He was there before her with {{his hands in his pockets}} and appreciation winking from every yellow spot in his red necktie.
