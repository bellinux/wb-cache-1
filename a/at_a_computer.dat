30|$|More {{complex and}} perhaps more educationally {{relevant}} (Question 11, “I cannot program a computer”), students show strong evidence of improvement {{from a position of}} not regarding themselves able to program <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> to being positive or at least uncertain (Δℓ[*]=[*] 3.10). From a position of considering themselves generally poor <b>at</b> using <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> to analyse DNA sequences (Question 14, “I am good <b>at</b> using <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> to analyse DNA sequences”), there is strong evidence of improvement towards a more positive assessment of their own abilities (Δℓ[*]=[*] 3.10), although no pupil ended up strongly confident (Fig.  1).

25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} significant psychosocial risk factors for bruxism, particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} triggering factor. It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E

[...] "I had been working on pixel art games and projects for some years so offered to create an entire set of level graphics for the game", Glancy said. The Terminator (1984) and Akira (1988) influenced Glancy's design work, which he described as [...] "the most complex pixel graphics [...] had ever made", due to the addition of motion blur and dynamic lighting. While Jones was impressed by Glancy's designs, he selected alternative designs by the art department at DMA Design because Glancy was not an employee.|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} {{difficulty}} porting {{the game to}} the Atari ST, due to the hardware's limitations with smooth scrolling. Brian [...] "Biscuit" [...] Watson, who the team met <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> club in 1984, discovered a technique to overcome this difficulty. Other limitations included the fewer colours available with the hardware; Smith adapted his designs accordingly. After completing his own game, Kay was assigned to port Menace to PC. During development, the sound effects were temporarily replaced with those from Salamander (1986); Jones recorded the sound effects from the game, as Hammond and Dailly played. Prior to this, the temporary sound effects consisted of noises by Jones. The game's final sound effects were designed by musician David Whittaker. The cover art was designed by Ian Craig.|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five chapters. Each chapter {{is divided into}} five parts, each {{describing}} events {{from the perspective of}} one of the five main characters: Karen, Rick, Luke, Rachel, and Player One. The first chapter, [...] "Hour One: Cue the Flaming Zeppelin", has Karen arriving at the Toronto airport on a flight from Winnipeg to meet a man she met online. She sits on a stool at the airport hotel bar in which Rick is the bartender, Rachel is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> terminal, and Luke is sitting at a table drinking scotch. Rachel is there with the expectation to meet a man who can father her child and approaches Luke. Karen's date goes badly as she finds the man too assertive physically and too distant intellectually. A self-help guru, Leslie Freemont, enters with his assistant Tara to welcome Rick into his empowerment program; Leslie gives a speech to the group, takes Rick's money, and leaves. Meanwhile, oil prices rapidly increase and explosions start to occur outside. With the power unreliable, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel run to Rick's vehicle to listen to the radio. Karen's date, Warren, is killed by a sniper as he runs to the group, who quickly return to the bar lounge where they barricade themselves in.|$|E
500|$|Hack would {{eventually}} be dropped in favor of NetHack (1987). When Mike Stephenson, an analyst <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> hardware manufacturer, took maintainership of Hacks code, he improved it, taking suggestions from Izchak Miller, a philosophy professor at University of Pennsylvania, and Janet Walz, another computer hacker. Calling themselves the DevTeam, they began to make major modifications to Hacks code. [...] They named their new version NetHack, {{in part due to}} their collaboration over the game being done through USENET. NetHacks major deviations from Hack were the introduction of a wider variety of monsters, borrowing from other mythologies and lores, including anachronistic and contemporary cultural elements (such as a tourist class with a flash-bulb camera inspired by Terry Pratchett's Discworld series) in the high fantasy setting, and the use of pre-defined levels with some procedural elements that the player would encounter deeper in the dungeons. Further iterations of the game included branching pathways through the dungeon and optional character-based quests that could grant the player an extremely useful item to complete the game. Though the DevTeam released the code publicly, they carefully maintained who could contribute to the code base to avoid excessive forking of the vanilla game, and remain relatively quiet about suggested improvements to each release, working in relatively secrecy from its player base. There are separate forks of NetHack, such as Slash'EM.|$|E

The episode aired as part of season four. Their Seinfeld script and The Simpsons episode caught the attention of Diane English, and they were offered a job on a sitcom. Before they accepted this job, they were told that Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky were leaving The Simpsons, and then joined the writing staff on a permanent basis in 1992, in the third season of that show. They began as story editors. They were initially quiet and felt [...] "intimidated", being in the same room as [...] "10 of the greatest minds in comedy", but eventually started pitching jokes with confidence. They wrote their scripts together, working side-by-side <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer.</b> Their first episode as staff writers was [...] "Marge in Chains", an existing idea that they were assigned. The first draft of the script was based on research about women in prison conducted by Oakley and Weinstein, making it [...] "slightly more realistic" [...] than {{the final version of the}} episode, in which many realistic elements were replaced.|$|E
