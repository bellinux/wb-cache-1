40|$|Society {{is facing}} {{continuous}} challenges regarding accessibility in {{information and communication}} technology (ICT), including mobile applications. Solutions fail to accommodate the diverse abilities and requirements of different users, depriving many people of possibilities {{to take full advantage}} of digital services and products. Based on the present state of ICT there is a need to explore new methods for how to develop widely inclusive solutions. Digital feedback channels represent an opportunity for communication between end users and companies to solve issues with products and services. However, research seems to be lacking on the use of such channels for accessibility purposes. This thesis investigates how effectively two digital feedback channels, emails and <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> <b>reviews,</b> function as platforms for solving accessibility issues in mobile applications. More specifically, the study focuses on problems for blind persons using the screen reader VoiceOver to interact with mobile content. A field experiment was conducted, in which a sample of iOS applications from Norwegian top lists was evaluated for the purpose of finding accessibility problems. Feedback concerning 50 problems in 50 separate applications was sent in via emails or <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> <b>reviews.</b> The applications were re-tested after 30 days to document the effect. As part of interviews performed, the study also looked into habits, preferences, and experiences of persons in the user group, with regards to sending feedback about accessibility problems through digital channels. Findings from the field experiment indicate that sending feedback through emails and <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> <b>reviews</b> currently has a minimal effect on solving VoiceOver related accessibility problems in mobile applications. As the sample was limited to a selection from the most popular iOS applications in Norway within certain categories, the results are considered likely to be more generalizable to this specific subpopulation than to the general population of mobile applications. Factors such as time, type and severity of problems and feedback formats, formulation and quantity could potentially influence the results and therefore be subject to further research. Additional findings from the interviews suggest that there are challenges which should be further investigated regarding how persons in the user group experience to employ digital feedback channels for communication about accessibility problems. Collaboration between end users and companies through digital feedback channels such as emails and <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> <b>reviews</b> could be part of the solution for achieving increased accessibility in mobile apps and other ICT solutions. Further studies should be done on the potential of using these channels for such purposes, and how to utilize this potential in more effective ways...|$|R

40|$|Apple and Google chose very {{different}} ways to communicate security and privacy risks to the iPhone and Android users, respectively. iPhone users, in the existing Apple tradition, are actively encouraged to trust into Apple being able to protect their devices through the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> <b>review</b> process. Android users have at least the possibility to know which data types and which critical actions are used by the app through the permissions that are shown on every app download. Thus, Android users would be better informed about possible risks in case they notice {{and are able to}} understand the permissions. In an online survey with over 700 German respondents, we noticed that Android users are indeed better informed than the iPhone users who seem to think less about possible risks. An interesting question is whether the iPhone users really need to be informed. Do they need to know about risks that they are probably never going to encounter, such as malicious apps sending premium-rate SMS messages or using their phone cameras to spy on them? The same issue applies to communication of security risks to Mac and Linux users, {{as well as to the}} whole field of risk communication: Should risks only be communicated to the highrisk groups? 1...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> in 2008 the mobile applications (apps) market has been growing rapidly. Currently there are about 1. 8 million apps in the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> and that number increases every day. That is why app developers have to develop strategies that will generate revenue and make their app noticeable in the <b>App</b> <b>Store.</b> One possible solution is to pair a paid app with a free trial version (“free and paid app ” strategy). Previous studies on apps have proved that free trials improve visibility and increase demand for the paid app. Demand for an app is reflected in its rank performance in the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> charts. A high rank in the charts improves visibility of an app. Furthermore, earned media like features by the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> and consumer <b>reviews</b> significantly affect visibility and demand for apps. Despite the benefits of a free trial, developers remain skeptical if the free trial app attributes to demand increase for the paid app. That is why this article aims to answer the following question: “How is the rank performance of the free app interrelated with the rank performance of the paid app over time, and what impact do earned media have on rank performance? ” To answer this research question various relationships between ran...|$|R
2500|$|In two {{succeeding}} versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some {{applications to}} a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS, {{at the same time}} simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use. This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase in mobile apps for diabetes self-care. However, their quality is not guaranteed and patients do not have the appropriate tools for careful evaluation. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to propose a tool to help patients with diabetes select an appropriate app for self-care. METHODS: After identifying the conceptual framework of diabetes self-care, we searched Apple US <b>app</b> <b>store</b> and <b>reviewed</b> diabetes self-care apps, considering both generic and diabetes-specific features. Based on an existing tool for representing the benefits and weaknesses of medical apps, we created the pictorial identification schema/Diabetes Self-care tool, which specifically identified medical apps in the diabetes domain. RESULTS: Of the 952 apps retrieved, 67 were for diabetes self-care, while 26 were excluded because they were not updated in the last 12 months. Of the remaining 41, none cost more than 15 USD, and 36 implemented manual data entry. Basic features (data logging, data representation, and data delivery) were implemented in almost all apps, whereas advanced features (e. g., insulin calculator) were implemented in a small percentage of apps. The pictorial identification schema for diabetes was completed by one patient and one software developer for 13 apps. Both users highlighted weaknesses related to the functionalities offered and to their interface, but the patient focused on usability, whereas the software developer focused on technical implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The Pictorial Identification Schema/Diabetes Self-care is a promising graphical tool for perceiving the weaknesses and benefits of a diabetes self-care app that includes multiple user profile perspectives...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{applications}} {{stores such as}} Apple’s <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> and Google’s Android Market {{revolutionized the}} distribution of applications for mobile devices. However, with thousands of application submissions, limited testing resources {{and the lack of}} an effective filtering mechanism, application stores suffer from information overload and a risk of releasing poor quality applications that could create confusion to consumers and may seriously affect the <b>App</b> <b>store</b> markets. Thus concern has been raised whether applications have been developed according to the need and interest of consumers. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was mainly to identify and get insight into the main factors that mobile application consumer takes into consideration when purchasing mobile applications from the desktop iTunes <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> and the mobile <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> on the iOS devices: iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. In this study both qualitative and quantitative case study approach was used. Accordingly twelve participants were selected from Stockholm and Uppsala area and their behaviour in the Apple’s <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> from the desktop iTunes and the mobile <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> on iOS devices was observed and recorded. Additionally questionnaires were administered to all participants in order to gather the necessary information. Consumers on the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> behave differently depending on the unit they are using. This is because applications on the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> are presented differently in the desktop iTunes <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> and the mobile <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> on the iOS devices. The study shows that young consumers with lower income purchase apps more frequently than the consumers with higher income. It also shows that consumers often consider the description, the screenshots, and the ratings when they are interested in buying applications. Furthermore consumers take a look more on ratings in the list on the iPhone and iPad <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> because the ratings are not shown in the list on the iTunes <b>App</b> <b>Store.</b> Similarly consumers tend to read the customer reviews more on the iTunes and iPad <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> as the customer reviews on the iPhone <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> is displayed in another page. Consumers were found to be more attracted by visual elements that they are already familiarized with, apps with famous logos and known fonts and styles but also to coherent and descriptive app names and strong colors (i. e. red, green, yellow, black and blue, respectively). The majority of the participants found the iTunes <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> messy and cumbersome to use. They preferred using the iPad <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> because they found it to be a good mixture of both iTunes and iPhone <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> but also because it has more options to consider. Although consumers behave differently depending on the unit they are using, the visual element of the apps, prior knowledge of consumers about the name of the apps, ratings, easy accessibility of screenshots and customer reviews of the apps were found to be the main factors to be considered by consumers when they visit <b>app</b> <b>stores</b> for purchase. Thus application developers and digital magazine publishers should consider these consumer behaviours in order to influence more downloads and successfully sell apps on the <b>app</b> <b>stores.</b> ...|$|R
