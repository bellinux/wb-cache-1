25|$|Storage space {{allocated}} to a database {{is divided into}} sequentially numbered pages, each 8KB in size. A page is the basic unit of I/O for SQL Server operations. A page is marked with a 96-byte header which stores metadata about the page including the page number, page type, free space on the page and the ID of the object that owns it. Page type defines the data contained in the page: data stored in the database, index, allocation map which holds information about how pages are {{allocated to}} tables and indexes, change map which holds information about the changes made to other pages since last backup or logging, or contain large data types such as image or text. While page is the basic unit of an I/O operation, space is actually managed {{in terms of an}} extent which consists of 8 pages. A database object can either span all 8 pages in an extent ("uniform extent") or share an extent with up to 7 more objects ("mixed extent"). A row in a database table cannot span more than one page, so is limited to 8KB in size. However, if the data exceeds 8KB and the row contains varchar or varbinary data, the data in those columns are moved to a new page (or possibly a sequence of pages, called an <b>allocation</b> <b>unit)</b> and replaced with a pointer to the data.|$|E

50|$|Inefficient address use: Organizations that {{obtained}} IP addresses in the 1980s {{were often}} allocated far more addresses {{than they actually}} required, because the initial classful network allocation method was inadequate to reflect reasonable usage. For example, large companies or universities were assigned class A address blocks with over 16 million IPv4 addresses each, because the next smaller <b>allocation</b> <b>unit,</b> a class B block with 65,536 addresses, was too small for their intended deployments.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} align F2FS with {{underlying}} flash-based storage, F2FS allocates a segment in {{a unit of}} a section. F2FS expects the section size {{to be the same}} as the garbage collection unit size in FTL. With respect to the mapping granularity in FTL, F2FS allocates each section of the active logs to as many different zones as possible. FTL can write the active log data into one <b>allocation</b> <b>unit</b> according to its mapping granularity.|$|E
50|$|The {{file system}} block size {{represents}} the minimum <b>allocation</b> <b>unit.</b> XFS allows file systems {{to be created}} with block sizes ranging between 512 bytes and 64 KB, allowing the file system to be tuned for the expected degree of usage. When many small files are expected, a small block size would typically maximize capacity, but for a system dealing mainly with large files, a larger block size can provide a performance efficiency advantage.|$|E

5000|$|Block suballocation is {{a feature}} of some {{computer}} file systems which allows large blocks or <b>allocation</b> <b>units</b> to be used while making efficient use of [...] "slack" [...] space {{at the end of}} large files, space which would otherwise be lost for other use to internal fragmentation.|$|R
50|$|This {{results in}} unused space when a file {{is not an}} exact {{multiple}} of the <b>allocation</b> <b>unit,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} slack space. For a 512-byte allocation, the average unused space is 256 bytes. For 64 KB clusters, the average unused space is 32 KB. The size of the <b>allocation</b> <b>unit</b> is chosen when the file system is created. Choosing the allocation size based on the average size of the files expected to be in the file system can minimize the amount of unusable space. Frequently the default allocation may provide reasonable usage. Choosing an allocation size that is too small results in excessive overhead if the file system will contain mostly very large files.File system fragmentation occurs when unused space or single files are not contiguous. As a file system is used, files are created, modified and deleted. When a file is created the file system allocates space for the data. Some file systems permit or require specifying an initial space allocation and subsequent incremental allocations as the file grows. As files are deleted the space they were allocated eventually is considered available for use by other files. This creates alternating used and unused areas of various sizes. This is free space fragmentation. When a file is created and there is not an area of contiguous space available for its initial allocation the space must be assigned in fragments. When a file is modified such that it becomes larger it may exceed the space initially allocated to it, another allocation must be assigned elsewhere and the file becomes fragmented.|$|E
5000|$|An {{otherwise}} blank disk {{has five}} files, A through E, each using 10 blocks of space (for this section, a block is an <b>allocation</b> <b>unit</b> of the filesystem; the block size is set when the disk is formatted {{and can be}} any size supported by the filesystem). On a blank disk, all of these files would be allocated {{one after the other}} (see example 1 in the image). If file B were to be deleted, there would be two options: mark the space for file B as empty to be used again later, or move all the files after B so that the empty space is at the end. Since moving the files could be time consuming if there were many files which need to be moved, usually the empty space is simply left there, marked in a table as available for new files (see example 2 in the image). When a new file, F, is allocated requiring 6 blocks of space, it could be placed into the first 6 blocks of the space that formerly held file B, and the 4 blocks following it will remain available (see example 3 in the image). If another new file, G, is added and needs only 4 blocks, it could then occupy the space after F and before C (example 4 in the image). However, if file F needs to be expanded, there are three options, since the space immediately following it is no longer available: ...|$|E
