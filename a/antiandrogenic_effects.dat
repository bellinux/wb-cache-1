These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E

Due to the <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effects</b> that result from these actions, it is frequently used off-label to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a role.

40|$|Objective: Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a {{component}} of combined estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), {{has been associated with}} increased breast cancer risk in EPT users. MPA can bind to the androgen receptor (AR), and AR signaling inhibits cell growth in breast tissues. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of MPA to disrupt AR signaling in an ex vivo culture model of normal human breast tissue. Methods: Histologically normal breast tissues from women undergoing breast surgical operation were cultured in the presence or in the absence of the native AR ligand 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), MPA, or the AR antagonist bicalutamide. Ki 67, bromodeoxyuridine, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL 2), AR, estrogen receptor α, and progesterone receptor were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: DHT inhibited the proliferation of breast epithelial cells in an AR-dependent manner within tissues from postmenopausal women, and MPA significantly antagonized this androgenic effect. These hormonal responses were not commonly observed in cultured tissues from premenopausal women. In tissues from postmenopausal women, DHT either induced or repressed BCL 2 expression, and the <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of MPA on BCL 2 was variable. MPA significantly opposed the positive effect of DHT on AR stabilization, but these hormones had no significant effect on estrogen receptor α or progesterone receptor levels. Conclusions: In a subset of postmenopausal women, MPA exerts an <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect</b> on breast epithelial cells that is associated with increased proliferation and destabilization of AR protein.

40|$|Finasteride {{is known}} to inhibit Type 2 5 α-reductase and thus block the {{conversion}} of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The structural similarity of finasteride to DHT {{raises the possibility that}} finasteride may also interfere with the function of the androgen receptor (AR). Experiments were carried out to evaluate the <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of finasteride in LNCaP, C 4 - 2 and VCaP human prostate cancer cells. Finasteride decreased DHT binding to AR, and DHT-stimulated AR activity and cell growth in LNCaP and C 4 - 2 cells, but not in VCaP cells. LNCaP and C 4 - 2 (derived from castration-resistant LNCaP) cells express the T 877 A mutant AR, while VCaP cells express the wild-type AR. When PC- 3 cells, which are AR-null, were transfected with either the wild-type or the T 877 A mutant AR, only the mutant AR-expressing cells were sensitive to finasteride inhibition of DHT binding. Peroxiredoxin- 1 (Prx 1) is a novel endogenous facilitator of AR binding to DHT. In Prx 1 -rich LNCaP cells, the combination of Prx 1 knockdown and finasteride was found to produce a greater inhibitory effect on AR activity and cell growth than either treatment alone. The observation suggests that cells with a low expression of Prx 1 {{are likely to be more}} responsive to the <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of finasteride. Additional studies showed that the efficacy of finasteride was comparable to that of bicalutamide (a widely used non-steroidal antiandrogen).

40|$|Background: Cimetidine, {{histamine}} H 2 receptors antagonist, {{has caused}} {{adverse effects on}} the male hormones and reproductive tract due to its <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect.</b> In the testes, peritubular myoid cells and muscle vascular cells death has been associated to seminiferous tubules and testicular microvascularization damages, respectively. Either androgen or histamine H 2 receptors have been detected in the mucosa and smooth muscular layer of vas deferens. Thus, the effect of cimetidine on this androgen and histamine-dependent muscular duct was morphologically evaluated. Methods: The animals from cimetidine group (CMTG; n= 5) received intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg b. w. of cimetidine for 50 days; the control group (CG) received saline solution. The distal portions of vas deferens were fixed in formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Massońs trichrome-stained sections were subjected to morphological and the following morphometrical analyzes: epithelial perimeter and area of the smooth muscular layer. TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling) method, NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) and AR (androgen receptors) immunohistochemical detection were also carried out. The birefringent collagen of the muscular layer was quantified in picrosirius red-stained sections under polarized light. The muscular layer was also evaluated under Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Results: In CMTG, the mucosa of vas deferens was intensely folded; the epithelial cells showed numerous pyknotic nuclei and the epithelial perimeter and {{the area of the}} muscular layer decreased significantly. Numerous TUNEL-labeled nuclei were found either in the epithelial cells, mainly basal cells, or in the smooth muscle cells which also showed typical features of apoptosis under TEM. While an enhanced NF-kB immunoexpression was found in the cytoplasm of muscle cells, a weak AR immunolabeling was detected in these cells. In CMTG, no significant difference was observed in the birefringent collagen content of the muscular layer in comparison to CG. Conclusions: Cimetidine induces significant damages in the epithelium; a possible <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect</b> on the basal cells turnover should be considered. The cimetidine-induced muscle cells apoptosis confirms the susceptibility of these cells to this drug. The parallelism between enhanced cytoplasmic NF-kB immunolabeling in the damaged muscular tissue and muscle cell apoptosis suggests that this drug may avoid the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus and interfere in the control of NF-kB-mediated smooth muscle cell apoptosis. The decreased immunoexpression of ARs verified in the damaged muscular tissue reinforces this possibility. © 2013 Koshimizu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

In the present study, we determine whether a short-term exposure to a known antiandrogenic pesticide, linuron (LN), suppresses spiggin mRNA in male stickleback and in androgenized female stickleback. Primers were designed from previously characterized sequences for each androgen receptor (AR) isoform in stickleback, arα and arβ, to assess whether these receptors are differentially regulated by androgen or antiandrogen exposure. Fish were exposed for 72 h to one of four treatments: control, LN (250 µg/L), 17 α-methyltestosterone (MT, 500 ng/L), and an LN-MT mixture at those same concentrations. There was no effect of LN on spiggin and arβ mRNA levels in male kidney, while levels of arα were significantly increased twofold.

50|$|In {{addition}} to their antigonadotropic effects, estrogens are also functional antiandrogens by decreasing free concentrations of androgens via increasing the hepatic production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and by extension circulating SHBG levels.

5000|$|As {{part of the}} reregistration process, the U.S. EPA {{reviewed}} all {{toxicity studies}} on vinclozolin. The main effect induced by vinclozolin is related to its antiandrogenic activity {{and its ability to}} act as a competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor. Vinclozolin can mimic male hormones, like testosterone, and bind to androgen receptors, while not necessarily activating those receptors properly. There is evidence that vinclozolin itself binds weakly to the androgen receptor but that at least two of its metabolites are responsible for much of the antiandrogenic activity. When male rats were given low dose levels (>3 mg/kg/day) of vinclozolin, effects such as decreased prostate weight, weight reduction in sex organs, nipple development, and decreased ano-genital distance were noted. At higher dose levels, male sex organ weight decreased further, and sex organ malformations were seen, such as reduced penis size, the appearance of vaginal pouches and hypospadias. In the rat model, {{it has been shown that}} the antiandorgenic effects of vinclozolin are most prominent during the developmental stages. In utero, this sensitive period of fetal development occurs between gestation days 16-17. [...] Embryonic exposure to vinclozolin can influence sexual differentiation, gonadal formation, and reproductive functions. In bird models, vinclozolin and its metabolites were shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit androgen receptor binding and gene expression. Vinclozolin caused reduced egg laying, reduced fertility rate, and a reduction in successful hatches. Androgens also play a role in puberty, and it has been shown an antiandrogen like vinclozolin can delay pubertal maturation. Antiandrogenic toxins are also known to alter sexual differentiation and reproduction in the rabbit model. Male rabbits exposed to vinclozolin in utero or during infancy did not show a sexual interest in females or did not ejaculate. Since the androgen receptor is widely conserved across species lines, <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effects</b> would be expected in humans.In vertebrates, vinclozolin also acts as a neuroendocrine disruptor, affecting behaviors tied to locomotion, cognition, and anxiety.|$|E

Experimental groups consisted of a control group (corn oil injections on d 12 and 13), a TP-L group [corn oil and a low dose (L; 30 μg) of TP], a TP-H group [corn oil and a high dose (H; 300 μg) of TP], a CA-L + TP-H group [a low dose (L; 7. 5 μg) of CA + TP-H], and a CA-H + TP-H group [a high dose (H; 75 μg) of CA + TP-H]. The cloa-cal tissues were collected on d 16, processed into paraf-fin sections, and stained using 14 different biotinylated lectins. The Vicia villosa (VVA) lectin most strongly stained the developing cloacal glandular cells in TP-H. Western blotting analysis showed 1 VVA-positive band of approximately 75 kDa. The ratio of VVA-positive ar-eas per unit square examined microscopically by image analysis was significantly greater in the TP-H group than in the control group in both males and females.

50|$|Animal {{studies with}} vinclozolin, procymidone, linuron, and the DDT {{metabolite}} dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p.p’-DDE) have shown irregular reproductive development {{due to their}} function as androgen receptor antagonists that inhibit androgen-activated gene expression. Even with low doses of <b>antiandrogenic</b> pesticides, developmental <b>effects</b> such as reduced anogenital distance and induction of areolas were seen in male rats.|$|R
40|$|Endocrine {{disruptors}} (EDs) are exogenous substances or xenoestrogens {{natural or}} synthetic, capable of interacting with different systems and altering their normal hormonal regulation, being the reproductive system {{one of the}} most affected. EDs produce their effects not only by acting on nuclear steroid receptors, but also on membrane receptors, steroidal and non-steroidal synthetic enzymatic pathways and/or metabolism. The incorporation to the body depend on each EDs, which are liposoluble and easily deposited in the tissue; thus ensuring a prolonged accumulation and release, even when the exposure is not continuous. In addition to cross the placenta, EDs may act in the offspring during the reproductive system formation and maturation key stages and its regulatory mechanisms. The effects of EDs can be multiple, but most acts mediating estrogenic and/or <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect.</b> Three groups of EDs are widely used: in plastics (phtalates), sunscreens (cinnamate and methylbenzylcamphor), and detergents (nonylphenol). In this paper we review the effects of the exposure to these environmental chemicals on the reproductive system and the possible mechanisms by which they occur, focusing in the hypothalamic–pituitary neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate the reproductive system.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to define {{the role of the}} {{combined}} dienogest (DNG) /estradiol valerate (E 2 V) contraceptive pill, in terms of biochemistry, metabolic and pharmacological effects and clinical application as well. E 2 V is the esterified form of 17 β-estradiol (E 2), while dienogest is a fourth-generation progestin with a partial <b>antiandrogenic</b> <b>effect.</b> The cycle stability is achieved with 2 to 3 mg DNG, supporting contraceptive efficacy. In this new oral contraceptive, E 2 V is combined with DNG in a four-phasic dose regimen (the first two tablets contain 3 mg E 2 V; the next five tablets include 2 mg E 2 V + 2 mg DNG, followed by 17 tablets with 2 mg E 2 V + 3 mg DNG; followed by two tablets with 1 mg E 2 V only, and finally two placebo tablets). Duration and intensity of scheduled withdrawal bleeding are lower with this contraceptive pill, whereas the incidence and the intensity of intra-cyclic bleeding are similar to the other oral contraceptive. With this new pill the levels of high density lipoprotein increased, while the levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and D-dimer remained relatively unchanged; the levels of sex hormone binding globulin, cortisol binding globulin, thyroxine binding globulin increased. The most frequently reported adverse events are: breast pain, headache, acne, alopecia, migraine, increase of bodyweight. The satisfaction rate is about 79. 4 %...|$|R
