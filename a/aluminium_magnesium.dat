5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, <b>aluminium,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of <b>aluminium,</b> <b>magnesium</b> and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due {{to the need to}} transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{grouping}} of minerals by far are the silicates; most rocks {{are composed of}} greater than 95% silicate minerals, and over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of these minerals.

Other common elements in silicate minerals correspond to other common elements in the Earth's crust, such <b>aluminium,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> iron, calcium, sodium, and potassium. Some important rock-forming silicates include the feldspars, quartz, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and micas.|$|E

This gallery was all of <b>aluminium</b> <b>magnesium</b> alloy, the tight front of the air-ship swelled cliff-like above and below, and the black eagle sprawled overwhelmingly gigantic, its extremities all hidden by the bulge of the gas-bag.
