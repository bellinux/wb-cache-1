40|$|We {{have shown}} in {{previous}} work that {{the addition of}} small quantities of colloidal silica to the UV-curable polymer coating of fused silica optical fiber causes a dramatic improvement in the fatigue and aging resistance both in aqueous and in constant humidity environments. The presence of silica in the coating inhibits the mechanisms responsible for the surface roughening that causes the fatigue knee and strength degradation during zero-stress aging. This work presents results which show the effect of higher concentrations of the silica additive (6 wt%) and of an <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>agent</b> on both the rheological properties of the polymer coating and the fatigue and zero-stress aging behavior of the fiber. Viscosity measurements show thixotropic behavior which indicates that the silica particles tend to form a network structure in the prepolymer. Filtration of the prepolymer to remove large particles is hampered by this phenomenon. The fiber coated with the silica-containing polymer exhibits substantial improvement {{in the long term}} mechanical reliability compared to a reference fiber without additive in the coating. 1...|$|E
40|$|Leukocyte {{activation}} is {{a complex}} process that involves multiple cross- regulated cell adhesion events. In this report, we investigated the role of intercellular adhesion molecule- 3 (ICAM- 3), the third identified ligand for the beta 2 integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1), in the regulation of leukocyte adhesion to ICAM- 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), and the 38 - and 80 -kD fragments of fibronectin (FN 40 and FN 80). The activating anti-ICAM- 3 HP 2 / 19, but not other anti-ICAM- 3 mAb, was able to enhance T lymphoblast adhesion to these proteins when combined with very low doses of anti-CD 3 mAb, which were unable by themselves to induce this phenomenon. In contrast, anti-ICAM- 1 mAb did not enhance T cell attachment to these substrata. T cell adhesion to ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, FN 40, and FN 80 was specifically blocked by anti-LFA- 1, anti-VLA alpha 4, and anti-VLA alpha 5 mAb, respectively. The activating anti-ICAM- 3 HP 2 / 19 was also able to specifically enhance the VLA- 4 - and VLA- 5 -mediated binding of leukemic T Jurkat cells to VCAM- 1, FN 40, and FN 80, {{even in the absence}} of cooccupancy of the CD 3 -TcR complex. We also studied the localization of ICAM- 3, LFA- 1, and the VLA beta 1 integrin, by immunofluorescence microscopy, on cells interacting with ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and FN 80. We found that the anti-ICAM- 3 HP 2 / 19 mAb specifically promoted a dramatic change on the morphology of T lymphoblasts when these cells were allowed to interact with those adhesion ligands. Under these conditions, it was observed that a large cell contact area from which an uropod-like structure (heading uropod) was projected toward the outer milieu. However, when T blasts were stimulated with other <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>agents</b> as the activating anti-VLA beta 1 TS 2 / 16 mAb or phorbol esters, this structure was not detected. The anti-ICAM- 3 TP 1 / 24 mAb was also unable to induce this phenomenon. Notably, a striking cell redistribution of ICAM- 3 was induced specifically by the HP 2 / 19 mAb, but not by the other anti-ICAM- 3 mAb or the other <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>agents.</b> Thus, ICAM- 3 was almost exclusively concentrated in the most distal portion of the heading uropod whereas either LFA- 1 or the VLA beta 1 integrin were uniformly distributed all over the large contact area. Moreover, this phenomenon was also observed when T cells were specifically stimulated with the HP 2 / 19 mAb to interact with TNF alpha-activated endothelial cells.

40|$|Purpose: During {{the last}} 20 years DLC (diamond-like carbon) layers became a very {{attractive}} material in many medical and engineering applications. While the layer’s stress and adhesion were always a concern, several adhesion improvement methods have been proposed. A majority of those methods consists of either the deposition of an <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoting</b> interlayer or {{the application of a}} gradient of chemical composition. In whatever way this reduces the internal stress and improves the adhesion of carbon layers, it also affects the properties of the carbon layer. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the physicochemical properties of gradient carbon layers manufactured by RF PACVD/MS method at different process parameters. Design/methodology/approach: The a-C:H/Ti gradient layers were deposited onto silicon wafers using a hybrid deposition method which combines PVD and CVD processes in one reaction chamber. Surface topography, adhesion and coefficient of friction (COF) were measured at a nanoscale using Atomic Force Microscopy, Nanoindentation, and Nanotribometry. Findings: The result of this investigation has demonstrated that gradient interlayer deposition parameters affect roughness and tribological properties of outer carbon layer. Research limitations/implications: Presented investigation was performed with mirror-polished silicon wafers to prevent possible interferences caused by variations in surface topography of other typical substrates during polishing. However, the adhesion of carbon layer measured for the silicon substrates can be noticeably different from that measured for metal substrates. Thus, new adhesion investigations have to be done when using these layers on application-specific substrates. Also, additional friction and wear resistance measurements performed under wet conditions (biological serum) should be conducted in a case of medical applications. Originality/value: There are several reports available on the properties of carbon layers deposited subsequently onto the <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoting</b> interlayer. Present work is an attempt to understand and describe influence of <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoting</b> interlayer deposition parameters on the properties of interlayer - layer system as a whole...|$|R

In {{order to determine the}} biologic significance of epinectin, we determined the distribution of epinenctin in various rat epithelial tissues by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Polyclonal antibodies to epinectin stained basal cells and basilar regions of skin, urinary bladder, and vagina. There was predominantly cytoplasmic staining along with amorphous extracellular staining. Strong staining was also noted in sebaceous glands and hair follicles. The immunoreactivity for epinectin in the skin was distinct from that for fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. Antibodies to epinctin also stained subpopulations of neurons in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Epinectin antibodies strongly stained the cytoplasm of some pineal cells and cells of the pars intermedia of the pituitary. The distribution of epinectin suggests a role not only in epithelial cell-sub-stratum adhesion, but in neuronal cell function.
