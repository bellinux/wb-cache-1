25|$|Though Rodezno’s {{supporters}} {{complained about}} “fascistización” of the Communion {{under the new}} leadership of Fal, Carlism firmly changed course from political negotiations to organizational build-up. Rodezno was not appointed head {{of any of the}} newly created sections, nominated to Consejo de Cultura instead. Re-elected to the Cortes in 1933 and 1936, he was permitted to pursue talks with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> on the private business basis; in 1936 these contacts started to take shape of negotiating a joint insurgency. According to one source he was on the target list of the hit-team which, in his absence, shot Calvo Sotelo instead.|$|E
25|$|By many Carlists Bau {{was viewed}} with suspicion. This {{was due to}} his enthusiasm when {{engaging}} in alliance talks with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and personal friendship with their leader, José Calvo Sotelo; though new Traditionalist jefe Manuel Fal approached Bloque Nacional as tactical option to be eventually abandoned, Bau was suspected of pushing for a dynastical compromise. In the spring of 1935 Don Alfonso Carlos and Fal considered Bau’s activity in the Bloque intolerable and semi-rebellious. Also present-day scholars name his position as “conspiration”, while others claim that he was loyal to Calvo rather than to Traditionalism. However, {{he was allowed to}} speak at massive Carlist meetings in Poblet and at Montserrat; he was also appointed to the Carlist Council of Economy.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} months of the Republic Comín emerged as engaged in a number of Jaimist {{initiatives}} going far beyond the regional realm and with major nationwide impact. In June 1931 he contributed to reformatting of Requeté from a self-defense militia to a paramilitary formation; more importantly, in the autumn of that year and with a group of senior Carlist leaders he took part in preliminary talks with the Alfonsist politicians, intended as preparations for a would-be dynastical agreement. Fully authorized by Don Jaime, they met with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> in San Sebastián, leading later to the so-called Pacto de Territet. Comín's stance on dynastical agreement is not clear; later that year he was noted as speaking against any common monarchist movement, including sort of a monarchist shirt organization.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Don Javier firmly {{abandoned}} any thought of reconciliation with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and instructed harsh measures versus those who approached them; however, he remained respectful towards Don Juan and avoided open challenge, still falling short of explicitly claiming the title. He supported Valiente – his position gradually reinforced formally {{up to new}} Jefe Delegado in 1958-1960 - in attempts to eradicate internal focos of rebellion against collaboration and to combat new openly secessionist anti-collaborative groups. Though 20 years earlier he expelled from the Comunión those who had accepted seats in the Francoist structures, {{at the turn of}} the decades Don Javier viewed the appointment of 5 Carlists to the Cortes as success of the collaborationist policy, especially that the regime permitted new Carlist legal outposts and the movement seemed visibly reinvigorated, now openly present in the public discourse.|$|E
25|$|In 1943 Sivatte co-signed Reclamación de Poder, a {{document}} which demanded from Franco dismantling of national-sindicalist regime and introduction of Traditionalist monarchy. This {{was his last}} action within the party executive. Increasingly perplexed by contacts with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and fearing some sort of dynastic compromise, as means of protest in 1944 Sivatte resigned from Junta Nacional Carlista, though he retained his post of the Catalan jefe. He was also concerned with what he perceived as Carlist lack of direction, political bewilderment and especially the inactive regency of Don Javier. In a late 1945 document he firmly denied dynastic rights to Don Juan and Don Carlos Pio and recommended that the regent assumes a bold and decisive stand; other documents soon followed. Executing his strategy, Sivatte co-engineered a grand Carlist demonstration in Pamplona in December 1945; the event ended in riots and detentions.|$|E

25|$|In April 1956 the Sivattistas {{met with}} Don Javier in Perpignan. The latter agreed {{to sign a}} {{document}} rejecting any dynastic compromise with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and with Franco, {{though he did not}} agree to sign as a king and afterwards insisted on keeping the document private. Sivatte, fearing another reverse step, refused; moreover, he presented the declaration at Junta Suprema de las Regiones, a freshly formed and somewhat rebellious Carlist body bent on preventing a pro-Juanista and pro-Francoist turn. The intention was to keep Don Javier in a crystal box and to separate him from daily political business, but the new Carlist political leader José María Valiente mounted a counter-offensive and forced dissolution of the Junta. Sivatte responded by publishing the Perpignan paper as Manifesto a los españoles. At that point he was already convinced that loyalty to Don Javier reached a dead end and that a competitive solution is needed.|$|E
25|$|As provincial {{deputy leader}} Sivatte focused on Requeté buildup and {{propaganda}} activities, occasionally replacing Alier during Carlist gatherings. On {{the national level}} he displayed his already trademark intransigence speaking against an alliance with the <b>Alfonsinos,</b> advocated {{by the likes of}} conde Rodezno and Pradera. Following the Popular Front triumph he represented Catalan Carlism during talks with local UME leaders, drafting first plans of anti-Republican insurgency. One of them was almost put into action in the spring of 1936; when recalled in the very last minute, Sivatte formed part of the Catalan Requeté command. According to one source, it was Sivatte who suggested that Alier, who resigned early that year, be replaced as regional jefe by Tomàs Caylà. The new leader entrusted Sivatte with the task of collecting funds for anticipated military action. He also went on negotiating with UME and was unhappy about their vision; the generals imagined the coup to topple the frentepopulista government, while Sivatte intended to topple the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Once {{he decided}} to abandon {{unreliable}} and wavering Don Javier, Sivatte started to look for alternatives. In 1957 he held consultations with Don Antonio, representative of another Borbón branch considered legitimate heir by the Carloctavista faction, but the talks bore no fruit. Don Carlos Hugo, the oldest son of Don Javier, made a fulminant entry on Spanish political stage in May 1957 and was greeted by enormous enthusiasm of the crowd gathered on the Aplec of Montejurra; many Sivattistas concluded that the years of apathy were over. Some of them re-joined the Javieristas, {{though it is not}} clear to what extent Sivatte himself considered Don Carlos Hugo an alternative to Don Javier; he was suspicious about pro-Francoist tones of his addresses. When in late 1957 a large group of Traditionalists leaning towards dynastic accord with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> declared Don Juan the legitimate heir, Sivatte felt genuine Carlism should be immediately given new momentum.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Araúz, {{determined}} {{to bring the}} monarchy back, was steering between the Carlists and the Alfonsists. In August 1943 along with Manuel Fal Conde {{and a number of}} other Carlist leaders he signed a letter to Franco, demanding that fascistoid features of the regime are replaced with Traditionalist solutions; the response was his detention and a month spent behind bars in the Dirección General de Seguridad prison. Later the same year he conferred with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> concerning their policy towards Francoism. He supported a manifesto to be issued by their claimant Don Juan, a document intended to dissociate the pretender from Franco; in minority, he fruitlessly advocated a bold action. In 1944 he supported vague plans for a joint monarchist coup against Franco. In 1946 together with conde Rodezno he visited Don Juan in Estoril, sounding him on a would-be dynastical agreement between himself and the Carlist regent-claimant Don Javier. Formally the mission did not breach the rules of Carlist regency, but in fact it was bordering disloyalty to Don Javier. In 1957 together with Arellano he sought Carlist adhesions to the Juanista project and emerged among leaders of the initiative; eventually, both Araúz de Robles brothers, José Maria and Carlos, joined a large fraction of Carlists who recognized Don Juan as the legitimate Carlist pretender. The Acto de Estoril declaration marked his formal break with mainstream Carlism. He was expulsed from Comunión and faced anger of the javierista crowd during the Carlist Montejurra amassment of the following year.|$|E
2500|$|A {{penchant for}} {{accord with the}} <b>Alfonsinos,</b> {{demonstrated}} by some Carlists, stemmed from a looming dynastical crisis; the claimant Don Alfonso Carlos was an octogenarian {{and there was no}} clear successor in sight. Larramendi was leaning towards the deposed Portuguese Braganza family, pointing to Duarte Nuño as to a potential Carlist successor. However, later he got converted to a regentialist solution. In early 1936 it was Larramendi, considered totally loyal and an excellent lawyer, who edited the royal decree of Alfonso Carlos; it nominated Don Javier as the future Carlist regent. As authority he wrote prologue to Historia critica del tradicionalismo español of [...] His vital role was reflected in the 1936 electoral campaign, when together with Fal he negotiated a failed deal with Gil-Robles. For unclear reasons he ran in Gerona; his name sounded strange among Catalan candidates though it was Frente Popular triumph which contributed to his next electoral failure. Last but not least, as an abogado he kept defending Carlists before the Republican courts.|$|E
2500|$|In Traditionalist historiographical {{narration}} Rodezno {{is one of}} {{the black}} characters, among the likes of Rafael Maroto, [...] or Don Carlos Hugo. He is charged with blatant political miscalculation at best and with treason of principles and kings at worst. His vacillating stance during the Mellista crisis in 1914-1919, rapprochement towards the <b>Alfonsinos</b> in the Republic years or bypassing Carlist command when pushing for almost unconditional adherence to the generals’ coup of 1936 are less of an issue; it is Rodezno’s stance on unification and pro-Juanista lobbying which earned him most hostility. Though scholars speculate on his different motives, the opinion which gained particular popularity is that he has never been a genuine Carlist, adhering to the movement mostly out of respect for his father. None of the currently existing organizations claiming Carlist identity, be it either those pursuing a socialist path (javierocarlistas, Partido Carlista) or those attached to Traditionalist values (tronovacantista , sixtinos, carloctavistas) admits deference to his name.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Alfonsino,</b> Beryx splendens Lowe, 1834, is a {{demersal}} fish species that inhabits the continental slope (200 - 600 m depth) {{in the eastern}} Atlantic (Quero, 1984) and seamounts around the islands of Madeira, the Canaries and the Azores (Maul, 1986).

40|$|<b>Alfonsino</b> (Beryx splendens) is {{a species}} {{associated}} with seamounts, with an important fishery in Juan Fernandez archipelago, Chile (33 ° 40 'S, 79 ° 00 'W). Since 2004, this resource has been managed by catch quotas estimated from stock assessment models. The <b>alfonsino</b> model involves {{high levels of}} uncertainty for several reasons including {{a lack of knowledge}} of aspects of the population dynamics and poorly informative time-series that feed the proposed evaluation models. This work evaluated three hypotheses regarding population dynamics and their influence on the main state variables (biomass, recruitment) of the model using age-structured and dynamic biomass models. The hypotheses corresponded to de-recruitment of older individuals, non-linearity between standardized catch per unit effort, and population abundance as well as variations of the relative importance of length structures. According to the results, the depletion of the spawning biomass between 1998 and 2008 varied between 9 and 56 %, depending on the combination of hypotheses used in the model. This indicates that state variables in <b>alfonsino</b> are not robust to the available information; rather, they depend strongly on the hypothesis of population dynamics. The discussion is focused on interpreting the causes of the changes in the state variables in light of a conceptual model for population dynamics in <b>alfonsino</b> and which pieces of information would be necessary to reduce the associated uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Research Paper and PowerPoint PresentationThis paper aims {{to analyse}} and {{elucidate}} key {{conditions for the}} sustainability of community-based fisheries management (CBFM) on unrestricted fisheries in Japan. It re-examines more than 50 years’ worth of empirical evidence regarding the outcomes of the socio-economic rationality of the self-imposed management of common property, with particular reference to splendid <b>alfonsino</b> (Beryx splendens) fishing grounds off Katsuura, Chiba Prefecture, and the Small-Type Coastal Fishing Vessel Fishery Cooperative (STCC) there. It shows that the exclusive use of fishing grounds and other factors, including communal solidarity and a social milieu advocating fishermen’s protection of fishing grounds observed roughly 20 years ago, have for more than 50 years continuously existed as conditions necessary to establishing sustainable CBFM in unrestricted <b>alfonsino</b> fisheries using waters off Katsuura. At present, however, it should be recognised that the resource management of <b>alfonsino</b> as a migratory species would be required with different types of fishery operations in fishing grounds other than STCC’s operation near Katsuura. To resolve this issue, a co-management system involving a resource management plan and fisheries risk management plan under the fraternal insurance of the fishery was recently introduced {{in collaboration with the}} Japanese government, Chiba’s prefectural government, and the STCC. As a type of adaptive fisheries management system in Japan, this co-management system would {{play an important role in}} securing key sustainable conditions for CBFM in unrestricted, self-managing fisheries in <b>alfonsino</b> fishing grounds off Katsuura, Japan...|$|R
40|$|Selenium is an {{essential}} micronutrient for humans, and seafood {{is one of the}} major selenium sources, as well as red meat, grains, eggs, chicken, liver and garlic.
