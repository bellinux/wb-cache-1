5|$|Williamson's {{work during}} this decade was his most {{prolific}} {{in terms of}} comic book work and has garnered considerable praise for its high quality. He has been noted for his perfectionism <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> the medium. Despite its high reputation, S.C. Ringgenberg felt that Williamson's artwork from this period could at times be uneven and uninspired. Williamson was single during this period and, according to The Art of Al Williamson, had a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Carmelo Félix Camet (October 29, 1904 – July 22, 2007) was an Argentine fencer who {{competed in}} the Olympic games in 1928. He {{was the son of}} Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics who is {{sometimes}} considered to be Argentina's first participant at the Olympics. Trained as a lawyer, Carmelo Camet gained his training <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> fencing at an early age from his father.

5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> his mother, Jevrosima; {{he often}} sought her advice, {{following}} it {{even when it}} contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Nell begins {{working at}} The Orchard, Rupert Brooke becomes a resident. As he enjoys his summer working on papers for Cambridge {{societies}} and composing his poetry, Brooke leads {{a social life}} flirting with various women and enjoying the company of artists and other students. Brooke soon lusts for Nell, and his increased interest in her leads to unconventional encounters. They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E
5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on {{stage for the}} last time. He was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest <b>and</b> <b>Love</b> <b>for</b> Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.|$|E

5|$|John Calvin, a very {{influential}} early Reformed theologian, believed the Lord's Supper fed Christians with the spiritual food of union with Christ. He believed {{that in the}} Supper Christians feed on Christ's flesh, which he saw as an inexplicable miracle. Calvin taught that the Supper confirms the promises communicated to Christians in the preaching of the gospel. He also saw its purpose as provoking praise for God <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> other people. He believed it necessary for Christians to partake of Christ's humanity in the Supper {{as well as his}} Spirit, and that the bread and wine really present, rather than simply symbolize or represent, Christ's body and blood. Calvin spoke of the communication involved in the Lord's Supper as spiritual, meaning that it originates in the Holy Spirit. Calvin's teaching on the Lord's Supper was followed by many others in the Reformed tradition, including Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli. Calvin, like Zwingli and against Luther, did not believe that Christ is bodily present in the elements of the Eucharist. He taught that Christ remains in heaven and that we commune with him in the Lord's Supper by being raised up to him rather than him descending to us. Calvin believed the elements of the Supper to be used by God as instruments in communicating the promises which they represent, a view called symbolic instrumentalism.|$|E

25|$|One {{distinct}} {{feature of}} the 1896 revolution against Spain in Nueva Ecija {{was that it was}} led by the elite, ruling class instead of the masses.

Despite being in the ruling class and enjoying positions in the colonial government, these prominent Novo Ecijanos proved their patriotism <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> fellow Filipinos.|$|E

Hughes did, however, show a respect <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> his fellow black man (and woman).
