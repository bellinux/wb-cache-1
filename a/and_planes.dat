5|$|The American {{prisoners were}} quickly {{returned}} to the United States, most by plane. Those who were still sick or weakened remained at American hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS General A.E. Anderson bound for San Francisco via Hollandia, New Guinea. In an effort to counter the improved American morale, Japanese propaganda radio announcers broadcast to American soldiers that submarines, ships, <b>and</b> <b>planes</b> were hunting the General Anderson.

5|$|Vector spaces {{stem from}} affine {{geometry}} via {{the introduction of}} coordinates in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, Descartes and Fermat founded analytic geometry by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve. In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced certain operations on points, lines <b>and</b> <b>planes,</b> which are predecessors of vectors. His work was then used in the conception of barycentric coordinates by Möbius in 1827. In 1828 C. V. Mourey suggested {{the existence of an}} algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.|$|E

5|$|For the US Navy, the Battle of Savo Island would {{institute}} many changes. Virtually every cruiser {{would be}} retrofitted with emergency diesel electric generators. The fire mains {{of the ships}} would be changed to a verticle loop design that could be broken many times and still function. Fires were set at Savo which were attributed to aviation facilities filled with gas, oil, <b>and</b> <b>planes.</b> Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted.

5|$|In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was {{held responsible for the}} 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters <b>and</b> <b>planes</b> to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two weeks}} {{following}} 27 July, German transports moved nearly 2,500 troops of the Army of Africa to Spain; 1,500 between 29 July and 5 August. Transport planes were moved to Spain from Germany via San Remo in Italy. German aircraft continued to provide cover for ship movements in the Strait of Gibraltar. There were fuel shortages, however, these eased as more fuel arrived from Germany. By 11 October, the mission's official end, 13,500 troops, 127 machine guns and 36 field guns had been carried into Spain from Morocco. Over this period there was a movement from training and supply missions of overt combat. The operation leader, Alexander von Scheele, was replaced by Walter Warlimont, and was moved into Franco's headquarters to coordinate military and diplomatic efforts. In September, 86 tons of bombs, 40 Panzer PzKpfw I tanks and 122 personnel had been landed in Spain; they were accompanied with 108 aircraft in the July–October period, split between aircraft for the Nationalist faction itself <b>and</b> <b>planes</b> for German volunteers in Spain.|$|E

5|$|The film, {{a romantic}} action-war picture, was rewritten by scriptwriters Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton from {{a story by}} John Monk Saunders to {{accommodate}} Bow, Paramount's biggest star at the time. Wellman was hired as {{he was the only}} director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat pilot experience, although Richard Arlen and John Monk Saunders had also served in the war as military aviators. The film was shot on location on a budget of $2 million at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas between September 7, 1926 and April 7, 1927. Hundreds of extras and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming, including pilots <b>and</b> <b>planes</b> of the United States Army Air Corps which were brought in for the filming and to provide assistance and supervision. Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen on a battlefield made for the production on location. Although the cast and crew had much spare time during the filming because of weather delays, shooting conditions were intense, and Wellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Japan {{began its}} southward {{expansion}} by expanding its {{military presence in}} Indochina ("securing 'points d'appui'") and decisively {{increased the number of}} stationed personnel <b>and</b> <b>planes.</b> This provoked the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments to freeze Japanese assets, while the US (which supplied 80 percent of Japan's oil) responded by placing a complete oil embargo on the Japanese Empire. As a result, Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in South-East Asia and its prosecution of the war against China, or seizing the natural resources it needed by force. The Japanese military did not consider the former an option as attacking Soviet Russia instead of expanding into South Asia had become a more and more unpopular choice since Japan's humiliating defeat at the Battle of Khalkin Gol in 1939 and the final rejection of any near-term action in Siberia shortly after Germany began its invasion of the USSR. Moreover, many officers considered America's oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war. With the harsh oil sanctions imposed by the United States, the Japanese leadership was now even more determined to remain in China. Germany had refused to sell Japan the blueprints to make synthetic oil, so Japan's only hope for oil was to invade the Dutch East Indies, which would result in war with the United States and Britain. To succeed the Japanese had to neutralize the powerful United States Pacific Fleet, so they could prevent it from interfering with future Japanese movements in South-East Asia and negotiate peace terms from a strong hand.|$|E
5|$|Ships {{and other}} water craft were advised {{to avoid the}} Cape Cod area as the storm was {{forecast}} to brush that area, which was put under a hurricane warning by the National Hurricane Center. In Massachusetts, schools were closed and emergency shelters were opened to accommodate evacuees. Evacuations were ordered for residents living in low-lying areas in Cape Cod. In Boston, {{the threat of the}} storm caused both elementary and middle schools to close at noon while high schools were closed at 1 p.m. (est). The approach of the storm also postponed a fair at a local hospital <b>and</b> <b>planes</b> at Otis Air Force Base were quickly moved to their hangars. Much of southeastern Massachusetts civil defense and fire departments were alerted in preparation of the storm's impact. In Rhode Island, schools and other buildings were used as shelter to house evacuees. As Hurricane Gerda sped up the East Coast of the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended the hurricane warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Eastport, Maine. At Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, two ships of the United States Navy left their berths to ride out the storm. One of which was the Comsixthflt flagship USS Puget Sound (AD-38).|$|E

5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships <b>and</b> <b>planes</b> that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few days}} after the {{hurricane}} passed, the Grenada Emergency Operations Center temporarily prevented relief supplies from entering the country to ensure the safety of the incoming items; the decision was reversed shortly thereafter, <b>and</b> <b>planes</b> flew supplies during daylight hours into the reopened airport. Severe looting occurred in the immediate aftermath of Ivan, prompting police officials to enact a curfew for the night hours. In the first week following the hurricane, aid was slow to the affected residents, due to the lack of an efficient aid distribution system. 30official shelters and 17prepared ones housed over 5,000people in the aftermath of the storm. Thousands of people lost their jobs due to the hurricane, with all businesses shut down following the hurricane. By two months after the hurricane struck, 65schools were opened, some of which serving as shelters; water and power were gradually restored to the island. By a year after the storm's passage, all schools were reopened, and most buildings enacted provisional repairs. Officials determined around 10,000houses on the island required complete reconstruction, while a further 22,000 needed repairs. The government of Grenada initially planned to rebuild 1,000houses in the year after the hurricane struck; by June 2005, 260families were provided houses, with a further 85under construction. The government also established a Material Assistance Programme, which provided $5,000 (2004XCD) of free materials to more than 5,000families, as well as a total of $4.3million (2004XCD) in low interest loans to 148families. Several indirect fatalities occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane, primarily senior citizens.|$|E

40|$|The translog cost {{function}} approach is employed {{to characterize the}} production structure and to estimate the rate of technical change and technical bias in the saw <b>and</b> <b>planing</b> mills industry (SPM) in the New Brunswick Province. The findings are that the production structure of the saw <b>and</b> <b>planing</b> mills in Canada is neither homothetic nor homogenous implying potential scale induced distortion in the input mix. Morishma elasticity of substitution estimates show that in the existing technology of the saw <b>and</b> <b>planing</b> mills in New Brunswick, labor can more easily be substituted by capital than capital by labor. Moreover, the amount of round wood that is required to complement labor is higher than that required to complement energy and capital, which indicates that a labor intensive technology choice in the SPM industry is more round wood consuming than the capital and energy intensive technologies. These results coupled with the increasingly stringent environmental regulations indicate that the relative use of labor compared to other inputs is likely to decline in the saw <b>and</b> <b>planing</b> mills industry. Hence, in view of their cost minimizing behavior, the saw <b>and</b> <b>planing</b> mills in New Brunswick will sooner or latter start to replace labor with energy or capital. The saw <b>and</b> <b>planing</b> mills in New Brunswick exhibited fairly high economies of scale during the period 1965 - 1995, but the rate of technical change {{has been found to}} be negative.
