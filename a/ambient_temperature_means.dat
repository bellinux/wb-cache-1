40|$|Background: As {{no human}} data exist, we aimed to {{determine}} the relation between <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and volume of perihematomal 'cerebral' edema in acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) among Chinese participants of the pilot phase, Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial (INTERACT 1). Methods: INTERACT 1 was a multicenter, open, blind outcome assessed, randomized controlled trial of intensive (systolic target < 140 mmHg) vs. guideline-recommended (systolic target < 180 mmHg) blood pressure (BP) lowering in 404 patients with acute ICH. Data on <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> (<b>mean,</b> minimum, maximum, and range) {{on the day of}} each participant's ICH obtained from China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System were linked to other data including edema volumes. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate association between <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and edema volumes. A generalized linear regression model with a generalized estimating equations approach (GEE) was used to assess any association of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and change in edema volume over 72 h. Results: A total of 250 of all 384 Chinese participants had complete data that showed positive associations between <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> (<b>mean</b> and minimum <b>temperatures)</b> and edema volumes at each time point over 72 h after hospital admission (all P< 0 · 05).

The increase was greater in people with conditions related to cardiovascular disease. An 1 °C decrease in indoor temperature was associated with 0. 38 mm Hg (0. 18 – 0. 58) increase in SBP, while the effects on DBP were not estimated due to limited studies. Among the previous studies on temperature-BP relationship, temperature and BP measurements are not accurate enough and statistical methods need to be improved.

40|$|The {{provision}} of nest-boxes {{is widely used}} as a conservation intervention to increase the availability of cavities for hole-nesting birds, particularly in managed forests, but it is uncertain whether nest-boxes are an appropriate substitute for tree cavities. Tree cavities and nest-boxes may differ in many aspects, including microclimate, but there are few data with which to examine this. We measured the air temperature and relative humidity in vacant tree cavities previously used by breeding marsh tits Poecile palustris (a non-excavating forest passerine) and in nest-boxes provided for this species that had similar dimensions to natural nest sites, and we compared values from both with ambient conditions. We examined how tree cavity characteristics influenced microclimate and if similar conditions were replicated in nest-boxes. Tree cavities, particularly those in thicker parts of trees, were more efficient thermal insulators, with temperature extremes dampened {{to a greater extent}} relative to ambient values. In contrast, the nest-boxes provided poor insulation with negligible buffering against <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> <b>Mean</b> daily relative humidity was high (on average c. 90 %) in tree cavities, which all had walls of living wood, and this averaged 24 % higher than in nest-boxes at comparable ambient conditions (mean humidity 76 – 78 %). These results support previous studies that incorporated various types of tree cavities and nest-boxes, indicating that the environment within nest-boxes differs significantly from that of tree cavities.

40|$|Pulsating {{flows in}} a Helmholtz pulse {{combustor}} tailpipe were numerically simulated by a commercial CFD software package, FLUENT. The effects of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> {{on the characteristics}} of the pulsating tailpipe flows were studied. Two study cases, with high and low levels of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> were simulated with compressible flow equations. An additional case, with high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> was simulated with incompressible (temperature-dependent density) flow equations. Results showed that the effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on the <b>mean</b> <b>temperature</b> profile in the tailpipe was limited to the distance where the ambient fluid traveled into the tailpipe during the period of flow reversal. In this region, the amplitude of mass flow rate oscillation significantly increased, due to higher density associated with low <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> The overall effects of cooler <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> included an increase in mean pressure at the entrance of the tailpipe and a decrease in the magnitude of velocity amplitude profile along the tailpipe. Interestingly, the mean velocities along the tailpipe, even at the tailpipe exit, were not affected by the cooler ambient air. The mean velocity at the exit corresponded to the higher temperature of fresh fluid from upstream, which was not affected by the <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> driven out of the tailpipe in each oscillation cycle. The linear acoustic theory with appropriate assumptions could be used to calculate the magnitude of the profiles of velocity amplitude along the tailpipe as a fair approximation, at least for the study cases in this thesis.

In this study we used infrared thermography to measure the hen’s capacity to dissipate heat, in a commercial line of laying hens subjected to cycles of neutral (N, 19. 6 °C) or high (H, 28. 4 °C) <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> <b>Mean</b> body <b>temperatures</b> (BT) were estimated from 9355 infrared images of wing, comb and shank taken from 1200 hens. Genetic parameters were estimated separately for N and H temperatures. Correlations between BT and plumage condition were also investigated. Wing temperature had low heritability (0. 00 to 0. 09), consistent with the fact that wing temperature mainly reflects the environmental temperature and is not a zone of heat dissipation. The heritability of comb temperature was higher, from 0. 15 to 0. 19 in N and H conditions, respectively. Finally, the shank temperature provided the highest heritability estimates, with values of 0. 20 to 0. 22 in H and N conditions, respectively. Taken together, these results show that heat dissipation is partly under genetic control. Interestingly, the genetic correlation between plumage condition and shank and comb temperatures indicated that birds with poor condition plumage also had the possibility to dissipate heat through featherless areas. Genetic correlations of temperature measurements with egg quality showed that temperatures were correlated with egg width and weight, yolk brightness and yellowness and Haugh units only under H conditions. In contrast, shell colour was correlated with leg temperature only at thermo-neutrality. </p...|$|R

40|$|Siliceous frustules were {{extracted}} from a representative fresh water diatom species (Cyclotella sp.) by treating with aqueous hydrochloric (HCl) acid. The structural characterizations of cleaned frustules were examined by {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The microscopy images showed that the diatoms have a regular circular shape and are of almost equal size (average length is 9 µm and average width is 3 µm). From energy dispersive X –ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) spot analysis {{it was confirmed that}} the frustules isolated from diatoms are composed mainly of silicon in the form of amorphous silica (SiO 2). The bond information of chemical substances of diatom frustules was carried out at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> by <b>means</b> of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. FTIR spectrum as recorded in transmittance mode showed the characteristic peaks for diatom biosilica, including for Si-O-Si stretching vibration at 1057 and 776 cm- 1. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements of diatom frustules were performed at room temperature and it was observed that they emitted strong blue PL centered at 440 nm when excited with ultraviolet (UV) radiation...|$|R

A definitive version was subsequently published at: [URL] central integration of thermal (i. e. cold) and mechanical (i. e. pressure) sensory afferents is suggested as to underpin the perception of skin wetness. However, the role of temperature and mechanical inputs, and their interaction, is still unclear. Also, it is unknown whether this intra-sensory interaction changes according to the activity performed or the environmental conditions. Hence, we investigated the role of peripheral cold afferents, and their interaction with tactile afferents, in the perception of local skin wetness during rest and exercise in thermo-neutral and warm environments. Six cold-dry stimuli, characterised by decreasing temperatures [i. e. - 4, - 8 and - 15 °C below the local skin temperature (Tsk) ] and by different mechanical pressures [i. e. low pressure (LP) : 7 kPa; high pressure (HP) : 10 kPa], were applied on the back of 8 female participants (age 21 ± 1 years), while they were resting or cycling in 22 or 33 °C <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> <b>Mean</b> and local Tsk, thermal and wetness perceptions were recorded during the tests. Cold-dry stimuli produced drops in Tsk with cooling rates in a range of 0. 06 to 0. 4 °C/s. Colder stimuli resulted in increasing coldness and in stimuli being significantly more often perceived as wet, particularly when producing skin cooling rates of 0. 18 °C/s and 0. 35 °C/s. However, when stimuli were applied with HP, local wetness perceptions were significantly attenuated. Wetter perceptions were recorded during exercise in the warm environment. We conclude that thermal inputs from peripheral cutaneous afferents are critical in characterizing the perception of local skin wetness. However, the role of these inputs might be modulated by an intra-sensory interaction with the tactile afferents. These findings indicate that human sensory integration is remarkably multimodal...|$|R
