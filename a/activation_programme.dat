40|$|The paper {{provides}} a theoretical rationale for flexicurity policies, which consist of low employment protection, generous unemployment insurance and active labor market programmes. It analyzes in which conditions flexicurity can be optimal. Low employment protection encourages costly education efforts to access high productivity and high innovation sectors, with firms {{more likely to}} survive and thus not exposing much their workers to unemployment risk. <b>Activation</b> <b>programmes</b> support the reallocation flow from unproductive to productive firms, helping to reduce unemployment. Low employment protection thus provides incentives for costly self-insurance against unemployment risk through education, mitigating the moral hazard cost of unemployment insurance and <b>activation</b> <b>programmes.</b> The paper provides realistic numerical illustrations where flexicurity is optimal, {{and where it is}} not optimal...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, QBW 2 {{confirmed}} that both meetings and early activation were effective – although it {{also revealed that}} the early <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> involved increased costs and increased the risk of prolonging unemployment spells due {{to the risk of}} locking-in effects.|$|E
30|$|It {{is clear}} from the figure that the exit rate is higher for the {{treatment}} group in the first 20 weeks of the experiment. Several authors have evaluated the experiment further. Graversen & Van Ours (2008) use duration models to address issues of dynamic selection and estimate the effect of the <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> on exit rates to work. They find that the re-employment rate increases about 30 %, and this effect is the same across age and gender. Rosholm (2008) finds similar results when estimating the effects of the <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> separately for both counties. Graversen & Van Ours (2008), Rosholm (2008) and Vikström et al. (2011) all investigate which elements of the <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> are most effective. Graversen & Van Ours (2008) find that the threat effect and job search assistance are most effective. A similar conclusion is drawn by Vikström et al. (2011), who construct nonparametric bounds. Also Rosholm (2008) finds substantial effects, but he also shows that when controlling for time-varying indicators of treatment all positive effects vanish and some even become negative, the so-called locking-in effect. He finds that the estimated risks of meetings and being activated drive the difference in the job finding rates between treated and non-treated Individuals. Additional evidence for threat effects is provided by Graversen & Van Ours (2011). They show that the effect of the <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> is largest for individuals with the longest travel time to the programme location. Finally, Blasco & Rosholm (2011) analyse long-term effects on post-unemployment employment stability in terms of duration of self-support after leaving the unemployment pool. They find that treatment increases the post-unemployment self-support duration by 10 % for men, while treated women show no post-unemployment stability effects. Decomposing the effect, they show that 20 – 25 % is due to lagged duration dependence.|$|E

For 38 % of the social {{assistance}} spells, the immigrant is participating in an <b>activation</b> <b>programme.</b> Of those who participate in programmes, 7.4 % concerns employment with a wage subsidy, and 26.7 % direct employment programmes. Durations of each type of <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> vary a lot (mean duration is 5 – 6 months {{with a standard deviation}} of 4 – 6 months), but one reason for this is that some programmes are interrupted, for instance because the participant finds a job. There is also a large variation in the time of entry into programmes: On average, immigrants who participate in a programme enter about 13 months after the start of the social assistance spell, and the standard deviation is 15 months. 34 % of all the immigrant social assistance spells have employment as destination state. The percentage is 39 for spells not involving ALMP participation and 26 for spells with ALMP participation, varying from 51 % for employment with wage subsidy to 20 for ‘other programmes’.|$|E

30|$|Nor is {{it always}} {{clear that a}} “work-first” {{approach}} is less effective {{in a period of}} high unemployment. Michaelides (2013) provides experimental evidence from a reemployment programme which was implemented by the US state of Nevada during the Great Recession. This experiment required a random sample of new UI claimants to attend a one-to-one meeting with a caseworker in the first three weeks of their UI claim as a condition of remaining eligible for benefits. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether the claimant was in fact eligible for benefits and actively seeking work. Claimants who either failed to attend the interview or failed the eligibility test were immediately disqualified from benefits. The results showed a significant cut in the average duration of unemployment and in public spending on benefits. Importantly, the programme increased significantly the exit rate from UI receipt to employment. In another study, Martins and Pessoa e Costa (2014) evaluated a large <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> which was introduced in Portugal in 2012 when the unemployment rate hovered around 16 %. Their results showed that, despite the depressed state of labour demand, the <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> doubled the monthly exit rate to a job.|$|E

To analyse whether co-produced activation programmes suffer from selection biases, participants in a local innovative <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> (n?=? 60) were compared to non-participants (n?=? 18). Participants are more motivated in general and showed higher levels of generalized, municipal and interpersonal trust.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the topic of <b>Activation</b> and {{education}} <b>programmes</b> for seniors {{in the region of}} Karlovy Vary. The topic is divided here into two parts. The first, theoretical part {{deals with the}} old age as a biopsychosocial problem, i. e. it evaluates the demography of old age, the concept of healthy ageing, it deals with medical and social geriatric diagnostics and, above all, with individual <b>activation</b> <b>programmes,</b> their creation and principles, importance and practical application. The work especially includes education programmes, it describes their particularities and use, as well as their teaching at colleges in the region of Karlovy Vary. The second, research part consists of the determining of hypotheses, the aim of the work, and the methodology of the research. I have chosen the quantitative method of research by which three questionnaires were assessed: for respondents living in old people´s homes, for respondents living at home and for professional workers dealing with <b>activation</b> and education <b>programmes</b> in old people´s homes. Further a comparative analysis of the questionnaire for respondents living in old people´s homes as well as those living at home was carried out. The subject of this analysis are the questions of the same aim and their statistic compiling. All the data are compiled with the help of charts, tables and statistic programme SPSS. The most important is the testing of the hypothesis concerning the knowledgeability of respondents about <b>activation</b> and education <b>programmes</b> and related participation in such programmes, and further hypotheses inquiring whether professional workers (course lectors) have enough information on the entire spectrum of these programmes. The discussion is directed at the evaluation of the research targets, practical implementation of knowledge into practice, and especially at additional new facts, which I revealed during the research itself and during the statistic compiling of data. It is possible to say that the respondents must have information on the importance of <b>activation</b> and education <b>programmes,</b> on their taking place and the conditions of participation. Alike the professional staff holding or lecturing them should be professionally trained in courses.

40|$|Policing is a disciplining {{means for}} using welfare {{services}} to govern welfare recipients towards a desired behaviour or goal. We apply Foucault’s (1977) definition of institutional discipline {{as a means}} for exploring how the distinctions made by state and local welfare authorities in Norway when policing recipients may take shape according to normative perceptions of ethnicity and deservingness. More particularly, we explore the regulating understandings and activities linked to the inclusion and exclusion of eligibility to welfare benefits and services and the form of the services offered. Our focus lies at the point of entry from the lowest tier of Norwegian welfare benefits (social assistance) into two semi-parallel and higher tiers promising more (higher benefits, better services). The tiers are represented by programmes that share aims, yet differ in reach: the 2004 Introduction Programme and the 2007 Qualification Programme. The Introduction Programme is an <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> targeted at immigrants and refugees newly arrived to Norway. Its aim is to strengthen opportunities to participate in society and labour market, as well as to promote economic independence. The Qualification Programme is an <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> that was explicitly modelled after the Introduction Programme, yet whose target group reaches more broadly to include long-term recipients of social assistance and those whose work ability is severely lowered. While both programmes have been premised on the need to transform participants from a status of passive welfare benefit recipients to active participants in qualifying measures and society, the target groups vary and it is this contrast that is our point of focus. We contrast the two policies at two ‘moments’ in the policy cycle: (1) policy framing (public and policymaker understandings/assumptions concerning the target group, the location of accountability for the marginal position of the policy recipient and the policy’s political/social goals); and (2) the shaping and formative structure of these policies (how the relevant policies came into existence and what they look like) ...|$|E

30|$|Using {{data from}} the ‘Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services’, Black et al.

Similarly, using data from Denmark, Graversen and van Ours (2008) find that being assigned to a mandatory <b>activation</b> <b>programme</b> increases job finding rates of newly unemployed. Using data from three experiments in Sweden, Hägglund (2011) provides evidence on increased exit rates from unemployment insurance benefit receipt due to programme assignment in Jämtland, where a broad group of unemployment insurance recipients was targeted. In contrast, he does not find well-determined threat effects in Uppsala and Östergötland, where locally specific groups were targeted. To the best of our knowledge, only one study for Germany is based on experimental data.

40|$|Although {{activation}} {{services such}} as monitoring, training, or job subsidies {{have been shown to}} increase exits from unemployment, there is little comprehensive evidence about the effects of activation during recessions.

This programme required specific unemployment benefit recipients to meet jobcentre caseworkers and then participate in active labour market policies. Our analysis draws on rich longitudinal data, the programme's focus on those unemployed for at least six months, and fuzzy regression discontinuity methods. We find that, despite the weak labour market, the programme is very successful as it doubles the monthly reemployment probability. The results are robust to a number of checks, including a falsification exercise based on pre-programme data and an analysis of non-employment and income effects. Moreover, in a novel IV approach using information on all unemployed, we find no evidence of substitution effects such as decreased transitions to employment amongst non-eligible individuals...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{frontline}} delivery of activation services in three Dutch municipal social assistance agencies, aimed at stimulating unemployed {{people to find}} work. Further, the study explores how the delivery of activation work can be understood from policy and organisational choices regarding activation. The study develops ideal types for bureaucratic and professional activation work to characterise the activation practices. Empirical data comes from interviews with workers and key-informants {{as well as from}} observations of interactions of workers with clients. The research finds considerable variation which is conceptualised as three types of activation work: •a professional ‘interventionist’ type, consisting of individualised guidance to the unemployed to find work, primarily based on ‘professional’ norms regarding effective activation; •a mixed bureaucratic/professional ‘director’ type, consisting of the selection of external <b>activation</b> <b>programmes</b> and administrative monitoring. In this type, some workers primarily act as bureaucrats, following guidelines whenever possible. Others use their own ‘professional’ judgement to select external services; •a bureaucratic ‘administrator’ type, in which workers primarily focus on benefit administration and consider activation work to be a marginal task. They refer clients to a limited number of programmes based on policy guidelines. Rule bending and rationing are identified as coping strategies used by all three types. The professional standards the workers adhere to are interpreted as ‘pre-professional’ because they lack a general professional legitimacy that transcends local practices. This can be understood given the lack of specific professional qualifications for activation work and the limited professional institutionalisation of activation work. The study finds the following policy and organisational choices to be stimulating the bureaucratic or professional nature of the work and the occurrence of coping strategies. Professional service delivery is stimulated by: •the policy choice for individualised service delivery; •the absence of strict regulation of the service delivery; •output steering based on activation results. Bureaucratic service delivery is stimulated by: •the choice for a limited number of activation programmes; •outsourcing of service delivery in combination with administrative monitoring tasks; •the combination of activation tasks, benefit administration and high caseloads; •output steering on the number of activation plans, referrals to certain <b>activation</b> <b>programmes</b> and standard review meetings with clients. Coping strategies can be understood given: •strict steering on administrative accountability in combination with high workloads; •high caseloads; •output steering based on number of activation plans, referrals to certain <b>activation</b> <b>programmes</b> and standard review meetings with clients. These results show that the nature of activation work is not self-evidently bureaucratic or professional. Therefore, the role of bureaucracy and professionalism in activation work and possibly other new types of frontline work needs careful attention. These variations contribute to a lack of transparency regarding the norms that workers follow. In combination with the pre-professional activation norms this raises normative accountability issues. The study gives recommendations regarding the further development of activation work in the Netherlands. It is argued that developing activation as a professional, rather than a bureaucratic, function is the most viable option...|$|R

30|$|The {{conclusion}} so {{far from}} the experiments is that counselling is effective – especially for newly unemployed. In addition, early activation is in some cases effective since it leads to increased search activities before actual participation. It is, however, also clear that activation has a locking-in effect and therefore tends to prolong unemployment spells for unemployed who participate in activation. On top of this are the costs of running <b>activation</b> <b>programmes.</b> To decrease both the locking-in effects and the costs of programmes there has been a shift from more expensive programmes like class-room training to less expensive programmes like work practice, where the unemployed has an internship at a private or public firm for on average 4 weeks on unemployment benefits. Although it has been the intention to implement a more work-related activation policy, it has not been implemented in the experiments in a sufficiently clean way to allow for a test of the effectiveness of the two training schemes against each other.|$|R

40|$|Activation {{policies}} such as sanctions, workfare {{employment and}} counselling and monitoring schemes {{have been found}} to speed up labour market reintegration. At the same time, it has been suspected that this quicker reintegration is paid for with worse job quality, e. g. in terms of lower wages. I contribute to this discussion by analysing the effects of a workfare (counselling and monitoring) scheme from Germany on employment probability and post-unemployment wages via regression-adjusted matching estimations. This scheme tightens behavioural requirements for unemployed workers but also offers support in terms of more intense counselling. The results point to a strongly positive effect on employment probability but no effect on wages. They are robust to changes in the matching algorithm, and placebo tests refute concerns about endogenous selection or substitution effects. These findings contrast the results from previous research on sanctions, which confirmed a negative effect on job quality. This puzzle suggests that the existence of adverse effects on job quality depends on the type of <b>activation</b> <b>programme.</b> While it may indeed be there for very intense kinds of activation, it can be avoided if the right balance between pressuring and supportive components is found...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade the {{active labour market policy}} (ALMP), {{primarily}} in the Netherlands and in Scandinavia, has been evaluated innumerable times. The common denominator for most evaluations is their focus on employment as dependent variable (see eg.

For many long-time unemployed people, the road contains more bumps than one to reach employment, and the research needs to take this into consideration.
