500|$|According to the singer, {{the clip}} portrays [...] "a {{day in the}} life of the earth to show that we <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> forward to the end of the 1900s century at full speed. I think Jonas made an {{excellent}} interpretation of the song, although he forced me to dance like crazy for two days. He's a tough director". Inspiration came from the 1982 American experimental film, Koyaanisqatsi, which showed time-lapse footage of cities. Madonna's scenes were shot in early April 1998 at MTV's Times Square studios in New York and Los Angeles. Background scenes were shot in various cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London, Las Vegas, and Stockholm. Test shots taken in Stockholm were presented to Madonna, for conveying the idea behind the clip, but they were deemed good to be used in the final product.|$|E
500|$|Humphrey's {{progress}} with {{civil rights in}} Minneapolis gained national attention, with many cities inquiring about how they could establish their own civil rights commissions. In 1947, he was reelected with 102,000 votes over his opponent's 52,000 votes. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he led the call for a strong civil rights plank. In his address, he said, [...] "There {{are those who say}} to you– we <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years late. There are those who say– this issue of civil rights is an infringement on states rights. The time has arrived for the Democratic Party {{to get out of the}} shadow of state's rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights." [...] Humphrey was elected to the United States Senate in the 1948 election and served many years as a prominent Minnesota politician, including Vice President of the U.S. from 1965–1969.|$|E

She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode [...] "Camping," [...] locks her {{in a room and}} refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice, its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of stance-direction used by snowboarders. A [...] "regular" [...] stance places the rider's left foot {{at the front of the}} snowboard. [...] "Goofy", the {{opposite}} stance direction, places the rider's right foot at the front, as in skateboarding. Regular is the most common. There are different ways to determine whether a rider is [...] "regular" [...] or [...] "goofy". One method used for first time riders is to observe the first step forward when walking or climbing up stairs. The first foot forward would be the foot set up at the front of the snowboard. Another method used for first time riders is to use the same foot that you kick a football with as your back foot (though this can be an inaccurate sign for some, as there are people who prefer goofy though are right handed, and therefore naturally kick a football with their right foot). This is a good method for setting up the snowboard stance for a new snowboarder. However having a surfing or skateboarding background will also help a person determine their preferred stance, although not all riders will have the same stance skateboarding and snowboarding. Another way to determine a rider's stance is to get the rider to run and slide on a tiled or wooden floor, wearing only socks, and observe which foot the person puts forward during the slide. This simulates the motion of riding a snowboard and exposes that persons natural tendency to put a particular foot forward. Another method is to stand behind the first-timer and give them a shove, enough for them to put one foot forward to stop themselves from falling. Other good ways of determining which way you ride <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> a door (leading shoulder equals leading foot) or going into a defensive boxing stance (see which foot goes forward).|$|E

What with advertising, establishing agencies, &c., you have got an enormous lot of machinery under way and hard at work in a wonderfully short space of time. It is easy to see, when one travels around, that one must be endowed with a deal of genuine generalship in order to maneuvre a publication whose line of battle stretches {{from end to end}} of a great continent, and whose foragers and skirmishers invest every hamlet and besiege every village hidden away in all the vast space between.|$|E

Now the holes in this line which are near each other have {{certainly}} something to do with each other. For instance, when the earth shook the other day round the volcanos of Quito, it shook also round the volcanos of Peru, though they were 600 miles away. And there are many stories of earthquakes being felt, or awful underground thunder heard, while volcanos were breaking out hundreds of miles away. I will give you a very curious instance of that.|$|E

60|$|Sir, {{the agents}} and {{distributors}} of falsehoods have, with their usual industry, circulated another lie, {{of the same}} nature with the former.

No longer awed, it seems, with the spirit of the former rulers, they thought themselves a match for what our calumniators choose to qualify by the name of so feeble a ministry as succeeded. Feeble in one sense these men certainly may be called: for, with all their efforts, and they have made many, they {{have not been able to}} resist the distempered vigor and insane alacrity with which you <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> to your ruin. But it does so happen, that the falsity of this circulation is (like the rest) demonstrated by indisputable dates and records.|$|E
