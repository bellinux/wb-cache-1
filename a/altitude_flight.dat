The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and <b>altitude</b> <b>flight</b> restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E

25|$|The XP-39 {{made its}} maiden flight on 6 April 1938. at Wright Field, Ohio, {{achieving}} 390mph (630km/h) at 20,000ft (6,100m), reaching this altitude in only five minutes.

25|$|Breathing gases for use at reduced ambient {{pressure}} {{are used for}} high <b>altitude</b> <b>flight</b> in unpressurised aircraft, in space flight, particularly in space suits, and for high altitude mountaineering. In all these cases, the primary consideration is providing an adequate partial pressure of oxygen. In some cases the breathing gas has oxygen added {{to make up a}} sufficient concentration, and in other cases the breathing gas may be pure or nearly pure oxygen. Closed circuit systems may be used to conserve the breathing gas, which may be in limited supply - in the case of mountaineering the user must carry the supplemental oxygen, and in space flight the cost of lifting mass into orbit is very high.|$|E
25|$|Saab and Honeywell co-developed an {{automatic}} digital {{flight control system}} for the JA 37 Viggen, which has been {{claimed to be the}} first such system in a production aircraft. To assist low <b>altitude</b> <b>flight,</b> a Honeywell radar altimeter with transmitter and receiver in the canard wings was used. The aircraft was also fitted with a Decca Type 72 Doppler navigation radar. TILS (Tactical Instrument Landing System), a landing-aid system made by Cutler-Hammer AIL, improved landing accuracy to 30m from the threshold on the short highway airbase system. In order to effectively enforce Sweden's air space, the Viggen was integrated with STRIL 60 national defence system. The JA 37 Viggen was also equipped with a Garrett AiResearch digital Central Air Data Computer, modified from the unit used upon the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.|$|E
50|$|By this point, the {{opposition}} to the project was becoming increasingly vocal.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of weather conditions, {{temporal}} factors and distance to coast on the <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> of migrating waterbirds in Western Estonia. We used a laser range finder and marine surveillance radar to measure <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes,</b> and identified significant effects on avian <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> by several weather components, particularly wind conditions, visi-bility and cloud cover. Wind components played a particularly significant role. Tailwinds were generally associated with elevated <b>flight</b> <b>altitude,</b> and reductions in <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> were usually associated with high wind speed, possibly because of enhanced energetic costs or risk of being blown off course. Behavioural and physical adaptations to the envi-ronment also contributed to specific flight-altitude selection. The results provide new in-sights into factors determining <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> and useful information to support environ-mental impact assessments. 1...|$|R

25|$|The Stainforth Trophy was {{designed}} by Robin Beresford. The trophy depicts in silver three supersonic aircraft and spiralling vapour trails soaring into the stratosphere. The artist also tried to display {{an awareness of the}} achievements of the Schneider Trophy Team in the design, being aware that these achievements resulted in the improved design and development, by R. J. Mitchell, of the Spitfire, which played such a major role in Britain's victory in World War II. In the design of the trophy, the artist has tried to show the Earth as seen by the astronauts, vapour trails ending in arrows to depict high speed <b>altitude</b> <b>flight,</b> and with an outward sweep to infinity, which suggests that the sky is literally the limit of man's achievement in the air. Into his design, he has incorporated a star and its orbit to evoke the achievements of science and the Royal Air Force motto Per ardua ad astra.|$|E
500|$|The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More {{representative}} of production aircraft, it was lengthened {{to accommodate a}} longer nose undercarriage leg, featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of [...] thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the control wheel. Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of [...] thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high <b>altitude</b> <b>flight</b> envelope, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down. The solution included the [...] "phase 2" [...] wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer introduced a nose-up attitude when at high speeds; the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight.|$|E

The bomber nose was altered using a normal fighter nose, armed with four standard [...]303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns.

Nevertheless, the general need for high altitude interceptors was recognised - but now the emphasis was to be upon night fighters.|$|E
