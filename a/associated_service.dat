25|$|The New Deal for Country Passengers was a {{timetable}} introduced on 4 October 1981 in Victoria, Australia which revolutionised {{the provision of}} country passenger railway services. Thirty-five little-used passenger stations were closed, rolling stock utilisation was improved, and new rolling stock introduced. The timetable and <b>associated</b> <b>service</b> changes resulted in an average patronage growth of 8.7% per year, from 3 million in 1981 to 5.6 million passengers in 1990/91.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} Malaya to Europe grew rapidly during the 18th century. The fast-growing tea trade between China and United Kingdom increased {{the demand for}} high-quality Malayan tin, which was used to line tea-chests. Malayan pepper also had a high reputation in Europe, while Kelantan and Pahang had gold mines. The growth of tin and gold mining and <b>associated</b> <b>service</b> industries led to the first influx of foreign settlers into the Malay world — initially Arabs and Indians, later Chinese.|$|E
25|$|After 1996, 13% of the Iraqi oil {{sales were}} {{allocated}} for Iraqi Kurdistan and {{this led to}} a relative prosperity in the region. Saddam had established an oil smuggling route through territory controlled by the KDP, with the active involvement of senior Barzani family members. The taxation of this trade at the crossing point between Saddam’s territory and Kurdish controlled territory and then into Turkey, along with <b>associated</b> <b>service</b> revenue, meant that whoever controlled Dohuk and Zakho had the potential to earn several million dollars a week. Direct United States mediation led the two parties to a formal ceasefire in what was termed the Washington Agreement in September 1998. It is also argued that the Oil-for-Food Programme from 1997 onward had an important effect on cessation of hostilities.|$|E

500|$|Castro {{was adamant}} that the {{missiles}} remain but Mikoyan, seeking {{to avoid a}} full-fledged confrontation with the United States, attempted to convince him otherwise.

But after several tense and grueling weeks of negotiations, he finally relented and the missiles and the bombers were removed in December of that year.|$|E

60|$|In {{a survey}} of Mr. Gladstone’s performances, some would place this of which I have last spoken, as {{foremost}} among his services to the country. Others would call him greatest in the <b>associated</b> <b>service</b> of a skilful handling and adjustment {{of the burden of}} taxation; or the strengthening of the foundations of national prosperity and well-being by his reformation of the tariff. Yet others again choose to remember him for his share in guiding the successive extensions of popular power, and simplifying and purifying electoral machinery. Irishmen at least, and others so far as they are able to comprehend the history and vile wrongs and sharp needs of Ireland, will have no doubt what rank in legislation they will assign to the establishment of religious equality and agrarian justice in that portion of the realm. Not a few will count first the vigour with which he repaired what had been an erroneous judgment of his own and of vast hosts of his countrymen, by his courage in carrying through the submission of the Alabama claims to arbitration. Still more, looking from west to east, in this comparison among his achievements, will judge alike in its result and in the effort that produced it, nothing equal to the valour and insight with which he burst the chains of a mischievous and degrading policy as to the Ottoman empire. When we look at this exploit, how in face of an opponent of genius and authority and a tenacity not inferior to his own, in face of strongly rooted tradition on behalf of the Turk, and an easily roused antipathy against the Russian, by his own energy and strength of arm he wrested the rudder from the hand of the helmsman and put about the course of the ship, and held England back from the enormity of trying to keep several millions of men and women under the yoke of barbaric oppression and misrule,—we may say that this great feat alone was fame enough for one statesman. Let us make what choice we will of this or that particular achievement, how splendid a list it is of benefits conferred and public work effectually performed. Was he a good parliamentary tactician, they ask? Was his eye sure, his hand firm, his measurement of forces, distances, and possibilities of change in wind and tide accurate? Did he usually hit the proper moment for a magisterial intervention? Experts did not (M191) always agree on his quality as tactician. At least he was pilot enough to bring many valuable cargoes safely home.|$|E
