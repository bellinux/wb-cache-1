5|$|When {{stationary}} fronts become {{smaller in}} scale, degenerating {{to a narrow}} zone where wind direction changes over a short distance, they become known as shear lines. If the shear line becomes active with thunderstorms, it may support formation of a tropical storm or a regeneration of the feature back into a stationary front. <b>A</b> <b>shear</b> line is depicted as a line of red dots and dashes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1946, the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Eastern Pacific moved {{north of}} its typical position. An {{associated}} weather disturbance moved over Central America and interacted with a surface low-pressure area over Guatemala. Meanwhile, a broad high-pressure area moved over the United States behind an intense storm that moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Connected to the cyclone was <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> line stretching from Bermuda to the Caribbean Sea, which spawned an upper-level low over open waters. It moved westward on October 4, and {{by the next day}} it was located over the Southeastern United States. The feature over Guatemala began moving toward the northeast as the upper-level low approached and began deepening. Modern-day analysis estimates that the system became a tropical storm early on October 5, shortly after emerging into the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E

25|$|Sound {{waves in}} solids are {{composed}} of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and {{a different type of}} sound wave called <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> wave, which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in seismology. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's compressibility, shear modulus and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.|$|E

25|$|Fanno flow {{refers to}} {{adiabatic}} flow through a constant area duct where {{the effect of}} friction is considered. Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Fanno flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow {{is assumed to be}} steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an irreversible process due to viscous effects. The viscous friction causes the flow properties to change along the duct. The frictional effect is modeled as <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> stress at the wall acting on the fluid with uniform properties over any cross section of the duct.|$|E
25|$|By 1895, steel had {{replaced}} cast iron as skyscrapers' structural material. Its malleability {{allowed it to}} be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections. The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.|$|E
25|$|The {{large size}} of the monolete pollen of Macroneuropteris and other seed ferns {{suggests}} {{that they may not}} have been well adapted to wind dispersal. This raises speculation about the possibility of insect pollination. One of those possibilities is Arthropleura, a very large millipede of the carboniferous. Scott and Taylor (1983) studied seed-fern pollen on the plates of Arthropleura and thought they might have a role in pollination. W. <b>A.</b> <b>Shear</b> and others have noted that this is very unlikely due to the size of Arthropleura. Other insects of the carboniferous however may have been pollinators. The cycads, a modern seed plant with some similar affinities to seed ferns, were previously thought to only be pollinated by wind. New studies have confirmed the role of Thrips and other beetles in their pollination. This form of pollination is now known to be present {{as far back as the}} Cretaceous. A similar relationship may have occurred between these seed ferns and some carboniferous insects.|$|E

25|$|During the {{formation}} of the GLTZ, the MRV protocontinent consumed the Superior province's oceanic crust as the subprovince came in from the south. Suturing of one continental block onto another usually occurs because a subduction zone exists beneath one of the blocks. The subduction zone consumes the oceanic crust connected to the other block. After the oceanic crust is consumed, the two blocks meet and the subducting oceanic crust pulls the attached continental block under the other. During the collision with the Superior province, the MRV gneissic block was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge; this resulted in a thrusted crumpled fault tens of kilometers wide producing a mountain range, and <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> zone which defines the boundary between the two terranes. Tectonism along the zone began during the docking of the two terranes into a single continental mass, and culminated in the early Proterozoic, where deformation took place under low to intermediate pressures.|$|E
25|$|The Mona Lisa example pictured {{at right}} {{provides}} a simple illustration. Each {{point on the}} painting can be represented as a vector pointing {{from the center of}} the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice that points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft soil layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E
