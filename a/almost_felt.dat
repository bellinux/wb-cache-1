500|$|The {{final scene}} in the episode, {{featuring}} Bart and Lisa fighting in the arena, has received overwhelmingly positive remarks from reviewers. Canning wrote that it was [...] "a classic moment for the series [...] This <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> like a moment that could have closed out the series." [...] Hughes commented that it was [...] "the best moment of the night" [...] as it [...] "would have been a typical ending" [...] {{if it had not}} added the twist preceding the credits. Melissa and Randall Baker of TV Guide magazine said that the scene was a moment of [...] "girl power", as Lisa knocks out Bart easily with one punch.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} stages of The King of Fighters '99, SNK planned to exclude Iori and Kyo from the game, as the story's focus {{was meant to}} center on the new protagonist, K'. However, they reversed this decision because of the characters' popularity. Iori's, Kyo's, and other SNK regulars repeated appearances in the series is {{at the insistence of}} the marketers and main planners, making it a challenge to decide the story for each title. Because of his popularity among fans, some of the series' main designers have stated that he is [...] "difficult to draw for". Illustrator Shinkiro thought Iori was one of the series' wildest characters because of his hairstyle; similar sentiments were expressed by Last Blade illustrator, Tonko. [...] In addition, [...] producer Falcoon stated that attempting to change an [...] "untouchable" [...] design such as Iori's put him under severe pressure. He stated that creating Iori's alternate design that appears in the Maximum Impact series <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "unforgivable", as he felt unsure of fans' reaction to the change.|$|E
500|$|Claire Zulkey of The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "In {{some ways the}} episode <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> too comfortable, with the {{familiar}} story lines and even the obligatory fantasy featuring Baldwin as a former president. The show, thus far post-strike, hasn't seemed like it has distinguished itself too much from Season 1. [...] But is that really so bad?" [...] Ann Oldenburg of USA Today said that [...] "As always, [...] 30 Rock was filled with fast one-liners." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Even for the always politically astute 30 Rock, last night's episode was unusually so." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] episode of 30 Rock had more jokes and one-liners - the kind where you actually smile and laugh out loud" [...] and that [...] "There's no other comedy that's running on all cylinders like 30 Rock is right now." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] was filled not with just great laughs, but also some heart. Damn the roller coaster that is the crazy Dennis-and-Liz on-again/off-again thing!" ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} [...] "It was the atmosphere that sold me on [...] "Northwest Passage", an episode {{with a fairly}} middling mystery and only minimal advancement of the master-plot. (Though the end-point of that advancement was a doozy, and has me eating a little crow.) At times tonight the show <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> like a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Peter tooling around the Pacific Northwest meeting local law enforcement and cracking cases. And while that's a show I'd definitely watch, I confess I'm anxious to jump ahead to next week, when there'll be inter-dimensional conflict and doppelgangers galore". Murray considered the ending {{with the appearance of}} Walternate a [...] "strong finish to a mostly strong episode". IGN's Ramsey Isler gave it 7.8/10, writing that [...] "Fringe sophomore season is building up to an epic 2-part finale. This episode doesn't reveal much in terms of overall Fringe mythology until the very awesome ending, and even then it just confirms what we already knew or suspected. Still, this installment deserves credit for using a different formula and giving Joshua Jackson some much-deserved time in the spotlight all by himself".|$|E
500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here because so much of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Bradfield {{commented that}} Journal for Plague Lovers {{was an attempt}} to finally secure the legacy of their former member Richey Edwards and the result was that, during the {{recording}} process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: [...] "There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part of the whole thing of letting enough time lapse. Once we actually got into the studio, it <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> as if we were a full band; it [...] as close to him being in the room again as possible." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Village in 2004, Shyamalan had been {{planning}} a film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi with 20th Century Fox, but later backed out {{so that he could}} make Lady in the Water. [...] "I love that book. I mean, it's basically [...] a kid born in the same city as me — it <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> predestined", Shyamalan said. [...] "But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon as you put my name on it, everybody would have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie".|$|E
2500|$|Peppino's brother Giovanni {{declared}} {{before the}} Italian Antimafia Commission: [...] "It seemed that Badalamenti was well liked by the carabinieri {{as he was}} calm, reliable, and always liked a chat. It <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> like he was doing them a favour in that nothing ever happened in Cinisi, it was a quiet little town. If anything, we were subversives who made nuisances of ourselves. This was what the carabinieri thought. When I {{had a chance to}} speak to one of them – something which didn't happen often because I didn't really trust them – I realised that it was a widely held belief that Tano Badalamenti was a gentleman and it was us who were the trouble-makers." [...] "I often used to see them walking arm in arm with Tano Badalamenti and his henchmen. You can't have faith in the institutions when you see the police arm in arm with mafiosi." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Berdella voluntarily {{withdrew from}} the Kansas City Art Institute after {{receiving}} harsh criticism from college administrators for killing, then cooking a duck {{for the sake of}} art. He chose to remain in Kansas City and in September of that year, he moved into an address located within the Hyde Park district of Kansas City: 4315 Charlotte Street. Having by this stage long been open about being gay, Berdella [...] began spending much of his free time with male prostitutes, drug addicts, petty criminals, and runaways. These individuals he would typically befriend, then try to help free them from their drug addictions and general lethargic or criminal lifestyles, and he was adamant that, throughout much of the 1970s, he had no physical contact whatsoever with any of these individuals. To several of his neighbors, Berdella stated he gradually <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> like a foster parent to many of these youths. Nonetheless, by the early 1980s, many of his older acquaintances had ceased any form of social contact with him, thus meaning Berdella increasingly relied on these young men as a source of companionship and friendship. He would retrospectively claim to have become increasingly frustrated at many of these individuals' collective ignorance to his efforts to assist them to steer their lifestyles away from harm and deterioration, and their basic flouting of him.|$|E

2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I <b>almost</b> <b>felt</b> that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
