5|$|In Uruguay, {{the album}} was {{released}} in 1974 as a single LP (with just the first two sides) on Odeon Records. It used <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> sleeve design unlike any other release, with a rising sun on the cover.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the referendum, Cameron {{raised the issue of}} 'English votes for English laws', with Miliband criticising the move as <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> {{solution}} to a complex problem, eventually coming out in favour for a constitutional convention to be held after the general election.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance has <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> {{combat system}} with the player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can be {{attacked}} using ships, missiles and agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and anti-missile turrets shoot out incoming missiles.|$|E

50|$|Up to 100 units {{could be}} {{controlled}} in the overhead two-dimensional mode. The three-dimensional mode featured <b>a</b> very <b>simplistic</b> and generic graphics interface for vehicle controls.|$|R
5000|$|Which is a {{polynomial}} number [...] of subsets {{rather than}} an exponential number. Intuitively this means that a finite VC-index implies that [...] has <b>an</b> apparent <b>simplistic</b> structure.|$|R
5|$|The {{recordings}} compiled for Coltrane for Lovers initially received {{criticism for}} Coltrane's stylistic move from complex jazz compositions {{of the free}} jazz form to <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> formula of ballads and blues. Following the initial controversy, the album's recordings gained a legacy as one of Coltrane's most popular recordings and significant in the genre of romantic jazz. The tracks were compiled by producer Richard Seidel and remastering engineer was Allan Tucker at Foothill Digital, New York City.|$|E
5|$|Ferb {{was given}} <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> {{structure}} so that young audiences {{would be able}} to draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E
5|$|The line is, {{along with}} the Namsos Line, the only railway line in Norway to holistically employ Neoclassical architecture. All the {{original}} stations were designed by R. Werenskiold, who used <b>a</b> <b>simplistic,</b> wooden interpretation of the 1920s Neoclassicism. The station buildings at Figgjo and Ålgård have been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. The line eventually received additional stops, and in 1955, there were stations at Holane, Vagle, Foss-Eikeland, Kalberg, Bråstein, Figgjo Fajanse, Figgjo, Figgjo fabrikker and Ålgård. Some trains operated to Sandnes Station, whilst others continued {{all the way to}} Stavanger Station.|$|E
2500|$|Inside the DS, {{there was}} often <b>a</b> {{somewhat}} <b>simplistic</b> distinction between reformists (riformisti) and radicals (radicali), indicating respectively the party's mainstream and its left-wing. The party also included several organised factions.|$|R
50|$|Released {{as part of}} {{the first}} wave of movie Legends toys, this Micro class 3 inch long Saleen S281E is 1/63 scale to the real vehicle and has <b>an</b> {{extremely}} <b>simplistic</b> transformation.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes <b>a</b> very <b>simplistic</b> {{approach}} to masking is adopted through applying a null value {{to a particular}} field. The null value approach is really only useful to prevent visibility of the data element.|$|R
5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person {{perspective}} puzzle game. The Player {{takes the}} role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robotsAtlas and P-Bodyin the cooperative campaign, or as <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint; in the cooperative game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle. The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.|$|E
5|$|The Grolier Codex (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Sáenz Codex) is a Maya book of a pre-Columbian type but of disputed authenticity. It first appeared in a private collection in the 20th century and was displayed at the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name. The codex consists of a fragment of a Maya book, containing almanacs of Venus represented in <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> fashion. The Grolier Codex would be only the fourth surviving pre-Columbian Maya book if genuine. The codex {{is said to have been}} recovered from a cave in the Mexican state of Chiapas in the 1960s, together with a mosaic mask and some blank pages of pre-Columbian fig-bark paper. It was displayed at the Grolier Club from April 20 to June 5, 1971, and is now held in Mexico City. In 1973, Michael D. Coe published the first half-size recto-side facsimile of the codex in The Maya Scribe and His World, produced by the Grolier Club. The codex contains a Venus almanac that, in structure, is closely related to the Venus almanac contained in the Dresden Codex.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{to the song}} is <b>a</b> fairly <b>simplistic</b> one. The video was {{directed}} by Marc Klasfeld, who also directed the music video for her previous hit single [...] "A Thousand Miles".|$|R

50|$|The final {{movement}} is an intense fugue, utilizing <b>a</b> jarring, <b>simplistic</b> theme throughout. Though technically a four-voice fugue, certain passages introduce {{as many as}} six voices. The fugue is very difficult to perform, and ends bombastically.|$|R
25|$|The basic {{operation}} of the REPL is as follows. This is <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> description which omits many elements of a real Lisp, such as quoting and macros.|$|E
25|$|One deck overlooks runway 5L/23R {{near the}} air traffic control tower and {{park-and-ride}} lot 2. It has a playground with <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> model of RDU's runways for kids and air traffic communications are broadcast via a loudspeaker for the curious public.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, Burger King {{began using}} the {{original}} animated King design {{from the late}} 1960s and early 1970s commercials on its cups, bags and in non tie-in kids advertising. The second generation King is portrayed as a sarcastic type who sometimes gets in trouble for his mischief making adventures, and appears as <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> hand puppet.|$|E
50|$|However, {{critics like}} Clayton Riley from the New York Times argued that Blaxploitation films {{provided}} <b>an</b> overly <b>simplistic</b> view of African Americans, {{which could have}} had detrimental effects, potentially making African Americans more submissive to societal injustice.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} {{characters and}} Digimon that {{were included in}} the first three seasons of the animated series of the same name in <b>a</b> somewhat <b>simplistic</b> fighting scenario, and also has slightly arranged samples of the show's soundtrack.|$|R
5000|$|The Blaney-Criddle {{equation}} is <b>a</b> relatively <b>simplistic</b> method for calculating evapotranspiration. When sufficient meteorological data is available the Penman-Monteith {{equation is}} usually preferred. However, the Blaney-Criddle equation is ideal when only air-temperature datasets {{are available for}} a site.|$|R
25|$|Much {{sophisticated}} and important thought {{has taken place}} after the writing of Marx and Engels; much or perhaps even all {{of it has been}} influenced, subtly or overtly, by Marxism. Simply dismissing all philosophy as sophistry might condemn Marxism to <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> empiricism or economism, crippling it in practice and making it comically simplistic at the level of theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{inspection}} of railway equipment {{is essential for}} the safe movement of trains. Many types of defect detectors are in use on the world's railroads. These devices utilize technologies that vary from <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> paddle and switch to infrared and laser scanning, and even ultrasonic audio analysis. Their use has avoided many rail accidents over the 70 years they have been used.|$|E
25|$|A {{histogram}} can {{be thought}} of as <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> kernel density estimation, which uses a kernel to smooth frequencies over the bins. This yields a smoother probability density function, which will in general more accurately reflect distribution of the underlying variable. The density estimate could be plotted as an alternative to the histogram, and is usually drawn as a curve rather than a set of boxes.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{modeling}} of physics, a toy model is <b>a</b> deliberately <b>simplistic</b> model with many details removed {{so that it}} can be used to explain a mechanism concisely. It is also useful in a description of the fuller model.|$|R
30|$|Differentiating the {{potential}} of each task types in creating a medium for language engagement {{on the part of}} participants is <b>a</b> very <b>simplistic</b> view and this view masks {{the potential}} of each task type in engaging students at ideational level.|$|R
50|$|Legoland (stylized as LEGOLAND) is a Legoland-themed {{construction}} and management simulation video game. It shares many aspects with the RollerCoaster Tycoon series (a similar series of games with an identical premise) but with <b>a</b> more <b>simplistic</b> and child-friendly gameplay style.|$|R
25|$|According to Christopher Toumey, LaRouche's charismatic {{authority}} within {{the movement is}} grounded on members' belief that he possesses a unique level of insight and expertise. He identifies an emotionally charged issue, conducts in-depth research into it, then proposes <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> solution, usually involving restructuring of the economy or national security apparatus. He and the membership portray anyone opposing him as immoral {{and part of the}} conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Richard Feynman {{noted that}} <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> {{interpretation}} of the relativistic Dirac equation runs into problems with electron orbitals at Z > 1/α ≈ 137 {{as described in the}} sections below, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond element 137, and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals therefore breaks down at this point. On the other hand, a more rigorous analysis calculates the limit to be Z ≈ 173.|$|E
25|$|Lübeck's Clavier-Übung of 1728 {{consists}} of a single harpsichord suite, in which the traditional dances (allemande, courante, sarabande and gigue) are preceded by a prelude and fugue, and a chaconne, which is <b>a</b> <b>simplistic</b> two-voice piece, in which the chorale melody Lobt Gott, ihr Christen allzugleich by Nikolaus Herman is combined with an eight-bar ostinato. The suite, on the other hand, is much more advanced and exhibits some of the virtuosic qualities found in Lübeck's organ works.|$|E
50|$|This is <b>a</b> highly <b>simplistic</b> classification. Each major zone {{is divided}} into subzones, and there are {{transitional}} vegetation types. Moreover, many zapovedniks, especially if in a transitional zone or covering a range of altitudes, will contain examples of several vegetation types.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his recent}} works, Shams Langeroodi has shown {{interest}} in <b>a</b> more <b>simplistic</b> approach to language. While imagery still {{plays a major}} part, simplicity and sarcasm are the new elements in his work that is engaged with Iran's social condition.|$|R
5000|$|The CPU {{allocation}} for virtual machines can {{be adjusted}} dynamically with a granularity of 1% or 1 MHz. CPU time is allocated by a fair-share scheduler, which delivers better CPU utilization for SMP guests than <b>a</b> more <b>simplistic</b> gang scheduler.|$|R
