500|$|After the Liberal {{losses in}} the 1910 elections, ILP member and {{journalist}} Henry Brailsford helped organise a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage, which gathered 54 MPs from various parties. The group's Conciliation Bill {{looked to be a}} narrowly defined but still significant possibility to achieve the vote for women. Thus the WSPU agreed to suspend its support for window-breaking and hunger strikes while it was being negotiated. When {{it became clear that the}} bill would not pass, Pankhurst declared: [...] "If the Bill, in spite of our efforts, is killed by the Government, then... I have to say there is an end to the truce." [...] When it was defeated, Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 women to Parliament Square on 18 November. They were met with aggressive police response, directed by Home Secretary Winston Churchill: officers punched the marchers, twisted arms, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> women's breasts. Although Pankhurst was allowed to enter Parliament, Prime Minister Asquith refused to meet her. The incident became known as Black Friday.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{while the}} twins heard the Sun enter. [...] He removed his glowing hot disk from his back and hung it on the wall. [...] "Who has come here today?" [...] he asked the woman.

[...] "I know that two strangers are here," [...] said , [...] "And I demand {{to know where they}} are." [...] "Two young men did come here," [...] said the woman, [...] "and they claim they are your sons. [...] You have promised me that I am the only woman you see. [...] So whose sons are these?" [...] and she went to the bundle <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the blankets. [...] The twins fell to the floor, and at once grasped the hoop of feathers that Spider Woman had given them. [...] the Sun said, [...] "I will see if you are my sons," [...] and he seized them at once and hurled them against the sharp spikes of white shell on the eastern wall of his house. [...] The twins, holding the , bounced back unharmed. [...] The Sun seized them again and hurled them against the turquoise spikes on his southern wall. [...] Again they held the [...] and bounced back unharmed. [...] "You must survive two more tests," [...] said [...] [...] He took them outside where there was a great sweathouse, and he started a fire to heat the four large rocks within it. [...] While he did this, , the Wind, came up to the twins and whispered [...] "You must dig a tunnel to the outside and hide in it after you have answered his question." [...] The twins dug the tunnel while the Sun prepared the fire, and hid its opening with a stone. [...] The Sun then commanded them to enter the sweatlodge. [...] After a while [...] said, [...] "Is it hot in there?" [...] "Yes," [...] answered the twins, and then they hid in the tunnel they had dug. [...] suddenly poured a great quantity of water {{through the hole in the}} top of the sweatlodge, and when it hit the hot rocks they exploded and hot steam hissed. [...] After {{a while the}} twins crawled back into the sweatlodge. [...] called, [...] "Is it hot in there?" [...] expecting to get no answer. [...] But the twins answered, [...] "Not so hot as before." [...] The Sun opened the door. [...] "Perhaps you truly are my sons," [...] he said. [...] "Come inside, and we will smoke." ...|$|E

50|$|And only at that instant, a man, woman, boy or {{girl with}} the purest and bravest soul could cross it <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> a gold chain that would appear {{in the other side}} of the bridge <b>and</b> after <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> the chain, the city, buried by the curse of the Gods would reappear.|$|R
60|$|I sprang out of bed; <b>and,</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> a dressing-gown, {{followed}} Lawrence {{along the}} passage and the gallery {{to the right}} wing of the house.|$|R

60|$|The {{two horses}} left, {{belonging}} to Hardman and Purcell, neighed loudly at being left behind, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> their halters.|$|E
60|$|They {{adjusted}} the new sweep with care <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> it gradually. At first the houseboat refused to budge, but presently it swung {{around a little}} and then more and more.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed his}} collar and tie into his {{overcoat}} pocket. Then {{he sat down}} <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boots. They were sodden, as were his socks and trouser-bottoms. But he himself was quick and warm.|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, [...] "I've roped one of {{his hind}} legs. Now we'll pull him up a little, then we'll fasten this rope, <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{said the}} young man, rising <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> his overcoat. [...] "You {{have given me}} fresh life and hope. I shall {{certainly}} do as you advise." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{was a most}} miserable Sunday; {{and several}} of the sailors had twinges of the rheumatism, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> their monkey-jackets. As for Jackson, he was all the time rubbing his back and snarling like a dog.|$|E
60|$|Riggs made no reply, {{and went}} on rolling down his {{trousers}} leg, lapped a fold over at the bottom <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boot. Then he strode out toward the promontory. Half-way there he encountered Anson tramping back.|$|E
60|$|The Major {{took off}} his carpet {{slippers}} <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boots, while Patricia was {{getting ready for the}} walk. Uncle John wandered around the room aimlessly for a time, and then {{took off his}} black tie and put on the white one.|$|E
50|$|The mastoid {{process is}} absent or {{rudimentary}} in the neonatal skull. It forms postnatally (starts to develop after 1 year old), as the sternocleidomastoid muscle develops <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the bone.|$|R

60|$|Next came a promptitude of {{bellowed}} orders, and all {{the watch}} was slacking away after braces to starboard <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> after braces to port. I had already learned the manoeuvre. Mr. Pike was wearing ship.|$|R
60|$|She talked {{softly to}} herself a little while, then {{went over to}} the window <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the string of the curtain till it rolled up. Then she went back and looked at her mother. She grew tired of waiting at last.|$|E
60|$|We {{passed the}} bridge, {{and soon after}} that I asked if she saw the lock. She said no, {{she did not see}} any lock; and I said, “Oh!” <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on.</b> Another five minutes went by, and then I asked her to look again.|$|E
6000|$|He bounced {{out of bed}} <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his pantaloons, and was down-stairs in a minute.

Fire!" ...|$|E

50|$|At East Bergholt {{there is}} England's only bell cage {{which is in}} the graveyard, where the bells are rung by the ringers {{standing}} beside the bells <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> the headstock directly, rather like the Bolognese technique described below.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're cached {{right there}} in his cabin," [...] Shorty said. [...] "As sure as God made little apples, they are. But where? We sure {{overhauled}} it plenty."

60|$|At first, she {{preserved}} {{herself from}} criticism. She would {{not consider the}} professors as men, ordinary men who ate bacon, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> their boots before coming to college. They were the black-gowned priests of knowledge, serving for ever in a remote, hushed temple. They were the initiated, and {{the beginning and the}} end of the mystery was in their keeping.|$|E
60|$|The mate {{sprang from}} his bunk--just {{opposite}} to mine--and {{was on the}} cabin floor before the sentence was well finished. Thrusting the poker with violence into the cabin fire, he rushed on deck. I jumped up <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> coat, nether garments, and shoes, as if my life depended on my speed, wondering the while at the poker incident. There was unusual need for clothing, for the night was bitterly cold.|$|E

60|$|In {{another minute}} the galley came {{sweeping}} along, {{close to the}} boat. A dozen figures appeared over her side, {{and two or three}} ropes were thrown. John caught one, twisted it rapidly round Mary's body and his own, knotted it and, taking her in his arms, jumped overboard. Another minute they were drawn alongside the galley, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> board. As soon as the ropes were unfastened, John rose to his feet; but Mary lay, insensible, on the deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right you are, {{but no more}} hose {{water for}} me," [...] {{answered}} Tom, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the rubber with all his might. It parted about half way down the hallway, and into the room he darted with the piece in his hands. Then Sam and Dick closed the door, locked it, and shoved a bed and the table against the barrier. They also turned the button of the transom window so that the glass could not be swung back as before.|$|E
60|$|As soon, however, as {{he reached}} the shallow water and his feet touched the ground he threw his whole weight upon the rope.

The peasants regained their feet <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the rope and cords. Again the hippopotamus rose and was dragged to the shallow, only to break away again. For eight or ten times this happened.|$|E
