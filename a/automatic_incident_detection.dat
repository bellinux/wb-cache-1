40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to improve the reliability of <b>automatic</b> freeway <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> by applying the fuzzy logic system and neural networks. A Fuzzy Logic Incident Patrol System (FLIPS) is proposed to combine a fuzzy logic system and the learning capabilities of neural networks to form a connectionist model. The proposed system can be constructed automatically from training examples to find the optimum input/output term sets, input/output membership functions, and fuzzy logic rules. ^ The output of FLIPS is an <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> index which represents the possibility of an incident. These continuous indices can be sent to a freeway traffic operations center for further analysis. One example of such further analysis is the conversion of the continuous incident index value into a binary value predicting the absence or presence of an incident. The Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Threshold System (FLATS) is developed for this purpose. The FLATS produces an adaptive threshold for the conversion task based on the current <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> index provided by FLIPS. FLATS itself is also a fuzzy logic system with a recurrent neural network structure. Therefore, the threshold serves both as input and output parameters for FLATS. Like FLIPS, the FLATS can also be generated automatically from training examples. ^ In total, four artificial intelligence <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> models have been developed to evaluate the benefits of the proposed integrated learning process and adaptive threshold technique. The evaluation results show that the integrated learning process and adaptive threshold technique can significantly improve <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> performance. The FLATS-I, which incorporates proposed integrated learning process and adaptive threshold technique, exhibits superior <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> performance. ^ Finally, the research conducted comparisons of the FLATS-I with conventional <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms (i. e., the McMaster algorithm, the California algorithm, and the filtering technique) using the same incident database collected in Toronto, Canada. The evaluation results indicate that the FLATS-I provides promising improvements in the <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> and the persistence check technique used in the McMaster algorithm may not be an effective method to improve <b>incident</b> <b>detection.</b> ...|$|R

A logistic regression model is suitable when the outcome can take {{only a limited}} number of values. For traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detection,</b> the outcome is limited to only two values, the presence or absence of an incident. The logistic regression model used in this study is a generalized linear model (GLM) with a binomial response and a logit link function. This paper presents a framework to use logistic regression and wavelet-based feature extraction for traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detection.</b> It investigates the effect of preprocessing data on the performance of <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> models. Results of this study indicate that logistic regression along with wavelet based feature extraction can be used effectively for <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> by balancing the <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> rate and the false alarm rate according to need. Logistic regression on raw data resulted in a maximum detection rate of 95. 4 % at the cost of 14. 5 % false alarm rate. Whereas the hybrid model achieved a maximum detection rate of 98. 78 % at the expense of 6. 5 % false alarm rate.

To reduce the impact of an incident a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway.

Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for <b>automatic</b> <b>incident</b> <b>detection.</b> However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident.

40|$|Abstract: While the Video Image Detector {{became a}} popular choice for data {{gathering}} device of freeway management system, {{the outcome of}} operational experience for past years looks dismal.

This paper tackles on a practical issue faced by many agencies that dominantly deployed Video Image Detectors along its freeway. The main objective is to lower FAR for <b>Automatic</b> <b>Incident</b> <b>Detection</b> algorithms while keeping DR above reasonable performance criterion. High FAR often puts unbearable burden on TMC operators. A resorting approach was a heuristic adjustment to on-line data from one of two detector stations by applying correction factors or values.

The functionality of <b>automatic</b> <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> on expressways is a primary objective of advanced traffic management system.

This paper presents a methodology that integrates moving average (MA) model with stationary wavelet decomposition for <b>automatic</b> <b>incident</b> <b>detection,</b> in which parameters of layer coefficient are extracted from {{the difference between the}} upstream and downstream occupancy. Unlike other wavelet-based method presented before, firstly it smooths the raw data with MA model. Then it uses stationary wavelet to decompose, which can achieve accurate reconstruction of the signal, and does not shift the signal transfer coefficients. Thus, it can detect the incidents more accurately. The threshold to trigger incident alarm is also adjusted according to normal traffic condition with congestion. The methodology is validated with real data from Tokyo Expressway ultrasonic sensors. Experimental results show that it is accurate and effective, and that it can differentiate traffic accident from other condition such as recurring traffic congestion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Real time traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> is {{critical}} for increasing safety and mobility on freeways. There have been <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> approaches based on traffic behavior or mathematical models proposed for this task. However, earlier <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> methods are limited in distinguishing recurrent and non-recurrent congestions. The complexity of current approaches makes them insufficient to handle the real time task. In this paper, a new approach for detecting incidents is proposed. Different from traditional traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> methods, both spatial and temporal information are considered to find the potential incidents. Meanwhile, adaptive learning ability and short detection response time are achieved in the new method. To analyze the high dimensional traffic data, Mahalanobis distance is applied to discover potential incidents according to the traffic pattern. Lifeline style detection and visualization is utilized to provide intuitive user interface. Methodology analysis and preliminary evaluation have been performed to validate the detection effectiveness on the integrated traffic visualization system...|$|R

The success of fractal dimension analysis in modelling complex behaviour of real-world systems in fields as diverse as seismology, meteorology and economics provided the motivation for investigating this technique {{in the development of}} <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> models. The algorithms developed in this study were based on the notion that traffic parameters upstream of incidents and bottlenecks show substantial irregular behaviour when compared with downstream conditions. Fractal dimension analysis was used to provide a measure of the irregularity in traffic parameters. A number of fractal models based on a combination of smoothing and recursion tests on speed and occupancy data were developed in this study. These models were developed and tested using a real-world data set of 100 incidents. The best performing model was identified as that implementing smoothed fractal speed and occupancy inputs based on data collected from dualloop detectors embedded in the pavement of the freeway.
