25|$|<b>American</b> <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> (AWG), {{also known}} as the Brown & Sharpe wire gauge, is a {{standardized}} wire gauge system used since 1857 predominantly in North America for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire.

50|$|The Stubs Iron <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> system (also {{known as}} the Birmingham <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> and not the same as, though similar to, the Stubs Steel <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge)</b> is used to specify {{thickness}} or diameter of metal wire, strip, and tube products. The Stubs system was the first <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> recognized as a standard by any country when Great Britain adopted it in 1884; though nearly obsolete, {{it is the only}} <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> recognized in the United States through an Act of Congress.|$|R

25|$|Unshielded {{twisted pair}} (UTP) cables {{are found in}} many Ethernet {{networks}} and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard 25-pair color code originally developed by AT Corporation. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with copper wires measured at 22 or 24 <b>American</b> <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> (AWG), with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as polyethylene or FEP and the total package covered in a polyethylene jacket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wire drawing}} process is quite simple in concept. The wire is {{prepared}} by shrinking {{the beginning of}} it, by hammering, filing, rolling or swaging, {{so that it will}} fit through the die; the wire is then pulled through the die. As the wire is pulled through the die, its volume remains the same, so as the diameter decreases, the length increases. Usually the wire will require more than one draw, through successively smaller dies, to reach the desired size. The <b>American</b> <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> scale is based on this. This can be done on a small scale with a draw plate, or on a large commercial scale using automated machinery. [...] The process of wire drawing changes material properties due to cold working.|$|E

50|$|Standard <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> used {{to refer}} to the number of dies through which the wire had been pulled. Thus, a higher-numbered <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> meant a thinner wire. Typical {{telephone}} wires were 22-gauge, while main power cables might be 3- or 4-gauge.|$|R
25|$|Increasing gauge numbers denote {{decreasing}} wire diameters, {{which is}} similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as British Standard <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> (SWG), but unlike IEC 60228, the metric wire-size standard used {{in most parts of the}} world. This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given <b>gauge</b> of <b>wire.</b> Very fine wire (for example, 30gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than 0gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> systems; the development of standardized <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.|$|R
