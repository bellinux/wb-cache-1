5|$|Sportsmanship {{is also an}} {{important}} aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> the death.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> the death.|$|E

In 1958, she was secretly called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and recounted her experiences with the Independent Citizens' Committee.|$|E
5|$|Simplemente Lo Mejor {{was made}} {{available}} {{one month after}} the release of Arjona's eleventh studio album, 5to Piso (2008).

5|$|When Taft {{became chief}} justice, {{the court did}} not have its own {{building}} and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building. In 1925, Taft began <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> get the court a building, and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land, {{on the south side of}} the Capitol. Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into the new building, but it did not do so until 1935, after Taft's death.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages in <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> the death with Batman. In {{order to prevent}} Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results {{in the destruction of}} Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|Wilson had a combative {{streak and}} {{sometimes}} initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot {{broke out in}} the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the St. Louis Cardinals when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in his favor. The following year he took offense at a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and – upon reaching first base after hitting a single – he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated. Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati player Pete Donohue. In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight Art Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match, but reneged after Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Hack's wife Virginia to dissuade him, and then Shires lost <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> George Trafton of the Chicago Bears. There was nothing to gain, Wilson said, by fighting a defeated boxer.|$|E

25|$|Another explanation, {{according}} to Clive Dewey, was the Jagirs-based taxation system and economy that Ranjit Singh inherited and retained from the Mughal times.
