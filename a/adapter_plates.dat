50|$|The European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) was a payload {{mounted on}} the {{exterior}} of the European Columbus laboratory, one of the modules of the International Space Station. The facility, mounted onto the exterior of Columbus, provided a platform for multiple types of experiments and materials to be exposed directly to the harsh space environment.The EuTEF is a programmable, multifunctional architecture that provides uniform interfaces for instruments. Nine instrument modules are accommodated and operated simultaneously. Each experiment is {{mounted on the}} Columbus External Payload Adapter (CEPA), which consists of an <b>adapter</b> <b>plate,</b> the Active Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (A-FRAM) and the connectors & harness.

50|$|The P100 {{was longer}} than the {{corresponding}} Cortina and Sierra models, and had a higher ride height due to having a multi leaf spring suspension in the rear and larger five-stud wheels all round. The hub design on the Cortina was a SA specific pattern and actually a Rover PCD, hence Rover SD1 alloys and steel wheels fit. The later Sierra front hubs were from the Granada with <b>adapter</b> <b>plates</b> to allow fitment of the heavier duty Ford Transit wheel. Its rear axle was lifted directly from the SWB Transit 80, hence {{the need for the}} front adapters to match.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{variation}} is called flex track or monorail track lighting {{in which the}} fixtures are hung from a single line monorail track attached to the ceiling using stems. There are several different types of track. Some are very flexible and can be curved in any shape or form and some are more rigid and can be curved very slightly. Some patterns {{that can be made}} are [...] "S curves" [...] or [...] "spirals". Various adapters are available for combining features of track and other lighting. There are [...] "L" [...] and [...] "T" [...] adapters for rigid track, as well as flexible ones for unusual angles, or to change the vertical angle where a ceiling changes slope. <b>Adapter</b> <b>plates</b> allow single fixtures to be attached directly to a junction box, by providing an extremely small section of track embedded into the plate.

40|$|In November 2016, Spaceflight, in {{partnership}} with SpaceX, is scheduled to set a new world record for the most number of free-flying spacecraft deployed from a single launch with eighty-nine spacecraft deployed during the FORMOSAT- 5 /SHERPA mission.

Spaceflight is a world leader {{in the development of}} commercial rideshare opportunities for the small satellite industry. Success on this mission required both technical and business innovations to include design and development of SHERPA, a custom ESPA Grande ring with custom payload adapters and dispenser systems, designed for manifesting multiple secondary payloads and hosting secondary payloads. <b>Adapter</b> <b>plates</b> designed for SHERPA enable either one or two microsats, or up to seven Innovative Solutions in Space (ISIS) QuadPack dispensers to be deployed from a single port.

40|$|Machine integrators and PC {{builders}} {{require a}} great deal of flexibility and durability when assembling electronic components. The aim of this project was to design a universal ATX computer case that could accommodate any motherboard and processor combination available on the market. It also had to be isolated from the outside air, as to be used in dirty or industrial applications where durability is required. This case design maintains low cost and high flexibility by dissipating high amounts of heat using natural convection {{on the outside of the}} case and forced convection on the inside of the case. It is designed to dissipate a total of 250 W through a large heat exchanger and 27 W through a smaller one dedicated to dissipating heat from the hard disk. A universal CPU cooler uses pin fins with forced convection an custom <b>adapter</b> <b>plates</b> to mate with a variety of CPU processors. It is capable of dissipating 162 W, more than any CPU on the market needs.

40|$|Methyl Bromide for grain {{fumigation}} will {{be phased}} out in the U. S. by January 1, 2001. Alternative rapid fumigation methods are needed by U. S. grain storage, milling and export elevator industries. Aluminum phosphide pellets are slow and unpredictable. Magnesium phosphide releases faster, but are unstable and more expensive than aluminum phosphide. Although not as fast as Methyl Bromide, a liquid phosphine fumigant called "PhosfumeTM " developed by BOC Gases Ltd, Australia is a potential solution. Liquid phosphine is formulated in high pressure cylinders at 2 % PH 3, 98 % C 02, or 0 g/kg by weight (1994). Due to a prior U. S. phosphine fumigant copyright, BOC Gases, U. S. is introducing PhosfumTM in the U. S. A. as EC 02 FUME TM fumigant gas. ECO 2 FUME TM fumigant gas is not temperature dependent, so a fumigation can be conducted quickly at predictable high, medium or low dosages and concentrations in storage or building spaces. The primary objective {{of this research was}} to compare EC 02 FUME TM fumigant gas with a leading phosphine pellet, Degesh PhostoxinTM for labeling purposes. Tests compared daily gas levels between minimum dosage rates for commercial steel tanks for PhostoxinTM and EC 02 FUME TM fumigant gas targeted at 200 ppm during a 7 day period. Test were conducted in eleven 1. 8 m (6 ft) diameter by 2. 7 m (9 ft) high corrugated steel bins assembled on welded steel bases. During bin assembly, special care was used to seal all seams and joints to minimize gas leakage. A 2. 4 cm (6 in) diameter flanged transition installed through the sidewall with the transition centerline 2. 4 cm (6 in) above the base. Blower mounting <b>adapter</b> <b>plates</b> sealed the transition opening. An inverted "V " duct extends 19 cm (48 in) across the bin from the transition as a gas and aeration duct. All bins were sealed to hold a half-life of 25 nun (1. 0 in) water column for at least one minute as a gas tightness standard. During pressure testing, smoke bombs and soap spray were used to detect leaks. Wall seams, penetrations, and base joints were silicone sealed. Five bins were equipped with gas piping from the roof cavity to the recirculation blower inlet for fast recirculation o...|$|E

50|$|The term {{may also}} be used to define {{replacement}} criteria for other components available from multiple sources. For example, a plug-compatible cooling fan may need to have not only the same physical size and shape, but also similar capability, run from the same voltage, use similar power, attach with a standard electrical connector, and have similar mounting arrangements. Some non-conforming units may be re-packaged or modified to meet plug-compatible requirements, as where an <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> is provided for mounting, or a different tool and instructions are supplied for installation, and these modifications would be reflected in the bill of materials for such components.

40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{completed}} under the TX- 100 blade manufacturing {{portion of the}} Carbon-Hybrid Blade Developments: Standard and Twist-Coupled Prototype project. The TX- 100 blade is a 9 meter prototype blade designed with bend-twist coupling to augment the mitigation of peak loads during normal turbine operation. This structural coupling was achieved by locating off axis carbon fiber in the outboard portion of the blade skins. The report will present the tooling selection, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> design and fabrication. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. The molds used {{for the production of}} the TX- 100 were originally built for the production of the CX- 100 blade. The same high pressure and low pressure skin molds were used to manufacture the TX- 100 skins. In order to compensate for the difference in skin thickness between the CX- 100 and the TX- 100, however, a new TX- 100 shear web plug and mold were required. Both the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture used for the CX- 100 blades could be utilized for the TX- 100 blades. A production run of seven TX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken at TPI Composites during the month of October, 2004. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain gauges before final assembly. After production at the TPI Composites facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico and three blades to the United States Department of Agriculture turbine field test facility in Bushland, Texas. An <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> was designed to allow the TX- 100 blades to be installed on existing Micon 65 / 13 M turbines at the USDA site.
