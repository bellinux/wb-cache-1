5|$|In 2012, {{twenty years}} after the battle, President Ivo Josipović {{presented}} the Charter of the Republic of Croatia to the commanders and units involved in the battle, commending their military achievements. That was the first such move in twenty years, and <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official stance towards the offensive which had originally declared it as an unauthorised deployment of the HV.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role it {{played in the}} conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

5|$|Guillemin was {{a member}} of the team that beat Scotland at Colombes in 1911 and won France's first victory in the Five Nations. After all the {{previous}} French losses to the Home Nations teams, the Scottish were favourites to win, and France's unexpected win was considered a great occasion by the French press. It proved <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defeats, accompanied with humiliating press commentary which suggested that the French were too idle and debauched to produce a team worthy of their British opponents.|$|E
5|$|In August 1954 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{sponsored}} {{a tour of}} the south by Buth Diu of the Southern Liberal Party. In his speeches Buth Diu quoted NUP campaign promises supporting a Federal system in which the southern provinces would have considerable autonomy. Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious talk and threatened to use force to prevent secession from Sudan by the south. In May 1955 Isma'il al-Azhari announced that Sudan would seek complete independence, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costly earlier peace. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E
25|$|The Red Crescent emblem {{was first}} used by ICRC volunteers during the armed {{conflict}} between the Ottoman Empire and Russia (1876–1878). The symbol was officially adopted in 1929, and so far 33 states in the Muslim world have recognized it. In common with <b>the</b> official promotion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red cross symbol as <b>a</b> colour <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swiss flag (rather than a religious symbol), the red crescent is similarly presented as being derived from <b>a</b> colour <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire.|$|R
50|$|A {{compressor}} surge typically causes <b>an</b> abrupt <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airflow through the unit, as <b>the</b> pumping action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfoils stall (akin to an aircraft wing stalling).|$|R

5|$|Soma Bringer was the {{creation}} of producer and studio co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi. Initially a standard role-playing game before transitioning to action role-playing due to hardware restrictions, the aim was to create an engaging multiplayer experience: this resulted in the gameplay being developed before the story, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development style used for earlier Monolith Soft titles. It featured returning staff from Takahashi's earlier titles, including Xeno series writer Soraya Saga, and Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Development took approximately two years.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreements}} to containerise Cunard's freight operations had returned the overall Cunard group to profitability, with the shipping line now profitable and the passenger ships losing money, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation Smallpeice had inherited in 1965. The company returned profits of £2 million in 1968 and £3 million in 1969 and {{the share price}} rose accordingly. The downturn {{in the economy and}} shipping industry in 1970 resulted in Cunard once again incurring a loss and a drop in the share price, resulting in the company becoming a takeover target.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was last}} {{referred}} to in active use in 1316, after which it was probably allowed to decay; further stonework {{was taken by the}} keeper of Rockingham Forest in 1373, by which time the castle had probably been abandoned. By the 15th century, Sauvey formed a subsidiary property of Withcote manor - <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old land holding pattern. Its structures had mostly been dismantled or destroyed by 1622 and had gone entirely {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E

5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Leonard Harrison State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed only about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near the present village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, which caused <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded {{to the south and}} quickly carved a deep channel {{on its way to the}} West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or}} no glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
50|$|The plot is also <b>an</b> ironic <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{classical}} theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brother, {{from the}} ancient Greek Electra plays and the New Testament story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prodigal Son.|$|R

5|$|On 11 March 1976, SAC {{headquarters}} {{announced that}} the 42d Bombardment Wing would be inactivated, citing the poor condition of Loring's facilities. In 1976, {{it was estimated that}} Loring needed up to $300 million in facilities improvements. Between 1976 and 1979, considerable debate took place over the strategic importance of Loring, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Air Force decision to close Loring. When the decision to keep Loring AFB open was made in 1979, Congress committed itself to upgrading Loring's facilities. After 1981, nearly $300 million in military construction and operations and maintenance funds were spent to upgrade the facilities. Congressman Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts and Senator William Cohen of Maine were firm supporters of the base during the time when it was proposed to be closed.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E
5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E

Similarly, mixed-radix digit reversals arise in mixed-radix Cooley-Tukey FFTs.|$|R
5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about {{the rise of the}} bikini in Indian films.|$|E
