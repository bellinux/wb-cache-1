The historian Peter Ackroyd argues that Bazalgette should be considered a hero of London.|$|E
5|$|In The Artist Among the Missing (1949), Manning {{illustrates}} the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and multiculturalism mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind {{in which the}} British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The School for Love (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy's journey of disillusionment in <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun.|$|E

5|$|After the draft, Milwaukee {{attempted}} to convince Yi {{to sign with}} the team and on 2 July 2007, {{the owner of the}} Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.|$|E
5|$|Most French rulers {{since the}} Middle Ages {{made a point}} of leaving their mark on <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that,</b> {{contrary}} to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map. At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the film}} {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio de Janeiro. The {{production}} team had considered India and Nepal as a location in the film but on arriving at those places to investigate, they found that it was inconceivable to write them into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so. They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively early on, <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> Cubby Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E

5|$|The Motagua River flows {{down from}} the western Guatemalan highlands, and Quiriguá was ideally {{positioned}} to control the trade of uncut jade, the majority of which {{was found in the}} middle reaches of the Motagua Valley, as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as cacao, which was produced as a local cash crop. Although cacao was produced for trade, maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the Maya diet. In addition, maize probably formed an important component in the site's tribute payments to its overlords at Copán, <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was exhausting its own local resources. Although little jade has been recovered from the site, there is evidence for trade in obsidian originating from the Ixtepeque source situated near {{the upper reaches of the}} Motagua.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Greek slaves {{was a constant}} source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the Spartans Agesilaus II and Callicratidas. Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: {{in the middle of the}} 3rd century BC, Miletus agreed not to reduce any free Knossian to slavery, and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BC, restored Thebes. Before him, Philip II of Macedon enslaved and then emancipated Stageira.|$|E
5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. They {{were coming to}} <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> {{did not have a}} {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown much interest in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at the Astrodome and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E

5|$|Others {{were soon}} to follow. In about 1340 Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, a {{merchant}} from Florence, compiled a guide about trade in China, a country he called Cathay, noting {{the size of}} Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) and how merchants could exchange silver for Chinese paper money {{that could be used}} to buy luxury items such as silk. John Mandeville, a mid-14th-century author and alleged Englishman from St Albans, claimed to have lived in China and even served at the Mongol khan's court. However, certain parts of his accounts are considered dubious by modern scholars, with some conjecturing that he simply concocted his stories by using written accounts of China penned by other authors such as Odoric of Pordenone. Marco Polo mentioned the heavy presence of Genoese Italians at Tabriz (modern Iran) <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> Marco returned to from China via the Strait of Hormuz in 1293–1294. The Italian Franciscan monk John of Montecorvino took this same journey in reverse starting in 1291, setting out from Tabriz to Ormus, sailing from there to China while accompanied by the Italian merchant Pietro de Lucalongo. While Montecorvino became a bishop in Khanbaliq (Beijing), his friend Lucalongo continued to serve as a merchant there and even donated a large amount of money to maintain the local Catholic Church.|$|E
