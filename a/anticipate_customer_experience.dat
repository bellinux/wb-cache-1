40|$|Understanding <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and the <b>customer</b> journey {{over time}} is {{critical}} for firms. Customers now interact with firms through myriad touch points in multiple channels and media, and <b>customer</b> <b>experiences</b> are more social in nature. These changes require firms to integrate multiple business functions, and even external partners, in creating and delivering positive <b>customer</b> <b>experiences.</b> In this article, the authors aim to develop a stronger understanding of <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and the <b>customer</b> journey {{in this era of}} increasingly complex customer behavior. To achieve this goal, they examine existing definitions and conceptualizations of <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> as a construct and provide a historical perspective of the roots of <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> within marketing. Next, they attempt to bring together what is currently known about <b>customer</b> <b>experience,</b> <b>customer</b> journeys, and <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management.

40|$|My {{literature}} review topic {{is the role}} of innovations in <b>Customer</b> <b>Experience</b> Management. It aims to give a reader a comprehensive understanding of the concepts of <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management (CEM). This thesis also aims to form an understand-ing of the important role that innovations play in <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and how these innova-tions are essential for gaining and sustaining competitive advantage. In the paper I mainly focus on service and product innovations since they are distinctly valuable for <b>customers</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management. The review will also cover digital <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> innovations that are highly current and actually {{one of the most important}} and disruptive in-novations of 2010 s. The first part of the thesis reviews the literature and research about <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management and defines the concept as a whole. It focuses on the prospects of customer ex-perience management and point out to executives, why <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management (CEM) is worth the bother. In the second part of the paper the concept of innovation is de-scribed and especially literature about digital <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> innovations and digital environment is reviewed. The third part combines these two concepts and forms a totality of them. It discovers the significance and importance of <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> innovations in or-der for companies to gain and sustain competitive advantage. In the paper I discover that even though the benefits of <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management are widely recognized, companies still struggle to use it in practice and some even ignore it completely. It has been proven that most of the companies that have <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> maturity levels above average have better financial reports than their competitors. This sup-ports the argument that companies can no longer differentiate themselves from competitors by solely on physical elements, such as product features or price. The vital differences are found in the brand, in the perception and feel of a company, all of which are central elements in <b>customer</b> <b>experience.</b> This has led to <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> inno-vations especially becoming the key competitive factors in more and more industries. In the competitive and global environment the need and demand for innovations is now greater than ever. Customer collaboration in creating successful <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> innovations is vital and supported by thesis’s marketing theory...|$|R

Scholars and practitioners state that <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> {{is the next}} area of competition. For a long time, {{there has been a}} call for a uniform, accurate definition, definition of its components, and the development of the <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> frameworks.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} summarize research on <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> analysis and to explore and compare the dimensions describing <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> listed in seven conceptual models with findings from 17 research projects on <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> conducted after the year 2010.

However managing <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> successfully the <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> needs to be considered in the context of multiple marketing channels and multiple customer segments which requires a lot of resources. With the difficult financial conditions today the use of technology and marketing automation offer companies a chance to work efficiently across the marketing channels and segments. Managing customer relationships and <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> has been studied quite extensively before. In recent years the scope in the research has moved more from customer relationship management (CRM) to <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management (CEM). Segmentation of the customers origins from the 1950 s and {{it is one of the}} fundamental concepts of marketing. Also digital marketing and using technology in the marketing has been studied quite a lot in the past decades. However using technology and specially marketing automation as a tool to manage <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> has not been studied. Since <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> is seen one of the most important concepts of marketing in the coming years and companies are all the time looking a ways how to enhance their marketing with better use of software these two concepts make an interesting combination. In this study I have combined the <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> management with marketing automation. My main research question is how <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> can be managed with marketing automation. The sub questions are what kind of channels can be used in the digital marketing and how customers can be segmented effectively. I’ll answer these questions by reviewing the research that has already been made in these areas and with a case study of the <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and marketing automation in a company called Fintoto. The literature research includes <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and it’s management, segmentation, digital marketing channels and use of technology in marketing. Based on this research is built a framework which is used the case study to analyze the <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> and marketing automation of Fintoto.

The main argument is that as <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> happens in the touch-points where customer interacts with the company with the use of marketing automation technology the respond can differ and be most optimal one for each customer.

The study contributes to the <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> literature by constructing and empirically testing a theoretical model that integrates the construct of employee engagement as an influencing variable on <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> in a business-to-business environment. Employee engagement is characterised by the level of engagement an employee depicts through attributes such as vigour, dedication and absorption. The study sampled 106 employee respondents and 1, 216 customer respondents of a South African mining and construction firm. The combined dataset of both employee and customer responses was empirically tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling. The research finds a relationship exists between employee engagement and <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> of employee performance. Additionally, <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> of employee performance was significantly statistically associated with overall <b>customer</b> <b>experience,</b> a construct focusing on <b>customer</b> <b>experience</b> comparative to competitors and alternate suppliers.
