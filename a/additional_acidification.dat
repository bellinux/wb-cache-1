40|$|The ionic {{specificity}} of IAA-induced acidification by Avena coleoptiles was studied, using zwitterionic, presumably impermeant buffers. The acidification was almost totally dependent on divalent cations with {{an order of}} effectiveness of Ca 2 + ≥ Sr 2 + > Mn 2 +, Mg 2 +; whereas other polyvalent cations tested were ineffective. The Ca 2 + response was IAA-dependent. The CaCl 2 concentration was optimal at 0. 3 to 1 mm and inhibitory at higher concentrations. Sr 2 + inhibited Ca 2 +-dependent acidification and monovalent cations such as K+ did not induce <b>additional</b> <b>acidification</b> {{in the presence of}} optimal CaCl 2. These data are consistent with a mechanism for IAA-induced acidification involving a Ca 2 + −H+ exchange...|$|E
40|$|Seawater {{acidification}} can {{be induced}} both by absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) and by atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Their relative significance, interplay, and dependency on water column biogeochemistry {{are not well}} understood. Using a simple biogeochemical model we show that the initial conditions of coastal systems are not only relevant for CO 2 -induced acidification but also for <b>additional</b> <b>acidification</b> due to atmospheric acid deposition. Coastal areas undersaturated with respect to CO 2 are most vulnerable to CO 2 -induced acidification but are relatively least affected by additional atmospheric deposition-induced acidification. In contrast, the pH of CO 2 -supersaturated systems is most sensitive to atmospheric deposition. The projected increment in atmospheric CO 2 by 2100 will increase the sensitivity of coastal systems to atmospheric deposition-induced acidification by up to a factor 4, but the additional annual change in proton concentration is at most 28 %...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this work}} were to {{establish}} improved conditions for lipase production by Candida viswanathii using agroindustrial wastes in solid-state cultivation and to purify and evaluate the application of this enzyme for poultry fat hydrolysis. Mixed wheat bran plus spent barley grain (1 [*]:[*] 1, w/w) supplemented with 25. 0 % (w/w) olive oil increased the lipase production to 322. 4 %, compared to the initial conditions. When olive oil was replaced by poultry fat, the highest lipase production found at 40 % (w/w) was 31. 43 [*]U/gds. By selecting, yeast extract supplementation (3. 5 %, w/w), cultivation temperature (30 °C), and substrate moisture (40 %, w/v), lipase production reached 157. 33 [*]U/gds. Lipase was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, presenting a molecular weight of 18. 5 [*]kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The crude and purified enzyme showed optimum activity at pH 5. 0 and 50 °C and at pH 5. 5 and 45 °C, respectively. The estimated half-life at 50 °C was of 23. 5 [*]h for crude lipase and 6. 7 [*]h at 40 °C for purified lipase. Lipase presented high activity and stability in many organic solvents. Poultry fat hydrolysis was maximum at pH 4. 0, reaching initial hydrolysis rate of 33. 17 [*]mmol/L/min. Thus, C. viswanathii lipase can be successfully produced by an economic and sustainable process and advantageously applied for poultry fat hydrolysis without an <b>additional</b> <b>acidification</b> step to recover the released fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|Acidification is {{required}} for the function of many intracellular organelles, but methods to acutely manipulate their intraluminal pH have not been available. Here we present a targeting strategy to selectively express the light-driven proton pump Arch 3 on synaptic vesicles. Our new tool, pHoenix, can functionally replace endogenous proton pumps, enabling optogenetic control of vesicular acidification and neurotransmitter accumulation. Under physiological conditions, glutamatergic vesicles are nearly full, as <b>additional</b> vesicle <b>acidification</b> with pHoenix only slightly increased the quantal size. By contrast, we found that incompletely filled vesicles exhibited a lower release probability than full vesicles, suggesting preferential exocytosis of vesicles with high transmitter content. Our subcellular targeting approach can be transferred to other organelles, as demonstrated for a pHoenix variant that allows light-activated acidification of lysosomes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{conducted}} {{research was to}} determine the influence of liming, mineral and organic fertilization on soil chemical properties and nutrient availability in the soil, yield height and mineral composition of alfalfa. Results were used to create regression models for prediction of liming impact on soil chemical properties. Liming and fertilization experiment was sat up in 20 L volume plastic pots with two types of acid soils with different texture from two sites. Ten liming and fertilization treatments were applied in four repetitions. Lime treatments increased soil pH values and decreased hydrolytic acidity. Mineral and organic fertilization affected <b>additional</b> soil <b>acidification.</b> Application of lime intensified mineralization and humus decomposition, while organic fertilization raised humus content. The results showed significant increase of AL-P 2 O 5 and K 2 O availability. The treatments increased soil Ca concentrations, {{but at the same time}} decreased exchangeable Mg concentrations. Soil pH increase resulted in lower Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu availability. Soil CEC was increased by applied treatments. Lime rates increased number and height of alfalfa plants, as well as yield of leaf, stalk increased concentrations of N, P, K and Ca in alfalfa leaf and stalk, but decreased leaf Mg and Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu concentrations. Regression computer models predicted with adequate accuracy P, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu availability and final pH value as a result of liming and fertilization impact...|$|R
40|$|Four {{field studies}} are {{conducted}} {{to enhance the}} knowledge on soil chemistry and in situ soil water quality in forested areas receiving moderate to high acid loading, associated with differing amounts of ammonia and neutralizing compounds. The Janów site receives moderate levels of mobile, strong acid anions and base cations. The Ratanica catchment receives slightly more mobile anions though almost all are associated with base cations. At Czerniawka and Brenna the throughfall is more acid with higher deposition of mobile anions and less alkaline dust. At Janow, Ratanica and Brenna a large deposition of ammonia represents an important <b>additional</b> source of <b>acidification.</b> The effective cation exchange capacity in the mineral soil layers ranges from 3 meq kg- 1 in Janów to 60 meq kg- 1 in Brenna. The soil solutions from the minerogenic soil profiles are all quite acidic, especially in the organic forest floor horizon. In the mineral layers the acidity is partly neutralized by release of aluminium, causing an increase in monomeric, mainly labile, inorganic aluminium. In these soil solutions, containing high concentrations of sulphate, the Al 3 + concentrations correspond well to equilibrium with jurbanite (AlSO 4 OH), although the actua...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River Site has {{enriched uranium}} (EU) {{solution}} {{which has been}} stored for almost 10 years since being purified in the second uranium cycle of the H area solvent extraction process. The concentrations in solution are {tilde 6 } g/L U and about 0. 1 M nitric acid. Residual tributylphosphate in the solutions has slowly hydrolyzed to form dibutyl phosphoric acid (HDBP) at concentrations averaging 50 mg/L. Uranium is known to form compounds with DBP which have limited solubility. The potential to form uranium-DBP solids raises a nuclear criticality safety issue. SRTC tests have shown that U-DBP solids will precipitate at concentrations potentially attainable during storage of enriched uranium solutions. Evaporation of the existing EUS solution without <b>additional</b> <b>acidification</b> {{could result in the}} precipitation of U-DBP solids if DBP concentration in the resulting solution exceeds 110 ppm at ambient temperature. The same potential exists for evaporation of unwashed 1 CU solutions. The most important variables of interest for present plant operations are HNO{sub 3 } and DBP concentrations. Temperature is also an important variable controlling precipitation. The data obtained in these tests can be used to set operating and safety limits for the plant. It is recommended that the data for 0 degrees C with 0. 5 M HNO{sub 3 } be used for setting the limits. The limit would be 80 mg/L which is 3 standard deviations below the average of 86 observed in the tests. The data shows that super-saturation can occur when the DBP concentration is as much as 50 percent above the solubility limit. However, super-saturation cannot be relied on for maintaining nuclear criticality safety. The analytical method for determining DBP concentration in U solutions was improved so that analyses for a solution are accurate to within 10 percent. However, the overall uncertainty of results for periodic samples of the existing EUS solutions was only reduced slightly. Thus, sampling appears to be the largest portion of the uncertainty for EUS sample results, although the number of samples analyzed here is low which could contribution to higher uncertainty. The analytical method can be transferred to the plant analytical labs for more routine analysis of samples...|$|E
40|$|Uptake of {{anthropogenic}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{from the atmosphere}} {{has resulted in a}} range of changes in ocean chemistry, including the lowering of pH, collectively referred to as ocean acidification. Rates of coastal-zone acidification exceed those of the open ocean since coastal-ocean pH is influenced by many other processes than absorption of CO­ 2 alone. These processes do not only play a role in long-term acidification but also impact pH on seasonal timescales. Examples are enhanced atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen deposition, as well as eutrophication, the latter which can additionally result in the development of low-oxygen waters. The degree to which these processes induce a change in pH depends both on their rates {{and the extent to which}} the water can buffer acid production or consumption. This acid-base buffering capacity has been shown to decrease substantially in hypoxic waters, suggesting that low-oxygen conditions exacerbate ocean acidification. In this dissertation the key factors controlling the seasonal pH variability and longer-term pH changes in both the coastal and open ocean were examined, showing that buffering mechanisms play a crucial role in the impact of any biogeochemical or physical process on pH. Monthly or seasonal water-column chemistry and process-rate measurements in a transiently hypoxic coastal marine basin indicate that, despite generally higher process rates in the surface water of the basin, the amplitude of pH variability as mainly governed by the balance between primary production and respiration is greater in the seasonally-hypoxic bottom water, due to a considerable reduction of its acid-base buffering capacity in summer. A proton budget, based on these measurements and set up for each season, shows that the net change in pH is much smaller than the flux of protons induced by each of the individual processes. The interplay between absorption of atmospheric CO 2 and atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen deposition in the coastal ocean was found to depend on the water-column concentration of CO 2 relative to the atmosphere. If the atmospheric concentration surpasses that of the surface water, then this part of the coastal ocean is most sensitive to CO 2 -induced acidification, but least affected by <b>additional</b> <b>acidification</b> resulting from atmospheric acid deposition. Although coastal seas will become up to a factor 4 more sensitive to atmospheric deposition-induced acidification between the present-day and 2100, the annual change in proton concentration will only increase by 28...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River Site has {{enriched uranium}} (EU) {{solution}} {{which has been}} stored for almost 10 years since being purified in the second uranium cycle of the H area solvent extraction process. The concentrations in solution are approximately 6 g/L U and about 0. 1 M nitric acid. Residual tributylphosphate in the solutions has slowly hydrolyzed to form dibutyl phosphoric acid (HDBP) at concentrations averaging 50 mg/L. Uranium is known to form compounds with the dibutylphosphate ion (DBP) which have limited solubility. The potential to form uranium-DBP solids raises a nuclear criticality safety issue. Prior SRTC tests (WSRC-TR- 98 - 00188) showed that U-DBP solids precipitate at concentrations potentially attainable during the storage of enriched uranium solutions. Furthermore, evaporation of the existing EUS solution without <b>additional</b> <b>acidification</b> {{could result in the}} precipitation of U-DBP solids if the DBP concentration in the resulting solution exceeds 110 mg/L at ambient temperature. The same potential exists for evaporation of unwashed 1 CU solutions. As a follow-up to the earlier studies, SRTC studied the solubility limits for solutions containing acid concentrations above 0. 5 M HNO 3. The data obtained in these tests reveals a shift to higher levels of DBP solubility above 0. 5 M HNO 3 for both 6 g/L and 12 g/L uranium solutions. Analysis of U-DBP solids from the tests identified a mixture of different molecular structures for the solids created. The analysis distinguished UO 2 (DBP) 2 as the dominant compound present at low acid concentrations. As the acid concentration increases, the crystalline UO 2 (DBP) 2 shows molecular substitutions and an increase in amorphous content. Further analysis by methods not available at SRS will be needed to better identify the specific compounds present. This data indicates that acidification prior to evaporation can be used to increase the margin of safety for the storage of the EUS solutions. Subsequent experimentation evaluated options for absorbing HDBP from solution using either activated carbon or anion exchange resin. The activated carbon outperformed the anion exchange resin. Activated carbon absorbs DBP rapidly and has demonstrated the capability of absorbing 15 mg of DBP per gram of activated carbon. Analytical results also show that activated carbon absorbs uranium up to 17 mg per gram of carbon. It is speculated that the uranium absorbed is part of a soluble U-DBP complex that has been absorbed. Additional testing must still be performed to 1) establish absorption limits for uranium for anion exchange resin, 2) evaluate desorption characteristics of uranium and DBP, and 3) study the possibility of re-using the absorbent...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of widespread neuronal death occurring in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains enigmatic even after extensive investigation {{during the last}} two decades. Amyloid beta 42 peptide (Ab 1 – 42) is believed to play a causative {{role in the development of}} AD. Here we expressed human Ab 1 – 42 and amyloid beta 40 (Ab 1 – 40) inDrosophila neurons. Ab 1 – 42 but not Ab 1 – 40 causes an extensive accumulation of autophagic vesicles that become increasingly dysfunctional with age. Ab 1 – 42 -induced impairment of the degradative function, as well as the structural integrity, of post-lysosomal autophagic vesicles triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that can be enhanced by autophagy activation or partially rescued by autophagy inhibition. Compromise and leakage from post-lysosomal vesicles result in cytosolic <b>acidification,</b> <b>additional</b> damage to membranes and organelles, and erosive destruction of cytoplasm leading to eventual neuron death. Neuronal autophagy initially appears to play a pro-survival role that changes in an age-dependent way to a pro-death role in the context of Ab 1 – 42 expression.

40|$|Although {{plant growth}} is often limited at high pH, {{little is known}} about root-induced changes in the rhizospheres of plants growing in {{alkaline}} soils. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. Rhizosphere pH was measured quantitatively, with a micro pH electrode, and qualitatively, with an agar/pH indicator solution. Manganese deficiency in Rhodes grass increased root-induced acidification of the rhizosphere in a soil profile in which N was supplied entirely as NO 3 -. Rhizosphere pH in the Mn deficient plants was up to 1. 22 pH units lower than that of the bulk soil, while only 0. 90 to 0. 62 pH units lower in plants supplied with adequate Mn. When soil N was supplied entirely as NO 3 -, rhizosphere acidification was more efficient in inoculated lucerne (1. 75 pH unit decrease) than in non-inoculated lucerne (1. 16 pH unit decrease). This difference in capacity to lower rhizosphere pH is attributable to the ability of the inoculated lucerne to fix atmospheric N 2 rather than relying on the soil N (NO 3 -) reserves as the non-inoculated plants. <b>Additional</b> Keywords: legume, <b>acidification,</b> manganese deficiency, rhizosphere p...|$|R
40|$|Muscle fiber {{conduction}} velocity (MFCV) {{has often been}} shown to decrease during standardized fatiguing isometric contractions. However, several {{studies have indicated that}} the MFCV may remain constant during fatiguing dynamic exercise. It was investigated if these observations can be related to the absence of a large decrease in pH and if MFCV can be considered as a good indicator of acidosis, also during dynamic bicycle exercise. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was combined with read-outs of muscle energetics recorded by in vivo (31) P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Measurements were performed during serial exhausting bouts of bicycle exercise at three different workloads. The HDsEMG recordings revealed a small and incoherent variation of MFCV during all high-intensity exercise bouts. (31) P MRS spectra revealed a moderate decrease in pH at the end of exercise (~ 0. 3 units down to 6. 8) and a rapid ancillary drop to pH 6. 5 during recovery 30 s post-exercise. This <b>additional</b> degree of <b>acidification</b> caused a significant decrease in MFCV during cycling immediately after the rest period. From the data a significant correlation between MFCV and [H(+) ] ([H(+) ] = 10 (-pH)) was calculated (p < 0. 001, Pearson's R = - 0. 87). Our results confirmed the previous observations of MFCV remaining constant during fatiguing dynamic exercise. A constant MFCV is in line with a low degree of acidification, considering the presence of a correlation between pH and MFCV after further increasing acidification...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{resources}} are gradually depleting and becoming more expensive. Therefore, {{new ways to}} fuel our economy should be sought. Being a renewable carbon source, biomass will take {{a key role in}} the transition to a more sustainable economy. However, while potentially renewable, biomass relies on an intensive cultivation step and it will not be able to deliver a constant and endless supply without inducing other harmful effects. Therefore sustainability assessments of biorefineries are highly relevant. After an introductory first chapter, the sustainability concept and assessment methodologies are studied in chapter two. Based on this information, the life cycle framework is applied in chapter three, in which it is shown that a food and feed company processing wheat can switch to a fossil fuel replacing biorefinery without inducing efficiency losses. On the other hand, the replacement of fossil fuels goes at the cost of other resources such as land, water, minerals, etc. A profound study of the supply chain of different sources of biomass illustrates that the valorization of domestic organic waste and farm residues is an environmentally benign opportunity. These types of biomass however, have lower conversion efficiencies compared to agricultural crops such as silage maize because they often contain more difficult molecules to process such as lignocelluloses requiring more pre- and post-treatment. It is demonstrated that these different types of organic resources can be efficiently converted to a highly energetic biomethane by anaerobic digestion while maintaining nutrients in the digestate, which can be used as fertilizer. <b>Additional</b> emissions causing <b>acidification</b> and eutrophication should however be avoided by good agricultural management. The fourth chapter of this dissertation focuses on methodological development. The quantification of sustainability is a complex task and therefore more research is required to improve assessment techniques. A first identified bottleneck is the acquirement of reliable data. While this is the key to obtain useful results from a life cycle study, it is especially difficult to gather mass and energy balances of future production processes. For this purpose, engineering modules are developed of 22 processes that are commonly used in industry which can be used in prospective sustainability assessments. Although challenges are identified, an application in a case study illustrated the operability and reliability of the approach. The second part of this chapter focuses on the allocation procedure of LCA. It is illustrated that this methodological attribute should be linked to the goal and scope of the assessment. System expansion can give interesting insights in economy wide assessments to assess different product mixes and markets, whereas partitioning is a useful approach in product policies and supply chain improvement. For the latter, exergy is identified as a useful parameter to quantify the physical value of both mass and energy. In a last part of the methodological chapter, an indicator of sustainable development is proposed that focuses on the broader concept of sustainable development. The indicator weighs the antropospheric benefit, quantified as satisfaction by a product or service and the labor quality and quantity, with the ecological burden, quantified as resource and emission impact. These factors are weighted with macro-scale aspects such as the human development index, unemployment rate and the world’s ecological footprint. Overall, it can be concluded that society will have to take better care of its available resources. Biorefineries can have a role in this development by optimally utilizing the available biomass. However, a strong policy is needed that analyzes supply and demand interactions and related impacts such as land use, water use and field emissions. Life cycle assessment will take an essential role in these developments, both in a top-down perspective by analyzing direct and indirect effects of product mixes and markets, as in a bottom-up approach by analyzing and optimizing production chains. On the other hand, more collaborative research is required to better understand different aspects of sustainable development and to search for better ways for a proper assessment of different scopes and scales...|$|R
