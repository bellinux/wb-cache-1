5000|$|The Basel Convention {{was created}} in 1989 but started {{enforcing}} rules in 1992. The purpose of the Convention is to control the hazardous waste that was imported and exported throughout the EU. The Convention is a great contributor to stopping the shipment of illegal waste. [...] In May 2005, 60 containers were seized that {{were on their way}} from the United Kingdom to China. [...] The containers seized by Dutch authorities were supposed to be for paper but actually contained household wastes. [...] Since neither the UK, China, nor Dutch had agreed to the importation of the wastes, the waste was shipped back. The Basel Convention also deals with the popular growing issue of E-waste. The Waste Shipment Regulation confirms what can be shipped to, from, and between EU countries. These regulation rules divide the waste into three separate lists: Green List, <b>Amber</b> <b>List,</b> and Red List.|$|E
40|$|Sheepdrove’s bird {{community}} {{includes many}} birds of conservation concern, in a substantial area of land farmed organically. The standard BBS (Breeding Bird Survey) sampling method {{was used to}} record bird species and counts at Sheepdrove Organic Farm during 2003 in 3 sampling areas (each 1 km square). Normally BBS is only carried out during breeding season, but to gather broader data, extra survey visits were also carried out including autumn and winter surveys for records of winter migrants. Many common species were observed, and often those expected at farmland, including several species which have declined nationwide - birds of conservation concern on the Red and <b>Amber</b> <b>List</b> of the BTO (British Trust for Ornithology). There was an unusual sighting of Ring Ouzel, and also of Barn Owl, which is often missed during daytime surveys. Due to the extra survey visits, records were taken for winter migrants such as Fieldfare, and the incidence of winter flocks, e. g. of finches and Starling (many {{of which will be}} winter migrants). The results of this survey will serve as a benchmark for the biodiversity records of Sheepdrove Organic Farm...|$|E

(Insecta: Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae: Metopiinae) We describe a new fossil genus and species Palaeometopius eocenicus of Ichneumonidae Metopiinae (Insecta: Hymenoptera), from the Lowermost Eocene amber of the Paris Basin.

50|$|In November 2007, HPD started {{installed}} a system called PlateScan by its manufacturer, California-based Civica Software, {{which would allow}} for several cameras installed on a Police Cruiser to scan license plates and automatically run them through a database that would immediately alert the officer if the plate is wanted as a stolen vehicle, on an <b>AMBER</b> Alert <b>list,</b> or on a warrant. This saves the officer from having to individually type in every plate and does it at a faster pace.|$|R

It has close affinities with the Nearctic and Afrotropical species E. femoralis (BADONNEL 1931) and the fossil species E. saxonicus GÜNTHER 1989 from Saxonian <b>amber.</b> An annotated <b>list</b> of fossil Liposcelididae is given.

5000|$|The term [...] "Baltic amber" [...] is generic, so amber {{from the}} Bitterfeld brown coal mines in Saxony (Eastern Germany) {{sometimes}} is included the same name. Bitterfeld amber was previously {{believed to be}} only 20-22 million years old (Miocene), but {{a comparison of the}} animal inclusions revealed that it is most probably genuine Baltic amber that has only been redeposited in a Miocene deposit. Other sources of Baltic <b>amber</b> have been <b>listed</b> as coming from Poland and Russia.|$|R
40|$|An {{annotated}} {{catalogue of the}} type and non-type scutigeromorph centipedes (Chilopoda: Scutigeromorpha) held in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin is presented. The collection includes material from throughout the world, {{with a focus on}} former German colonies. Notes on collectors and localities are provided where appropriate. Type material for 42 Recent species or subspecies is present; all described in the early 20 th century by Karl Verhoeff. However, only seven of these names remain valid with the other thirty-five currently regarded as junior synonyms. The collection in its entirety includes material from nineteen currently valid species, making up about 20 % of the known world fauna. The type of a fossil species in Eocene Baltic <b>amber</b> is also <b>listed</b> for completeness...|$|R
40|$|All fossil psocid species ('Psocoptera', i. e. free living, mostly bark-dwelling {{members of}} the insect order Psocodea) known from Cretaceous <b>amber</b> are <b>listed</b> and their {{systematic}} placement is discussed. This critical evaluation of published data resulted in a list of 32 species assignable to 27 genera and 11 families. Each genus could be {{assigned to one of}} the three suborders Trogiomorpha, Troctomorpha and Psocomorpha, but five genera could not clearly be assigned to a family. No extant genus is represented in Cretaceous amber. Several systematic misallocations, a few at subordinal level, have been identified. Suborder transfers are proposed for the genera Paramesopsocus, Arcantipsocus and Libanopsyllipsocus; an infraorder transfer within Troctomorpha is proposed for Globopsacus. The extant troctomorph family Pachytroctidae is recorded for the ﬁrst time from the Cretaceous. Two family-group names of Psocomorpha (Paramesopsocidae and Arcantipsocidae), based on extinct taxa, are considered as synonyms of two extant families of Troctomorpha (Electrentomidae and Amphientomidae respectively). The extant family Lachesillidae is the only family of Psocomorpha represented in Cretaceous amber. 53 % of the species from Cretaceous amber belong to the Trogiomorpha, representing the basal clade of Psocoptera; 41 % belong to Troctomorpha and only 6 % to Psocomorpha, while the latter comprises 69 % of the species known from Baltic amber (Eocene) and 82 % of the extant species. The presence of the family Lachesillidae shows that the deepest divergences of the psocomorphan phylogeny date back at least to the Cretaceous, but the main radiation of Psocomorpha at generic or species level probably happened in the Cenozoic. This critical review of published information about the oldest known fossils clearly assignable to the order Psocodea (as this group is deﬁned by taxonomists working on the extant fauna) aims to reﬁne the data which could provide some fossil evidence for calibration of molecular trees in future research on the phylogeny of paraneopteran insects...|$|R
