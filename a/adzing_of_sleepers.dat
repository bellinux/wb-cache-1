40|$|AbstractBallasted track {{sleepers}} have the important function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers,</b> rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of continuous welded rails. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> In view <b>of</b> the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Single-sleeper pullout tests and track panel pullout tests were conducted on different types <b>of</b> concrete <b>sleepers.</b> The results <b>of</b> the pullout tests revealed the effects <b>of</b> the <b>sleeper</b> shape, the sleeper spacing, and the number <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the lateral resistance. Based on the model test results, a new numerical method for evaluating the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> is proposed...|$|R

In {{order to improve}} the prediction accuracy of the ballast settlements in the ballasted track, a series of cyclic loading tests were performed to be focused attention {{on the condition of}} minimum load and the shape <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> in the various design condition. It was found that the settlement of railway ballast increased to be supported at the central part <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> for the ballasted track on the standard rigid roadbed when the small void became to be grown between the bottom surface <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> and upper surface of railway ballast around the end <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> by the cyclic loading...|$|R

Two-dimensional FE linear elastic {{analyses were performed}} in order to investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> size on the stress distribution in the ballasted track. Based {{on the results of}} FE analyses, a series of full-scale cyclic loading tests were performed by using various <b>sleepers</b> <b>of</b> different lengths and heights. It is found that the track settlement in the state where a clearance gap exists between sleeper and ballast can be estimated by amount of displacement amplitude up to a full contact and a maximum displacement rate <b>of</b> <b>sleeper...</b>|$|R
