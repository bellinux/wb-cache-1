5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing <b>anti-competitive</b> behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity: whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.|$|E
5|$|Gates {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} {{entrepreneurs}} of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered <b>anti-competitive.</b> This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{judgment}} {{marked a}} successful appeal for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian regulator of <b>anti-competitive</b> conduct, having lost {{at first instance}} and on appeal in the Federal Court of Australia. The ACCC was again successful when the case was remitted to the Federal Court for reconsideration, ending eight years of litigation between the parties. The High Court's judgment was received as a significant precedent in the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the European Commission began {{investigating}} Valve {{and five}} other publishers—Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Focus Home Interactive, Koch Media and ZeniMax Media—for <b>anti-competitive</b> practices, specifically the use of geo-blocking through the Steam storefront and Steam product keys to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries. Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group buys a number of keys in regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to profit on the difference, outside of European oversight and tax laws.|$|E
5|$|The United States Department of Justice was {{investigating}} the company's practices {{at the time}} and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used <b>anti-competitive</b> and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam’s testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam’s manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the CL's independence, various larger {{companies}} {{were looking to}} acquire it, mainly for the valuable Court Street terminal property. The most persistent rumor was that the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (CJ, later a NYC line) would buy the CL as an entrance to Cincinnati. The CJ had built south from Michigan to Carlisle, Ohio in 1887, and initially acquired trackage rights over the CH to reach Cincinnati. Negotiations between the CL and CJ convinced the CH that the latter was capable of becoming a strong competitor, despite its poor financial state, and the CH attempted to acquire the CJ in 1892. But the CL stopped the consolidation based on Ohio's laws prohibiting such <b>anti-competitive</b> practices, and the CJ continued {{to look at the}} CL as a possible part of its line. After the CL's conversion to standard gauge was completed in 1894, the CJ secured trackage rights over the CL into Court Street, beginning service on January 27, 1896 via an extension from Carlisle to Franklin, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four, later a NYC line) to Middletown, and the recently opened Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad to the CL at Hageman. The CJ also acquired the long-dormant Deer Creek Tunnel project in an attempt to construct its own route into the city, tired of dealing with Hafer and the CL The Pennsylvania Railroad, owner of the Little Miami Railroad that had been constructed east of Lebanon in the 1840s, entered the negotiations in 1896 to protect its Cincinnati-area interests, and in March it (through the Pennsylvania Company) acquired a majority of the CL's stock. Pennsylvania officials took over management in May, and in 1902 the CL acquired the tunnel property and some terminal property near Court Street from the Cincinnati Northern Railroad, successor to the CJ, which had become part of the Big Four and terminated its use of the CL in 1901.|$|E
25|$|Such {{opposition}} {{is largely a}} function {{of the size of the}} firm. Behavior from Microsoft, which would have been ignored from a smaller firm, was seen as an <b>anti-competitive</b> and monopolistic threat, due to Microsoft's size, thus bringing about government lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, FairSearch, a {{lobbying}} organization supported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, {{filed a complaint}} regarding Android with the European Commission, alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted <b>anti-competitive</b> predatory pricing. The Free Software Foundation Europe, whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch allegations. On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its leverage over Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android, constituted <b>anti-competitive</b> practices. In August 2016, Google was fined US$6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) under similar allegations by Yandex.|$|E
25|$|The Securities Act of 1933 was {{originally}} {{administered by the}} Federal Trade Commission. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 transferred this responsibility from the FTC to the SEC.

25|$|Power Ventures Inc. filed {{a motion}} to dismiss the case (or in the alternative, a motion for a more {{definite}} statement), but Judge Fogel denied the motion.

25|$|In 1993, Novell {{claimed that}} Microsoft was {{blocking}} its competitors {{out of the}} market through <b>anti-competitive</b> practices.

Microsoft reached a settlement in 1994, ending some of its license practices.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{conditions}} on the merger were required by both state and federal governments. These included a limit on excess revenues ("profits"), that $86 million in cost savings {{be passed on to}} consumers, and a prohibition on certain <b>anti-competitive</b> behaviors. Another restriction prohibited Benefis from entering into any joint ventures which would permit existing services to be transferred to the joint venture (thus enabling Benefis to skirt the COPA agreement).|$|E
25|$|In 2006 the BBC {{launched}} a free educational website for children, BBC Jam, which cost £150million. Following complaints {{by a number}} of commercial suppliers of educational software that the BBC was engaging in <b>anti-competitive</b> practices by providing this service for free, the BBC Trust announced that the website would be suspended pending a review. The following year it was decided that the service would not be re{{launched a}}nd it was closed permanently.|$|E
25|$|Apple's {{products}} have been claimed by critics to combine stolen and/or purchased designs that it claims are its own original creations. Criticism of Apple includes unethical business {{practices such as}} <b>anti-competitive</b> behavior, rash litigation, and dubious tax tactics, their production methods involving the use of sweatshop labor, customer service issues involving misleading warranties and insufficient data security, and concerns about environmental destruction. Additionally, it {{has been criticized for}} its alleged collaboration with U.S. surveillance program, PRISM.|$|E
25|$|Feeling the {{pressures}} of success, the band decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos. In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted {{for three years and}} limited the band's ability to tour in the United States. Gossard took an active role during Pearl Jam's dispute with Ticketmaster in 1994 over prices and surcharges. Along with Ament, Gossard testified before a congressional subcommittee, arguing that Ticketmaster's practices were <b>anti-competitive.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1912, {{the company}} {{was found guilty of}} violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Watson, and 26 other NCR {{executives}} and managers were convicted for illegal <b>anti-competitive</b> sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public because of the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.|$|E
25|$|LIRNEasia's Telecommunications Regulatory Environment (TRE) index, which summarises stakeholders' {{perception}} {{on certain}} TRE dimensions, provides {{insight into how}} conducive the environment is for further development and progress. The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines. The tool measured seven dimensions: i) market entry; ii) access to scarce resources; iii) interconnection; iv) tariff regulation; v) <b>anti-competitive</b> practices; and vi) universal services; vii) quality of service, for the fixed, mobile and broadband sectors.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, the European Commission accused Intel of <b>anti-competitive</b> practices, mostly against AMD. The allegations, {{going back}} to 2003, include giving {{preferential}} prices to computer makers buying {{most or all of}} their chips from Intel, paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips, and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions. Intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer-friendly. General counsel Bruce Sewell responded that the Commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions as to pricing and manufacturing costs.|$|E
25|$|Amazon state {{sales tax}} {{collection}} policy {{has changed over}} the years since in the company's beginning it did not collect any sale taxes. In the U.S., state and local sales taxes are levied by state and local governments, not at the federal level. In most countries where Amazon operates, a sales tax or value added tax is uniform throughout the country, and Amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers. Proponents of forcing Amazon.com to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an <b>anti-competitive</b> advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{airlines}} {{went to the}} European Courts, as {{they claimed}} {{that the development of}} Milan Malpensa and the closure of Milan Linate would provide an <b>anti-competitive</b> situation in favour of Alitalia. They claimed that Alitalia could go on feeding its Fiumicino hub from Linate but they could not. Furthermore, they claimed that Malpensa was too far (40km) and lacked the infrastructure to/from the city (the rail link would open a year after the opening of the hub). After many court disputes the EU decided to leave 33% of the flights at Linate until the rail link opened.|$|E
25|$|The GamePlus {{features}} {{added to}} the Rogers NHL GameCentre Live service provide additional in-game camera angles for subscribers who also subscribe to Rogers' cable, internet, or wireless services. In October 2014, Bell {{filed a complaint with}} the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), arguing that the exclusivity of GamePlus to Rogers subscribers was <b>anti-competitive</b> and showed undue preference. Bell felt that the exclusivity violated a CRTC ruling banning vertically integrated telecommunications companies from being the exclusive distributor of television content on internet and mobile television platforms, as footage from these additional angles are occasionally incorporated into the linear telecast.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 the Boeing 247 was introduced, {{the first}} truly modern airliner. The 247 was an {{all-metal}} low-wing monoplane {{that was much}} faster, safer, and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft. For example, {{it was the first}} twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine. In an era of unreliable engines, this vastly improved flight safety. Boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own United Airlines subsidiary's operations. This badly hurt competing airlines, and was typical of the <b>anti-competitive</b> corporate behavior that the U.S. government sought to prohibit at the time.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the methods}} Starbucks has used to expand and {{maintain}} their dominant market position, including buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled <b>anti-competitive</b> by critics. For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who {{could not afford to}} pay inflated prices for premium real estate.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{group of}} 5,000 Freehand graphic {{designers}} convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe. The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged {{in a series of}} exclusionary and <b>anti-competitive</b> acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism. Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled. The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.|$|E
25|$|The DAC {{report is}} as {{critical}} to the livelihood of a professional truck driver as the credit report is to a consumer. When a trucking company reports negative information about a truck driver, it can ruin the driver’s career by preventing him or her from finding a truck driving job for several years or more. It is widely known that trucking companies often abuse this power by willfully and maliciously reporting false information on truckers’ DAC reports, either in retaliation for seeking better paying trucking jobs elsewhere or {{for any number of}} other fraudulent, <b>anti-competitive</b> reasons. As long as truck drivers can be threatened with a false DAC report for standing up to management or leaving their company for a better job elsewhere, working conditions at truck driver jobs will not improve.|$|E
25|$|Jazz filed a $11.5 million {{lawsuit against}} the TPA and later, Porter, in the Ontario Superior Court in February 2006, alleging that the TPA signed {{contracts}} forcing Jazz out of the airport, causing a monopoly at the airport, and were <b>anti-competitive.</b> Jazz later filed a suit in Federal Court. On October 20, 2009, Jazz formally dropped its suit in Ontario Court, but plans to continue its lawsuit against Porter and the TPA in Federal Court. According to the announcement, Jazz dropped the matter in provincial court as the TPA is a federal agency, and the Airport is a federal facility. Damages in the federal case are not specified. Porter filed a counter-claim to Jazz' lawsuit citing damages of $850 million, based on Jazz agreement with Air Canada, and Porter has not dropped its counter-claim.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{a lawsuit}} was {{threatened}} {{due to the}} exclusion of teams from the non-automatic qualifying conferences in the BCS system. Following Utah's win over Alabama in the 2009 Sugar Bowl, Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff announced an inquiry into whether the BCS system violates federal anti-trust laws. In 2009, senior Utah senator Orrin Hatch announced that he was exploring the possibility of a lawsuit against the BCS as an <b>anti-competitive</b> trust under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. On November 27, 2009 the Fort Worth Star-Telegram ran a story that said that Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX), ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, announced that he would hold anti-trust hearings on the BCS, again based on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and its provisions outlawing non-competitive trusts, beginning in May 2010. Meanwhile, various organizations, including the BCS, spent {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to lobby the federal government both in support and in opposition to a college football playoffs system.|$|E
25|$|In November 2004, Southwest {{announced}} their active {{opposition to the}} Wright Amendment, claiming {{that the law is}} <b>anti-competitive</b> and outdated. On November 30, 2005, Missouri was added to the list of states exempted from the Wright Amendment by an amendment written by Sen. Kit Bond. Southwest began nonstop flights to Kansas City and St. Louis on December 13. American Airlines and American Eagle began flights from Love to St. Louis, Kansas City, Austin, and San Antonio on March 2, 2006, although American Airlines subsequently pulled out of the market, leaving American Eagle to offer a reduced service to Austin and Kansas City alone. In 2008, American decided to terminate the Austin and Kansas City service and replace it with service to O'Hare International Airport (which Southwest does not serve) using 50-passenger regional jets in compliance with the Wright provisions regarding aircraft size, although American Eagle later stopped service from Love Field altogether.|$|E
25|$|As of 2013, MasterCard {{is under}} {{investigation}} by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other <b>anti-competitive</b> practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007. The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of digital}} rights {{management}} is not universally accepted. Proponents of DRM {{argue that it is}} necessary to prevent intellectual property from being copied freely, just as physical locks are needed to prevent personal property from being stolen, that it can help the copyright holder maintain artistic control, and that it can ensure continued revenue streams. Those opposed to DRM contend there is no evidence that DRM helps prevent copyright infringement, arguing instead that it serves only to inconvenience legitimate customers, and that DRM helps big business stifle innovation and competition. Furthermore, works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued. DRM can also restrict users from exercising their legal rights under the copyright law, such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs (instead having to buy another copy, if it can still be purchased), lending materials out through a library, accessing works in the public domain, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the fair use doctrine, and under French law. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) consider the use of DRM systems to be an <b>anti-competitive</b> practice.|$|E
25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent <b>anti-competitive</b> conduct. In other words, the question is what should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E
25|$|Post {{deregulation}} Lothian experienced alternating {{periods of}} competition and stability with the other major bus operator in Edinburgh, First in Edinburgh (First), and its previous incarnations SMT/Eastern Scottish. During this time Lothian acquired a number of smaller Edinburgh operators. In 2001, Lothian alleged <b>anti-competitive</b> practises by First. This claim was later rejected. Other operators such as Stagecoach Fife, E Horsburgh, Perryman's Buses and MacEwans also operate stage services into Edinburgh, but as these tend to be long-distance routes or subsidised local services they are not generally a competitive threat. One lasting effect of competition was the extension of Lothian services beyond the City of Edinburgh boundaries, in response to incursion by Eastern into Edinburgh city services. However, Lothian subsequently withdrew from West Lothian, leaving this area to First, with the sole exception of a night bus service between Longstone depot and Livingston which is operated primarily {{for the use of}} staff who live in West Lothian. Although this service is not widely advertised to the public, they are permitted to use this service. Withdrawal from this area and not the others that Lothian extended into has caused concern amongst residents who had experienced low fares and greater choice of services during the period when Lothian and Eastern Scottish were competing. During the time in which it was not served by Lothian Buses, West Lothian Council remained a shareholder of the company. In 2014, Lothian Buses began to again serve to the historical area of the county after taking over a contracted service to South Queensferry and Kirkliston. However, these towns are located in the City of Edinburgh council area under present-day municipal boundaries.|$|E
