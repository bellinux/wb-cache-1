5|$|In early 1943 the Army {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> warfare doctrine by {{adapting the}} pre-war field service regulations {{to meet the}} conditions in the South-West Pacific. The Army's front-line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with this doctrine during the year. <b>A</b> <b>jungle</b> warfare school was opened at Canungra, Queensland, in November 1942, and all reinforcements for combat units subsequently passed through the school before joining their unit. Canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre, an Independent Company training centre, and a tactical school. With the establishment of Canungra the Independent Company training centre on Wilsons Promontory was closed.|$|E

5|$|Following its capture, Java {{was under}} British {{administration}} from 1811 to 1816. The appointed governor was Lieutenant Governor-General Thomas Stamford Raffles, who took {{great interest in}} the history of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On an inspection tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> near the village of Bumisegoro. He was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C. Cornelius, a Dutch engineer, to investigate.|$|E

5|$|Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants {{existed in}} Europe during the Eocene and Late Oligocene. Cesare Baroni Urbani {{collected}} Prionomyrmex janzeni in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad, Russia and Prionomyrmex wappleri in Germany. Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr collected Prionomyrmex longiceps in Baltic amber from the Eocene, but {{the exact location}} of its discovery is unclear, due to the lost type material. P. longiceps were an arboreal nesting species, living in trees instead of the ground. William Morton Wheeler assumed this due to its long legs, sharp claws and elongated mandibles. Prionomyrmex may have preferred <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> habitat at low elevations.|$|E
5|$|The {{adventure}} {{begins when}} the player characters hear reports of bandits waylaying and attacking caravans in <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> region. Most of the ambushed merchants and guards have been killed, but {{the few who}} have returned alive tell fantastic stories about deformed plants and deadly beasts in the jungle. The stolen goods taken from the caravans provide an impetus for the characters to enter the jungles in search of this lost treasure.|$|E
5|$|William Morton Wheeler {{comments}} that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species. This means the ant {{did not live}} in the soil and nested in trees instead. He assumed this due to its long legs, strong claws and long mandibles; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious, equipped with a well developed and powerful sting that was most likely used to kill prey. Prionomyrmex may have preferred <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> habitat at low elevations, and is even more primitive in its body structure than Myrmecia. Female stylopids were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants.|$|E

5|$|At {{first light}} on 6 November, Carlson and his command group, {{two of his}} companies, {{and a group of}} native scouts and {{carriers}} commanded by Major John Mather of the Australian Army and Sergeant Major Jacob C. Vouza of the Solomon Islands Police Force set out from Aola on the patrol. The group marched along <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> trail northwest to the Reko River, arriving on 7 November. At the Reko, Carlson learned that the local Christian mission had recently been raided by Japanese troops who had killed two of the missionaries before moving west. Pushing across the river with one platoon of troops, Carlson encountered a small group of Japanese who shot and severely wounded the native scout leading the Marine column. Returning fire, the Marines killed two Japanese soldiers and drove off another three or four. Carlson's main body then arrived and the column bivouacked for the night.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E
5|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{supposed}} to be developed for the PlayStation 3, but due to the long wait for the PS3, {{the game was}} developed for the PlayStation 2 instead. From the outset, the games director Hideo Kojima wished to drastically change the setting from previous games. He stated that the jungle setting is what both his development team, and the Metal Gear fans, wanted. However, he acknowledged that the elements of <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> environment, such as the weather, landscape and wildlife, were features that would present problems during the game's development. Whereas in previous installments the player starts out close to, or even within, the enemy base, Kojima wished Snake Eater to be more realistic, with Snake starting out miles from civilization and having to work his way to the enemy encampment.|$|E
5|$|While Mad Max {{was being}} {{developed}} by Avalanche's studio in Stockholm, the New York division was working on Just Cause 3. The development of Just Cause 3 also began in early 2012. While the previous Just Cause games were developed by the Swedish studio, the development of Just Cause 3 {{was transferred to the}} New York studio to give the title a fresh start. The game was the first title published by Square Enix after their acquisition of Eidos Interactive. Avalanche Studios sent a team to visit <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> in Costa Rica to inspect the local landscapes and environments to help them create the game worlds for both Mad Max and Just Cause 3.|$|E
5|$|Director Darren Aronofsky {{sought to}} produce The Fountain {{after the release}} of Requiem for a Dream in 2000. In April 2001, he entered {{negotiations}} with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow to direct the then-untitled film with actor Brad Pitt in the lead role. Requiem for a Dream was screened for Pitt, and the preliminary script for The Fountain persuaded the actor to join the project. Aronofsky prepared for production by traveling with a crew to Central America to consult with Mayan experts and to explore the Mexican ruins of Palenque. The group also visited Tikal, <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> location featured in the 1977 film Star Wars. In addition to the trip, the films Aguirre, the Wrath of God and The Holy Mountain were screened for the crew to inspire it in designing a rainforest set for The Fountain. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join Aronofsky's project. Aronofsky, who wanted the film's actual title to be a secret, gave the project the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed to improve the script and to wait for Blanchett, pregnant when she joined, to give birth to her child in December 2001. The start date for production was tentatively set in summer 2002.|$|E

Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than <b>a</b> <b>jungle,</b> a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making his way across the islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple {{at the start of a}} creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{has signed}} on to return in two {{additional}} sequels to Warner Bros.' , as well as <b>a</b> <b>Jungle</b> Cruise feature film being developed by Disney. In May 2016, Johnson confirmed his attachment to The Janson Directive as Paul Janson. The film will be produced by Universal Studios, {{with the intent to}} adapt more of Robert Ludlum's work in the future in a larger project than just the announced first installment. Later that same month, it was announced that he would star in Legendary Entertainment's Skyscraper movie which will be an action-thriller film with Rawson Marshall Thurber signed on as director and writer.

5|$|The Army was {{considerably}} expanded in early 1942 {{in response to}} the Japanese threat to Australia. During this year the Army's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions, and in August 1942 the Army had a strength of 476,000 men. This force was larger than Australia's population and economy could sustain, and its strength was reduced {{in the second half of}} the year. Militia units were able to serve outside of Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 after the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943 was passed, but few did so. The Army was further reduced by 100,000 members from October 1943 to free up manpower for industry. At the end of 1943 the Army's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades, although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945. The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943. In early 1943 the Army developed <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South West Pacific.|$|E

5|$|The {{program was}} {{directed}} by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez, and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming occurred {{at the headquarters of}} Pol-ka in the Colegiales neighborhood. The telenovela took several risks in the creative and production fields, which were mostly successful. The choice of Martín Quesada's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races. For realism, plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city. There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany, which took place during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the Veltins-Arena stadium during the Argentina-Serbia and Montenegro match. The result of the matcha 6–0 Argentine victorybenefited the filming, and the episode received 31.5 rating points. Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort Las Leñas in the Andes. A simulated aircraft crash that left the characters in <b>a</b> <b>jungle</b> was filmed at the Pereyra Iraola park and an Argentine Air Force park in Morón.|$|E
