25|$|Rumble {{filters are}} high-pass filters {{applied to the}} removal of {{unwanted}} sounds near to {{the lower end of}} the <b>audible</b> <b>range</b> or below. For example, noises (e.g., footsteps, or motor noises from record players and tape decks) may be removed because they are undesired or may overload the RIAA equalization circuit of the preamp.|$|E
25|$|A third risk is an {{inability}} to find mating partners. With so few whales in such a large area, simply finding a mate is difficult. Right whales generally travel alone or in very small groups. In other oceans, breeding females attract mates by calling. The success of this strategy depends upon having males within hearing range. As expanding shipping traffic increases the ocean's background noise, the <b>audible</b> <b>range</b> for such mating calls has decreased.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{whistles}} described generate nearly pure tones {{that can}} be heard. The mountain tones discussed above are examples of tones that are inaudible because they are below the frequency range of humans. There are others whose sound levels are below the <b>audible</b> <b>range</b> of humans. For example, the vortex street behind a stick underwater might radiate at audible frequencies but not sufficiently to be heard by a Scuba diver. There are others that are both below audible frequencies and below audible levels.|$|E

25|$|Plasma arc {{loudspeakers}} use electrical plasma as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but {{is charged}} {{and therefore can}} be manipulated by an electric field, {{the result is a}} very linear output at frequencies far higher than the <b>audible</b> <b>range.</b> Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the Plasmatronics Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from helium gas. This avoided the ozone and nitrous oxide produced by RF decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|Harmonic {{additive}} synthesis {{is closely related}} to the concept of a Fourier series which is a way of expressing a periodic function as the sum of sinusoidal functions with frequencies equal to integer multiples of a common fundamental frequency. [...] These sinusoids are called harmonics, overtones, or generally, partials. [...] In general, a Fourier series contains an infinite number of sinusoidal components, with no upper limit to the frequency of the sinusoidal functions and includes a DC component (one with frequency of 0 Hz). [...] Frequencies outside of the human <b>audible</b> <b>range</b> can be omitted in {{additive synthesis}}. [...] As a result, only a finite number of sinusoidal terms with frequencies that lie within the <b>audible</b> <b>range</b> are modeled in additive synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{significant}} noise reduction typical of electric vehicles that travel at low speeds, the 2011 Leaf includes digital warning sounds, one for forward motion {{and another for}} reverse, to alert pedestrians, the blind, and others of its presence. For this purpose Nissan created the Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians (VSP) system, which was also used in Nissan Fuga hybrid. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{in order to be}} aware of the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound, they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists. The sine-wave sound system sweeps from 2.5kHz at the high end to a low of 600Hz, an easily <b>audible</b> <b>range</b> across age groups. Depending on the speed and if the Leaf is accelerating or decelerating, the sound system makes sweeping, high-low sounds. The sound system ceases operation when the Nissan Leaf reaches [...] and engages again as car slows to under [...] For the 2011 model, the driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside the vehicle, but the system automatically reset to [...] "On" [...] at the next ignition cycle. The system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in the dash panel, and the sound is delivered through a speaker in the front driver’s side wheel well. Nissan removed the ability to disable the pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of the U.S. ruling to be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.|$|E

5000|$|A {{speaker driver}} is an {{individual}} loudspeaker transducer that converts an electrical audio signal to sound waves. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with the term loudspeaker (speaker), it is usually applied to specialized transducers which reproduce {{only a portion of}} the <b>audible</b> frequency <b>range.</b> For high fidelity reproduction of sound, multiple loudspeakers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing {{a different part of the}} <b>audible</b> frequency <b>range.</b> In this case the individual speakers are referred to as drivers and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker. Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called tweeters, those for middle frequencies are called mid-range drivers, and those for low frequencies are called woofers, while those for very low bass range are subwoofers. Less common types of drivers are supertweeters and rotary woofers.|$|R

25|$|The {{compression}} effect: The amplification {{needed to}} make quiet sounds audible, if applied to loud sounds would damage the inner ear (cochlea).

50|$|The {{frequencies}} an ear {{can hear}} {{are limited to}} a specific range of frequencies. The <b>audible</b> frequency <b>range</b> for humans is typically given as being between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz), though the high frequency limit usually reduces with age. Other species have different hearing ranges. For example, some dog breeds can perceive vibrations up to 60,000 Hz.|$|R
5000|$|Since around 1989, 1 bit delta-sigma {{modulators}} {{have been}} used in analog to digital converters. This involves sampling the audio at a very high rate (2.8224 million samples per second, for example) but only using a single bit. Because only 1 bit is used, this converter only has 6.02 dB of dynamic range. The noise floor, however, is spread throughout the entire [...] "legal" [...] frequency range below the Nyquist frequency of 1.4112 MHz. Noise shaping is used to lower the noise present in the <b>audible</b> <b>range</b> (20 Hz to 20 kHz) and increase the noise above the <b>audible</b> <b>range.</b> This results in a broadband dynamic range of only 7.78 dB, but it is not consistent among frequency bands, and in the lowest frequencies (the <b>audible</b> <b>range)</b> the dynamic range is much greater — over 100 dB.

We distill the limitations of acoustic ranging; and present efficient signal designs and detection algorithms to overcome the challenges of coverage, range, accuracy/resolution, tolerance to Doppler’s effect, and audible intensity. We evaluate our proposed techniques experimentally on TWEET, a low-power platform purpose-built for acoustic ranging applications. Our experiments demonstrate an operational range of 20 m (outdoor) and an average accuracy 2 cm in the ultrasound domain.

40|$|International audienceThe {{prediction}} of acoustical properties of multilayered systems including poroelastic layers using the full Biot theory is in principle possible {{but in practice}} limited {{by the absence of}} material data. One of the parameters that is difficult to measure is the dynamic rigidity of the porous frame. Current experimental methods are limited to {{the lower part of the}} <b>audible</b> frequency <b>range</b> 1 (typically below 400 Hz) and require special shapes of the sample (cube, cylindrical rod or very thin samples). Since most sound absorbing plastic foams are viscoelastic, the elastic moduli may vary strongly with frequency, a measuring technique in the full <b>audible</b> frequency <b>range</b> is needed. Recently 2 a new method for the measurement of the dynamic shear modulus of the frame of poroelastic foams in the medium and high <b>audible</b> frequency <b>range</b> (1 to 4 kHz) has been presented This method is based on the measurement of the velocity and the damping of a Rayleigh-type surface wave on sample with thickness larger than the Rayleigh wave penetration depth. The Rayleigh wave was excited through direct mechanical excitation of the frame or the porous material and detected using a laser-doppler vibrometer. The velocity of this wave is closely related to the shear velocity, which is directly linked to the shear modulus. The damping of the Rayleigh wave can be used to determine the imaginary part of the shear modulus. In this work a first attempt is made to measure the dynamic shear modulus on a layer of finite thickness. In this way there is no requirement whatsoever concerning the shape of the sample under investigation...|$|R
