5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Bronze Age artefact {{depicting the}} cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, another {{investigation}} was {{undertaken by the}} States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up-to-date techniques, including gas chromatography, to formally confirm the origin of six van Meegeren forgeries that had been <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> genuine Vermeers, including the Emmaus and the Last Supper. The conclusions of the 1946 commission were again reaffirmed and upheld by the Dutch judicial system.|$|E

He was felled and then arrested by civilian police officers Sergeant Mark Todd & Sergeant Kimberly Munley. Much of the subsequent investigation was handled by III Corps, as the soldiers killed were under the corps' chain of command.|$|E
5|$|Although Snoop Dogg retains working {{relationships}} with Warren G and Daz, who are <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uncredited contributors {{on the hit}} albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr.Dre is capable of making beats {{without the help of}} collaborators, and that he is responsible for the success of his numerous albums. Dr.Dre's prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Winehouse's {{spokesman}} {{reported that}} the singer was in a physician-supervised programme and was channelling her difficulties by writing a lot of music. The British tabloid The Sun posted a video of a woman, <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Winehouse, apparently smoking crack cocaine and speaking of having taken ecstasy and valium. Winehouse's father moved in with her, and Island Records, her record label, announced the abandonment of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf. In late January 2008, Winehouse reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment program.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} year of his administration, however, the Superior Audit Office of Mexico, the audit office of the Mexican federal government, {{discovered}} two irregularities in the city's spending and budget. On 30 September 2013, at the end of his mayoral administration, Galván was succeeded by Carlos Enrique Canturosas Villarreal of the PAN. That year, the new mayor opened an investigation against eleven former city officials <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in the financial case. On November 8, 2016, one of the city's former financial heads, Juan Fernando Miranda Macías, was arrested for illegally using city resources. He was released from prison in two days after a judge concluded that the accusations against him were inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{also has}} a {{political}} wing, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement (formerly the 32 County Sovereignty Committee), led by Francis Mackey. The RIRA is distinct from the Continuity IRA, another Provisional IRA splinter group founded in 1986, although the two groups {{have been known to}} co-operate at a local level. The Provisional IRA has been hostile to the RIRA and issued threats to RIRA members, and in October 2000 was <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the fatal shooting of Belfast RIRA member Joe O'Connor according to O'Connor's family and 32 County Sovereignty Movement member Marian Price.|$|E

5|$|The {{first three}} seasons of Prison Break were {{primarily}} filmed outside of Hollywood. The {{majority of the}} first season of the series was filmed on location in and around Chicago. After it was closed down in 2002, Joliet Prison became the set of Prison Break in 2005, standing in as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen. Scenes set in Lincoln's cell, the infirmary, and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison. Lincoln's cell was <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same one in which serial killer John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated, which at least {{one member of the}} production crew refused to enter, because it was <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> haunted. Other sets were built at the prison, including the cell blocks that housed the general prison population; these blocks had three tiers of cells (as opposed to the real cell block's two) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras. Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around Chicago, Woodstock, and Joliet in Illinois. Other locations included O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Prison Break spent $2 million per episode in the state of Illinois, which cost them a total of $24 million in 2005.|$|E
5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E
5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E

5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2001, the Thai {{government}} under Thaksin Shinawatra agreed {{to open the}} sluice gates of the Pak Mun Dam for four months to allow studies to be conducted on its social impact; this was later extended to 13 months. Coinciding with this agreement, the government announced that official studies would be conducted by Ubon Ratchathani University and a private team contracted by the National Economic and Social Development Board. The university received a budget of 10 million baht (roughly US$280,000), and the government contractors, <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same group that recommended damming another river, received 94 million baht (roughly US$2,700,000), raising suspicions. Villagers thought that outside academics {{would not be able}} to make an objective or accurate study of the river because they were unfamiliar with local fish migration and habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038. Portions {{of an earlier}} structure were <b>alleged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included in the present edifice, which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later, and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, although we know that a new tower and porch were built around 1115. Much evidence which might have shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even {{as far back as}} late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present church, or is in the churchyard.|$|E
