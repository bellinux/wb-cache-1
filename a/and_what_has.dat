5|$|Kingship was {{the major}} form of government, growing in sophistication in the late Middle Ages. The scale and nature of war also changed, with larger armies, naval forces and the {{development}} of artillery and fortifications. Christianity introduced monasticism <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been identified as Celtic Christianity. Nevertheless, the church accepted papal authority and from the eleventh century embraced monastic reform, developing a flourishing religious culture that asserted its independence from English control. Scotland grew from its base in the eastern Lowlands, to approximately its modern borders. The varied and dramatic geography of the land provided a protection against invasion, but limited central control. It also defined the largely pastoral economy, with the first burghs being created from the twelfth century. The population may have grown to a peak of a million before the arrival of the Black Death in 1337. In the early Middle Ages society was divided between a small aristocracy and larger numbers of freemen and slaves. Serfdom disappeared in the fourteenth century and there was a growth of new social groups.|$|E
25|$|A 60-minute special titled The Winner's Story is {{broadcast}} {{each year}} over the festive period, featuring the winner of that year's X Factor. Cameras follow the winner from {{the announcement of the}} result through the lead-up to the Christmas number one. As from 2010, one week before each series due to start, there features a special called X Factor Rewind looking back at the previous year's contestants and what happened to them during The X Factor <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to them since the show ended. In Series 12, these programmes aired in late afternoon slots on weekends. They started two weeks before the show began, and finished the day the show started, {{for the first time on}} ITV.

She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway {{to have had}} one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented {{a time when she}} was not afraid to go against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, his flesh is falling away from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent to do before death.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, the “Flying Armadillos” of HMM-777 traded their aging UH-34Ds for the CH-53A Sea Stallion and was redesignated as a heavy Marine {{helicopter}} squadron (HMH). HMH-777 was deactivated due {{to massive}} budget cuts in 1980, however, on October 1, 1980, the squadron’s personnel and aircraft were reformed as the Bravo Detachment of HMH-772, {{which was based}} at NAS JRB Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. For the next thirteen years, the Dallas detachment supported 4th MAW, including a deployment to Okinawa in support of Desert Storm, yet in 1993 the Reserve heavy-lift squadrons were realigned, and both HMH-772 detachments were deactivated. Det Alpha was reactivated as HMH-769, but HMH-777 was not so lucky. On 1 April 1993, HMH-772, Det Bravo, retired the squadron colors in a brief ceremony to close the final chapter on the “Flying Armadillos” <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has,</b> so far, been the final chapter of rotary aircraft in MAG-41.|$|E
25|$|For some time, {{especially}} {{through the}} work of D. A. Binchy, the laws were held to be conservative and useful primarily for reconstructing the laws and customs of the Proto-Indo-Europeans just as linguists had reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language. For instance, historians have seen similarities between Irish and Indian customs of fasting {{as a method of}} shaming a wrongdoer to recover a debt, or to demand the righting of a wrong. Other legal institutions prominent in early Irish law but foreign to most contemporary legal systems, {{such as the use of}} sureties, have been considered as survivals from earlier periods. More recently historians have come to doubt such attributions. While few historians argue that all Irish law comes from church influence, they are today much more wary as to what material is a survival <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> changed. A past may still be suggested for a certain legal concept based on Irish legal terms' being cognate with terms in other Celtic languages, although that information does not prove that the practice described by the legal term has not changed.|$|E

500|$|Bligh was {{exchanged}} {{shortly after}} the action and returned to Britain. On 27 May 1795 he sat before a court-martial, standard practice when a Royal Navy ship was lost in action, and was honourably acquitted of blame {{in the loss of}} Alexander. In France, the National Convention commended Nielly on his victory and the captured ship was repaired and taken into the French Navy, joining the Atlantic Fleet. It was however a poor sailor and in June 1795 was with the French fleet that participated in Cornwallis's Retreat and the Battle of Groix: at the latter action Alexandre was overrun by the British fleet and recaptured, rejoining the Royal Navy. The historical assessment of the capture of Alexander has been summed up by the historian Robert Gardiner, who wrote in 1996 that [...] "The capture of a British 74 was a rare event during these wars – only five were lost [...] [...] [...] However, the one sided nature of the conflict was not apparent in 1794 <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been called the Royal Navy's 'habit of victory' was not yet established." ...|$|E
500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{been described as a}} camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E
500|$|Rev. D. James Kennedy of The Center for Reclaiming America for Christ and Coral Ridge Ministries {{claims that}} Darwin was {{responsible}} for Adolf Hitler's atrocities.

[...] In his efforts to expose the [...] "harmful effects that evolution is still having on our nation, our children, and our world," [...] Kennedy also states that, [...] "We have had 150 years {{of the theory of}} Darwinian evolution, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> it brought us? Whether Darwin intended it or not, millions of deaths, the destruction of those deemed inferior, the devaluing of human life, increasing hopelessness." [...] The Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture fellow Richard Weikart has made similar claims, as have other creationists. The claim was central to the documentary film [...] (2008) promoting intelligent design creationism. The Anti-Defamation League describes such claims as outrageous misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, and as trivializing the [...] "...many complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry. Hitler did not need Darwin or evolution to devise his heinous plan to exterminate the Jewish people, and Darwin and evolutionary theory cannot explain Hitler's genocidal madness.

500|$|After {{producing}} {{the music for}} Oni, O'Donnell was tasked with composing the music for Bungie's next project, which would be unveiled at E3 2000. After talking with Joseph Staten, O'Donnell decided the music needed to be [...] "big, exciting, and unusual with a classical orchestra touch to give it some weight and stature. We also wanted it {{to have some sort}} of 'ancient' feel to it." [...] O'Donnell came up with the idea of opening the piece with gregorian chant and jotted down the melody in his car. Because he did not know how long the presentation would be, O'Donnell created [...] "smushy" [...] opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as time required to back up a rhythmic middle section. The music was recorded and sent to New York the same night the piece was finished; the resulting music became the basis for the Halo series' [...] "highly recognizable" [...] signature sound, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been called one of the best-known video game themes. The use of the chant in the main theme has been credited with contributing to popular interest in the genre. Halos music used an interactive engine to change music in response to player's actions; this non-linear method has since become widespread. The scores for Halo and its sequel Halo 2 garnered awards such as The Game Developer's Choice Award and Best Original Video Game Soundtrack from Rolling Stone.|$|E
500|$|Wills was a [...] "tear away" [...] footballer whose [...] "pluck and skill", it was said, only George O'Mullane matched. The longest {{drop kick}} in Victoria, {{he was an}} elusive dodger, as at Rugby, and excelled in {{different}} positions, moving from a follower and goal-scorer in the ruck to full back. Of the early footballers, Wills was appraised as the greatest, most astute captain, and is credited with opening up the Australian game to new tactics and skills and a more free-flowing style of play. In July 1860—in what the press called a [...] "coup de main", <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> since been recognised as a [...] "tactical leap" [...] that foreshadowed modern football—Wills breached the era's notional offside line by positioning his Richmond men down the field from defence to attack. By a series of short kick passes, they succeeded in scoring. That same month, captaining Melbourne to victory, he pioneered a rudimentary form of flooding; and in another win for the club, exploited the low player turnout by instructing his men to dart with the ball in open spaces. In his season-by-season ranking of players, early football historian C. C. Mullen named Wills [...] "Champion of the Colony" [...] five times. Historian Bernard Whimpress called Wills an innovator who [...] "would fit easily into today's game".
