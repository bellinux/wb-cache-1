25|$|Under {{the current}} Laws, a captain may forfeit either of his side's innings. A {{forfeited}} innings shall {{be considered as}} a completed innings. Usually this happens in shorter competitive two-innings matches, where captains need to agree with each other how to set up the match so that there is a reasonable chance of a result. Winning a game gains a team considerably more points than drawing it, so captains are often willing to risk giving the opposition an opportunity to win that they otherwise would not have had as long as they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> similar opportunity in return.|$|E
500|$|Carter {{announces that}} he and Barbara <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> divorce, causing Peter to suggest he meet other people. Taking him to the local club, Peter {{introduces}} Carter to the dating scene, where he soon meets Paula, an attractive blonde. Going on to demand an African American patron fetch him a drink, Carter is {{accused of being a}} racist by Paula, who leaves him. Continuing to desire Barbara, Carter decides to take a bouquet of roses to his former wife. While there, he discovers that Barbara has begun dating the man she had an affair with during the war (who sings to her in the tune of 'The Miners Mother'). Announcing he has something important to say to Barbara, Carter confesses his love for her, and apologizes. Barbara then allows Carter to earn her trust by letting him move back in, and the two ultimately embrace in a passionate kiss.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) share {{lunch with}} Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) {{to thank him}} for {{protecting}} her from Frank in [...] "Vandalism". They are expecting his wife Alyssa to join him, but Brian reveals they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> divorce after having been fighting for a while. In an awkward attempt to lighten the mood, Brian makes a joke referencing how he consoled Pam when she broke down after her fight with Jim over the phone in [...] "Customer Loyalty". After the lunch Jim admits, with some prodding, that he is angry that Pam did not tell him about this incident. Pam explains that she had not wanted to add to his worries, which only makes Jim angrier, but he brushes the matter off to avoid an argument. The couple had planned on sharing an evening bottle of wine for Valentine's Day, but Jim later tells Pam he wants to go down to Philadelphia instead because he fears they would only end up fighting. Pam initially accepts this, but realizing that the silence between them is worse than fighting, she tells Jim he should stay and fight with her, and Jim agrees.|$|E

The New York Observer analyzed the marketing for the film, which included an attempt at pushing a [...] "viral video" [...] of the two main stars; journalist Christopher Rosen commented on the desperation level of the publicity campaign, [...] "the marketing for this thing has seemed more intrusive and desperate than any other big-ticket release in some time."

2500|$|Sally Beth Draper (Kiernan Shipka); {{recurring}} Seasons 1–3, regular Seasons 4–7: The eldest {{child of}} Don and Betty Draper; {{her relationship with}} her mother is often strained. Sally is a minor character through the first two seasons, but assumes a larger role during the third season as she approaches adolescence. She forms a strong bond with her grandfather, Gene Hofstadt, when he comes to live with the Drapers, and is devastated by his sudden death. [...] She also becomes distraught when Don and Betty break the news that they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> divorce, reproaching her father for breaking his promise to always be there, and accusing her mother of making him leave. She also develops a friendship with Glen, a boy who lives down the street from her (and of whom her mother does not approve). Betty is extremely jealous of this relationship and seeks to sabotage it, deciding to move the family to Rye, New York, and firing Carla, the housekeeper, when Carla lets Glen in the house to say goodbye to Sally. However, in Season 5, Sally is shown to continue her friendship with Glen through phone calls and secret meetings. When Don marries Megan Calvet, Sally establishes a mostly positive relationship with Megan. During the sixth season, Sally is accepted to Miss Porter's School but gets suspended after being caught buying alcohol with a fake ID. In the final season, Sally's disillusionment with both of her parents is evident but changes upon the news of Betty's cancer diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Awareness {{occurs when}} {{patients}} have anesthesia that is inadequate {{to keep them}} unconscious during an operation. [...] The incidence of this anesthesia complication is variable and seems to affect 0.2% to 0.4% of patients according to the surgical setting carried out. This variation reflects the surgical setting {{as well as the}} physiological state of the patient. Thus, the incidence is 0.2% in general surgery, about 0.4% during caesarean section, between 1 and 2% during cardiac surgery and between 10% and 40% for anesthesia of the traumatized. The majority of these do not feel pain although around one third did, in a range of experience from a sore throat due to the endotracheal tube, to traumatic pain at the incision site. The incidence is halved in the absence of neuro-muscular blockade. In this situation, the patient may feel the pain or pressure of surgery, hear conversation, experience air hunger, or have difficulty breathing. The patient may be unable to communicate any distress because they have been given a muscle relaxant; without this, they can move and the anesthesiologists are alerted and provide more anesthetic drugs to render the patient unconscious again. If anesthesia awareness does occur, about 42% feel the pain of the operation, 94% experience panic or anxiety, and 70% experience lasting symptoms which may be psychological and may be physical or neurological. The quoted incidences are controversial as many cases of [...] "awareness" [...] are open to interpretation. These usually involve feeling severe pain, clear recall of the conversations of the operating room staff or suffocation. Some patients undergo sedation for smaller procedures such as biopsies and colonoscopies and are told they will be asleep, although in fact they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> sedation that may allow some level of awareness as opposed to a general anesthetic.|$|E
