25|$|Since the Rebbe's death, there <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{persisted in}} the belief that Schneerson is still the Messiah, {{sometimes}} extremely vocally. Chabad messianists (meshichists) either believe Schneerson will be resurrected, or (a vocal minority) refuse to admit that Schneerson died, instead proclaiming that he is still alive. The Chabad–Lubavitch umbrella organization, Agudas Chasidei Chabad, and the governing body of Chabad–Lubavitch rabbis, Vaad Rabonei Lubavitch, have both denounced the messianic behavior. The issue received much negative attention. To this day it remains controversial.|$|E

Yet there <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> seen their scores decline, often {{because they did not}} change their technique or bowling balls appropriately. Some argue that such high technology unfairly affects competition, making high scores too dependent on how much money one spends on equipment. The USBC, for various reasons, has struggled to regulate these changes well enough to protect the integrity of their honor score award program.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} meningiomas {{are not well}} understood. Most cases are sporadic, {{appearing}} randomly, while some are familial. Persons who have undergone radiation, especially to the scalp, are more at risk for developing meningiomas, as <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had a brain injury. Atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima had a higher than typical frequency of developing meningiomas, with the incidence increasing the closer {{that they were to}} the site of the explosion. Dental x-rays are correlated with an increased risk of meningioma, in particular for people who had frequent dental x-rays in the past, when the x-ray dose of a dental x-ray was higher than in the present.|$|E
25|$|Organ donors may {{be living}} or may {{have died of}} brain death or circulatory death. Most {{deceased}} donors <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been pronounced brain dead. Brain dead means the cessation of brain function, typically after receiving an injury (either traumatic or pathological) to the brain, or otherwise cutting off blood circulation to the brain (drowning, suffocation, etc.). Breathing is maintained via artificial sources, which, in turn, maintains heartbeat. Once brain death has been declared the person {{can be considered for}} organ donation. Criteria for brain death vary. Because less than 3% of all deaths in the U.S. are the result of brain death, the overwhelming majority of deaths are ineligible for organ donation, resulting in severe shortages.|$|E

In view of a speedier administration corresponding to modern demands Pope Pius X has very much simplified the workings of the vicariate; some of its departments he suppressed, others he combined, so that now of its former fifteen sections and sub-sections only seven remain.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many former}} mill towns, Huddersfield {{has a higher}} than average number of {{residents}} from ethnic minorities. The white population makes up 81% of the population comparing to 91.3% for England as a whole.

25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of all the things said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E

These services range from assisting with promotional mailings to staffing the Banjo Jubilee. A former member is someone who resigns from the band or who has not attended a practice or performance for at least three years. Both playing and auxiliary members have voting rights as long as they meet certain annual criteria laid out in the Standing Rules of the Bylaws.

500|$|There is {{a debate}} over what should {{constitute}} an acceptable scientific and engineering foundation for proceeding with radioactive waste disposal strategies. There <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> argued, {{on the basis of}} complex geochemical simulation models, that relinquishing control over radioactive materials to geohydrologic processes at repository closure is an acceptable risk. They maintain that so-called [...] "natural analogues" [...] inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides, making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary. However, existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined: due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations, the accuracy of computer simulation models has not been verified by empirical observation, certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half-lives of high-level radioactive waste. On the other hand, some insist deep geologic repositories in stable geologic formations are necessary. National management plans of various countries display a variety of approaches to resolving this debate.|$|E
