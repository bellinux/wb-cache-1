25|$|Living between Los Angeles and Ireland, Helnwein met {{and photographed}} the Rolling Stones in London, and his {{portrait}} of John F. Kennedy made {{the front cover}} of Time magazine on the 20th anniversary of the president's assassination. His Self-portrait as screaming bandaged man, blinded by forks (1982) became {{the cover of the}} Scorpions album Blackout. Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, William Burroughs and the German industrial metal band Rammstein posed for him; some of his art-works appeared in the cover-booklet of Michael Jackson's History album. Referring to the fall of the Berlin Wall Helnwein created the book Some Facts <b>about</b> <b>Myself,</b> together with Marlene Dietrich. In 2003 he became friends with Marilyn Manson and started a collaboration with him on the multi-media art-project The Golden Age of Grotesque and on several experimental video-projects. Among his widely published works is a spoof of the famous Edward Hopper painting Nighthawks, entitled Boulevard of Broken Dreams, depicting Elvis Presley, Marylin Monroe, James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. This painting also inspired the Green Day song of the same name.|$|E

500|$|Many of the album's {{lyrics are}} {{narrative}} and diaristic in nature, and were heavily drawn from Love's {{personal life and}} experiences in her teenage and young adult years. In a press release promoting the album, Love said: [...] "These songs are about my own weaknesses and impurities; things <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> that I hate... paranoias, petty concerns, and pithy, pathetic things that are inside of me." [...] The songs are often lyrically abstract and describe shocking scenes of violence, and, particularly, violence against women. Prominent themes discussed in the lyrics include elitism, beauty and self-image, abortion, prostitution, suicide, murder, [...] "red lights", and self-destructiveness. Q Magazine described the lyrics on the record as [...] "confrontational" [...] and [...] "genuinely uninhibited." ...|$|E

[...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life. I saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, {{to be different from}} the way that they are -- came from lies that I told <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> -- my wanting to be different from the way that I was." ...|$|E

500|$|Amanda Sebestyen {{wrote in}} The Women's Review of Books {{that at first}} glance the ideas in The Good Terrorist appear deceptively simple, and the plot predictable. But she added that Lessing's {{strength}} is her [...] "stoic narrat of the daily effort of living", which excels in describing day-to-day life in a squat. Sebestyen also praised the book's depiction of Alice, who [...] "speak to me most disquietingly <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> and my generation". In a review in off our backs, an American feminist publication, Vickie Leonard called The Good Terrorist a [...] "fascinating book" [...] that is [...] "extremely well written" [...] with characters that are [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "realistic". Leonard added that even though Alice is not a feminist, the book illustrates the author's [...] "strong admiration for women and their accomplishments".|$|E

When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible <b>about</b> <b>myself.</b> They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E

Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught me a lot <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist.

500|$|In 1997, Gittings and Lahusen {{pushed the}} American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to grant couple's {{membership}} to them, for a reduced price on health insurance. One {{of her last}} acts as an activist was {{to come out in}} the newsletter published by the assisted living facility they reside in. On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania after a long battle with breast cancer. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: [...] "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> and {{what it meant to be}} gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off our backs, to oil the closet door hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world too. It's hard work— but it's vital, and it's gratifying, and it's often fun!" ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the {{emotional}} {{gulf between the}} state of his domestic affairs {{and the loss of}} his special friendship informs the reading of [...] "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem [...] "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, [...] "There is more <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam." [...] Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.|$|E
