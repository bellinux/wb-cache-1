25|$|Reliability {{refers to}} whether the scores are reproducible. A variety of things can {{influence}} the reliability of scores, so the concept of reliability applies to scores from tests given to groups of people (such as English-reading youths and their caregivers or teachers) in particular settings (such as a special education classroom or a community mental health clinic). Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>context</b> than {{where it had been}} studied before.|$|E
25|$|Remnants of the Vision Serpent {{have survived}} until modern times. Around 1930, J.E.S.

The participant came into direct contact with a giant serpent, Ochan (Och-Kan).

25|$|Two {{types of}} tensor decompositions exist, which generalise the SVD to multi-way arrays. One of them {{decomposes}} a tensor into a sum of rank-1 tensors, {{which is called}} a tensor rank decomposition. The second type of decomposition computes the orthonormal subspaces associated with the different factors appearing in the tensor product of vector spaces in which the tensor lives. This decomposition is {{referred to in the}} literature as the higher-order SVD (HOSVD) or Tucker3/TuckerM. In addition, multilinear principal component analysis in multilinear subspace learning involves the same mathematical operations as Tucker decomposition, being used in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>context</b> of dimensionality reduction.|$|E
25|$|Research studies provide {{evidence}} that the fetus becomes familiar with chemical cues in the intrauterine environment. Intrauterine olfactory learning may be demonstrated by behavioral evidence that newborn infants respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid. Infants are responsive to the olfactory cues associated with maternal breast odors. They are able to recognize and react favorably to scents emitted from their own mother’s breasts, {{despite the fact that}} they also may be attracted to breast odors from unfamiliar nursing females in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>context.</b> The unique scent of the mother (to the infant) is referred to as her olfactory signature. While breasts are a source of the unique olfactory cue of the mother, infants are also able to recognize and respond with familiarity and preference to their mother’s underarm scent.|$|E
25|$|The Danish National Bank {{estimates}} that the occupation had resulted in the printing press increasing the currency supply from the pre-war figure of 400 million kroner to 1,600 million, much of which {{ended up in the}} hands of war profiteers. In July 1945, two months after the liberation of Denmark, the Danish Parliament passed an emergency law initiating a currency reform, making all old banknotes void. A small number of employees at the National Bank had clandestinely begun the production of new banknotes in late 1943. The production of new notes happened without the knowledge of the German forces located at the bank, and by the spring of 1945 the bank's stock of notes was sufficient to initiate the exchange. The law required was passed hastily on Friday 20 July and published the same day; it also closed all shops for the weekend. By Monday 23 July, all old notes were officially outlawed as legal tender and any note not declared in a bank by 30 July would lose its value. This law allowed any Dane to exchange a total of 100 kroner to new notes, no questions asked. An amount up to 500 kroner would be exchanged, provided the owner signed a written statement explaining its origins. Any amount above this level would be deposited in an escrow account and only released or exchanged following scrutiny by tax officials examining the validity of the person's statement about the origins of this wealth. All existing bank accounts were also scrutinized. Multiple exchanges of cash by the same person were avoided by the requirement that currency would only be exchanged to anybody also handing in a specified ration stamp, previously issued in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>context,</b> which had not yet been authorized for use. The exchange resulted in a significant drop in the currency supply, and around 20% of the 3,000 million kroner property declared had not previously been registered by the tax authorities. Estimates vary for the amounts of currency simply destroyed by its owners. All banknotes issued since the changeover date remain valid indefinitely; earlier ones are not valid.|$|E

The story of the game is influenced by decisions the player made in the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.

BioWare stated that Mass Effect 3 ends Shepard's story arc and that future games in the series would feature <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>context.</b> Unlike its predecessors, Mass Effect 3 features a multiplayer cooperative mode in addition to the single-player campaign.

In some Ramayana adaptations and North-western Indian manuscripts of Ramayana, it is Tara, not Ruma in whom Sugriva is engrossed when Lakshmana arrives. The South Indian manuscripts portray the drunk Sugriva, who is engrossed in lustful revel as being ignorant of Lakshmana's anger and sending Tara to pacify him, in some versions, {{even though she is}} drunk. Though intoxicated with [...] "half-closed eyes and unsteady gait", Tara manages to disarm Lakshmana. The intoxication of Tara is also described in original Ramayana, but in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>context.</b> Tara is described as having made it a habit to visit Sugriva always in a tipsy state, before indulging in the [...] "new pleasures of love".|$|E
