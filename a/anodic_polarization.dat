LSM offers high performance under electrolysis conditions due to generation of oxygen vacancies under <b>anodic</b> <b>polarization</b> that aid oxygen diffusion. [...] In addition, impregnating LSM electrode with GDC nanoparticles was found to increase cell lifetime by preventing delamination at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The exact mechanism by how this happen needs to be explore further. In a 2010 study, it was found that neodymium nickelate as an anode material provided 1.7 times the current density of typical LSM anodes when integrated into a commercial SOEC and operated at 700 °C, and approximately 4 times the current density when operated at 800 °C. The increased performance is postulated to be due to higher [...] "overstoichimoetry" [...] of oxygen in the neodymium nickelate, making it a successful conductor of both ions and electrons.|$|E

40|$|The {{modification}} of a glassy carbon electrode with gold nanoparticles was pursued, characterized, and examined for electrocatalytic applications. The fabrication process of this electrode involved assembling the gold nanoparticles atop of amino group grafted glassy carbon electrode. The {{scanning electron microscopy}} indicated the deposition of gold nanoparticles in flower-shaped nanostructures with an average particle size of ca. 150  nm. Interestingly, the electrode exhibited outstanding enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction, which reflected from the large negative shift (ca. 0. 8  V) in its onset potential, in comparison with that observed at the bulk unmodified glassy carbon and gold electrodes. Alternatively, the Tafel plot of the modified electrode revealed a significant increase (∼one order of magnitude) in the apparent exchange current density of the oxygen evolution reaction upon the modification, which infers a faster charge transfer. Kinetically, gold nanoparticles are believed to facilitate a favorable adsorption of OH− (fundamental step in oxygen evolution reaction), which allows the charge transfer at reasonably lower <b>anodic</b> <b>polarizations...</b>|$|R

In all solutions the alloys, having nominal compositions Ti– 50 Zr at. % and Ti– 13 Zr– 13 Nb wt. %, displayed a valve-metal behaviour, {{owing to the}} formation of barrier-type oxide films.

40|$|The low {{temperature}} embrittlement behavior of duplex stainless steel 2205 was investigated {{on the basis}} of changes in mechanical and electrochemical properties after aging for 5000 h at 335, 365 and 400 degrees C. Aging leads to increase in the hardness of delta-ferrite phase. The ferrite hardening was very rapid in the initial stages of aging; thereafter the hardness increase was more gradual at all the aging temperatures. Charpy impact test of the aged samples showed drastic decrease in impact toughness. The value of Charpy impact energy saturated after aging to 5000 h at all the aging temperatures. The embrittlement in the material is known to be caused by spinodal decomposition reaction in which the delta-ferrite decomposes into iron-rich a and chromium-enriched alpha'. For the purpose of non-destructive evaluation of thermal aging embrittlement, double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) test and <b>anodic</b> <b>polarizations</b> in acetic acid and HCl solution were carried out.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the surface oxygen content of electrocatalysts can be arranged in order as: Pt/NiCeOx> Pt/PdCeOx>Pd/PtCeOx> Ni/PtCeOx> Pt/FeCeOx> Fe/PtCeOx. Comparison of XPS and ICP-OES (bulk and surface analysis) indicate that; after hydrogen reduction Pt and Ni in Pt/NiCeOx or Ni/PtCeOx segregate to the surface.
