This results in a ticket from Uppsala to Arlanda costing SEK136, while a ticket on the same train but traveling onwards to StockholmC only costs SEK64.

The NFL at first offered $2,400 to fans who did not receive a replacement seat, but later offered tickets to a future Super Bowl with airfare and hotels included.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Burns' {{state of}} mind {{is the subject of}} {{frequent}} jokes on the show. At times, he appears to be completely removed from reality and modern conventions. He continually fails to recognize Homer Simpson or remember his name, even though many of the recent major events in Mr. Burns' life have involved Homer in some way. Mr. Burns is, for the most part, unaware of the townspeople's general dislike of him. He also displays mannerisms which are considered outdated, such as practicing phrenology, writing with a quill pen, and using an antique view camera to take photographs. He is also angered when Springfield Elementary children mock his dated car, saying it was [...] "the first car to outrun a man!" [...] Mr. Burns refers to many celebrities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the present tense, assuming they are still alive. In [...] "Homer at the Bat", Mr. Burns instructs Smithers to recruit dead-ball era players, such as Honus Wagner and Cap Anson for the plant's softball team, and has to be told that all of them died long ago. He also once rewarded Homer for being the first to arrive at work with <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1939 World's Fair. However, despite his obvious senility and social ineptitude, Mr. Burns is an extraordinarily clever businessman, as he has lost his fortune several times, only to regain it a very brief time later. In the episode [...] "The Old Man and Lisa", Mr. Burns loses his fortune, and regains it by opening a recycling plant, which allows him to regain his nuclear power plant. Additionally, in the episode [...] "The Seemingly Never-Ending Story", Mr. Burns loses both his fortune and nuclear power plant to the Rich Texan after losing a scavenger hunt, but eventually gains both back after a series of events that includes him briefly working at Moe's Tavern.|$|E
