40|$|The {{medical records}} of 277 {{consecutive}} patients who underwent cholecystectomy for benign gall stone disease, were reviewed {{to determine the}} incidence and cause of biliary tract obstructuion. Obstructive jaundice (icteric obstructive biliopathy) was present in 38 cases. This was due to choledocholithiasis in 22, Mirizzi’s Syndrome in two, biliobiliary fistula in eight and biliary stricture in five patients. Preoperative direct cholangiography (ERCP/PIC) was helpful. <b>Anicteric</b> patients were classified {{on the basis of}} a history of jaundice, serum alkaline phosphatase, sonography and operative findings. <b>Anicteric</b> patients with evidence of biliary tract pathology (<b>anicteric</b> obstructive biliopathy) had a significant incidence of choledocholithiasis (33. 3 %). Biliary complications were uncommon in this group (4. 3 %). Peroperative cholangiography was carried out and was valuable in these patients but was normal in all 83 patients who had no evidence of biliary obstruction.

40|$|Liver {{structure}} and function in 10 patients with extrahepatic biliary atresia were studied after portoenteric anastomosis (Kasai operation). Bile flow adequate to reduce the serum bilirubin concentration was established in five patients (improved group), three of whom became <b>anicteric.</b> The serum bilirubin concentration did not decrease in the remaining five patients (unimproved group). Hepatic effluent collected postoperatively from both groups contained small amounts of cholesterol and bilirubin; bile salts, however, {{were present in the}} hepatic effluent of only the improved patients. Liver biopsy specimens obtained postoperatively from the five improved patients showed partial (in two) or complete (in three) relief of cholestasis; hepatic fibrosis, however, was unchanged (in one) or worse (in four). The serum concentrations of bile salts were markedly elevated, despite normal excretion of sodium sulfobromophthalein and rose bengal, in two <b>anicteric</b> patients studied 14 and 24 months postoperatively.

40|$|Leptospirosis, a {{zoonosis}} occurring worldwide, has a {{broad spectrum}} of clinical manifestations. Recently, various countries observed an increase of severe <b>anicteric</b> cases. In Austria and Germany, growing numbers of imported cases are notified in addition to autochthonous infections. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether imported and autochthonous cases differ in clinical manifestations and outcome. We retrospectively analyzed 24 imported and 35 autochthonous cases treated in six infectious disease units between 1998 and 2008. To compare disease severity, patients were classified according to established independent risk factors for fatal outcome. Although severe leptospirosis (i. e., presence of ≥ 1 independent risk factors for death) occurred in similar proportions of imported (67 %) and autochthonous (86 %) infections (P = 0. 1), imported cases were significantly fewer icteric (13 % versus 69 %; P < 0. 0001).

40|$|The plasma {{clearance}} of a tracer dose of 14 C-glycocholic acid, and fasting total serum {{bile acid}} concentrations were measured in 14 control subjects and in 38 patients with acute and chronic liver disease.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that in}} <b>anicteric</b> patients with the isolated form of schistosomiasis (without comorbidities) an ursodeoxycholic acid-sensitive increase in serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity (gamma GT) occurs. We now describe the presence of cholangiopathy in these patients. Methods: Sixteen adult <b>anicteric</b> patients with the isolated form of schistosomiasis mansoni were carefully selected: nine with increased gamma GT and seven with normal gamma GT. High sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), to exclude inflammatory status, hyaluronic acid (HA), and other laboratory parameters were determined. the ultrasonographic study measured spleen length, portal vein and splenic vein diameters, and the portal flow. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) images were interpreted by a blind observer. MRCP was deemed abnormal when focal narrowing and/or paucity of second and third order biliary branches and/or irregularities in the contours of biliary pathways were identified. Results: Both groups (normal and elevated gamma GT) have preserved hepatic function tests (HA, serum albumin, prothrombin time) and clinical significant portal hypertension (low platelet count and ultrasonographic parameters). MRCP was abnormal in all patients with elevated gamma GT but in only 3 of the 7 patients with normal gamma GT (p = 0. 003). Conclusion: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography characterized a cholangiopatic disorder in <b>anicteric</b> patients with the isolated form of schistosomiasis, even preceding laboratory test alterations.

IgM Leptospira DipstickTM and Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) was used to detect human antibodies to leptospiras and serovar respectively. Leptospirosis incidence in humans was 2. 2 / 100, 000 inhab. in 1998, 0. 7 / 100, 000 in 1999 and 0. 9 / 100, 000 in 2000. Overall seroprevalence was 14. 2 %, relatively unchanged from seroprevalences observed 20 years ago. Highest seropositivity was found in people over 56 years of age, predominating males over females. Predominant serovars in the open population were tarassovi, hardjo, pomona and panama. Leptospirosis cases were most frequent in rural areas, and the <b>anicteric</b> course predominated over the icteric.

Eighty-three others were tested less frequently. Twenty-seven changes were found in the serums of the 56 people tested frequently enough to have their course examined. There were four cases of typical acute hepatitis with Au(l) in the serum, fifteen staff members with rises in SGPT indicative of acute <b>anicteric</b> hepatitis, and eight staff members with small SGPT rises.

A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify untreated patient series. Included patients were symptomatic, but asymptomatic patients and those who had received antibiotics, dialysis or who were treated on Intensive Care Units were excluded. Included patients had a confirmed laboratory diagnosis by culture, PCR, or serological tests. Data was extracted and individual patient series were assessed for bias. Thirty-five studies, comprising 41 patient series and 3, 390 patients, were included in the study. A high degree of bias within studies was shown due to limitations in study design, diagnostic tests and missing data. Median series mortality was 2. 2 % (Range 0. 0 - 39. 7 %), but mortality was high in jaundiced patients (19. 1 %) (Range 0. 0 - 39. 7 %), those with renal failure 12. 1 % (Range 0 - 25. 0 %) and in patients aged over 60 (60 %) (Range 33. 3 - 60 %), but low in <b>anicteric</b> patients (0 %) (Range 0 - 1. 7 %).
