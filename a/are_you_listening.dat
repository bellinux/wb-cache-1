25|$|Four {{months after}} {{publishing}} his first article in Marc’Aurelio, the highly influential biweekly humour magazine, {{he joined the}} editorial board, achieving success with a regular column titled But <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Listening?</b> Described as “the determining moment in Fellini’s life”, the magazine gave him steady employment between 1939 and 1942, when he interacted with writers, gagmen, and scriptwriters. These encounters eventually led to opportunities in show business and cinema. Among his collaborators on the magazine’s editorial board were the future director Ettore Scola, Marxist theorist and scriptwriter Cesare Zavattini, and Bernardino Zapponi, a future Fellini screenwriter. Conducting interviews for CineMagazzino also proved congenial: when asked to interview Aldo Fabrizi, Italy’s most popular variety performer, he established such immediate personal rapport with the man that they collaborated professionally. Specializing in humorous monologues, Fabrizi commissioned material from his young protégé.|$|E

He was seventeen, then. Seventeen, mind you. And all he knew was a little Latin and Greek, a very little, and nothing else. And they sent him out to make his fortune." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Snyder, as a detective, {{you will}} be {{interested}} in a curious and very tragic affair which happened in this house a few days ago. One of my boarders, Captain Gunner, was found dead in his room. It was the room which he shared with Captain Muller. I am very proud of the reputation of my house, Mr. Snyder, and it was a blow to me that this should have happened. I applied to an agency for a detective, and they sent me a stupid boy, with nothing to recommend him except his belief in himself. He said that Captain Gunner had died by accident, killed by a snake which had come out of a crate of bananas. I knew better. I knew that Captain Gunner had been murdered. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>listening,</b> Captain Muller? This will interest you, as you were such a friend of his." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned me}} cold. I felt that here, at least, he was right. My husband had wooed {{and won the}} woman who had refused Dexter's offer of marriage. Was Dexter the man to forgive that? My own {{experience}} answered me, and said, No. [...] "Bear in mind what I have told you," [...] Mr. Playmore proceeded. [...] "And now let us get on to your own position in this matter, and to the interests that you have at stake. Try to adopt my point of view for the moment; and let us inquire what chance we have of making any further advance toward a discovery of the truth. It is one thing to be morally convinced (as I am) that Miserrimus Dexter is the man who ought to have been tried for the murder at Gleninch; and it is another thing, at this distance of time, to lay our hands on the plain evidence which can alone justify anything like a public assertion of his guilt. There, as I see it, is the insuperable difficulty in the case. Unless I am completely mistaken, the question is now narrowed to this plain issue: The public assertion of your husband's innocence depends entirely on the public assertion of Dexter's guilt. How are you to arrive at that result? There is not a particle of evidence against him. You can only convict Dexter on Dexter's own confession. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>listening</b> to me?" ...|$|E
