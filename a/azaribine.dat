40|$|<b>Azaribine,</b> as a {{pyrimidine}} analog, {{blocks the}} decarboxylase conversion of orotidylic acid to uridine monophosphate with a resultant excretion of accumulated orotic acid and orotidine in the urine. Patients treated with <b>azaribine</b> may develop transitory, severe {{central nervous system}} symptoms of depression, lethargy, and ataxia. These side effects are not predictable from oral dosage, and blood levels of the drug {{are very difficult to}} determine. All of our psoriatic patients treated with <b>azaribine</b> excreted large but variable amounts of orotic acid-orotidine in the urine. Spot urine ratios of orotic acid-orotidine:creatinine correlated very well with measured 24 -hr urine output of orotic acid-orotidine. Patients with central nervous system symptoms were found to have very high urine levels of orotic acid orotidine. These symptoms can be prevented by monitoring the urinary orotic acid-orotidine:creatinine ratio levels and keeping them within a range which is still compatible with successful management of the psoriatic lesions...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by hyperproliferation of epidermal cells. This is the first study of the effects. of antipsoriasis drugs on the growth of epidermis-derived cells in cell culture. GP 18 cells, a clonal strain of epithelial-like cells derived from guinea pig epidermis and selected for rapid growth and epithelial morphology, responded as expected to metabolic inhibitors with known mechanisms of action. Cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicine inhibited thymidine incorporation into DNA, as did actinomycin D. Cycloheximide and puromycin inhibited amino acid incorporation into protein. All inhibited cell proliferation at a 2 μM concentration. The antipsoriasis drugs (in order of potency: methotrexate, anthralin, mycophenolic acid, <b>azaribine</b> [its active metabolite, azauridine, was used], and hydroxyurea) all inhibited thymidine (or deoxyuridine) incorporation into DNA, but not amino acid incorporation into protein. They also inhibited cell proliferation when applied to GP 18 cells at concentrations of 0. 5 to 50 μg/ml. Anthralin, which was studied in more detail, was also found to be most potent against rapidly growing cells, to inhibit growth irreversibly, and to inhibit utilization of thymidine and deoxyuridine equally. The similar type of activity shown by all of these drugs with GP 18 cells indicates that in vitro cultured cell systems could be useful tools in identifying new topically active drugs potentially useful as antipsoriasis agents...|$|E
