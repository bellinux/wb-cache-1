40|$|Buffer {{solutions}} for pH {{control in the}} range of dissociation constants of weak acids (10 to 106) are numerous, But the suitability of a buffer system in the physiologically important pH range (pH values of 6 to 8) is rendered difficult by the scarcity of weak acid-base systems with pK’s between 6 and 8. Another hindering factor is the incompatibility of some acid-salt buffers with physio-logical media (1, 2). For example, the primary pH standard phosphate buf-fers, certified by the National Bureau of Standards, precipitate calcium and react with certain other blood constituents. An attempt to avoid this kind of diffi-culty has been made by Durst and Sta-ples (3), Bates and Allen (4), and others through the use of nitrogenous bases and their salts.

Attention is centered on the coupling constants, which are compared with other values and discussed {{in light of the}} known inapplicability to pyridine of the average energy approximation. The coupling ^ 2 J_(NH) exhibits the normal dependence on geometry, and the algebraic increase observed on protonation parallels the behavior exhibited by other acyclic compounds with unsaturated nitrogen. The coupling ^ 1 J_(NC) in pyridine increases 30 -fold on protonation, which accords with qualitative predictions. In contrast to the absence of C-N coupling over more than one bond in saturated systems (glycine, alanine, 1,l-dimethylhydrazine), pyridine and pyridinium ion display substantial C-N couplings over two and three bonds. Because large two-bond C-N couplings are also observed in methylnitrosamine as well as in some amides, the presence of a π system is felt to be important for the longer range couplings. Substantial solvent effects are observed on these couplings which may be attributed to increasing hydrogen bonding at nitrogen. On the basis of changes in ^(15) N chemical shifts and ^(15) N-H coupling constants, ^lJ_(NC) is shown to very likely undergo a change in sign when the nitrogen is protonated...|$|E

Kainoids are a group of non-proteinogenic pyrrolidine dicarboxylic acids, which have attracted considerable interest because of their potent biological activity, including insecticidal, anthelmintic and neuroexcitatory properties. The ideal synthesis of kainoids would allow the ability to introduce various side chains at the C- 4 position to access diverse pharmacologically active kainoid analogues. Tandem asymmetric Heck-Mizoroki arylation reaction and [2, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement provides a quick and efficient way to access these molecules.

40|$|Gyorgy (1, 2), in {{nutritional}} {{studies on}} rats, demonstrated that a charac-teristic dematitis {{for which he}} coined the name “rat acrodynia ” {{is due to a}} new factor of the vitamin B complex. This factor, which he named vitamin B 6, has been isolated (3, 4, 5, 6) from rice bran and yeast and identified as 2 methyl- 3 -hydroxy 4, 5 -bis-(hydroxymethyl) -pyridine (Pyridoxine); its synthesis was accomplished in 1939 by Harris and Folkers (7) and simultane-ously by Kuhn and coworkers (8). The importance of vitamin B 6 in the nutrition of animal species other than the rat has been pointed out by several investigators. Fouts, Helmer, Lepkovsky, and Jukes (9, 10, 11) showed that dogs maintained on a diet free of vitamin B 6 develop a microcytic, hypochromic anemia which is not relieved by iron but responds readily to the administration of vitamin B 6. These results have been confirmed by McKibbon, Madden, Black and Elve-hjem (12). The rOle of vitamin B 6 in the nutrition of pigs has been suggested by the work of Chick et al. (13) and Wintrobe (14), and Jukes (15) has es-tablished the need for this vitamin in the chick. Recent reports (16, 17, 18, 19) indicate the necessity for vitamin B 6 in the nutrition of man. Synthetic material was used exclusively in the present investigation since we found in a previous study (20) on B 6 deficient rats that synthetic and pure natural vitamin B 6 are identical in their physiological actions. The vitamin both as the free base and {{in the form of the}} hydrochloride is readily soluble in water. Solutions of the base are neutral in reaction, whereas the pH of a 10 per cent solution of vitamin B 6 hydrochloride is 2. 5.
