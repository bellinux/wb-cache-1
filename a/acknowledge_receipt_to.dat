40|$|Letter to Guy Guernsey, Secretary of Chicago-Kent College of Law, from Nettie Rothblum (1909), in 1913. Nettie Rothblum, {{one of the}} {{original}} founders of the Kappa Beta Pi Legal Sorority in 1908, was in Sinaloa during the Mexican Revolution, and included a short description of life in Mexico at the time along with payment for her sister Ruth 2 ̆ 7 s tuition. Transcript: February 21, 1913. Dear Mr. Guernsey, Your cordial letter received and but for the fact that I have been extremely busy, would have answered it before this. With all the war news that you are getting in Chicago, it hardly behooves me to add anything, excepting the fact that this particular spot is quiet. At least, we expected to be besieged day before yesterday. Everyone was armed, and the home I live in was guarded, because it would be the centre of attack, but the revolutionists stopped at Mochicahui, a little town few miles north, thought better of it when they heard we were prepared to meet them, and didnt [sic] come that day, although we now expect them daily. In fact, their leader was at the house the morning the attack was expected, reconnoitred, and withdrew, and none of us were any the wiser until now. Inclosed [sic] herewith please find my check to order of Chicago-Kent to pay for Ruth 2 ̆ 7 s tuition, the last semester. I have dated it March 4 th, which is near enough {{to the beginning of the}} new semester, to be acceptable, I think. Please <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> direct <b>to</b> my sister, as you did before. With kindest personal regards, I am, Sincerely yours, Nettie Rothblum[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO identified four methods the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), within the U. S. Department of Transportation, uses to assure that recipients of federal transit funding comply with civil rights requirements: 1) requiring recipients to self-certify that they assure compliance with applicable civil rights requirements; 2) issuing guidance to inform recipients of their responsibilities; 3) administering a complaints process; and 4) conducting oversight reviews of funding recipients' compliance with laws and requirements. GAO found that FTA's policies and procedures for processing civil rights complaints incorporate nine key federal practices based on an analysis of U. S. Department of Justice guidance: 1) ensure a timely complaint process; 2) provide a complaint process that is accessible to the public; 3) <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> of complaint <b>to</b> complainant; 4) document complaint allegations to be resolved; 5) document the results of any complaint investigations; 6) use informal method to resolve complaints when possible; 7) provide a formal or an informal appeals process {{for the results of}} complaints investigations; 8) after a complaint investigation is completed, monitor the recipient based on the issues involved in the complaint; and 9) oversee an effective program of compliance reviews for recipients and subrecipients. Additionally, GAO found that FTA's average times for resolving complaints greatly decreased from 2009 through 2012, and that few FTA investigations of complaints resulted in findings of violations. ...|$|R
