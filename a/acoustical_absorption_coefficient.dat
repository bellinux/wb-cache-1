40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} {{a class of}} engineered metamaterials {{for the purpose of}} attenuating and trapping spectrally broadband vibration and acoustic energy. The physical phenomenon realized to effect such wideband energy dissipation performance is termed hyperdamping since it is the consequence of eliminating fundamental stiffness contributions within the material system so as to asymptotically enhance damping properties. A strategically sculpted elastomer topology is geometrically constrained and embedded in a poroelastic matrix to realize the metamaterial platform. Finite element model analyses guide design of the embedded hyperdamping inclusions while experimental studies on dynamic force transmissibility and <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> provide conclusive evidence that hyperdamping phenomena facilitate wideband energy dissipation in a lightweight material system that is not subject to the limitations of conventional resonance- or bandgap-based attenuation effects. The hyperdamping metamaterials thus meet the often conflicting performance requirements of real applications where broadband vibrations and noise must be abated using lightweight material solutions...|$|E
40|$|This work reports {{new data}} on the {{acoustical}} properties of open cell foam with pore stratification. The pore size distribution {{as a function of}} the sample depth is determined in the laboratory using methods of optical image analysis. It is shown that the pore size distribution in this class of materials changes gradually with the depth. It is also shown that the observed pore size distribution gradient is responsible for the air flow resistivity stratification, which is measured acoustically and non-acoustically. The <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the developed porous sample is measured using a standard laboratory method. A suitable theoretical model for the acoustical properties of porous media with pore size distribution is adopted. The measured data for open porosity, tortuosity, and standard deviation data are used together with this model to predict the observed acoustic absorption behavior of the developed material sample. The transfer matrix approach is used in the modeling process to account for the pore size stratification. This work suggests that it is possible to design and manufacture porous media with continuous pore size stratification, which can provide an improvement to conventional porous media with uniform pore size distribution in terms of the attained acoustic absorption coefficient...|$|E

First, the <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> of porous concrete materials with various aggregate types, gradations, fibre contents, and compaction indexes are measured in the laboratory. The laboratory results show that porous concrete that uses a composite of expanded perlite and slag as aggregate can not only obtain good <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> properties but also satisfy mechanical requirements. Also, the gradation of the combined aggregate has {{a significant effect on}} the acoustic absorption performance of the porous concrete, with an optimal aggregate gradation of 1 ~ 3 [*]mm. Furthermore, the fibre content and compaction index affect both the strength and the acoustic absorption property of the porous concrete, with the optimum value of 0. 3 % and 1. 6, respectively. Then, the findings from the laboratory studies are used to make porous sound-absorbing concrete slabs, which are applied in a test section. The measurements indicate that porous sound-absorbing concrete slabs can significantly reduce railway noise at different train speeds and that the amount of the noise reduction changes roughly linearly with speed when the train is traveling at less than 200 [*]km/h.

Textiles used in vehicles are increasing, and the current performance of the expectations bar is determined by automobile manufacturers. While meeting the expectations of users in the vehicle mechanically, but also disturbing the user during operation of the mechanical properties of this ratio should be minimized. This study was intended to minimize sound transmission of nonwoven textile components, which are used in cars as silencer parts. For that purpose, four different models were developed in this study.

In spit of industrial improvements, exposure with over permissible limit of noise is counted as one of the health complication of workers. In Iran, do not exact information of the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of acoustic materials.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore and analyze the effect of porosity {{on the use of}} mul-tiple perforated plate (hereafter PP) implemented with coir fiber acoustic absorber. Previous-ly developed analytical method for multilayer PP absorber employing Allard and Sgard mod-el together with acoustic transmission approach and Johnson-Allard rigid frame model was utilized to estimate the absorption coefficient of the absorber in different conditions. The ve-rification of the estimated <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> for multiple PP absorber using the developed method are shown for two different combination compromises of two PP, coir fi-ber and or air gap. Measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence sound absorption of the panel. It shows that the presented analytical method can provide a fa-vorable and consistent agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, it was anticipated that this analytical approach can be used efficiently for exploring and analyzing the factor that may significantly contributes and control the absorption behavior of multiple PP absor-ber in the use of coir fiber. In this research, only two layer PP absorbers are analyzed to de-scribe the characteristic factors as a preliminary study for multiple PP absorbers. The acoustic features of the multiple PP acoustic absorbers such as effect of PP porosity with the variation of arrangement of PPs and backing compartment employed with PP are discussed in details. Those elements seem to have a significant contribution on the absorption characteristics of the absorber. In addition, it was noticed that porosities of PP can be engineered based on per-formance of the panel and designed for developing an effective coir fiber absorber utilizing multiple PP in future. Moreover, some recommendations were made {{based on the results of}} the analysis.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{absorption}} {{characteristics of}} coir fiber were analyzed previously. &# 13; Analytical method {{to predict the}} acoustical behavior of coir fiber has already been developed. &# 13; However, compression effects of coir fiber were not explored which might significant for acoustics&# 13; absorption during seat padding. In this study, compression effect on the sound absorption&# 13; characteristics of coir fiber are demonstrated based on the previous analytical approach such as rigid&# 13; frame method with the modification in the physical parameters. Approach: The verification of the&# 13; estimated <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> in uncompressed condition using rigid frame Johnson-&# 13; Allard Model are shown for three different thicknesses of industrially processed coir fiber mixed with&# 13; binder latex. Measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence sound absorption&# 13; of coir fiber. It {{is well known that}} the absorption behavior of a porous material varies during&# 13; compression and affects the physical parameters. In these analyses, formulas proposed by Castagnede&# 13; are employed to predict the compression effect on the absorption of coir fiber which takes into account&# 13; the modifications of the physical parameters during compression. Results: The agreement between the&# 13; analytical and measured results is justified for all three sample thicknesses in uncompressed condition. &# 13; Analyses on the acoustic behavior of material during compressed condition show that compression has a&# 13; substantial effect on the absorption of coir fiber. It also indicates that the absorption of coir fiber can be&# 13; enhanced by compressing the material. In addition, the absorption performances are compared by varying&# 13; the compression rate on material at uncompressed and compressed condition. Conclusion: From overall&# 13; analyses, it is evident that compression of coir fiber can significantly change the absorption behavior of&# 13; coir fiber from the actual acoustical characteristics as estimated at normal condition. Moreover,&# 13; compressing the material might be considered as a possible approach to improve the absorption&# 13; coefficient of coir fiber.

40|$|Therapeutic {{ultrasound}} {{describes a}} non-invasive surgical technique by which high-energy ultrasound is delivered to malignant tissue. This method must be monitored {{in order to}} ensure that the correct tissues are treated and that the tissues are treated with the proper dose. Typically, therapeutic ultrasound has relied on MRI techniques to monitor the extent of the thermal surgery. Besides for the great cost and limited availability, MRI monitoring presents limitations for therapeutic equipment design because all other equipment must be compatible with the large magnetic fields created by the MRI system. A new method of monitoring is explored which uses a method coined Ultrasound Stimulated Acoustic Emission, USAE. This relatively new material property measurement method presented by M. Fatemi and J. F. Greenleaf in Science May 1998 relies on the low frequency stimulation of a material by overlapping two slightly differing high frequency ultrasound beams in a pattern which creates a region of low frequency, known as a beat frequency. The resulting low frequency stimulus is highly focused and localized. The low frequency pressure field causes cyclic forces and induces a mechanical displacement in the object being imaged. The low frequency response of the object from the ultrasound stimulus reveals information about the mechanical and ultrasound properties of the object, namely its stiffness and <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> A diagnostic ultrasound system applying the USAE method for imaging biological tissues was designed and constructed for use in this thesis. In a series of experiments presented in this thesis, the USAE method is applied to imaging ex vivo porcine and rabbit tissue. Lesions are created with focused ultrasound and raster scanned in the focal plane by the two intersecting focused ultrasound fields to image the necrosed tissue. This method successfully rendered high-resolution images of the necrosed lesions. In addition, the amplitude of the USAE responses correlate well with temperature measurements in a study of nine samples of porcine fat and nine samples of porcine muscle. Evidence including a broadband response and fluctuating USAE amplitude indicate that the USAE method may also be used to detect cavitation events in tissue. The images and the temperature measurements demonstrate the effectiveness of the USAE method for imaging and monitoring biological tissue in conjunction with thermal therapy. by Jonathan S. Thierman.

Allard method took the elasticity of material into account and transfer matrices were able to characterize the whole structure as a combination of single layers. Results were close to experimental values and predicted the path and resonances very well. Further analyzes were conducted by Allard method and derived that having a fiber layer backed by an air gap was better than leaving the same gap in between that layer. The explanation was that, in the first arrangement, the sound field impacted a solid layer with higher thickness and followed a longer transmission path which caused a higher <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption.</b> Furthermore, it was noticed that a reasonable thickness of backing air gap improved the overall sound absorption. Increase in the gap thickness produced more peaks and moved them to lower frequencies which caused better absorption in low frequencies. The cause of this phenomenon was increase in impedance of the panel due to rise in the air-gap thickness. This moved the acoustical resonances to lower frequencies and improved the sound absorption in this frequency span.

The regional model WRF-Chem was used in conjunction with a high resolution soot emission inventory to simulate soot mass concentrations and <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the Central European Troposphere. The model was validated using soot mass concentrations from Raman measurements and <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Simulated soot mass concentrations were found to be too low by around 50 %, which could be improved by scaling the emissions by a factor of two. In contrast, the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> was positively biased by around 20 %. Adjusting the modeled mass <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> to measurements, the simulation of soot light absorption was improved. Finally, the positive direct radiative forcing at top of the atmosphere was found to be lowered by up to 70 % for the model run with adjusted soot absorption behaviour,, indicating a decreased heating effect on the atmosphere...|$|R

High variability in light <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of phytoplankton was due to change of pigment concentration and chlorophyll a specific <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> A relationships between light <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> and chlorophyll a concentration have been found: for the blue maximum (a_ph(440) = 0. 0413 x** 0. 628; R** 2 = 0. 63) and for the red maximum (?_ph(678) = 0. 0190 x** 0. 843; R** 2 = 0. 83). Chlorophyll a specific <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> decreased while pigment concentration in the Sea increased. Observed variability in chlorophyll a specific <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> at chlorophyll a concentrations < 1. 0 mg/m** 3 had seasonal features and was related with seasonal change of intracellular pigment concentration. Ratio between the blue and red maxima decreased with increasing chlorophyll a concentration (? = 2. 14 x**- 0. 20; R** 2 = 0. 41). Variability of spectrally averaged <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of phytoplankton (a'_ph) on 95 % depended on <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> at the blue maximum (y = 0. 421 x; R** 2 = 0. 95). Relation of a_ph with chlorophyll a concentration was described by a power function (y = 0. 0173 x** 0. 0709; R** 2 = 0. 65). Change of spectra shape was generally effected by seasonal dynamics of intracellular pigment concentration, and partly effected by taxonomic and cell-size structure of phytoplankton...|$|R
