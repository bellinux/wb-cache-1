40|$|In {{the context}} of {{aircraft}} engineering and maintenance, No Fault Found (NFF) is {{a chain of events}} that develops from a pilot experiencing a system malfunction with postflight maintenance failing to reproduce the reported symptoms. Without any repair being undertaken, the malfunction may be experienced again on subsequent flights. This present significant cost impacts to the industry that includes financial, reduced operational achievement, airworthiness challenges and potential flight safety issues. One of the major causes identified for NFF occurrence within electronic, mechanical and hydraulic products are faults that are intermittent in nature. This makes it difficult to use systematic fault detection techniques effectively, as system are subject to unknown disturbances and model uncertainties. The philosophy behind this criterion is that the designed model-based Fault Detection (FD) observer should be robust to disturbances but sensitive to intermittent faults where the occupance of intermittent faults can be alarmed by the use of an adaptive threshold. The aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the development of such methodologies and to examine its performance in a real-world test bed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a specific scheduling approach {{for a typical}} service operations scheduling issue [...] allocating the given and limited service capacity to highly demanded service requirements under complex practical constraints. Specifically, it describes how to schedule <b>aircraft</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> component overhaul operations for the U. S.

To balance between {{the high cost of}} developing new weapons systems and the constant need to utilize the newest technology, the managers in charge of <b>aircraft</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> overhaul have for many years taken many practical, but complex factors in their scheduling consideration, such as ongoing upgrades, life extending improvements, maintainability design, and parts sustaining processes.

Coordination and prioritization of constraint factors that result from the different locations, missions, and operational characteristics will generalize the best possible decisions, and thus contribute to enhancement of performance, cost, safety, reliability, and sustainability goals of the U.
