5|$|Breeding convicts is {{as simple}} as having <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> a female in the same tank with {{adequate}} water quality and feeding. There is no special conditioning required. Due to their prolific breeding in captivity, there is a very low demand for Convict fry, and one may easily find their aquarium overstocked with an inbreeding population of Convicts without any avenues for adoption.|$|E

5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress {{as a man}} was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> there was speculation {{at the time that}} she was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.|$|E
50|$|The <b>male</b> leopon is <b>a</b> fertile {{offspring}} of <b>a</b> <b>male</b> leopard <b>and</b> <b>a</b> female lion. The fertile female liguar, {{offspring of}} <b>a</b> <b>male</b> lion <b>and</b> female jaguar, {{is capable of}} fertilization by a leopon. Their mating, though rare, results in a leoligular.|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand, {{the gender}} pay gap coexists with an ethnic one.

5|$|The {{constellation}} of Camelopardalis, {{introduced in the}} seventeenth century, depicts a giraffe. The Tswana people of Botswana traditionally see the constellation Crux as two giraffes – Acrux and Mimosa forming <b>a</b> <b>male,</b> <b>and</b> Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> multiple females.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{differentiation}} is {{the process}} of development of the differences between <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females from <b>an</b> undifferentiated zygote. <b>As</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female individuals develop from zygotes into fetuses, into infants, children, adolescents, and eventually into adults, sex and gender differences at many levels develop: genes, chromosomes, gonads, hormones, anatomy, and psyche.|$|R

5|$|Traditional dances {{revolve around}} stylized {{courtship}} between <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female dancer, {{known as the}} kavalyé and danm respectively. The bélé song-dances include the bélé soté, bélé priòrité, bélé djouba, bélé contredanse, bélé rickety and bélé pitjé.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} many Christians {{performed}} daring feats to rescue captives from Seringapatnam {{and take them}} to places of safety. A captive named Domingo Pinto (brother of Salvador Pinto, who rose to high rank in the services of Tipu), was particularly proficient in this. He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those anxious to regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money. He fixed the rescue price per captive at 8 hoons (Rs. 32) for <b>a</b> <b>male,</b> <b>and</b> 4 hoons (Rs. 16) for a female.|$|E

5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} {{of a high school}} named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides to replace them with <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> a female graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching children at the school.|$|E

Entering an unlocked storage area {{at the end of the}} cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> a female wildebeest.

Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E

Similarly, females also follow this linear herarchy. The <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female hierarchies are different and of a nonoverlapping or nonmixing types. Males are usually dominant over females.|$|R

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned {{to one or two}} breeding groups. When <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon will inherit the species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.|$|E

5|$|Bhairava's {{headgear}} has a ruff on the back, a {{skull and}} cobra over the forehead, and the crescent {{high on the}} right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs.

5|$|Breslin married Jami Rutili, and {{the couple}} had three children, Shane, Paige, and Chase. He {{earned a degree in}} {{recreation}} management while at Lake Superior State. During his career, Breslin was involved in numerous charities. He delivered food on Thanksgiving for the Chris Zorich Foundation; conducted self-esteem workshops for an anti-drug, anti-gang organization; participated in the Wolves' Read to Succeed program, in which he read to children at local libraries; and several others. In a 1997 interview, Breslin said that the most special charity he helped was one started by him and his wife. The Extra Effort program was started at Indian Trail Junior High School in Addison, where Jami was a teacher. Each month the program gave both <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> a female student four tickets to a Wolves game and a gift bag. The students were chosen based on attitude, effort and attendance. After retiring from professional hockey, he coached youth hockey and helped manage an Irish pub.|$|E
5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E
