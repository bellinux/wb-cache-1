2500|$|The film {{deals with}} the history of the {{electric}} car, its modern development, and commercialization. The film focuses primarily on the General Motors EV1, which was made available for lease mainly in Southern California, after the California Air Resources Board (CARB) passed the zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) [...] mandate in 1990 which required the seven major automobile suppliers in the United States to offer electric vehicles in order to continue sales of their gasoline powered vehicles in California. Nearly 5000 electric cars were designed and manufactured by Chrysler, the Ford Motor Company, General Motors (GM), Honda, Nissan, and Toyota; and then later destroyed or donated to museums and educational institutions. Also discussed <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> of the events depicted for air pollution, oil dependency, Middle East politics, and global warming.|$|E
2500|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, {{and was the}} first role cast. Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final {{appearance}} on Doctor Who. Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: [...] "We talked a lot about the role of a vicar in a community like that and what <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> of the circumstances that the town is put in," [...] said Darvill, [...] "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young." [...] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and trustworthy person. Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect. Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set. [...] "Early on I {{knew it was going to}} be good because Chris said...veryone has to be nice and good." ...|$|E

60|$|Besides having, in {{the present}} {{appearances}} of the Earth's crust, no data for fixing a commencement to these processes--besides finding that the evidence permits us to assume such commencement to have been inconceivably remote, as compared even with the vast eras of geology; we are not without positive grounds for inferring the inconceivable remoteness of such commencement. Modern geology has established truths which are irreconcilable {{with the belief that}} the formation and destruction of strata began when the Cambrian rocks were formed; or at anything like so recent a time. One fact from Siluria will suffice. Sir R. Murchison estimates the vertical thickness of Silurian strata in Wales, at from 26,000 to 27,000 feet, or about five miles; and if to this we add the vertical depth of the Cambrian strata, on which the Silurians lie conformably, there results, on the lowest computation, a total depth of some seven miles. Now it is held by geologists, that this vast series of formations must have been deposited in an area of gradual subsidence. These beds could not have been thus laid one on another in regular order, unless the Earth's crust had been at that place sinking, either continuously or by small steps. Such an immense subsidence, however, must have been impossible without a crust of great thickness. The Earth's molten nucleus tends ever, with enormous force, to assume the form of a regular oblate spheroid. Any depression of its crust below the surface of equilibrium, and any elevation of its crust above that surface, have to withstand immense resistances. It follows inevitably that, with a thin crust, nothing but small elevations and subsidences would have been possible; and that, conversely, a subsidence of seven miles implies a crust of great strength, or, in other words, of great thickness. Indeed, if we compare this inferred subsidence in the Silurian period, with such elevations and depressions as our existing continents and oceans display, we see no evidence that the Earth's crust was appreciably thinner then than now. What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications?</b> If, as geologists generally admit, the Earth's crust has resulted from that slow cooling which is even still going on--if we see no sign that at the time when the earliest Cambrian strata were formed, this crust was appreciably thinner than now; we are forced to conclude that the era during which it acquired that great thickness possessed in the Cambrian period, was enormous as compared with the interval between the Cambrian period and our own. But during the incalculable series of epochs thus implied, there existed an ocean, tides, winds, waves, rain, rivers. The agencies by which the denudation of continents and filling up of seas have all along been carried on, were as active then as now. Endless successions of strata must have been formed. And when we ask--Where are they? Nature's obvious reply is--They have been destroyed by that igneous action to which so great a part of our oldest-known strata owe their fusion or metamorphosis.|$|E

50|$|The {{interaction}} between erosion and tectonics {{has been a}} topic of debate since the early 1990s. While the tectonic effects on surface processes such as erosion have long been recognized (for example, river formation {{as a result of}} tectonic uplift), the opposite (erosional effects on tectonic activity) has only recently been addressed. The primary questions surrounding this topic are what types of interactions exist between erosion and tectonics and what <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> of these interactions. While this is still a matter of debate, one thing is clear, the Earth's landscape is a product of two factors: tectonics, which can create topography and maintain relief through surface and rock uplift, and climate, which mediates the erosional processes that wear away upland areas over time. The interaction of these processes can form, modify, or destroy geomorphic features on the Earth’s surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper <b>is</b> <b>the</b> design of {{practical}} laser experiments that can produce collisionless shocks mediated by the Weibel instability. Such shocks may be important {{in a wide range}} of astrophysical systems. Three issues <b>are</b> considered. <b>The</b> first issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> of <b>the</b> fact that such experiments will produce expanding flows that are approximately homologous. As a result, both the velocity and the density of the interpenetrating plasma streams will <b>be</b> time dependent. <b>The</b> second issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> of <b>the</b> linear theory of the Weibel instability. For the experiments, <b>the</b> instability <b>is</b> in a regime where standard simplifications do not apply. It appears feasible but non-trivial to obtain adequate growth. <b>The</b> third issue <b>is</b> collisionality. <b>The</b> need to keep resistive magnetic-field dissipation small enough implies that the plasmas should not be allowed to cool substantially. © 2012.
