60|$|Irene laughed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> to {{have her}} sister take his praises in that way rather than another.|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t want {{to attract}} so much; I think it’s vulgar.” She spoke <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> {{to use the}} word. She was evidently open to new sources of pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|... "We farm, we study, we bake, we brew, and are as merry as grigs all day long. It's school-time now, {{and we must}} go; {{will you}} come?" [...] said Sally, jumping up <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it.|$|E
60|$|Angela fidgeted, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't <b>like</b> {{the style}} of the conversation.|$|R
60|$|Berry looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> {{to trace}} the {{connexion}} of ideas between Paul Dombey and Mrs Wickam's Uncle's Betsey Jane.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is a dress,' said Darton. 'Not {{exactly a}} wedding-dress; though she may use it <b>as</b> one <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>likes.</b> It is rather {{serviceable}} than showy--suitable {{for the winter}} weather.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Wilkins smiled {{all over}} her plump face, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> to tell her experience, and having hunched sleepy little Andy more comfortably into her lap, and given a preparatory hem or two, she began with great good-will.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{hurt them}} a bit. I don't give in, mind you; for my {{experiments}} always fail {{a few times}} before they succeed. Love to Amy and my blessed Marmee," [...] called Mrs. Jo, as the carriage drove away; and the last Mr. Laurie saw of her, she was consoling Daisy for her failure by a ride in the wheelbarrow, and looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} {{thinking}} of these changes as she watered her flowers, dusted the furniture, and laid the fire ready for kindling; and, when all was done, she stood a minute to enjoy the pleasant room, full of spring sunshine, fresh air, and exquisite order. It seemed to give her heart for more distasteful labors, and she fell {{to work at the}} pies as cheerfully <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mean making pens, but {{the romance}} I advised," [...] and {{she touched the}} closely written page before him, looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> to read it.|$|R
6000|$|... "She looked terribly, terribly excited, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> to say {{something}} to me. That was the reason I said I would let her go to her room alone." ...|$|R
60|$|Albinia {{laughed a}} little hysterically, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had the <b>like</b> bullet.|$|R
60|$|Lister moved {{abruptly}} {{and his mouth}} got firm. Perhaps Ruth exaggerated her father's importance, but it was possible Duveen could get him promotion. All the same, Lister saw what his taking the job implied; he must give up his independence and be Duveen's man. Moreover, if the girl meant to help, she had some grounds for doing so. He thrilled and was tempted, but he thought hard. It looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> him and was perhaps willing to embark upon a sentimental adventure, but he thought this was all. She would not marry a poor man.|$|E
60|$|Albinia was on thorns, lest Sophy {{should be}} offended; but though her cheeks lighted up, {{and she was}} {{certainly}} aware of some part of their meaning, either she {{did not believe in}} the possibility of any one bantering her, or else the assumption was more agreeable than the presumption was disagreeable. She endured with droll puzzled dignity, when Fred teased her anxiety the next day to know whether Mr. O'More had felt any ill effects; and it really appeared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> him better for what might have been expected to be a dire affront; but then he was a man whose manner enabled to do and say whatever he pleased.|$|E
6000|$|As {{everyone}} exclaimed, and Beth {{hugged the}} cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, {{which did not}} deceive anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it, [...] "It doesn't affect {{the fate of the}} nation, so don't wail, Beth. It will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig. It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off. My head feels deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's have supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a dear, good woman! Shall {{you send}} him to prison, Admiral Merrifield? What {{can be done to}} him?' said Arthurine, not looking at all <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> to {{abrogate}} capital punishment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She is {{not fair}} enough for the angel, and too large {{to go up in}} the tree. But she sings sweetly, and looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> to see a tree,' said the young lady.|$|R
60|$|Miss Edith looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> to go, {{but she did}} not say so; and, as for me, I {{agreed to}} every proposition. It would {{certainly}} be great fun to do things with this lively household.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had {{you seen}} her this morning, Mary," [...] he continued, [...] "attending with such ineffable {{sweetness}} and patience {{to all the}} demands of her aunt's stupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman's service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness, so much {{as if it were}} a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is, and one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and then shook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to me, or listening, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> to listen, to what I said. Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing." ...|$|E
60|$|They did {{not look}} at the {{moonlight}} long. The young man perched on the rail of the veranda, and Irene took one of the red-painted rocking-chairs where she could conveniently look at him and at her sister, who sat leaning forward lazily and running on, as the phrase is. That low, crooning note of hers was delicious; her face, glimpsed now and then in the moonlight as she turned it or lifted it a little, had a fascination which kept his eye. Her talk was very unliterary, and its effect seemed hardly conscious. She was far from epigram in her funning. She told of this trifle and that; she sketched the characters and looks of people who had interested her, and nothing seemed to have escaped her notice; she mimicked a little, but not much; she suggested, and then the affair represented itself as if without her agency. She did not laugh; when Corey stopped she made a soft cluck in her throat, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> his being amused, and went on again.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the blessings}} {{reserved}} for her here, {{which most of}} all concerns us, was the occasional sight of her Brother. Brother {{in a day or}} two ["18th November," [...] she says; which date is wrong, if it were of moment (see OEuvres de Frederic, xxvii. part 1st, where their CORRESPONDENCE is).] ran over from Ruppin, on short leave, and had his first interview. Very kind and affectionate; quite the old Brother again; and [...] "blushed" [...] when, at supper, Mamma and the Princesses, especially that wicked Charlotte (Papa not present), tore up his poor Bride at such a rate. [...] "Has not a word to answer you, but YES or NO," [...] said they; [...] "stupid as a block." [...] "But were you ever at her toilette?" [...] said the wicked Charlotte: [...] "Out of shape, completely: considerable waddings, I promise you: and then"--still worse features, from that wicked Charlotte, in presence of the domestics here. Wicked Charlotte; who is to be her Sister-in-law soon;--and who is always flirting with my Husband, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> that better!--Crown-Prince retired, directly after supper: as did I, to my apartment, where in a minute or two he joined me.|$|E
60|$|David laughed, as his eye {{went from}} the flowers to Christie's face, and when she laid down the last breast-knot, looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> the chance of {{presenting}} it to some one she knew, he seemed much amused.|$|R
5000|$|A young {{new model}} {{and a young}} new {{designer}} whose clothes she showed have given Paris a sense of double discovery this spring. Twenty-two-year-old Marie-Hélène Arnaud is unlike the breed of Paris mannequins who are usually pale, abnormally thin and wear their clothes {{with an air of}} dead-pan hauteur. Marie-Hélène has an outdoor look, is slender but far from skinny (115 pounds, 5' 5 1/2" [...] tall, with 35 inch bust and hips), looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> the clothes <b>she</b> wears. [...] "People are getting tired of those spooks," [...] said a veteran fashion photographer. [...] "Marie-Hélène is soft, round and looks like a girl." ...|$|R
60|$|After Mac and Steve had {{had their}} turn, Archie and Company bore her away for some weeks; {{and with them}} she was so happy, <b>she</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>like</b> to stay for ever, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could have Uncle Alec also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is it? This is the {{simplest}} {{question of the}} four. It is in the heart. It fills the heart to overflowing, so {{that if there were}} one drop more the heart would run over. Love is thus plainly a liquid: which accounts to some extent for its well-recognized habit of surging. Among its effects this may be noted: that it makes you miserable if you be not by the loved one's side. To hold her hand is ecstasy, to press it, rapture. The fond lover--as it might be myself--sees his beloved depart on a railway journey with apprehension. He never ceases to remember that engines burst and trains run off the line. In an agony he awaits the telegram that tells him she has reached Shepherd's Bush in safety. When he sees her talking, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it, to another man, he is torn, he is rent asunder, he is dismembered by jealousy. He walks beneath her window till the policeman sees him home; and when he wakes in the morning, it is to murmur her name to himself until he falls asleep again and is late for the office. Well, do I experience such sensations, or do I not? Is this love, after all? Where are the spills? ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is to be}} feared {{there was}} no {{disguise}} of Ransom's satisfaction at finding himself once more {{face to face with}} the charming creature with whom he had exchanged that final speechless smile the evening before. He was more glad to see her than if she had been an old friend, for it seemed to him that she had suddenly become a new one. [...] "The delightful girl," [...] he said to himself; [...] "she smiles at me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> me!" [...] He could not know that this was fatuous, that she smiled so at every one; the first time she saw people she treated them as if she recognised them. Moreover, she did not seat herself again in his honour; she let it be seen that she was still going. The three stood there together in the middle of the long, characteristic room, and, for the first time in her life, Olive Chancellor chose not to introduce two persons who met under her roof. She hated Europe, but she could be European if it were necessary. Neither of her companions had an idea that in leaving them simply planted face to face (the terror of the American heart) she had so high a warrant; and presently Basil Ransom felt that he didn't care whether he were introduced or not, for the greatness of an evil didn't matter if the remedy were equally great.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I don't {{see very}} well how I {{can make you}} {{understand}} that. At any rate," [...] Miriam pursued with her grand eyes on Nick, [...] "I retract what I {{said the other day}} about Mr. Dormer. I've no wish to quarrel with him on the way he has determined to dispose of his life, because after all it does suit me very well. It rests me, this little devoted corner; oh it rests me! It's out of the row and the dust, it's deliciously still and they can't get at me. Ah when art's like this, à la bonne heure!" [...] And she looked round on such a presentment of [...] "art" [...] in a splendid way that produced amusement on the young man's part at its contrast with the humble fact. Miriam shone upon him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> to be the cause of his mirth and went on appealing to him: [...] "You'll always let me come here for an hour, won't you, to take breath--to let the whirlwind pass? You needn't trouble yourself about me; I don't mean to impose on you in the least the necessity of painting me, though if that's a manner of helping you to get on you may be sure it will always be open to you. Do what you like with me in that respect; only let me sit here on a high stool, keeping well out of your way, and see what you happen to be doing. I'll tell you my own adventures when you want to hear them." ...|$|E
60|$|Rosa {{looked at}} him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would have <b>liked</b> {{him to be the}} {{recipient}} of a thousand dedications.|$|R
60|$|The pungy slipped along <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{conscious}} that <b>she,</b> <b>like</b> ourselves, had escaped from great dangers, and was longing for another cargo of oysters in her hold.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A Woman, am I! I'll {{teach you}} if I am a Woman!' {{and lifted her}} hand <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would have <b>liked</b> to strike her companion. This stung the maiden into {{absolute}} defiance.|$|R
6000|$|When they quitted {{the table}} the Colonel went away without coming upstairs; but Lyon {{returned}} to the drawing-room with his hostess, remarking to her however on {{the way that he}} could remain but a moment. He spent that moment--it prolonged itself a little--standing with her before the chimney-piece. She neither sat down nor asked him to; her manner denoted that she intended to go out. Yes, her husband had trained her well; yet Lyon dreamed for a moment that now he was alone with her she would perhaps break down, retract, apologise, confide, say to him, 'My dear old friend, forgive this hideous comedy--you understand!' And then how he would have loved her and pitied her, guarded her, helped her always! If she were not ready to do something of that sort why had she treated {{him as if he were}} a dear old friend; why had she let him for months suppose certain things--or almost; why had she come to his studio day after day to sit near him on the pretext of her child's portrait, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> to think what might have been? Why had she come so near a tacit confession, in a word, if she was not willing to go an inch further? And she was not willing--she was not; he could see that as he lingered there. She moved about the room a little, rearranging two or three objects on the tables, but she did nothing more. Suddenly he said to her: 'Which way was she going, when you came out?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You make it hard," [...] said Acton, getting up, [...] "for {{a man to}} say {{something}} tender to you." [...] This evening there was something particularly striking and touching about her; an unwonted softness and a look of suppressed emotion. He felt himself suddenly appreciating {{the fact that she}} had behaved very well. She had come to this quiet corner of the world under the weight of a cruel indignity, and she had been so gracefully, modestly thankful for the rest she found there. She had joined that simple circle over the way; she had mingled in its plain, provincial talk; she had shared its meagre and savorless pleasures. She had set herself a task, and she had rigidly performed it. She had conformed to the angular conditions of New England life, and she had had the tact and pluck to carry it off <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> them. Acton felt a more downright need than he had ever felt before to tell her that he admired her and that she struck him as a very superior woman. All along, hitherto, he had been on his guard with her; he had been cautious, observant, suspicious. But now a certain light tumult in his blood seemed to tell him that a finer degree of confidence in this charming woman would be its own reward. [...] "We don't detest you," [...] he went on. [...] "I don't know what you mean. At any rate, I speak for myself; I don't know anything about the others. Very likely, you detest them for the dull life they make you lead. Really, it would give me a sort of pleasure to hear you say so." ...|$|E
60|$|Dolores's {{mind was}} set at rest as to Flinders's evasion before night, and on the Sunday morning even Nurse Halfpenny could find out nothing the matter with her, so that she was obliged to make her {{appearance}} as usual. Uncle Reginald did not kiss her, he only gave a cold nod, and said 'Good morning.' Otherwise all went on as usual, and it was pleasant to find that Fly was as entirely used as they were to learning Collect and hymn, and copying out texts illustrating Catechism, {{and that she was}} expected to have them ready to repeat them to her mother some time in the afternoon. There was something, too, that Mysie could not have described, but which she liked, in the manner in which, on this morning, Dolores accepted small acts of good nature, such as finding a book for her, getting a new pen and helping her to the whereabouts of a Scriptural reference. It seemed for the first time <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> to receive a kindness, and her 'thank you' really had a sound of thanks, instead of being much more like 'I wish you would not.' Mysie felt really encouraged to be kind, and when, on setting forth to church, everybody was crowding round trying to walk with Fly, and Dolores was going along lonely and deserted, Mysie resigned her chance of one side of the favourite Phyllis, and dropped back to give her company to the solitary one. To her surprise and gratification, Dolores took hold of her hand, and listened quite willingly to her chatter about the schemes for the fortnight that Fly was to be left with them. Presently Constance was seen going markedly by the other gate of the churchyard, quite out of her usual way, and not even looking towards them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Bessie, {{her eyes}} cast down, {{as they always}} were when {{anything}} of this kind was said to her, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did not <b>like</b> to meet the look fixed on her.|$|R
60|$|If I {{ever before}} had {{occasion}} to glory in Sally I had it then. She betrayed not the slightest fear. <b>She</b> looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could fight <b>like</b> a little tigress. She was white, composed, defiant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where in thunder is she?" [...] growled Tom, {{walking off}} in high dudgeon. The quick tap of feet behind him made him turn {{in time to}} see a fresh-faced little girl running down the long station, and looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> rather <b>liked</b> it. As <b>she</b> smiled, and waved her bag at him, he stopped and waited for her, saying to himself, [...] "Hullo! I wonder if that 's Polly?" ...|$|R
