5|$|Sky Captain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tomorrow {{had high}} box office expectations, opening {{in first place}} on its September 17, 2004 release date and {{grossing}} USD $15.5 million on its opening weekend. However, the film only grossed $37.7 million in North America, below its estimated $70 million budget. It managed to gross $20.1 million {{in the rest of}} the world, making its final worldwide tally $57.9 million. The film is considered a box office flop.|$|E
5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{takes place}} on several worlds {{centered}} around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, {{but some of them}} are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Continent's older races.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Aristotle.|$|E

5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs {{through the crowd and}} sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E
