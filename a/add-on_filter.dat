Self-cleaning filter systems for gas turbines are designed for continuously efficient flow filtration. A good filter {{would be able to}} maintain its effectiveness over a longer time period, prolonging the duration between filter replacements and providing lower pressure drop over its operating lifetime. With this goal in mind, the current study is focused on the difference in pressure loss of the benchmark Salutary Avenue Self-cleaning filter in comparison to a new design with an <b>add-on</b> <b>filter</b> cap. Geometry for the <b>add-on</b> <b>filter</b> cap will be based from Salutary Avenue Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. SOLIDWORKS software was used to model the geometry of the filter, while simulation analysis on the flow through the filter was done using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software. The simulations are based on a low velocity condition, in which the parameter for the inlet velocity are set at 0. 032 m/s, 0. 063 m/s, 0. 094 m/s and 0. 126 m/s respectively. From the simulation data obtained for the inlet velocities considered, the pressure drop reduction of the modified filter compared to the benchmark was found to be between 7. 59 % and 30. 18 %. All in all, the modification of the filter cap produced a lower pressure drop in comparison with the benchmark filter; an improvement of 27. 02 % for the total pressure drop was obtained...|$|E

40|$|Though popularly {{used for}} safe web browsing, blacklist-based filters have funda-mental {{limitation}} in the “window of vulnerability”, {{the time between}} malicious website launch and blacklist update. An effective way of seamless protection is to use an <b>add-on</b> <b>filter</b> based on heuristics, but most of prior heuristics have offered the limited scope of protection against new attacks. Moreover, they have either suffered from low detection accuracy or incurred unacceptable slowdown. This paper presents an interactive website filter based on heuristics for detecting malicious websites. As the key feature, our filter considers the disparity between a website’s true identity (e. g., host domain) and its ob-served identity (e. g., frequent terms or source domains of iFrames). A website with sig-nificant disparity is considered as malicious. Users are warned against a website identi-fied as malicious, and determine if {{it is safe to}} proceed. Incorporating user-interaction into discovering the true identity of the suspect websites lets our filter avoid false posi-tives caused by automatic detection. Our main contribution is that we found a common and efficient characteristic to filter malicious websites. Not only is such disparity inher-ent in exploit mechanisms of malicious websites whether to aim for phishing or malware distribution, but its measuring by textual relevance incurs negligible overhead. Experi-mental results demonstrate that our filter is lightweight while delivering considerably high detection accuracy for both malicious websites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} {{applying}} advanced social information retrieval techniques for personalizing web-based information discovery {{has been identified}} as a key challenge. Until now, significant R&D effort has been devoted aiming towards applying collaborative filtering techniques for educational content retrieval. However, limited attention has been given to the use of educational metadata as a mean to enhance social filtering techniques via educationally informed filtering decisions. In this paper we propose the use of an <b>add-on</b> <b>filtering</b> service on existing social filtering systems/applications so as to create a data post-filtering mechanism that makes use of intelligence stored in TEL metadata. The proposed methodology starts with the generation of a matrix that represents the educational characteristics of the resources suggested by typical social filtering techniques and applies post-filtering using the educational “footprint ” of the resources already used by the targeted end-user...|$|R

This paper presents a novel linear time-varying (LTV) group filtering scheme for the compensation of a few mid- RRO harmonics. While having a short filter transient that ensures fast disturbance attenuation, the proposed filter does not constitute to any substantial unnecessary sensitivity function gain amplification at the steady state. Simulation and implementation results show the effectiveness of this group filtering scheme.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficient}} allocation of buyers {{in the presence}} of recommender systems. A recommender system affects the market in two ways: (i) it creates value by reducing product uncertainty for the customers and hence (ii) its recommendations can be offered as add-ons, which generates informational externalities. We investigate the impact of these factors on the efficient allocation of buyers across different products. We find that the efficient allocation requires that the seller with the recommender system has full market share. If the recommender system is sufficiently effective in reducing uncertainty, it is optimal to have some products to be purchased by a larger group of people than others. The large group consists of customers with flexible tastes. Recommender system, Collaborative <b>filtering,</b> <b>Add-ons,</b> Pricing, Information externality...|$|R
40|$|Phishing {{is one of}} the {{prevalent}} techniques used by attackers to breach security and steal private and confidential information. It has compromised millions of users’ data. Blacklisting websites and heuristic-based methods are common approaches to detect a phishing website. The blacklist method suffers from a window of vulnerability. Many heuristics were proposed in the past. Some of them have better accuracy but a lower performance. A phishing filter should have better accuracy and peformance. It should be able to detect fresh phishing websites. Jo et al. [2] present a list of attributes of the web page to find the disparity between an original website and a spoofed website. The main aim of this project is to integrate the approach presented by Jo et al. [2] into web browser via Firefox <b>add-on.</b> Our phishing <b>filter</b> collects the list of attributes and compares it with the help of approximate string matching algorithms and WHOIS [14] server queries.
