25|$|Tax rules {{recognize}} that {{some types of}} businesses do not earn income in the traditional manner and thus require special provisions. For example, insurance companies must ultimately pay claims to some policy holders from the amounts received as premiums. These claims may happen years after the premium payment. Computing the future amount of claims requires actuarial estimates until claims are actually paid. Thus, recognizing premium income <b>as</b> <b>received</b> and claims expenses as paid would seriously distort an insurance company's income.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow {{correlator}} spacing, {{have been developed}} to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power <b>as</b> <b>received</b> by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|E
25|$|The {{cookbook}} {{method of}} teaching introductory statistics leaves {{no time for}} history, philosophy or controversy. Hypothesis testing has been taught <b>as</b> <b>received</b> unified method. Surveys showed that graduates of the class were filled with philosophical misconceptions (on all aspects of statistical inference) that persisted among instructors. While the problem was addressed {{more than a decade}} ago, and calls for educational reform continue, students still graduate from statistics classes holding fundamental misconceptions about hypothesis testing. Ideas for improving the teaching of hypothesis testing include encouraging students to search for statistical errors in published papers, teaching the history of statistics and emphasizing the controversy in a generally dry subject.|$|E

25|$|The late 17th-century {{discoveries of}} gold and diamond {{deposits}} in Brazil {{were the most important}} such finds ever made in the colonial New World. Between 1700 and 1800 a thousand metric tonnes of gold were recorded <b>as</b> <b>received</b> by the Portuguese treasury, and another thousand tonnes may have evaded the royal fifth. Around 2.4 million carats of diamonds were extracted from the alluvial sources in Minas Gerais, while an unknown amount was smuggled out. These riches had a great economic impact there and in the mother country, encouraging large numbers of Portuguese to emigrate to the colony and giving it a more European character. Many of the settlers found their way to the gold-bearing region in the Atlantic Forest {Mata Atlântica}, where they could become prosperous enough to buy African slaves.|$|E
25|$|Some 250 known manuscripts of Plato survive. The {{texts of}} Plato <b>as</b> <b>received</b> today {{apparently}} represent the complete written philosophical work of Plato and are generally good {{by the standards}} of textual criticism. No modern edition of Plato in the original Greek represents a single source, but rather it is reconstructed from multiple sources which are compared with each other. These sources are medieval manuscripts written on vellum (mainly from 9th-13th century AD Byzantium), papyri (mainly from late antiquity in Egypt), and from the independent testimonia of other authors who quote various segments of the works (which come from a variety of sources). The text as presented is usually not much different from what appears in the Byzantine manuscripts, and papyri and testimonia just confirm the manuscript tradition. In some editions however the readings in the papyri or testimonia are favoured in some places by the editing critic of the text. Reviewing editions of papyri for the Republic in 1987, Slings suggests that the use of papyri is hampered due to some poor editing practices.|$|E

2500|$|The signal {{strength}} received on Earth from Huygens was {{comparable to that}} from the Galileo probe (the Jupiter atmospheric descent probe) <b>as</b> <b>received</b> by the VLA, and was therefore too weak to detect in real time because of the signal modulation by the (then) unknown telemetry. Instead, wide-band recordings of the probe signal were made throughout the three-hour descent. After the probe telemetry was finished being relayed from Cassini to Earth, the now-known data modulation was stripped off the recorded signal, leaving a pure carrier that could be integrated over several seconds to determine the probe frequency. It was expected that through analysis of the Doppler shifting of Huygens signal as it descended through the atmosphere of Titan, wind speed and direction could be determined {{with some degree of}} accuracy. A position of Huygens' landing site on Titan was found with precision (within one km – one km on Titan measures 1.3' latitude and longitude at the equator) using the Doppler data at a distance from Earth of about 1.2 billion kilometers.

2500|$|The apostleship {{does not}} hinge upon Jesus' calling of the disciples while alive, but upon Christ's {{appearances}} to the disciples, among whom James and Peter were chosen first of all, a significance the early Church did not miss. [...] "Paul sees the diakonis (Acts 20:24) and the apostole to world mission (Rom.1:5/Gal1:1) <b>as</b> <b>received</b> {{directly from the}} Christ who has risen and appeared to him. Accordingly he knows himself to be an ambassador, a leitourgos, a doulos of the Lord (Rom15:16/Gal1:10, p.90). The Ascension itself is the last, specially significant appearance of [...] "the Risen One", and not a parallel miracle to the Resurrection. Even the empty tomb is subordinated to the Resurrection: that the tomb was empty {{was part of the}} Gospel, entailed by the appearance corporeal of the glorified body of the Risen One. The inverse of this would not have been necessarily true, and so the empty tomb is implied, but not emphasized: an empty tomb alone could have indicated many various things. Emil Brunner's note that Paul does not mention the empty tomb does not entail a conflict between Paul's Gospel and the original apostles (p.92). Again, Künneth defends the extreme middle : the Church becomes increasingly focused on an empty tomb (as the original witnesses die off), yes, but [...] "the decisive question remains open, how far an essential concern of the primitive Christian Church is expressed precisely in this tendency". Therefore, [...] "according to the church tradition about the resurrection event handed down by Paul in I Cor 15:1ff, a difference between the experience of Paul and of the original apostles seems impossible".|$|E
