40|$|This Master's Thesis {{is focused}} on {{evolution}} of photography with focus on photojournalism <b>and</b> documentary <b>photography</b> <b>and</b> aims to prove that this genre, though it may seem that it's currently on the decline, is still important.

5|$|Rossier {{first arrived}} in Japan in 1859, {{at a time when}} early {{experiments}} in photography were being conducted in Kyūshū, particularly in Nagasaki. The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J.L.C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry <b>and</b> <b>photography.</b> Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.|$|E
