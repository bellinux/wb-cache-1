25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Moore has {{expressed}} dismay that [...] "he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, {{as exemplified by}} Watchmen [...] became a genre". He said in 2003 that [...] "to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since Watchmen, an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't {{have a lot to}} recommend them".

[...] Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was a good person [...] "deep down" [...] and actually [...] "vulnerable and lovable". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings was [...] "the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum." [...] Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saved him from misery.|$|R

[...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom.

Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all.

When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations. USMC commander Lieutenant General Earl B.

500|$|During Blackadder Rides Again, Tony Robinson {{likewise}} {{recalls that}} these script meetings could be uncomfortable, {{and has been}} less reserved speaking about the script rehearsals since. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph he suggests that although relations between the actors were generally cordial [...] "There was bad feeling between the writers and the performers—the writers felt we were unilaterally altering the script and altering it for the worse. At {{end of the first}} day of rehearsals the writers would go away {{and by the time they}} came back we would have changed an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it. By the end, they felt we had run away with it. There were quite a lot of emotions flashing around about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pollack and Rosenberg {{sent the}} script to Alan J. Pakula, {{who felt that}} it needed {{improvement}} and spent a year rewriting it with Pierson. Regarding the screenwriting process, Turow said, [...] "There were three large narrative problems to solve. Point of view; getting around the first person narrative; time sequence; it's all flashback and Hollywood doesn't like that; and then just an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> plot." [...] Pierson originally envisioned the film adaptation as being [...] "a movie full of sex and blood". Pakula felt {{that the concept of}} justice was more central to the story. He also wanted to present the film in a visual style that echoed the novel's narrative. In making various changes from the novel, Pakula and Pierson added new dialogue and rewrote the ending. Pakula signed on to direct the film in January 1989.|$|E
500|$|Leave Home was {{released}} on January 10, 1977 and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a favorable review in 1977, {{saying that it is}} very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: [...] "The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They've also lost just a pinch of their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout is a matter for debate. The Ramones make rousing music and damn good jokes, but they're in a bind: the hard rock of this group is so pure it may be perceived as a freak novelty by an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people." [...] In the 1979 book The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was given 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{receiving}} the trophy, Adams was called over by pitchside reporter Jim Rosenthal for a conversation on the field, explaining his absence from the celebratory team photograph for the press. The Arsenal captain spoke of how his team-mates were [...] "really fired up" [...] before the game and was delighted with the effort they put in {{during the course of}} the match. Graham was proud of his team's performance, and credited Adams, who [...] "suffered an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stick which has given football very little dignity." [...] When asked about the result he said, [...] "Nobody outside Highbury expected us to do it, but when you lose belief you might as well get out of football." [...] Dalglish paid tribute to his players and refused to blame the fixture rearrangements for losing out to Arsenal, lamenting [...] "It just wasn't to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Betrayal is the {{secondary}} theme of The Wild Bunch. [...] The characters suffer from {{their knowledge of}} having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ("$10,000 cuts an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> family ties"). However, Bishop says, [...] "When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal." [...] Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton (in flashback) when the law catches {{up to them and}} when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery (ostensibly to guard the hostages). Critic David Weddle writes that [...] "like that of Conrad's Lord Jim, Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{said she}} loved the chemistry between Michael and Dwight, and enjoyed the direction the Michael Scott Paper Company plot was going. She also liked the bond that was forming between Jim and Andy, and said Ed Helms was particularly good in [...] "Heavy Competition". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode [...] "just an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun", and wrote having Michael and Dwight at odds with each other [...] "forced both characters to be just human enough for the story and the jokes to breathe". Sepinwall did not enjoy the Jim and Andy subplot, except for the final moment when Jim comforted Andy. Will Leitch of New York magazine said, [...] "This {{might have been the}} funniest Rainn Wilson has been in an episode all season, and that's saying something." [...] Leitch also said B. J. Novak was particularly funny, and said he enjoyed being reminded that Michael is an excellent salesman.|$|E

In terms of his character Jackman views Wolverine as [...] "the ultimate outsider" [...] and that [...] "the great battle, I always thought with Wolverine, is the battle within himself". Regarding Logan's struggle with extreme life longevity, Jackman said, [...] "He realizes everyone he loves dies, and his whole life is full of pain. So it's better that he just escapes. He can't die really. He just wants {{to get away from}} everything." [...] Jackman stated that he ate six meals a day in preparation for the role. Jackman contacted Dwayne Johnson for some tips on bulking up for the film. Johnson suggested that for six months, he gain a pound a week, by eating 6,000 calories a day which consisted of [...] "an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> chicken, steak and brown rice".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{most common}} {{criticism}} is the {{heavy emphasis on}} sailing, especially later in the game when Link must trek around the ocean to collect Triforce pieces. GameSpot wrote that while the main quest [...] "starts out in a very brisk manner", by {{the last third of}} the game, the [...] "focus on sailing ... is pretty tedious". Edge wrote that the sailing was [...] "convincingly organic", but even with the warp feature, [...] "there remains an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> relatively dull seafaring activity". Others complained about having to use the Wind Waker so frequently to change wind direction. IGN wrote that using the device became [...] "a tedious nuisance", and that the inability to skip the accompanying animation was [...] "more bothersome still". Some reviewers enjoyed the sailing; two Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers appreciated the combat, exploration, and side quests available at sea. Another common criticism was the game's comparatively low level of difficulty. IGN wrote that once the player added enough hearts to Link's health meter, [...] "he becomes nearly invincible, which is a true shortcoming as far as we concerned".|$|E

Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting {{the importance of the}} funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland.
