One person sustained serious injuries, and five others received minor injuries; the plane was damaged during the event.

5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets and bitterns. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. Nine species have been recorded in Tasmania, one of which (the cattle egret) is a recent self-introduction <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> are vagrants.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Goni {{affected}} the Marianas Islands {{about two weeks}} after Typhoon Soudelor damaged houses in the same island chain and caused an island-wide power outage on Saipan. Damaged structures were not repaired in the interim, making airborne debris a concern. Goni's approach halted aid distribution for victims of the previous typhoon. A total of 680people in the Marianas Islands sought shelter during the storm. One flight was cancelled, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> were diverted.|$|E

5|$|In November 1939, No. 43 Squadron {{moved to}} RAF Acklington, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, flying Hawker HurricaneMkIs. Amid severe weather conditions, Hull scored the {{squadron}}'s first {{victory of the}} war on 30 January 1940, when he shot down a Heinkel He111 bomber of the Luftwaffe near the island of Coquet. On 26 February the squadron was transferred to RAF Wick in northern Scotland to help protect the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow. Hull, Carey <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> together downed another He111 on 28 March 1940. On 10 April 1940, Hull took part in the destruction of a reconnaissance He111.

5|$|The unity {{government}} suffered a partial collapse in 1995. The continuing violence, along with appointing {{of local government}} officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi, caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu government members, including prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu and interior minister Seth Sendashonga. Twagiramungu resigned in August, and Kagame fired Sendashonga <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> the next day. Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but {{the makeup of the}} new government was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame. Twagiramungu and Sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving the government.|$|E
5|$|While Damageplan was {{promoting}} the album {{at a concert}} on December 8, 2004, at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, a man named Nathan Gale climbed on stage and killed lead guitarist Darrell <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others,</b> and wounding another seven, before being shot dead by a police officer. Although no motive was found, some witnesses claimed Gale blamed the brothers for Pantera's breakup and believed that they had stolen his lyrics. The band's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has been inactive since the incident. Abbott and Zilla have joined the band Hellyeah, and Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic.|$|E
5|$|Wukong {{produced}} torrential rains over Japan, peaking at 516mm (20.3in) in Hinokage, Miyazaki Prefecture. Flooding in Kyūshū and the Yamaguchi Prefecture {{caused the}} evacuation of about 300 households. At least 200 residences were left without power in Kyūshū. Two people were killed by rough seas produced by Wukong, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> were injured in storm-related accidents. A total of seven landslides occurred, one of which damaged several homes. As the storm brushed the Korean Peninsula, it produced heavy rains, but caused no known damage.|$|E

5|$|Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought {{widespread}} flooding, {{which resulted}} in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100million (1987USD). In the Maguindanao and Albay provinces alone, 10,000people were evacuated and 1,000were homeless. However, {{the capital city of}} Manila avoided any serious damage. Nationwide, around 200,000people were reportedly homeless, 18,000of winch were from Marinduque and another 11,400resided on Mindoro Island. In the former, 4,000dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518homes received damage. Roughly 400,000people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85people were killed and 324others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000structures were damaged and 103people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> were hurt by the typhoon. Several villages were flooded, and numerous streets were damaged.|$|E
5|$|By war's end, Black Hawk and {{nineteen}} {{other leaders}} of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> were transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners. The American public was eager {{to catch a glimpse}} of the captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in Louisville and Cincinnati to watch them pass. On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in Washington, D.C., before being taken to Fort Monroe. Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as Charles Bird King and John Wesley Jarvis, and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he {{described}} as a developed colony with an existing community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had {{put in charge of}} the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>others</b> for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.|$|E
