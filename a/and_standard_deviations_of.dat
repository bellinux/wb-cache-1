40|$|Objects {{in orbit}} {{are exposed to}} extreme temperatures. These can lead to {{deformations}} which complicate the design of dimensionally critical space structures. Composites offer the major advantage of tailorable properties. Theoretically, dimensionally stable composite laminates {{can be made with}} coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE's) of zero. In practice, the laminate properties deviate from predicted properties due to variations in material properties and manufacturing parameters. The goal of the present investigation is to develop an analytical methodology to predict means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> laminate engineering properties from given means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> ply material properties, fiber volume fractions, and manufacturing parameters. This objective is successfully met through a combination of analytical modeling and experimental investigation. In the analysis, the means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> the laminate properties are found using Classical Laminated Plate Theory (CLPT) and simple statistical methods. A new laminate property, the thermal bending coefficient, is defined. The thermal bending coefficient is the out-of-plane analog to the in-plane CTE. Many unsymmetric laminates exhibit large-deformation effects which depart from CLPT predictions...|$|E
