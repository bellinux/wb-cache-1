5|$|In 1935, Johnson was one {{of three}} contenders for the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor. In the primary, he received more votes than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F.

50|$|The {{elections}} were close, and some Aspen observers argued that <b>a</b> traditional <b>runoff</b> system {{would have given}} more time to consider their top choices. There also was debate over how to implement audit procedures.

5|$|On December 3, 1855, the {{legislature}} convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation {{to move the}} capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, {{the legislature}} re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask {{the people of the}} territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have <b>a</b> <b>runoff.</b> The initial vote set up <b>a</b> <b>runoff</b> between Eugene and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low public participation, the election was ignored, and the capital remained in Salem.|$|E
5|$|The county prefects, {{city and}} {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units.

5|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} 27 April. Menem won the first round with 24.5 percent of the vote, followed by Kirchner with 22.2 percent. The conservative Ricardo López Murphy finished third, substantially behind the two main candidates. Since Menem was well short of the threshold required to win, <b>a</b> <b>runoff</b> election was scheduled for 18 May. He had a negative public image, and polls showed Kirchner receiving 60 to 70 percent of the vote. To avoid a humiliating defeat, Menem {{pulled out of the}} runoff in a move criticized by the other candidates. The judiciary declined requests for a new election and refused to sanction <b>a</b> <b>runoff</b> election between Kirchner and López Murphy, although López Murphy said he would not participate. The election was validated by the Congress, and Kirchner became president on 25 May 2003. Kirchner's 22.2 percent is the lowest vote percentage ever recorded for an Argentine president in a free election.|$|E

40|$|The {{topographic}} {{characteristics of}} a basin have great influence on <b>runoff</b> processes. If <b>a</b> lumped <b>runoff</b> model {{that takes into account}} the topographic {{characteristics of a}} basin can simulate runoff processes as exactly as and faster than <b>a</b> distributed <b>runoff</b> model, the former will be very useful. This paper describes a method to lump and scale up <b>a</b> distributed <b>runoff</b> model taking into account the topographic characteristics and shows the results of its application. In our method, we investigate distributed nature of topographic characteristics in a basin using the Basin Geomorphic Information System (BGIS), and lump slope systems using the cluster analysis technique. We also make a lumped stream network model on the assumption that stream discharge varies linearly along each stream segment at individual moment...|$|R

5|$|In 1991 Preckwinkle {{and four}} others {{challenged}} Evans for the 4th ward alderman's position. In {{the first round}} of voting on February 26, 1991, she won nearly one-third popular vote in the ward by winning 20 of 58 precincts (all in the Hyde Park-Kenwood community). Evans and Preckwinkle again advanced to <b>a</b> <b>runoff</b> election, as they had in 1983, but this time the majority of the eliminated candidates endorsed Preckwinkle. On April 2, 1991, Preckwinkle performed better {{in the northern part of}} the ward and was elected by a 109-vote margin, defeating the 17-year incumbent alderman Evans.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Shiller {{supported}} Danny K. Davis in Davis' unsuccessful primary {{challenge to}} Daley. Daley endorsed Shiller's challenger, Michael Quigley, campaigned with Quigley and sent letters {{in support of}} Quigley. Shiller finished seven votes ahead of Quigley, but a third candidate got 3.4% of the vote, which forced <b>a</b> <b>runoff,</b> the third straight run-off for Shiller and the fourth straight for the 46th ward. In the run-off, Shiller won with 53% of the vote, amid charges that Quigley was a carpetbagger.|$|E

A majority vote is required to win. <b>A</b> <b>runoff</b> election round is held in cases where no candidate secures the majority {{in the first round of}} voting.

5|$|The {{mayor is}} elected in citywide {{election}}. Elections follow a two-round system. The {{first round of}} the election is called the primary election. The top-two candidates from the primary election advance to <b>a</b> <b>runoff</b> election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, <b>a</b> <b>runoff</b> election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of campaign finance reform passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E
5|$|During the 1988 {{legislative}} session, Governor Wilkinson {{proposed an}} amendment to the Kentucky Constitution that would allow state officials, including the sitting incumbents, to succeed themselves in office once. As presiding officer in the Senate, Jones insisted that any such measure also include <b>a</b> <b>runoff</b> provision if a candidate did not receive a majority of votes in the party primary. Wilkinson opposed this provision, and the measure died in the state senate. Wilkinson's proposed education program also failed in the session, and Jones suggested that the governor should build a consensus among legislators before including the program on the agenda of a special legislative session, which Wilkinson had proposed for January 1989. After the 1988 session, Wilkinson called Jones a backstabber and accused him of sabotaging the succession amendment. The two did not meet for six months following the session.|$|E
