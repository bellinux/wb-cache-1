5|$|Nagumo {{was now in}} <b>a</b> <b>quandary.</b> Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (Hiryū and Sōryū), {{recommended}} that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū, and half the ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or {{it would have to}} ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to position ("spot") their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.|$|E

The mixed Nash equilibrium is also Pareto dominated by the two pure Nash equilibria (since the players will fail to coordinate with non-zero probability), <b>a</b> <b>quandary</b> that led Robert Aumann to propose the refinement of a correlated equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|In 1850 the Royal Commission {{appointed}} to organise the Great Exhibition were in <b>a</b> <b>quandary.</b> An international competition {{to design a}} building to house the Exhibition had produced 245 designs, of which only two were remotely suitable, and all would take too long to build and would be too permanent.

25|$|In a major {{embarrassment for}} China, the 17th Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, who was proclaimed by China, made a {{dramatic}} escape from Tibet to the Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in <b>a</b> <b>quandary</b> {{on this issue}} as any protest to India on the issue would mean an explicit endorsement on India's governance of Sikkim, which the Chinese still hadn't recognised. In 2003, China officially recognised Indian sovereignty over Sikkim as the two countries moved towards resolving their border disputes.|$|E
25|$|Following the June 1967 Six-Day War, Hebron {{came under}} Israeli control. The vacillations in the Israeli cabinet after the war, over {{annexation}} {{and the political}} realism in wanting to maintain the majority Jewish demographic of Israel left the Israeli leadership in <b>a</b> <b>quandary</b> in {{ways to deal with}} the newly occupied territories. Israel's position was that parts of the West Bank be traded for peace with Jordan. Under the Allon Plan, Israel was to annex 45% of the West Bank and Jordan the remainder.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the events}} that {{facilitated}} cooperating with Congress was the Bangladesh Liberation War. In 1971 Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) declared its independence from Pakistan. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising; but Indian military intervention thwarted such moves. There was confusion within the ranks of the Indian communists—while the pro-Soviet CPI had no problem in supporting the war, and the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, the CPI(M) found itself in quandary participated in the resistance struggle, the pro-China communist groups were in <b>a</b> <b>quandary,</b> because China had sided with Pakistan in the war.|$|E
25|$|While in Dublin {{studying}} for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions {{not to become}} involved in any militia activity. When Wolfe Tone's French invasion fleet entered Bantry Bay in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in <b>a</b> <b>quandary.</b> Politics was the cause of his unsettlement. Dennis Gwynn in his Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people—of which he was one. He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.|$|E
25|$|Bigelow was in <b>a</b> <b>quandary.</b> His {{troops and}} others were {{receiving}} fire from the San Juan Heights that was fortified by the Spanish defenders. Other units went into position {{on the left and}} the right. But still no orders to advance came. Bigelow's second in command, First Lieutenant Jules Garesche Ord, son of , was sent to Brigadier General Hamilton S. Hawkins asking permission to attack. Hawkins refused to give permission but did not deny it either. En route back to the company, Ord passed by the different units including Roosevelt's Rough Riders and asked them to support the regulars when they went up the hill.|$|E

25|$|The Pope had {{appointed}} Carlo Maderno in 1602. He was {{a nephew}} of Domenico Fontana and had demonstrated {{himself as a}} dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, {{even though he had}} been dead for forty years. The Fabbrica or building committee, a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the Curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in <b>a</b> <b>quandary</b> as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the Counter-Reformation which increasingly associated a Greek Cross plan with paganism and saw the Latin Cross as truly symbolic of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The activist Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang {{continued}} to criticise Khánh and {{accused him of}} jailing Buddhists. Khánh was in <b>a</b> <b>quandary,</b> as he could be perceived as being too soft on Diệm supporters, or being vindictive towards Roman Catholics. To placate Trí Quang, Khánh agreed to remove all Roman Catholic chaplains from the military. Khánh sentenced Major Đặng Sỹ, the Roman Catholic officer who had overseen the Huế Vesak shootings of Buddhist protesting Diệm's ban on the Buddhist flag on 8 May 1963 to a life sentence of hard labour, and sentenced Diệm's younger brother, Ngô Đình Cẩn, the de facto warlord of central Vietnam, to death. This occurred over the private objections of U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who {{thought that it was}} best for Khánh to take a mild line to dampen religious tensions. Cẩn was executed by firing squad on 9 May. Thích Trí Quang remained critical of what he saw as a lack of vigour on the part of Khánh in removing Diệmists from positions of authority.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{the seventeenth}} Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, {{who had been}} {{confirmed}} by the Dalai Lama and accepted as a tulku by the Chinese government, escaped from Tibet, seeking {{to return to the}} Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in <b>a</b> <b>quandary</b> on this issue, as any protests to India would mean an explicit endorsement of India's governance of Sikkim, which China still recognised as an independent state occupied by India. The Chinese government eventually recognised Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003, on the condition that India officially recognise Tibet as a part of China; New Delhi had originally accepted Tibet as a part of China in 1953 during the government of Jawaharlal Nehru. The 2003 agreement led to a thaw in Sino-Indian relations, and on 6 July 2006, the Sikkimese Himalayan pass of Nathu La was opened to cross-border trade, becoming the first open border between India and China. The pass, which had previously been closed since the 1962 Sino-Indian War, was an offshoot of the ancient Silk Road.|$|E

25|$|By AD 17, the Roman proconsul of Africa, Marcus Furius Camillus (II) was in <b>a</b> <b>quandary.</b> The {{threat to}} his {{province}} was now far more serious than the usual border raiding by the desert tribes. But while Tacfarinas relied on hit-and-run raids, he had little effective response. Although his own forces (the 3rd legion and at least {{the same number of}} auxiliaries, totalling ca. 10,000 men) were now greatly outnumbered by Tacfarinas' followers, Camillus decided to capitalise on the Romans' advantages in armour and training by offering Tacfarinas a decisive pitched battle. To this end, he led out into the field most of his force. Tacfarinas felt confident that with superior numbers, his newly modelled army, combining the best elements of Roman and Numidian warfare, was equal to the challenge. His men joined battle with the Romans - and were utterly routed. Tacitus gives no details on how this was accomplished, but later events suggest that the Numidian line was probably broken by the legionary infantry charge. Tacfarinas fled into the desert with the shattered remnants of his army and Camillus was awarded triumphal honours.|$|E

500|$|Journalist James P. O'Donnell, who {{conducted}} extensive interviews in the 1970s, provides one {{account of what}} happened next. SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke, {{who presided over the}} court martial for desertion, told O'Donnell that Hitler ordered him to set up a tribunal. Mohnke arranged for a court martial panel, which consisted of generals Wilhelm Burgdorf, Hans Krebs, SS-Gruppenführer Johann Rattenhuber, and himself. Fegelein, still drunk, refused to accept that he had to answer to Hitler, and stated that he was responsible only to Himmler. Fegelein was so drunk that he was crying and vomiting; he was unable to stand up, and even urinated on the floor. Mohnke was in <b>a</b> <b>quandary,</b> as German military and civilian law both require a defendant to be of sound mind and to understand the charges against them. Although Mohnke was certain Fegelein was [...] "guilty of flagrant desertion", it was the opinion of the judges that he was in no condition to stand trial, so Mohnke closed the proceedings and turned the defendant over to General Rattenhuber's security squad. Mohnke never saw Fegelein again.|$|E

40|$|A {{contribution}} to the second law review symposium dedicated to Steven Smith’s Law’s Quandary (Harvard 2004), this paper asks whether the “quandary” in which Smith finds modern law and jurisprudence is not, at least in part, the consequence of misunderstanding the classical natural law jurisprudence. The paper advances an interpretation of natural law according to which the natural law is the human person’s “participation” in the eternal law itself, with literally cosmic consequences for how we understand the ends and measures of human lawmaking. Mounting an argument against Justice Scalia’s thesis that “God applies the natural law,” the paper goes on to explore {{the consequences of the}} natural law’s being, first, available to all rational persons and, second, capable of coercive implementation only according to the norms of positive law that respect the common good. The paper concludes that while we might be in <b>an</b> “ontological” <b>quandary</b> in law today, we are not – because we have in fact received the natural law – in <b>an</b> “ontic” <b>quandary...</b>|$|R
