40|$|As {{if there}} isn’t enough {{confusion}} about carbohydrates and sugars in the diet, {{we now have}} to think about things like polyols, better known as sugar alcohols or sugar replacers. Sugar alcohols derive their name because they chemically resemble both sugar and alcohol. While many scientists do not classify them as carbohydrates, the Food and Drug Administration does.

25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K,</b> have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E

50|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} as well {{as other}} sugar substituents were intercalated into some layered double hydroxide (LDH) hosts by ion exchange. Characterization tests have shown that there is complete intercalation of the anions into the LDH hosts. In <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K,</b> the absorption at 1290 cm−1 is found in the intercalated product at 1314 cm−1.

5000|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} ( [...] ), {{also known}} as <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K</b> [...] (K is the symbol for potassium) or Ace K, is a calorie-free sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) often marketed under the trade names Sunett and Sweet One. In the European Union, it is known under the E number (additive code) E950. It was discovered accidentally in 1967 by German chemist Karl Clauss at Hoechst AG (now Nutrinova). In chemical structure, acesulfame potassium is the potassium salt of 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide. It is a white crystalline powder with molecular formula [...] and a molecular weight of 201.24 g/mol.|$|E
50|$|Unlike aspartame, <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K</b> {{is stable}} under heat, even under {{moderately}} acidic or basic conditions, {{allowing it to}} be used as a food additive in baking, or in products that require a long shelf life. Although acesulfame potassium has a stable shelf life, it can eventually degrade to acetoacetamide, which is toxic in high doses. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable. The acceptable daily intake of acesulfame potassium is listed as 15 mg/kg/day.|$|E

They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They {{tend to be very}} low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, ethyl methylphenylglycidate for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, allyl hexanoate for pineapple etc.) {{to make up for the}} lack of fruit juice taste.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment: Food ScienceJ. Scott SmithNon-nutritive {{sweeteners}} are alternative sweeteners {{that provide}} the taste of sweetness without a caloric contribution. In this Florence’s HomeStyle Cha-Cha study, aspartame, <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K,</b> sodium saccharin, and neotame were evaluated {{as a substitute for}} sucrose in the formulation. These sweeteners were used at their recommended equivalency levels to match the sweetness potency level to that of sucrose. Because they are more potent than sucrose, minimum amounts were needed to replace sucrose, and the remaining amounts were filled with maltodextrin. Using maltodextrin as bulk filler is common practice in the industry when replacing sucrose with a non-nutritive sweetener. This study evaluated the quality of the finished product in determining which non-nutritive sweetener had similar taste, aroma, and density qualities as the control, which was Cha-Cha sweetened with sucrose. The results of the evaluations indicated that Cha-Cha sweetened with <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K</b> was more similar to the control than the other non-nutritive sweeteners. Of the three taste characteristics evaluated for their degree of intensity, sweetness, saltiness, and bitterness, the <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K</b> sweetened treatment was closer to the control. In the GC/MS analysis in characterizing the volatile aroma compounds, <b>acesulfame</b> <b>K</b> contained all the aroma compounds with smaller differences in concentration than the other experimental treatments.
