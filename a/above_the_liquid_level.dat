50|$|The current {{design of}} the ECO Funnel {{utilizes}} a latching lid with gasket, and two internal tubes. One larger and longer tube extends into the container {{from the base of}} the funnel into the liquid waste to restrict the surface area of the contents and inhibit fume emission. The other tube is designed to sit <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> as a means to warn against overfilling. When the ECO Funnel is secured to a container, this second shorter and smaller tube provide the only ventilation. When the volume of liquid inside the container reaches the smaller tube opening, it will obstruct the air flow through the smaller tube, the waste fluid backs up into the funnel to signal the user that the container is at capacity. Detaching the ECO Funnel allows the remaining liquid to flow into the container and be safely sealed inside. So long as the ECO Funnel's contents do not exceed the maximum volume indicated, the liquid will drain into the container without overflowing.|$|E

25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the air inlet {{at the top}} of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer. The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a <b>level</b> <b>above</b> that of <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> in <b>the</b> tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.|$|R
50|$|Open or semi-open bath {{immersion}} cooling is a data center cooling technique that implies fully submerging servers in dielectric coolant fluid. It is called open or semi-open bath because servers are placed side-by-side in large tanks that function as baths. These baths operate at atmospheric pressure {{and allow the}} coolant fluid to be moved through the hardware components or servers submerged in it.Open Bath Immersion Cooling uses single-phase dielectric liquids. These liquids always remain in liquid state while operating. They never boil or freeze. The oil is usually pumped to an external heat exchanger where it is cooled thanks to heat exchange with a cooler water-circuit. A different approach uses natural convection as the driving force to circulate the oil through the servers. and a water cooled heat exchanger. This technique uses “open baths“ as there’s little (or no) risk of the coolant evaporating. In semi-open bath Immersion Cooling, a two-phase chemically engineered <b>liquid</b> is <b>the</b> working fluid. It literally boils thanks to its low boiling point and thus exists in both a liquid and gas phase. The system takes advantage of a concept known as “latent heat” which is the heat (thermal energy) required to change the phase of a fluid (in this case two-phase dielectric mineral oil). The oil is only cooled by boiling and thus remains at the boiling point (“saturation temperature”). Energy transferred from the servers into the two-phase oil will cause a portion of it to boil off into a gas (this is {{the second phase of}} the oil). <b>The</b> gas rises <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> oil <b>level</b> where it contacts a condenser which is cooler than the saturation temperature. This causes the vapoured oil to condense back into a liquid form and fall (rain) back into the bath.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{ordinary}} liquids, like {{alcohol or}} petroleum, creep up solid walls, driven by their surface tension. Liquid helium also has this property, but, {{in the case}} of He-II, the flow of the liquid in the layer is not restricted by its viscosity but by a critical velocity which is about 20 cm/s. This is a fairly high velocity so superfluid helium can flow relatively easily up the wall of containers, over the top, and down to the same level as the surface of the liquid inside the container, in a siphon effect as illustrated in figure 4.

Salt crystal whiskers were grown from salt solution saturated nanoporous silica coatings. Coated substrates were partially immersed into an aqueous potassium chloride solution and then {{kept in a}} controlled relative humidity chamber for whisker growth. The salt solution was first wicked into the coating by capillary action, and then evaporation ensued and a supersaturated condition was reached. Crystals grew from the surface by a base growth mechanism in which salt ions {{were added to the}} surface of the crystal that was in contact with the nanoporous coating. Optical microscopy and SEM results demonstrated this mechanism. Crystals with whisker morphologies, typically 2 - 50 µm in lateral dimension and up to ~ 1 cm in length, emerged from the coating surface at a position <b>above</b> <b>the</b> original <b>liquid</b> <b>level.</b> Sheet-like crystals also formed from whiskers that had fallen flat onto the porous coating surface. Inspired by the sheet formation mechanism and liquid transportation phenomenon, a seeding technique was developed to reduce whisker width. Attritor ground salt particles were placed on the nanoporous coating surface to initiate simultaneous whiskers growth and salt nano-whiskers with lateral dimension as small as 50 nm were obtained on the surface of the coating. This crystal growth method can be applied to different materials, namely water soluble materials, and creates whisker crystals with controllable size and location on the nanoporous coating. Open celled foam is a three dimensional structure. In some applications, other materials are coated on internal surface of the foam to provide desired final product functionality. Because of their complicated 3 D structures, coating onto foam is challenging. A new coating process that combines dip coating and spin coating was developed. Dip coating step was used to load the solution into the foam and a spin treatment step was added to remove <b>the</b> trapped <b>liquid</b> and redistribute <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> to obtain uniform coating. The dip and spin process was also used to create &# 61543;-alumina and zeolite coatings, which are of interest for catalysis applications...|$|R

The thickness increases with temperature but near 30 C the film appears foggy and scatters the laser beam. As the temperature of the cell is raised beyond room temperature it becomes increasingly difficult to equalize the temperature inside and outside the cell.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of German reactor safety {{research}} the thermal-hydraulic behaviour in accumulators was investigated experimentally and analytically for transient injection. The paper includes the description of two test facilities used for separate effect experiments for the discharge flow of accumulators. Results derived from experiments at a glass facility show the dependency of the nitrogen release processes in the water on the depressurization rate during negative pressure transients and a delay of release. This release delay caused oversaturated solutions and this effect {{has to be taken}} into account for the modelling of accumulators. It was not observed coalescence of nitrogen bubbles during rising but the appearance of humid nitrogen <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>level.</b> At the test facility TRACEI separate effect experiments were carried out for the investigation of the heat and mass transfer to the nitrogen cushion, the release of nitrogen out of saturated pressurized water and the multidimensional distribution of the gas temperature. The measured data in the nitrogen cushion show different conditions of humid nitrogen such as unsaturated and saturated humid nitrogen, the occurrence of water droplets in terms of fog and frozen fog. Intensive distributions of temperature and humidity <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> were detected during fast pressure gradients, hence high depressurization rates. Post test calculations were accomplished with the ATHLET-Code Mod. 1. 2 Cycle B for selected TRACEI separate effect experiments. The comparison of calculated results and experimental data shows well calculated liquid level decreasing and a good agreement of the pressure transient even if the friction pressure loss coefficients of the connection pipe between the accumulator simulator and the venting vessel were adapted. Deviations between simulations and experiments arised in calculating the cushion gas temperature. In order to improve the simulation quality it was suggested to calculate the enthalpy, the density, and accordingly the specific volume and the volumetric gas fraction, respectively the volumetric water fraction, by a model of humid nitrogen bearing analogy to the model of humid air in consideration of the basic equations used in the ATHLET-code. The modelling for releasing of solved nitrogen in the water nodes contains a source term of volumetric gas release rate subjected to pressure and depressurization rate and approaches for the determination of bubble rising velocities of the nitrogen bubbles in water.

40|$|A {{properly}} designed, installed ao 1 d maintained {{septic tank}} system is an approved method of sewage treatment for private residences in rural or urban areas where public sewage treatment {{systems are not}} available. The components of a septic system are the house sewer, the septic tank and the absorption field, as illustrated in Figure 1. Sewage flows to the septic tank through the house sewer. In the septic tank, the solids are separated from the liquids, undergo anaerobic digestion and are stored as sludge {{at the bottom of}} the tank. The liquid (septic tank effluent) flows to the absorption field where it percolates into the soil. The soil acts as a final treatment by removing bacteria, pathogens and fine particles. All household wastes and normal amounts of cleaning materials, including soaps, detergents, bleaches, drain cleaners and other mild chemical preparations, can be tolerated by a septic system. Roof drains and foundation drains should not be connected to the septic tank system. These sources of clear water only overload the septic system and may cause premature failure of the absorption field. Septic Tank Location The site of a septic tank is usually determined by the location of major bathroom and kitchen plumbing within the home and by the slope of the land. Locate septic tanks at least 15 feet (4. 5 m) from the foundation walls and approximately straight out from the point where the house sewer pipe goes through the wall. Table 1 gives minimum distances between the septic tank system and water lines, property lines and surface water supplies. Locate the septic tank out of high traffic areas where excessive loads may damage the tank top. Keep clear of areas subject to flooding, ponding or surface drainage from surrounding areas. The location should be accessible to a driveway or other acceptable route so a tank truck can be driven close enough to pump out the sludge and clean the tank. Do not locate septic tanks under sidewalks or patios where the tank is inaccessible for pumping. Consider the possibility of future expansion and locations for additions, such as sidewalks, patios, garages and storage buildings, before selecting the tank site. Sizing and Septic Tank Construction The minimum septic tank size for any installation is 1, 000 gallons (3, 800 I). For more than 3 bedrooms, add an additional capacity of 250 gallons (950 I) per bedroom. Garbag 3 disposals add an extra load to the system, requiring about 25 percent additional tank capacity. Minimum tank capacities are listed in Table 2. Septic tanks must be watertight and constructed of sound and durable materials that are not subject to excessive corrosion, frost damage, cracking or buckling due to settlement or back filling. Common construction materials include concrete, fiberglass and steel. Minimum liquid depth of the tank should be 4 feet (1. 2 m).

The second part of the thesis gives the results of a general investigation of high transport rates in the film. A solution of the problem of isolating the film was seen to depend upon the devising of a practical form of super-fluid filter. Capillary leaks through metal tubes containing closely packed wires, such as those used by Allen and Misener (J.  F.  Allen and A.  D.  Misener, Nature, 141, 75, 1938) in their work on the viscosity of <b>the</b> bulk <b>liquid</b> were found to be suitable. The construction and testing of such wire-tube filters is described. The performance data are tabulated for a typical one, consisting in this case of two tubes in parallel, each containing 900 wires of # 47 Eureka in a 5  cm. long cupronickel tube, initially. 157 " outside diameter,. 072 " inside diameter, drawn down finally to. 104 " outside diameter. Representative values of the amounts of gas, N. T. P., passed by this filter into a vacuum from one atmosphere of helium were:. 01  cc. /min. at 290 °K;. 06  cc. /min. at 90 °K;. 45  cc. /min. at 20 °K; 7  cc. /min. at 4. 3 °K. As the pressure is reduced in the helium temperature region, the amount of gas passed diminishes correspondingly, and at 4  cm.  Hg., 2. 2 °K, it becomes. 07  cc. /min. N. T. P. Below the λ-point, the filters pass no measureable quantity of gas when they are not dipping into <b>liquid.</b> <b>The</b> total transport circumference provided by <b>the</b> <b>above</b> combination of two leaks in parallel is 30  cm., giving a maximum possible film flow corresponding to 110  cc.  gas/min., N. T. P. It is pointed cut that the filters can be easily incorporated into metal apparatus, and an example is given of their application {{to the study of the}} vapour pressure over the film, and also the effect on the transport rate of lowering the vapour pressure over the film. It is found that the vapour pressure in equilibrium with the isolated film is the same as that of <b>the</b> bulk <b>liquid</b> at <b>the</b> same temperature. <b>Above</b> a critical rate of pumping, apparently determined by the incidental film flow up an auxiliary tube, and the evaporation loss of the particular arrangement used, the pressure over the isolated film suddenly decreases, and transport stops. It is shown that at the same time there is a sudden fall of temperature at the transport surface, and apparently a thermomechanical effect in the film which prevents it from moving into the container being pumped. It seems possible that the film is still present but immobilized, and if this is the case, oppositely directed thermomechanical forces along the path do not cancel each other, but act independently. A variety of geometrical arrangements hare been investigated for the occurrence of high transfer rates. It has been found that the transport through a small hole in a surface can be several times larger than that calculated from the perimeter of the hole and the rate established by Daunt and Mendelssohn (J.  G.  Daunt and K.  Mendelssohn, Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 170, 423, 1939) for flow over cylindrical beakers. A number of such holes hare been tested, and it has been found that there is sometimes a strong dependence of the transport rate on the height of <b>the</b> hole <b>above</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>liquid</b> <b>level,</b> and on <b>the</b> shape of the inside surface of the beaker. Experiments have been made similar to those of K.  R.  Atkins (Nature, 161, 925, 1948), who reported high transfer rates in capillaries ending in bulbs, and under the influence of the temperature gradients. The results of Atkins have not been verified, and a probable explanation, based upon the interpretation of his geometrical arrangement, has been given for the apparently high rates observed in the second of his experiments. Some possible explanations for the other discrepancies are considered, and it is recognized that hitherto unexplored experimental factors may be involved. Experiments have been made to eliminate certain possibilities, one in particular being the formation of thick films under certain conditions. This has led incidentally to an observation of a striking example of the high conductivity of helium as a free <b>liquid,</b> apart from <b>the</b> presence of solids on which subsurface could be carried. A summary of the experimental background of the field investigated, and some of the theoretical interpretations, is given in two chapters at the beginning of the thesis. </p...|$|R
