His most notable decision was the acquisition of the Seagram drinks company, which added Captain Morgan rum and Crown Royal Canadian whisky to Diageo's roster of brands.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the DelDOT {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{for a future}} north–south limited access highway in Sussex County. The Sussex County North–South Transportation Study explored routes along and between the US13, US113, and DE1 corridors. The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US113 corridor, using {{as much of the}} current US113 route as possible. For its standing US113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro–South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1862, the Confederate Navy {{initiated}} the first combat between ironclads when the Virginia successfully attacked the blockade. The next day, the Monitor engaged the Virginia in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Their battle {{ended in a}} draw, and the Confederacy later lost the Virginia when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture. The Monitor was the prototype for the monitor warship and many more were built by the Union Navy. While the Confederacy built more ironclad ships during the war, they lacked the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> or purchase ships that could effectively counter the monitors.|$|E

5|$|The Town Center {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} buildings in the game. Here villagers are created, and age advancement is researched. Most scenarios have each player begin with a single Town Center; the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> multiple Town Centers is unlocked by the construction of the Government Center during the Bronze Age. The Town Center provides population support for four units. In order to build more units, houses must be constructed. Each house supports four units, and although any number of houses can be built (a concept which was not maintained in later games like Age of Mythology), they can only support a maximum of fifty units.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit-and-run tactics that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36BC. The situation changed with the rise of the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, siege towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sasanian siegecraft, military engineering, and organization, as well as <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> defensive works.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be {{crucial for the}} success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft {{that could be used to}} replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation. Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days after the operation began.|$|E

5|$|The result {{confirmed}} the worries of some, including Spaak, {{that the vote}} would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold {{announced that he was}} willing to temporarily delegate his authority. Many within the PSC–CVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a national reconciliation around the King as long as their Liberal coalition partners and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the rural world in the 5th and 6th centuries, {{according}} to the landscape archaeology, was due to three factors: the continuity with the past, with no evidence of up-rooting in the landscape; farmer's freedom and rights over lands, with provision of a rent or duty to an overlord, who provided only slight lordly input; and the common outfield arable land (of an outfield-infield system) that provided the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> kinship and group cultural ties.|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} {{original}} approach {{based on a}} fluidic mechanism involving silica nano-particules that al-lowed us to design a elaborate set of segmented-optical structures such as arranged clusters of pillars and cross-tapered-waveguides. We show that the association of such complex segmented pre-formed struc-tures can be specifically shaped, by way of coupling nano-fluidics and drying mechanisms. The formation of specific silica nano-patterns or organized networks of silica nano-ridges may be predictable and in perfect agreement with the theory of minimal surfaces dealt with physics of fluids. The interest of such nano-photonic coupling mechanisms has been clearly highlighted thanks <b>to</b> their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> original nano-silica-networks and the specific development of new filters based on resonant tunnelling effects between multi-nano-ridges...|$|R
50|$|Most modules {{are built}} with a {{surface area of}} 2 by 4 ft. The {{official}} standard allows up to an extra 6 in of surface area on either the aisle or operator's side or both (which {{can lead to a}} module that is 3 ft wide). Module lengths are typically extended in 2 ft increments, but can be almost any length, limited by the modeler's <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> and transport the modules. Modules built to non-standard lengths must be built with consideration of the standard lengths; where appropriate, the modeler must also build a short bridge module so that the module set uses up a section of layout that is evenly divisible by 4 ft-long modules.|$|R

25|$|Children with {{attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, due to a limited <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> social skills through observational learning, difficulties attending to social cues, and because of the social impacts of impulsive behavior and a greater tendency to engage in behavior that may be seen as disruptive by their peers. In a 2007 review, no treatment was identified which effectively address peer functioning in children with ADHD, and treatments which addressed other aspects of the disorder were not found to eliminate issues related to peer functioning.|$|E

25|$|These {{modifications}} helped, but {{the demand}} for new automobiles outpaced the railroads' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> and modify boxcars in which to ship them. In 1923, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad experimented with modifying a group of -long wood-frame flat cars to increase their capacity by adding collapsible frames to allow for double-deck operation. The concept was not perfected and therefore failed to gain acceptance. In the 1940s and 1950s, some railroads experimented with automobile-loading assemblies that would lift one or more automobiles above others within a boxcar. The success of these assemblies was limited due to their special use and specific size; it proved uneconomical to maintain a fleet of these assemblies {{that could only be}} loaded into boxcars from the ends of the cars.|$|R
