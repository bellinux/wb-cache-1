5|$|Budapest Tales {{was even}} less {{successful}} than 25 Fireman Street {{at the box}} office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this may explain why Szabó shifted gears even more dramatically in his next film, Confidence (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on the relationship between <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> who are forced to share a room as they hide from the Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As the strength of their relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> who fall in love will have a child, and that child will inherit certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow, there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters that died were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a customisable castle that serves as the player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013, the High Court of Australia ruled, in {{relation}} to a territory-based same-sex marriage law of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), that the federal Marriage Act, which defined marriage as the union of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman,</b> precluded states and territories from legislating for same-sex marriage. As a result, only the Federal Parliament can legislate for same-sex marriage, whilst states and territories almost certainly cannot.|$|E

It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten sexual tension, attraction and interest.|$|E

Individuals in the Tanana society are born into their mother's clan.

25|$|In {{the first}} couple of decades there was no {{traditional}} marriage in the kibbutz. If <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a positive thing for the community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.|$|E
25|$|Cheek kissing between adults, when {{it occurs}} at all, {{is most often}} done between <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> who know each other well, such as between {{relatives}} or close friends. In this case, a short hug (generally only upper-body contact) or handshake may accompany the kiss. Likewise, hugs are common but not required. A hug alone may also suffice {{in both of these}} situations, and is much more common. Particularly in the southeastern United States (Southern), elderly women may be cheek kissed by younger men as a gesture of affection and respect.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect is}} the lack of {{concordance}} between subjective sexual arousal and genital arousal. Research by Meredith L. Chivers and J. Michael Bailey indicates that men tend to show category-specific arousal; that is, they are sexually aroused by their preferred gender. However, women show category non-specificity: Their genitals show arousal to both preferred and non-preferred genders. Even though women reported being subjectively aroused to, for example, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> engaging in sexual activity, their genitals also show sexual arousal to two men engaging in sexual activity, two women doing so, and even non-human animals having sex.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{given the}} {{component}} of anger {{as a social}} construct, difficulty with communication between cultures can serve as another impediment. What is deemed an appropriate expression of anger is culturally dependent. Therefore, a mismatch between client and therapist {{could result in a}} misunderstanding as to the end goal of the program. For example, a client could only wish to decrease physical violence, while the therapist aims to decrease both verbal and physical outbursts. Gender dependent expectations of anger expression can contribute as well to societal standards. The same violent outburst for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> is subject to different interpretations due to anger being seen as more permissible in males.|$|E
25|$|The South Australia Test always {{coincides with}} the Australia day week-end.

To <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman,</b> the crowd rise to their feet to sing the national song...the men placing their hats and hands over their hearts. Equally there was no doubting the sincere determination of the Australian team as they took the field with their caps set in a resolute angle over their eyes.|$|E
