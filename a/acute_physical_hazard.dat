40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} indicating {{a positive effect}} of <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity on cognitive performance in children. Most of the evidence originates, however, from studies in highly controlled laboratory settings. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether the same effects can be found in more real-world settings. We examined the effects of qualitatively different <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity interventions on the three core dimensions of executive functions (updating, inhibition, shifting). In an experimental between-subject design, 219 ten to twelve year-olds were assigned to one of four conditions which varied systematically in physical activation and cognitive engagement. Executive functions were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Contrary to the hypothesis, no effects of <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity with and without cognitive engagement were found on executive functions in the overall sample. Only children with higher fitness and/or higher academic achievement benefitted from the interventions in terms of their updating performance. Thus, the results indicate that it may be more difficult to attain positive effects through <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity in real-world settings than in laboratory settings and that physiological and cognitive requirements may have to be adjusted to individual capacity to make an intervention effective...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of an <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity intervention including cognitive engagement on executive functions and on cortisol level in young elementary school children. Half of the 104 participating children (6 to 8 years old) attended a 20 -minute sport sequence, which included cognitively engaging and playful forms of physical activity. The other half was assigned to a resting control condition. Individual differences in children`s updating, inhibition, and shifting performance as well as salivary cortisol were assessed before (pre-test), immediately after (post-test), and 40 minutes after (follow-up) the intervention or control condition respectively. Results revealed a significantly stronger improvement in inhibition in the experimental group compared to the control group, while it appeared that <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity had no specific effect on updating and shifting. The intervention effect on inhibition levelled out 40 minutes after physical activity. Salivary cortisol increased significantly more in the experimental compared to the control group between post-test and follow-up and results support partly the assumed inverted U-shaped relationship between cortisol level and cognitive performance. In conclusion, results indicate that <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity including cognitive engagement may have immediate positive effects on inhibition, but not necessarily on updating and shifting in elementary school children. This positive effect may partly be explained trough cortisol elevation after <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> activity...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the effects of short-term exercise training on cardiac function and metabolism during rest and physical exercise in patients with heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DESIGN: Patients with DCM (n= 15, age 58 ± 2 years, NYHA class I-III) were studied before and after 8 weeks of cycle exercise for 20 min, five times per week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiac volumes, function and high energy phosphate metabolism were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance during rest and 7 min of <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> exercise (leg-raising). RESULTS: At baseline, average left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 38 ± 3 %, which did not alter during 7 min of exercise. After 8 weeks of home exercise training, there was a 16 % improvement in resting LVEF to 44 ± 3 % (p< 0. 01). Training caused a further 20 % improvement in LVEF (p< 0. 05) during <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> exercise. There was a negative correlation between subjects' baseline level of exercise and change in LVEF (r=- 0. 67, p< 0. 05), with sedentary patients having the greatest improvement. Cardiac phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP ratio did not change during <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> exercise or after exercise training. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exercise training improves resting LVEF and LVEF with <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> exercise with sedentary patients having the greatest improvement. There were no changes in cardiac PCr to ATP, before or after exercise training, suggesting that the improved cardiac function was not caused by improved energetics. Therefore, peripheral factors likely underlie the improved cardiac function in patients with heart failure after short-term exercise...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{research}} has demonstrated that <b>acute</b> aerobic <b>physical</b> exercise, neurofeedback, and mindfulness meditation independently have positive effects on executive performance. Technology has enabled a new intervention that combines neurofeedback and mindfulness meditation; however its effects on executive function are unknown.

Forty-two participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> exercise, mindfulness meditation, or mindfulness meditation neurofeedback delivered via the Muse brain-sensing headband. Participants completed 50 trials of the Stroop task, a well-established measure of executive function. A statistically significant one-way ANOVA revealed that participants made fewer errors after undergoing the mindfulness meditation neurofeedback intervention than they did following <b>acute</b> <b>physical</b> exercise. These findings demonstrate that mindfulness meditation neurofeedback may boost aspects of executive function that relate to lower Stroop task error rates...|$|R
