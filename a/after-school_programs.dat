5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner Daniel P.

O'Malley promised to enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods. Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and <b>after-school</b> <b>programs,</b> while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} study examined an interdisciplinary {{middle school in}} Southern California {{to determine the best}} practices employed for use with their academic based <b>after-school</b> <b>program.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the correlation between the best practices of an academic based <b>after-school</b> <b>program</b> and student achievement in the middle years.

5|$|Tierney first ran for Congress in 1994 against one-term Republican {{incumbent}} Peter G. Torkildsen, {{having won}} a competitive Democratic primary with {{a plurality of}} 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote <b>after-school</b> <b>programs,</b> consideration of means testing for Social Security, and single-payer health care. A primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against a 1994 crime bill, and advocated stronger gun control, while Torkildsen criticized Tierney's positions on gun control and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated {{in the general election}} by 4%. Tierney successfully ran for Congress in 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote.

5|$|Vick {{has been}} a {{principal}} in two charitable foundations, the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation. In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth with <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the new organization came just {{before the start of}} the foundation's first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after-school program. The foundation spent 12% of its 2006 budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. The foundation ceased operations that year. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000 – most of the remaining funds – from its checking account in 2008.|$|E

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study examined how academic self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, {{and participation in}} an <b>after-school</b> <b>program</b> contributed to the academic achievement of Latino middle school students {{over the course of}} one school year. Participants were 47 Latino students in sixth through eighth grades who attended two public middle schools in which an <b>after-school</b> <b>program</b> was held that was specifically for Latino students. Results from ordinary least squares regression revealed that intrinsic motivation was positively associated with students GPAs, self-efficacy was a positive predictor of students’ school attendance and standardized math achievement scores, and attendance at the <b>after-school</b> <b>program</b> also contributed positively to students’ math achievement.

50|$|Studies {{show that}} afterschool {{programs}} are beneficial for {{both children and}} adolescents. A 1994 long-term study by Posner and Vandell found that children in structured, academic afterschool programs had increased academic achievement when compared to their peers. Researchers chose a pool of children who had taken part {{in some sort of}} <b>after-school</b> <b>program</b> and another pool of children who did not take part in a formal <b>after-school</b> <b>program</b> as a control group. They gave assessments to the children, their parents, and their teachers {{in order to determine the}} children's levels of academic achievement, and the results showed that students who had taken part in a structured <b>after-school</b> <b>program</b> were more likely to have better grades and to perform higher in math and reading tests than those who had not taken part in an <b>after-school</b> <b>program.</b> Similarly, a 2010 study by Durlak, Weissberg, and Pachan showed that both children and adolescents experienced significant academic gains by taking part in afterschool programs.|$|R
