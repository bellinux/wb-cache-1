Its capital has been Patna for almost 2, 500 years. Bihar is the 12 th largest Indian state in terms of geographical size, ranked 14 out of 28 in terms of state and the third largest as regards the population. Bihar {{was part of the}} ancient kingdom of Magadha. Muslims occupied it in 1193 and the Delhi sultans in 1497. In 1765, the British took over Bihar and merged it with Bengal. The province of Bihar and Orissa was formed in 1912; Bihar became a separate province in 1936. Historically, Bihar has been a major centre of learning, home to the universities of Nalanda, one of the earliest universities of India dating back to the fifth century. All the chapters mentioned above as the Contents of Table briefly throw light on the Bihar religious luminaries.

The plantation sector is a strategic sector because of its dominant role in {{the economic and social}} development not only of a particular country but also as a global player in the provision of food, source of employment, economic returns through international trade and political stability. This sector stresses the strong bondage among the players in the industry comprising the workforce, plantation corporations, the unions as well as the states. The management of the plantations right from the selection of the appropriate agricultural crops, its agronomic and management practices, the risks and uncertainties involved and finally, meeting the ever changing consumers' needs requires a very strong commitment and total involvement on the part of these players as a team to face the insurmountable challenges. The sense of belonging to the company must be instilled forever as the company belongs to them. This book highlights the significance of the various plantations crops normally cultivated in Asia, Africa and the Latin American countries. The companies involved are mostly multi-national in nature and they control the export market of some of these products globally...|$|R
