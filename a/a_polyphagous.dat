25|$|V. maculifrons is <b>a</b> <b>polyphagous</b> species, {{meaning that}} they feed {{on a variety of}} foods. The number of trips a worker makes to forage depends on the age of the worker, as well as the size of the nest, since more food is {{necessary}} to feed a larger nest. Workers dedicated to foraging are capable of olfactory learning, allowing them to distinguish odors specific to food. Workers use this ability to scavenge for dead insects such as earwigs and fall webworm larvae, as well as live arthropods. They are also frugivores, obtaining carbohydrates from fruits, nectar, and honeydew. Workers go to flowers in an attempt to catch insects, but often end up feeding on nectar and pollinating the flower while doing so. They feed on honeydew, which is a sweet, sticky liquid. However, honeydew is susceptible to fermentation, causing individuals that feed on it to become inebriated and unable to fly or walk. Since this species is attracted to sugar sources, they may be attracted to soft drinks or other foods consumed by humans. Adults feed larvae with a chewed paste made from other insects and carrion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Stereochemistry plays a {{significant}} role in structure–activity relationships of messenger chemicals. The ability to distinguish between enantiomers and geo-metric isomers, however, may be limited to certain stereoisomeric substances, depending on the receiver. In this study, we assessed the preference of the peripheral olfactometry system of Western Flower Thrips, F. occi-dentalis towards ubiquitously expressed host compounds, with a goal of establishing whether particular stereoisomers enhance host odour recognition. We demonstrate that the peripheral olfactory system of <b>a</b> highly <b>polyphagous</b> thy-sanopteran insect has evolved to become highly sensitive to a type of green leaf volatile, which is highly ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. We show that there is {{a significant}}ly greater antennal response to the cis isomer, more so than the isomerisation by-product trans- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol. We demonstrate that the antennae of <b>a</b> highly <b>polyphagous</b> insect are capable of detecting common plant secondary metabolites in both enantiomeric forms...|$|R

40|$|The Neotropical jumping plant-louse Russelliana solanicola Tuthill is {{a potato}} pest and a {{probable}} vector of plant pathogens. Populations morphologically {{similar to those}} found on potatoes have been collected on plants of at least ten different families, four of which have been confirmed as hosts by the presence of immatures. This suggests that R. solanicola is either <b>a</b> single <b>polyphagous</b> species or <b>a</b> complex of closely related, monophagous species (host races/cryptic species). Results of our analyses of multiple morphometric characters show for both sexes a grouping of the populations of R. solanicola and a clear separation of the latter from other Russelliana species. On the other hand, within R. solanicola, there is an overlap of populations from different host-plants as well as from different geographical regions. The {{results of the present study}} strongly suggest that R. solanicola is <b>a</b> single, <b>polyphagous</b> species and the known distribution indicates that it is native to the Andes. It is likely that R. solanicola has been introduced into eastern Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The polyphagy together with the ability to disperse and transmit plant pathogens potentially make this species an economically important pest of potato and other crop species...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys,is <b>an</b> Asian <b>polyphagous</b> {{species that}} has become an {{invasive}} crop pest in North America and Europe. After its first detection in Switzerland in 2004, it was subsequently found in other European countries such as Italy, where, since 2012, it has rapidly spread in the northern regions, becoming a threat to many crops, especially in pear and peach orchards. Results/Conclusion: Overall, most egg parasitism {{was due to the}} generalist parasitoid Anastatus sp. (Eupelmidae) and, at a lower level, to various Scelionidae species (e. g.

Scientific investigations and field tests demonstrated that 2, 6 -dimethyl-l, 5 -heptadien- 3 -yl acetate is the most attractive one for these species. According to literature, synthesis of this pheromone suffers from low overall yield (cca 9 %), as well as increases the self-cost of this compound.

40|$|The Asian Long-horned Beetle (ALB) is <b>a</b> highly <b>polyphagous</b> species {{invasive}} in North America and Europe. This {{species has}} been reported to have low dispersing potential, but long- distance dispersal could occasionally happen. We conducted a preliminary study on laboratory- reared adults from invasive populations to measure the flying po- tential of beetles using computer- linked flight mills. Under standardized conditions, ALB was capable of flying over longer distances than previously described. The high- est distance recorded over an adult lifespan outreached 14 km. Flight mill method is therefore useful to estimate the maximum physiological flight abilities of the species that should be taken into account to improve management of invasive populations...|$|R
