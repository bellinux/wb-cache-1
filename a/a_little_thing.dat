25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bedingfield {{began writing}} and {{recording}} new material for her second North American album Pocketful of Sunshine. Producer J. R. Rotem {{had been working}} with Bedingfield on the album. Rotem introduced Bedingfield to reggae pop singer/rapper Sean Kingston, who was also recording with Rotem. Bedingfield decided to work with Kingston because she [...] "just Liked his thing". In an interview with Digital Spy, {{she said that she}} respected rappers and seemed to [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> with rappers" [...] since she had previously worked with Estelle, Eve and Bizarre from D12.|$|E
500|$|During the Experience's first {{performances}} {{during a}} short tour of France in October 1966 {{and before they}} worked up some original material, they played the song {{along with a few}} other R cover songs during their 15-minute opening sets. [...] A performance by the Experience at the Flamingo Club in London on February 4, 1967, was recorded and has been issued on several bootleg albums. [...] Hendrix announces the song as [...] "very straight Top-40 R rock 'n' roll record... <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> called 'Have Mercy'... 'Have Mercy on Me, Baby'". [...] The three and a half minute song features more elaborate and driving guitar work, although remains focused on chording.|$|E
500|$|While rehearsing {{for their}} {{performance}} at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna. After Madonna commented that she liked the track, Spears asked her to do the song with her. RedZone then handed [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna, who arranged and recorded her vocal additions on her own, therefore making the song a duet. Spears, {{who has been a}} Madonna fan for years, was [...] "beyond surprised" [...] when she heard Madonna's verse. She said [...] "I just asked her to do <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> but she really went there. She did a lot of stuff to it." [...] Jive Records hoped [...] "Outrageous" [...] would be released as the first single from the album, but Spears pushed for [...] "Me Against the Music". After she performed the song {{for the first time at}} the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live, Spears refused to answer if it was the first single from the album, but said that [...] "there are some surprises that are going to come up in the song that I'm really excited about." [...] On September 16, 2003, it was confirmed that [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] would be released as the first single from In the Zone.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone, {{presented}} Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of [...] "Me Against the Music"; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." [...] While rehearsing for their performance at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna.

2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it. They don't {{want to get into the}} nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} {{discussion}} in literary circles about how collaborative this novel is, fuelled partly by later comments by Barnard. This is despite significant {{evidence to the}} contrary, including Barnard's asking Palmer to obtain Eldershaw's signature {{as well as her}} own for his copy. In later years Barnard claimed that Eldershaw's removal to Canberra in 1941 broke down their collaboration on the novel, although in 1941 she wrote to Palmer that [...] "we're not going to let <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like distance interfere with collaboration. It's a pity the new book isn't further along". Dever argues that there is significant evidence for Eldershaw's active involvement in the novel, including correspondence from the publisher referring to them both, and Eldershaw's later letter to Miles Franklin in which she commented on [...] "the awful effort of having to close up the gaps left by the censor and adapting the ending".|$|E
2500|$|Grace took a vehemently pro-prosecution {{position}} {{throughout the}} 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, in which Crystal Gail Mangum, a stripper and North Carolina Central University student, falsely accused {{three members of}} Duke University's men's lacrosse team of raping her at a party. Prior to Duke suspending its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, [...] "I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game over <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like gang rape!" [...] and [...] "Why would {{you go to a}} cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?" [...] After the disbarment of District Attorney Mike Nifong, Attorney General Roy Cooper pronounced all three players innocent of the rape charges made by Mangum and Nifong. On the following broadcast of her show, Grace did not appear and a substitute reporter, Jane Velez-Mitchell, announced the removal of all charges.|$|E
2500|$|Among those giving {{extensive}} coverage {{to the matter}} was Nancy Grace. [...] Before Duke suspended its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, [...] "I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game over <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like gang rape!" [...] and [...] "Why would {{you go to a}} cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?" [...] Another, Susan Estrich, said [...] "I teach criminal law. But what are we dealing with here? The mafia, or a sports team from a first-class university. Instead, they hire them lawyers to trash the victim and the prosecutor." [...] Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy supplied the case {{with some of the most}} inflammatory claims and supported Nifong's withholding of evidence saying, [...] "Nifong should be rewarded for respecting the defendants' rights by not leaking the type of evidence that could help him personally respond to criticism." [...] Murphy said [...] "I never, ever met a false rape claim, by the way. My own statistics speak to the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Hanina deduced from [...] that {{everything}} is in the hand of Heaven except the fear of Heaven, for [...] says: [...] "What does the Lord your God ask of you, but only to fear the Lord your God." [...] The Gemara asked whether the fear of Heaven was such <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> that [...] says [...] "only." [...] Rabbi Hanina said in the name Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that God has in God's treasury nothing but a store {{of the fear of}} Heaven, as [...] says: [...] "The fear of the Lord is His treasure," [...] and thus the fear of Heaven must be a great thing. The Gemara responded that for Moses, the fear of Heaven was a small thing, for he had it. Rabbi Hanina illustrated with a parable: If a man is asked for a big article and he has it, it seems like a small article to him; if he is asked for a small article and he does not have it, it seems like a big article to him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} continuity, events in {{different}} episodes contradict each other, {{as there is}} a loose sense of canon. One such example is in [...] "The Other Cousin" [...] and [...] "N.R.A.y RAY", in which Toot is pictured with a penis, something that is not consistent with other episodes. Another is Foxxy's various and contradictory stories about her son Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just brushing his teeth). Plots and gags are often used that do not make any type of internal sense, but are used as one-off jokes, as when Foxxy, who is in her twenties, is said to have a teenage grandson. Some episodes begin with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to executive producer Bill Freiberger, [...] "Very little on Drawn Together can be considered canon. If you try to find continuity on this show you'll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that's consistent is we try to make the show as funny as possible. And we'd never let <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like continuity {{get in the way of}} that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
