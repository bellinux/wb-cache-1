5|$|After the DPP {{nominated}} Hsu as the 2001 Tainan mayoral race candidate, protests led by {{supporters of}} then-incumbent mayor George Chang, {{who is also}} a member of the DPP, arose. The protesters called Hsu a betrayer of the party <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> party in 1995. They showed their disapproval of the party's choice by burning their party membership cards.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 2009, {{following}} 8 {{years of}} distinguished service, Billy retired {{due to his}} age. Soldiers from the battalion lined the route from his pen to the trailer <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> camp for the last time, in ceremonial dress that included a silver headdress which {{was a gift from}} the queen in 1955. Billy was taken to Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire, where keepers say he had an easy life at the Children's Farm.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1982, ANO {{operative}} Hussein Ghassan Said shot Shlomo Argov, the Israeli {{ambassador to}} Britain, {{once in the}} head <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Dorchester Hotel in London. Said was accompanied by Nawaf al-Rosan, an Iraqi intelligence officer, and Marwan al-Banna, Abu Nidal's cousin. Argov survived, but spent three months in a coma {{and the rest of}} his life disabled, until his death in February 2003. The PLO quickly denied responsibility for the attack.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Poorly {{equipped}} {{and poorly}} trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated.

5|$|On lap 48, Michele Alboreto {{came in for}} a pit stop, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left,</b> <b>the</b> rear-right wheel came {{loose from}} the Minardi as it left the pit lane, {{striking}} two Ferrari and two Lotus mechanics, who were left needing hospital treatment.|$|E
5|$|At 3:21 of the 1st round, after Wanderlei flurried {{and missed}} a punch {{with his right}} hand, Jackson countered with a left hook on Silva's jaw, sending the latter on to the canvas and {{rendering}} him unconscious. Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest. Wanderlei remained on the canvas for several moments, but appeared to be OK <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> cage under his own power.|$|E

He also recorded it as a duet with fellow Puerto Rican singer Ana Isabelle on her studio album Mi Sueño (2010).|$|E
5|$|Phil Boersma {{opened the}} scoring for Liverpool in the 20th minute {{when he was}} first to reach the loose ball that had been blocked by David Harvey from a shot by Keegan. Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was angry with the decision because he claimed provocation, took off his shirt <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> field and threw it away. Bremner, several yards behind him, then did the same. Trevor Cherry headed home the Leeds equaliser in the 70th minute and the match finished 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Reamon, who {{had helped}} guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia, helped Michael with his SATs and helped {{him and his family}} choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech. Reamon favored Virginia Tech, where he felt better {{guidance}} was available under Frank Beamer, who promised to redshirt him and provide the freshman needed time to develop. Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand, Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story.|$|E

5|$|The FBB {{closed the}} Security Zone checkpoints, {{but by then}} Stauffenberg's car had been let through two of them <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> area.

They succeeded in getting away before clarity of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E
5|$|The Rangers {{lost to the}} Blue Jays in {{five games}} in the Division Series after {{squandering}} a 2-0 series lead. Hamels received a no-decision in Game 2 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> game tied, but the Rangers won in 14 innings. Hamels started Game 5, and was pulled {{in the bottom of}} the 7th inning while the Rangers were leading 3-2; the Jays subsequently scored 4 runs to win 6-3, and Hamels was charged with the loss as he was responsible for the runners on base.|$|E
5|$|When Said bin Taimur of Oman {{was ousted}} in a coup in July 1970 and {{replaced}} with his son Qaboos bin Said, he was sent in exile and lived at the Dorchester {{until his death in}} 1972. The McAlpine family owned the hotel until 1977 when they sold it to a consortium of businessmen from the Middle East headed by the Sultan of Brunei. On 3 June 1982, Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom was shot and seriously injured in an assassination attempt <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Dorchester. The attack was the immediate cause for the 1982 Lebanon War.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{five minutes}} into the third quarter, Namath forged another Jets drive, {{following}} an interception by safety Jim Hudson, that ended with halfback Bill Mathis scoring a 4-yard touchdown behind blocking guard Dave Herman to give New York a 19–14 lead. The Raiders responded with an 80-yard drive that saw running back Charlie Smith score his first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard pass from Lamonica. The Raiders took a 22–19 lead on a two-point conversion with Lamonica completing the attempt to receiver Hewritt Dixon. During this drive, Hudson was ejected from the game after being called for a face mask penalty followed by a dispute with an official. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> field, he gave the jeering crowd the finger. The penalties caused the ball to be placed at the Jets' 3-yard line, and Smith scored for Oakland one play later.|$|E
5|$|Tanahashi next tried a Rainmaker, which Okada {{countered with}} one of his own and scored a nearfall. Although Okada {{attempted}} the Rainmaker three more times, Tanahashi countered with a bridging straitjacket German suplex, a bridging dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three High Fly Flows. The first was a crossbody while Okada was on the ropes; the second a frog splash to a seated Okada, and the third another frog splash, after which Tanahashi scored a pinfall on Okada to retain the title at 30 minutes and 57 seconds. Okada wept <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> ring, and Tanahashi shouted that his opponent had {{a long way to go}} before becoming the New Japan ace. Tanahashi closed the show, thanking the fans and performing his air guitar routine.|$|E
5|$|The Documentary is {{the debut}} studio album by American rapper The Game. It was {{released}} on January 18, 2005, by Aftermath Entertainment, G-Unit Records and Interscope Records. The record serves as his major-label debut that was preceded by the release of his independently-released debut of Untold Story (2004). In 2001, after The Game was recovering from a shooting, he embarked his rap career. He later was discovered by Dr. Dre, who Dre signed The Game to his Aftermath Entertainment label. The album includes production from high-profile producers such as Dr. Dre, Kanye West, Scott Storch and Timbaland, among others. The album features guest appearances from 50 Cent, Eminem, Nate Dogg and Faith Evans, among others.

5|$|Alvarado's subjugation of Honduras proved superficial, {{and largely}} limited to Higueras. His {{conquest of the}} Naco valley and the lower Ulúa River firmly {{established}} a Spanish presence there, but beyond that Spanish control was fragile. Expeditions had penetrated deeply across Honduras, and distant native rulers had come to offer homage to the Spanish Crown. The settlement at Gracias a Dios was not as secure as it had appeared when Alvarado left, and no effective assistance {{had been sent to}} Trujillo. Many native rulers, who had been cowed by Alvarado's formidable reputation and military skill, rose in rebellion as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> province. Alvarado had also encouraged the enslavement of natives that fought against the Spanish, and their subsequent sale, as well as general harsh treatment of the indigenous population; this produced considerable resentment among the Indians, and left them susceptible to rebellion. Many natives resisted passively, by not providing supplies or labour to their encomenderos. Continued slave raids, and ferocious treatment {{at the hands of the}} Achi Maya auxiliaries increased their hatred and resistance, and many Indians abandoned their settlements and fled to the mountains and forests. The greater part of the districts of San Pedro and Gracias a Dios were at war, and the Spanish position was again precarious.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall {{blow to the}} shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease {{in less than an}} hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement {{after the end of the}} series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> arena.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} Fighter Command's need for {{units in the}} south of the country, No. 41 Squadron was redeployed to RAF Hornchurch in Essex on 3 September 1940. On 5 September, Lock flew as Red 2, {{positioned}} behind and protecting the Squadron's Leader. He shot down two Heinkel He 111s over the Thames Estuary. One of his victims crashed into a river, the other caught fire and its undercarriage fell down. Lock followed it down. He quickly realised his mistake—reducing height to pursue a damaged enemy put a pilot at risk from enemy fighters—but it was too late. A Messerschmitt Bf 109 attacked him and he sustained damage to his Spitfire and a wound to his leg. Lock immediately zoom-climbed. The Bf 109 attempted to follow but the pilot stalled and fell away. Lock reversed direction and dived. Waiting for the German fighter to come out of its dive he fired several short bursts and it exploded. Looking around he saw the second He 111 land in the English Channel, about ten miles from the first. Lock circled above the He 111 and noticing a boat he alerted the boat to its presence by flying over it and led the vessel to the crash site. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> scene he saw the crew surrendering to the occupants of the boat. On the way home he saw his first victim in the river, with a dingy nearby. A further Bf 109 was claimed destroyed on that date.|$|E
