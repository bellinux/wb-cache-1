Flowering plants and wildflowers are abundant, including trillium, lady slippers, forget-me-nots, violets, trout lily, spring beauty, hepatica, buttercups, and hawkweeds {{in the forests}} and orchids, fringed gentian, butter-and-eggs, and jack-in-the-pulpit <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline.</b> The island's forests are home to many varieties of trees, such as maple, birch, elm, cedar, pine, and spruce.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} devastated {{the city of}} Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. According to some estimates the death toll on the coast outside of Galveston may have been over one thousand. Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed. Communities <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in Southeast Texas. The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe.|$|E

5|$|<b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline,</b> blizzards {{shut down}} traffic and communication, causing {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars in damage. A 22-inch (56cm) snowfall in Cleveland, Ohio, put stores out of business for two days. There were four-foot (122cm) snowdrifts around Lake Huron. Power was out for several days across Michigan and Ontario, cutting off telephone and telegraph communications. A recently completed US$100,000 Chicago breakwater, intended to protect the Lincoln Park basin from storms, was swept away in a few hours. The Milwaukee harbor lost its entire south breakwater and much of the surrounding South Park area that had been recently renovated.|$|E
5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Striking the Philippines as {{a rapidly}} {{weakening}} system, Maysak had only minimal {{effects in the}} country, producing strong waves and light rainfall. Across Aurora and Isabela provinces, a total of 2,761people were directly affected by the storm, {{most of whom were}} evacuated prior to Maysak's landfall. No damage or loss of life was reported; however, four people were injured after waves generated by Maysak hit them while they were taking selfies <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> of Dipaculao town in Aurora province on April4. An overloaded, unregistered ferry capsized off Sulu Province in Mindanao on April3, resulting in five deaths. The Philippine Coast Guard stated that seas at the time were calm and the sinking likely resulted from overcrowding of the vessel rather than Typhoon Maysak.|$|E

5|$|A {{short-lived}} medicane developed {{near the}} end of September2006 along the coast of Italy. The origins of the medicane {{can be traced to the}} alpine Atlas mountain range on the evening of 25September, likely forming as a normal lee cyclone. At 0600UTC on 26September, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model analyses indicated the existence of two low-pressure areas <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> of Italy, one on the west coast, sweeping eastward across the Tyrrhenian Sea, while the other, slightly more intense, low was located over the Ionian Sea. As the latter low approached the Strait of Sicily, it met an eastward-moving convection-producing cold front, resulting in significant intensification, while the system simultaneously reduced in size. It then achieved a minimum atmospheric pressure of approximately 986mbar (29.12inHg) after transiting north-northeastward across the -wide Salentine peninsula in the course of roughly 30minutes at 0915UTC the same day.|$|E
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
5|$|Everett Station {{is served}} by six daily Amtrak trains: four Cascades runs between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, and two Empire Builder runs between Seattle and Chicago. The station is also served by the North Line of Sound Transit's Sounder {{commuter}} rail service, running four trains in peak direction towards King Street Station in Seattle during the morning commute and four trains from Seattle during the evening commute, only on weekdays and during special events. Train service to Everett is most often disrupted and canceled during the autumn and winter seasons because of landslides <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> of the Puget Sound, where the BNSF mainline tracks run. During the 2012–2013 winter season, a record-high of 206 passenger trains between Everett and Seattle were canceled, prompting the Washington State Department of Transportation to begin a three-year landslide mitigation project in 2013 that will stabilize slopes above the railroad between Seattle and Everett.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{sea level}} rising and the {{strength}} of <b>the</b> tides, <b>the</b> <b>shoreline’s</b> sandstones erode. Erosion causes sediment of sand, pebbles, and mud to be washed up and down the Cobequid Bay with the incoming and outgoing tides.

5|$|Oscoda is the {{location}} of the eastern termini of both the River Road National Scenic Byway and County Road F-41. In between those two junctions, the highway crosses the Au Sable River near its mouth, and the trunkline passes by the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base. Huron Road continues north, running next to Van Etten Lake as it leaves the national forest. Further north, it runs along Cedar Lake when it crosses into Alcona County. The highway meets the eastern termini of F-30 and M-72 in Greenbush and Harrisville respectively. It also passes Harrisville State Park in the latter community. The highway shifts a bit further inland north of Harrisville, continuing to parallel the railroad through the Mackinaw State Forest. Near Ossineke, the trunkline turns back toward the lake, running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> of Thunder Bay.|$|E
5|$|September 27, 1985– Hurricane Gloria {{parallels}} the New Jersey coastline just offshore as a Category2 hurricane. Its arrival forces 95,000citizens to evacuate, while eleven casinos in Atlantic City are closed, {{resulting in a}} loss of $7million (1985USD). Dubbed by some as the storm of the century, the hurricane is expected to become the first hurricane to hit the New Jersey coastline since the hurricane in 1903, though a last minute turn spares the state. While passing by the state, Gloria caused a storm surge of 4.6feet (1.4m) in Ventnor City and a wind gust of 80mph (129km) in Ocean City. Despite coming within miles of the coast, the storm caused only light rainfall <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline,</b> though further inland there were reports of over 5inches (13cm). Strong winds down trees and power lines, leaving 237,000 without power after the storm. Overall, damage is minor, and some were even disappointed at the lack of damage from the proclaimed storm of the century.|$|E
5|$|The final known {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was first observed by the brig Sea Lark on October21, while located just north of Inagua in the Bahamas. Throughout the Bahamas, storm surge impacted some islands. At Nassau, several ships were driven ashore, parts of the town were flooded and buildings <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> suffered damage. The storm moved northeastward and strengthened into a hurricane at 12:00UTC on October22. About 24hours later, the hurricane deepened into a Category2 hurricane. Later on October23, it passed just west of Bermuda. Gale force winds and rough seas were observed on the island, causing damage to several vessels. Peaking with winds of 105mph (165km/h), the storm began to weaken, falling to Category1 intensity on October25. It weakened to a tropical storm early the following day and dissipated hours later, while located about 195mi (315km) east-southeast of Sable Island.|$|E

Further south, near the waterline, is the Little Dennis Blockhouse, a D-shaped gun position dating from 1539, altered in the 1540s and then adapted to form {{part of a larger}} fortification covering the whole of Pendennis Point in the late 16th century. Built from Killas rubble, the exterior of the blockhouse and its lookout turret still survive intact. Just <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> to the north-east is the Crab Quay Battery, a set of defences originating in the 16th century, intended to prevent an amphibious landing on the headland, and modernised extensively in 1902.|$|E
5|$|At Caimito and Rosario, warehouses, their contents, piers, and wharves {{were all}} driven {{out into the}} {{neighboring}} ocean, and both towns were entirely flattened. The hurricane destroyed all the piers and nearly every building in Cabañas, and of the 23houses built in Cojimar, only seven weathered the storm. A majority of ships at Matanzas were destroyed, with numerous ships capsized or washed aground. Massive waves crashed ashore, crushing buildings and inundating low-lying areas in the city. Many wooden and stone buildings, already impaired by an earlier hurricane in 1844, were immediately destroyed by the surge's impact. Structures <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoreline,</b> in addition to towns along the courses of the Yumurí and San Juan rivers, were driven out to sea. More than forty deaths occurred {{in the first round}} of flooding brought by the storm. At Güines, the tempest wrecked all of the town's residences, public buildings, and businesses, and over a hundred individuals died. Among the losses were two distilleries, a packing plant, a lumbermill, and a warehouse, and countless other buildings, while at Pinar del Río, flooding along mountainsides and nearby rivers swamped the city and other nearby communities.|$|E
