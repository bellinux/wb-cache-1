5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted that performance should not be compromised due to delays in engine development. In a final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen detachable reconnaissance pods on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was a switch from the B-47 style tandem seating to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original tandem seating arrangement with <b>a</b> <b>framed</b> bubble-type canopy.|$|E
50|$|HDLC frames can be {{transmitted}} over synchronous or asynchronous serial communication links. Those links have no mechanism to mark the beginning or end of <b>a</b> <b>frame,</b> so {{the beginning and end}} of each frame has to be identified. This is done by using <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> delimiter, or flag, which is a unique sequence of bits that is guaranteed not to be seen inside <b>a</b> <b>frame.</b> This sequence is '01111110', or, in hexadecimal notation, 0x7E. Each frame begins and ends with <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> delimiter. <b>A</b> <b>frame</b> delimiter at the end of <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> may also mark the start of the next <b>frame.</b> <b>A</b> sequence of 7 or more consecutive 1-bits within <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> will cause the frame to be aborted.|$|R
50|$|The Abington Farm, or Abbington Farm, is a {{historic}} home and farm at Millersville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. The main house is <b>a</b> -story <b>frame,</b> side-passage, double-pile house with additions on both gable ends. The main block dates from about 1840. On the property are several outbuildings, including <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> summer kitchen; <b>a</b> stone and <b>frame</b> ice house; <b>a</b> <b>frame,</b> brick, and stone springhouse/dairy; <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> privy, chicken house, tool shed, and corncrib; <b>a</b> large, elaborate <b>frame</b> stable; and <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> tenant house.|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes <b>a</b> <b>framed</b> photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|On 24 May 1939, the {{prototype}} Re.2000 conducted its maiden flight at Reggio Emilia, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, flown by Mario De Bernardi. According to Cattaneo, early flights had quickly demonstrated the type's favourable flying attitude, including good speed and high manoeuvrability. Only minor modifications were required after the {{successful completion of}} the initial factory flight test programme; these including changes to the exhaust, the lengthening of the carburetor air intake, and {{the replacement of the}} round windshield with <b>a</b> <b>framed</b> counterpart. Following the completion of armament trials at Furbara, Santa Marinella, in August 1939, {{the prototype}} was delivered to the Experimental Estblishment of the Regia Aeronautica to commence its formal evaluation.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>frame</b> is <b>a</b> tight <b>frame</b> if <b>A</b> = B; {{in other}} words, the <b>frame</b> {{satisfies}} <b>a</b> generalized version of Parseval's identity.

This building was originally a residential property, but later became the Hand Inn public house.

25|$|The {{simplest}} kind of vault is {{the barrel}} vault (also called a wagon or tunnel vault), {{which is generally}} semicircular in shape. The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of voussoirs are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by centering consisting of <b>a</b> <b>framed</b> truss with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.|$|E
25|$|Trials of the Hawker Siddeley Andover (the second RAF {{aircraft}} of that name) {{were also}} partially {{carried out at}} RAF Andover. In commemoration of this, Hawker Siddeley presented the Borough of Andover with <b>a</b> <b>framed</b> photo of the aircraft, and the type was also named after RAF Andover. The Andover's main role in RAF service was tactical transport, for which its unique ability to “kneel” - to allow vehicle entry at a shallow angle via a rear ramp – was an asset. Other roles included aero-medical evacuation, STOL, and parachute and 1 ton container drops. The Andover could also be fitted with long-range ferry tanks, which enabled the short-range Andover to fly surprisingly long distances, such as across the Atlantic Ocean. Andovers were still in RAF service for the photo reconnaissance role under the Open Skies Treaty and {{for use by the}} Empire Test Pilots' School until 2012.|$|E
