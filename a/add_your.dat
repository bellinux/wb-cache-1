2500|$|The missionary {{position}} is sometimes mocked as a plain vanilla sex position. Archer stated, [...] "To all the sex gymnasts, {{this kind of}} banal preference looks lazy, unimaginative and uninformed," [...] but she rebuts this by pointing out the existence of variations: [...] "Missionary {{is kind of like}} tofu: You have to <b>add</b> <b>your</b> own flavor." [...] Perhaps due to the ubiquity of this position, its typical role as the first position used by couples, its tendency to put the man in control of speed, tempo and depth, its ability to cause him to quickly reach orgasm, {{and the fact that it}} is literally a [...] "male-superior" [...] position with the man on top, missionary is sometimes associated with men who are dominating and uncreative and selfish about sex. According to Gina Ogden, [...] "the cultural missionary position—man on top" [...] is not conducive to romance since [...] "If a relationship is based on authoritarian control, keeping one person on top and the other underneath, it gets old pretty fast—for both partners, really". In Women Who Love Sex, Ogden writes, [...] "Think what will happen to the missionary position when women, en masse, opt for pleasures that stir body and soul instead of continuing to do good-girl intercourse by the book." [...] In Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, the main character ridicules the idea of women making decisions by saying that one might as well say that the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the baby.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1886, the Society {{received}} strong {{criticism from}} New Zealand. The complaint was that [...] "the society's favours (i.e. the offering of scientific fellowships) {{appear to be}} sown [...]" [...] The complaint was prompted by the following note, sent speculatively from London to likely candidates in the Colonies by the Society."We shall be pleased to <b>add</b> <b>your</b> name {{to the list of}} Fellows of the Society of Science, Letters and Art, of London. We are admitting the principal men of science, letters and art {{from all parts of the}} world. With Sir H.V. Goold's compliments."Auckland Star, 18 October 1886 It was understood that the Society's practice was to send out, along with the above note and the SSLA Journal, a proposal of fellowship already stamped with the acceptance of Goold himself, and with the recipient's name left blank. The Journal stated that in return for an annual subscription of one guinea or a single life membership costing five guineas, 1,000 Foundation Fellowships were not only offered to eminent scientists, but also to anyone merely [...] "engaged in science, literature or art, including music and the fine arts; also to those who are most active in promoting the interests and objects of the society." [...] After the first 1,000 places were filled, an unlimited number of remaining applicants were to be called Ordinary Fellows, and were to pay double the fees. In return for their guineas and for writing their names on the proposal form, members were permitted to append the initials [...] "F.S.Sc." [...] to their names, and to wear gowns and hoods. The conclusion was as follows:"The Society seems, in short, to be founded on the continental system by which the right to use magic letters and titles, usually associated with degrees, can be purchased without examination. Such a system, to our mind, can only have an injurious effect upon true science and art - in the colonies certificates so obtained might be used by unqualified persons to impose upon the public as skilled teachers - and if the Society is earnest in its purposes, and wishes to earn the confidence of the scientific and art world, the sooner it alters its methods the better."Auckland Star, 18 October 1886 In 1892, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans described the Society as [...] "bogus." ...|$|E
