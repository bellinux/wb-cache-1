5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or <b>azathioprine.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, <b>azathioprine,</b> which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent <b>azathioprine</b> may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of <b>azathioprine,</b> methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Other purine analogues such as {{allopurinol}} inhibit xanthine oxidase, {{the enzyme}} that breaks down <b>azathioprine,</b> thus increasing the toxicity of <b>azathioprine.</b> On the other hand, low doses of allopurinol {{have been shown}} to safely enhance the efficacy of <b>azathioprine,</b> especially in inflammatory bowel disease non-responders. This may still lead to lower lymphocyte counts and higher rates of infection, therefore the combination requires careful monitoring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> {{treatment}} {{may lead to}} rare but life-threatening side effects. The rare side effects include leukopenia or pancreatitis. There may also be {{an increased risk of}} lymphoma that is associated with <b>azathioprine</b> or 6-mercaptopurine treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{transplant}} patients, {{skin cancer}} is 50 to 250 times {{more common than}} in the general population, and between 60% and 90% of patients are affected 20 years after transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive medication including <b>azathioprine</b> in organ transplantation {{has been linked to}} increased rates of developing skin cancer. <b>Azathioprine</b> causes the accumulation of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) in patients' DNA, which might trigger cancer when the patient is later exposed to ultraviolet light. Patients taking <b>azathioprine</b> were found to be abnormally sensitive to UVA light.|$|E
25|$|The various {{diseases}} requiring transplantation may {{in themselves}} increase {{the risks of}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, hepatobiliary carcinomas, and mesenchymal tumours to which <b>azathioprine</b> may add additional risks. Those receiving <b>azathioprine</b> for rheumatoid arthritis may have a lower risk than those undergoing transplantation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> {{treatment}} {{is associated with}} an increased risk of lymphoma, but it is unclear if {{this is due to the}} drug or a predisposition related to Crohn's disease. Lower doses of <b>azathioprine</b> are used as a therapy in children with refractory or corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease, without causing many side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> {{can cause}} birth defects. A 2003 {{population-based}} study in Denmark {{showed that the}} use of <b>azathioprine</b> and related mercaptopurine resulted in a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. Birth defects in a child whose father was taking <b>azathioprine</b> have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed. Transplant patients already on this drug should not discontinue on becoming pregnant. This contrasts with the later-developed drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which are contraindicated during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin has now {{replaced}} {{some of the}} <b>azathioprine</b> use due to {{a longer}} survival time, especially in heart-related transplantations. Moreover, despite being considerably more expensive, mycophenolate mofetil is also increasingly being used in place of <b>azathioprine</b> in organ transplantation, as it is associated with less bone marrow suppression, fewer opportunistic infections, and a lower incidence of acute rejection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine,</b> {{also known}} as Imuran (US) or Azasan, which metabolises to 6-MP.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> is a steroid-sparing agent used in {{combination}} with Prednisone. It functions by inhibiting RNA and DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> {{is listed}} by the United States FDA {{as a human}} carcinogen. However, it confers {{considerably}} less morbidity and mortality than corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|In Crohnâ€™s disease, {{treatment}} with <b>azathioprine</b> shortly after diagnosis {{was no more}} likely to result in corticosteroid-free remission than standard care or placebo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> {{is absorbed}} from the gut to about 88%. Bioavailability varies greatly between {{individual}} patients, between 30 and 90%, because {{the drug is}} partly inactivated in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations, counting not only the drug itself but also its metabolites, are reached after one to two hours; and the average plasma half-life is 26 to 80 minutes for <b>azathioprine</b> and three to five hours for drug plus metabolites. 20 to 30% are bound to plasma proteins while circulating in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|In case of organ-threatening disease, pulsed {{intravenous}} cyclophosphamide with steroids is recommended. Once remission {{has been}} achieved, <b>azathioprine</b> and steroids {{can be used}} to maintain remission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> is {{sometimes}} used in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} patients who require a maintenance dose of 15mg or higher of prednisone and those who experience recurrent flares.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane {{systematic}} review that included 13 randomized controlled trials, concluded that <b>azathioprine</b> and 6-mercaptopurine are not effective for inducing remission {{when a person}} has Crohn's Disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of <b>azathioprine</b> and infliximab treatment {{may be more}} effective than a single dose of infliximab to induce steroid-free remission for people with active Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|The use of many {{immunosuppressive}} medications {{increases the}} risk of skin cancer. Cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor for example {{increases the risk}} approximately 200 times, and <b>azathioprine</b> about 60 times.|$|E
25|$|Robert Schwartz {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} 6-MP on the immune response in 1958 and discovered that it profoundly suppresses the formation of antibodies when given to rabbits together with antigens. Following the work done by Sir Peter Medawar and Gertrude Elion in discovering the immunological basis of rejection of transplanted tissues and organs, and Schwartz's researches on 6-MP, Sir Roy Calne, the British pioneer in transplantation, introduced 6-MP as an experimental immunosuppressant for kidney and heart transplants. When Calne asked Elion for related compounds to investigate, she suggested <b>azathioprine,</b> which was subsequently found out to be superior (as effective and less toxic to the bone marrow) by Calne. On 5 April 1962, with regimens consisting of <b>azathioprine</b> and prednisone, the transplantation of kidneys to unrelated recipients (allotransplantation) was successful for the first time. For many years, this kind of dual therapy with <b>azathioprine</b> and glucocorticoids was the standard antirejection regimen, until ciclosporin was introduced into clinical practice (by Calne as well) in 1978.|$|E
25|$|A {{widely used}} therapy for {{idiopathic}} pulmonary fibrosis was <b>azathioprine</b> in combination with prednisone and N-acetylcysteine. A 2012 study showed that there were worse outcomes with this combination than with placebo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> was {{synthesized}} by George Herbert Hitchings and Gertrude Elion in 1957 (named BW57-322) {{to produce}} 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in a metabolically active but masked form, {{and at first}} used as a chemotherapy drug.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are common adverse effects, {{especially at the}} beginning of a treatment. Such cases are met with taking <b>azathioprine</b> after meals or transient intravenous administration. Side effects that are probably hypersensitivity reactions include dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin rashes. Hair loss is often seen in transplant patients receiving the drug, but rarely occurs under other indications. Because <b>azathioprine</b> suppresses the bone marrow, patients can develop anaemia and will be more susceptible to infection; regular monitoring of the blood count is recommended during treatment. Acute pancreatitis can also occur, especially in patients with Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{transplant}} rejection and subsequent damage to the new lung or lungs, patients must take a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs. Patients will normally {{have to take a}} combination of these medicines in order to combat the risk of rejection. This is a lifelong commitment, and must be strictly adhered to. The immunosuppressive regimen is begun just before or after surgery. Usually the regimen includes ciclosporin, <b>azathioprine</b> and corticosteroids, but as episodes of rejection may reoccur throughout a patient's life, the exact choices and dosages of immunosuppressants may have to be modified over time. Sometimes tacrolimus is given instead of ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil instead of <b>azathioprine.</b>|$|E
25|$|When eczema is {{severe and}} does not respond {{to other forms of}} treatment, {{systemic}} immunosuppressants are sometimes used. Immunosuppressants can cause significant side effects and some require regular blood tests. The most commonly used are ciclosporin, <b>azathioprine,</b> and methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is {{responsible}} for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that <b>azathioprine</b> undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme {{is responsible}}, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving <b>azathioprine.</b> In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of <b>azathioprine</b> dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for <b>azathioprine</b> recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced leukopenia through a genome wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} GPA is cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids for remission induction and less toxic immunosuppressants like <b>azathioprine,</b> leflunomide, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{may also help}} prevent relapse. Rituximab may be substituted for cyclophosphamide in inducing remission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> (AZA), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Imuran among others, is an {{immunosuppressive}} medication. It is used in rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and in kidney transplants to prevent rejection. It is taken by mouth or injected into a vein.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> is used {{to prevent}} {{rejections}} of kidney or liver allografts, usually {{in conjunction with other}} therapies including corticosteroids, other immunosuppressants, and local radiation therapy. The administration protocol starts either at the time of transplantation or within the following two days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> is a prodrug, a {{substance}} {{that is not an}} active drug itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first it is slowly and almost completely converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by reductive cleavage of the thioether (â€“Sâ€“). This is mediated by glutathione and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) and thio-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) via thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is methylated. The end products of <b>azathioprine</b> metabolism are thiouric acid (38%) and various methylated and hydroxylated purines, which are excreted via the urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azathioprine</b> is {{synthesized}} from 5-chloro-1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole and 6-mercaptopurine in {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} (DMSO). The {{synthesis of the}} former starts with an amide from methylamine and diethyl oxalate, which is then cyclizised and chlorinated with phosphorus pentachloride; the nitro group is introduced with nitric and sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|Refractory {{ulcerative}} colitis. Patients with toxic megacolon (colonic dilation > 6cm {{and toxic}} appearing) {{who do not}} respond to steroid therapy within 72 hours should be consulted for colectomy. Those with less severe disease but {{do not respond to}} IV steroids within 7â€“10 days should be considered for colectomy or IV cyclosporine. IV cyclosporine at a rate of 2mg/kg/day and if no response in 7â€“10 days, colectomy should be considered. If response is seen, oral cyclosporine at 8mg/kg/day should be continued for 3â€“4 months while 6-MP or <b>azathioprine</b> is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or <b>azathioprine</b> should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking cyclosporine as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP (Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia is advised.|$|E
25|$|Interferon alpha-2a {{may also}} be an {{effective}} alternative treatment, particularly for the genital and oral ulcers as well as ocular lesions. <b>Azathioprine,</b> when used in combination with interferon alpha-2b also shows promise, and colchicine can be useful for treating some genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, and arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{ciclosporin}} in post renal transplantation {{is associated}} with hyperuricemia and, in some cases, gout. This {{is due to the}} decrease in glomerular filtration rate induced by ciclosporin leading to retention of uric acid. Use of <b>azathioprine</b> as an alternative has shown to reduce the incidence of gouty arthritis.|$|E
