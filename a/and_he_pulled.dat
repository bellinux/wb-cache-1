5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull away from Häkkinen. de la Rosa ran into the rear of Alesi at Wurth corner on lap two causing Alesi to retire, with de la Rosa {{sustaining}} a broken front wing and retired after going off at Campsa corner. Further back, Irvine passed Verstappen for twelfth position. The positions at the front were the same for the next sixteen laps with the gap between Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen fluctated from 1.6 seconds to 3.4 seconds while Coulthard and Barrichello battled Ralf Schumacher for third position. Button became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 18 and rejoined in front of Mazzacane. Villeneuve made his pit stop on the 21st lap, which promoted Frentzen into the points-scoring positions. After rejoining the circuit, his car caught fire <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> {{off to the side of}} the track at the exit of Seat corner. Trulli's pit stop, which dropped him to 17th, proved problematic: he stalled his engine which required his mechanics to restart it. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop one lap later and re-emerged in fifth. On lap 24, Michael Schumacher made his pit stop. As he accelerated from his pit box, his rear wheel hit the Ferrari refuller Nigel Stepney who was dragged before being knocked over. Stepney was taken to the circuit's medical center for observation and he was replaced by reserve refuller Andrea Vacari. Coulthard made a pit stop on the same lap and experienced problems with leaving his pit box because he selected second gear and re-emerged behind Ralf Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{realized}} that his job was then on the line, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out all stops to capture the culprits. In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the Chicago office, received a tip on Dillinger's whereabouts that paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed, and killed by Bureau agents outside the Biograph Theater.|$|E
25|$|Alabama Governor George Wallace, an anti-integrationist, {{did well}} in the South (he won every county in the Florida primary) and among alienated and {{dissatisfied}} voters in the North. What might have become a forceful campaign was cut short when Wallace was shot in an assassination attempt by Arthur Bremer on May 15. Wallace was struck by five bullets and left paralyzed from the waist down. The day after the assassination attempt, Wallace won the Michigan and Maryland primaries, but the shooting effectively ended his campaign <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out in July.|$|E

25|$|The eight {{match was}} between Shane Douglas and General Rection in a First Blood Chain {{match for the}} WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. The match began with Rection in control, as he and Douglas {{attempted}} to retrieve the chain. Afterwards, Douglas worked on the legs of Rection {{for a period of}} time until Rection recovered and gained control. In a turn of events, Rection was pushed off a ladder by Douglas, which knocked down the referee, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out a chain from his boots and attacked Rection with it. As the referee recovered, Rection began to bleed and was seen by the referee who called for the bell, declaring Shane Douglas the winner and new WCW United States Champion.|$|E
25|$|Pironi was 15 laps {{from the}} end, {{when he noticed}} a front wheel wobble on his Ligier. He slowed the car to approx 50km/h (30mph) before the wheel came off, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> off the track {{at the end of}} the start/finish {{straight}} to retire, giving Jones the lead. Jones continued to keep a fairly constant distance between himself and second placed Jochen Mass to win the race, with Elio de Angelis, the only other car to be on the lead lap, finishing third. Jean-Pierre Jarier and Emerson Fittipaldi finished in fourth and fifth place respectively, both one lap down. Sixth placed Patrick Gaillard was the last driver to be classified as finishing the race, five laps down after his earlier collision with John Watson's car.|$|E
25|$|Opposition {{to the war}} first {{emerged from}} the New Left and from black leaders such as Martin Luther King. By 1967, however, there was growing {{opposition}} from within liberal ranks, led in 1968 by Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy. After Democratic President Lyndon Johnson announced, in March 1968, {{that he would not}} run for reelection, Kennedy and McCarthy fought each other for the nomination, with Kennedy besting McCarthy in a series of Democratic primaries. Then assassination removed Kennedy from the race and Vice President Hubert Humphrey emerged from the disastrous 1968 Democratic National Convention with the presidential nomination of a deeply divided party. Meanwhile, Alabama governor George Wallace announced his third-party run, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> in many working-class whites in the rural South and big-city North, most of whom had been staunch Democrats. Liberals, led by the labor unions, focused their attacks on Wallace, while Richard Nixon led a unified Republican Party to victory.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after, King {{was another}} retiree as he parked his car two laps after the restart with a {{punctured}} tyre, while Serrallés drove {{slowly to the}} pit lane to replace a dislodged front wing. Further back, Verstappen was moving through the field and up to eleventh position and was drawing closer to Calderón ahead of him for a top-ten placing. At {{the front of the}} race, Rosenqvist was maintaining a lead of over four seconds from Cassidy, with Auer pressuring the struggling New Zealand. However Auer could not take advantage of Cassidy's handicap <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> clear. At the end, Cassidy glanced the wall with the rear-end of his car, and lost time in the track's final sector. Auer slipstreamed up to the rear of Cassidy and temporarily moved into second on lap thirteen. He ran wide at Lisboa corner {{for the third time in}} the event, allowing Cassidy back through to second position. Auer was later able to retake the position later in the lap. Cassidy opted not to challenge Auer and refocused himself on the closing Merhi.|$|E
500|$|On October 8, {{just nine}} {{days after the}} Woodward, Secretariat was moved to turf for the Man O' War Stakes at a {{distance}} of [...] miles. He faced Tentam, who had set a world record for [...] miles on the turf earlier that summer, and five others. [...] Secretariat went to the lead early, followed by Tentam, who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch. Tentam got to within a half-length before Secretariat responded, pulling away by three lengths. Tentam made another run around the far turn, but Secretariat again drew away, eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam, with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third. Secretariat set a course record time of 2:24. After the race, Ron Turcotte explained that [...] "when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> away".|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{continued its}} near-deification {{of the event}} as a defining moment {{in the evolution of}} rock 'n' roll, with Jon Landau declaring, [...] "The Concert for Bangla Desh is rock reaching for its manhood." [...] As for Harrison, [...] "the spirit he creates through his own demeanor is inspirational. From the personal point of view, Concert for Bangla Desh was George's moment. He put it together; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> it off, and for that he deserves the admiration of all of us." [...] To the Rolling Stone writer, the highpoint of the album was the closing [...] "Bangla Desh", whose lyrics were no longer [...] "an expression of intent but of an accomplished mission". Landau had praise for the pacing and professionalism of the entire show, the only [...] "incongruous" [...] moment being Leon Russell's [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash"/"Youngblood" [...] segment, since it was straight from the singer's usual repertoire.|$|E

2500|$|The 1970 Florida Gators {{featured}} All-American {{defensive end}} Jack Youngblood, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> {{off one of}} the most remarkable plays in Florida football history. [...] With Bulldogs leading 17–10 and in possession of the ball at the Gators' two-yard line, Youngblood stood up Georgia back Ricky Lake short of the goal, forced a fumble and fell on the football. [...] "They ran a lead play to my side, and I cut it off", Youngblood said. [...] "I'm standing there holding the ballcarrier and I take the ball away from him, and gave it back to our offense." [...] Gators quarterback John Reaves and wide receiver Carlos Alvarez then connected for two touchdown passes in the final 5:13 to rally the Florida Gators to a 24–17 victory.|$|E
2500|$|Rayment {{moved the}} {{throttle}} forward slowly and released the brakes; the plane began to accelerate, and radio officer Bill Rodgers radioed the control tower {{with the message}} [...] "Zulu Uniform rolling". The plane threw up slush as it gathered speed, and Thain called out the plane's velocity in 10-knot increments. At 85 knots, the port engine began to surge again, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> back marginally on the port throttle before pushing it forward again. Once the plane reached , he announced [...] "V1", at which {{it was no longer}} safe to abort take-off, and Rayment listened for the call of [...] "V2" [...] (...) , the minimum required to get off the ground.

2500|$|During 1977 and 1978, Rundgren {{attempted}} to tour with a true quadraphonic sound system, however it proved ultimately unworkable – despite successfully delivering high-quality sound in a concert setting – {{due to the}} enormous technical requirements involved. Since most concert arenas of the day were ill-equipped to host large towers of sound equipment {{in the rear of}} the halls, the speakers often had to be hung from the ceiling rigging. This installation could take up to two days to complete, meaning that it was necessary to send two separate sound systems, each with its own, complete set-up crew, out on the road, so that they could [...] "leapfrog" [...] and allow Rundgren to play dates on consecutive days, which would have otherwise been impossible. The system featured a then-new technology called [...] "signal analysis", which required white and pink noise to be pumped through the speakers, in order to set the active equalizers so as to minimize feedback and distortion. The pink and white noise analysis had to be performed twice: once with the hall empty, and then again with the audience present, which many concertgoers found annoying. Additionally, Rundgren's insistence on personally overseeing the acoustic set-up of the system left him exhausted and unable to continue, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> the plug on the experiment.|$|E
2500|$|Around 4 p.m, Tyler {{attacked}} Fulkerson and Garnett {{by using}} an unorthodox approach with his brigade in [...] "close column of divisions"—a brigade front of two companies with 48 companies lined up behind them in 24 lines, in all about 75 yards wide, and 400 yards long, a formation difficult to control and lacking offensive power at the front. The Confederates were temporarily able to counter this attack with their inferior numbers by firing fierce volleys from behind the stone wall. Jackson, finally realizing {{the strength of the}} force opposing him, sent out Col. Jesse Burks's brigade, which had been held in reserve, but by the time they arrived around 6 p.m., Garnett's Stonewall Brigade had run out of ammunition <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> them back, leaving Fulkerson's right flank exposed. Panic set in among the Confederates, and as Burks's brigade arrived, it was caught in the fleeing mob and forced to retreat. Jackson tried in vain to rally his troops. He called out to a soldier [...] "Where are you going, man?" [...] The soldier replied that he was out of ammunition. [...] "Then go back and give them the bayonet!" [...] Jackson said. However, the soldier ignored him and kept running. Kimball organized no effective pursuit. That night, a cavalryman sat with Jackson by a campfire alongside the Valley Pike and jokingly said [...] "It was reported that they were retreating, General, but I guess they were retreating after us." [...] Jackson, not known for his sense of humor, replied, [...] "I think I am satisfied, sir." ...|$|E
