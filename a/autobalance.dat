5000|$|Development of Gang Garrison 2 {{began as}} an entry into the [...] TIGSource.com [...] "Bootleg Demake" [...] {{competition}} by mrfredman (art), MedO (programming) and Synnah (music). While it did not win the competition, it later grew in popularity on the sites forum. Initially the game lacked several features and balancing, especially class abilities for the Constructor and the Infiltrator, which caused other developers to decompile the code and update the game without consent. The original development team reacted by merging the unofficial changes and releasing the game under an open source license to allow contribution to the official version and avoid further forks. Version 2.0 was released on February 10, 2009. This version included taunts, new music, maps, and options, various graphical improvements, a spectator mode, <b>autobalance,</b> kill notification, and in-game communication. Version 2.1 was released on May 3, 2009. This version included Control Points, new music, maps, various graphical updates, Demoman [...] "sticky counter", sentry hud, and [...] "superburst", a medic ability very similar to Team Fortress 2s [...] "Ubercharge", and various other smaller tweaks.|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} centrifuge-related {{work performed}} at the Smart Systems Research Laboratory at NASA Ames Research Center's Computational Sciences Division from 1995 through 2003. The goal is to develop an automated system that will sense an imbalance (both static and dynamic 3) in a centrifuge and issue control commands to drive counterweights to eliminate {{the effects of the}} imbalance. This <b>autobalancing</b> development began when the ISS centrifuge design was not yet finalized, and was designed to work with the SSRL Centrifuge laboratory prototype, constructed in 1993 - 1995. Significant differences between that prototype and the current International Space Station (ISS) Centrifuge design are that: the spin axis for the SSRL Centrifuge prototype can translate freely in x and y, but not wobble, whereas the ISS centrifuge spin axis has 3 translational and two rotational degrees of freedom, supported by a vibration 34. The imbalance sensors are strained gauges both in the rotor and the stator, measuring the imbalance forces, whereas the ISS centrifuge uses eddy current displacement sensors to measure the displacements resulting from imbalance. High fidelity <b>autobalancing</b> and FDIR systems (for both counterweights and strain gauges) are developed and tested in MATLAB simulation, for the SSRL Centrifuge configuration. Hardware implementation of the <b>autobalancing</b> technology was begun in 1996, but was terminated due to lack of funding. The project lay dormant until 2001 - 2002 when the FDIR capability was added...|$|R

40|$|A {{calibration}} {{approach is}} proposed {{to compensate the}} systematic errors when the input reflection coefficient of a metallic access network cable is obtained using single port measurements from an access network analyzer. The analyzer is a versatile instrument and uses optimal cable matching and internal balancing to achieve maximum measurement resolution. The analyzer uses test-leads connected to a fixed bridge structure but with an adaptable balance and match impedance and two variable synchronous acquisition channels so that the calibration can be split up into the non-parametric determination of the fixed part and a parametric determination of the variable part. The outcome of the non-parametric calibration are nine frequency dependent coefficients and shows as important side product the <b>autobalance</b> procedure. The parametric calibration will result into two times 35 sets of coefficients of rational functions in the s-domain. The parametric calibration leans on frequency domain system identification where {{the order of the}} numerator and denominator polynomials of the rational functions are not fixed...|$|E

Large quantities of strain gages are installed in inaccessible locations of the missile. These strain gage signals require balance adjustment a few seconds after application of power.

The experimental apparatus is based on a mid-infrared optical parametric oscillator synchronously pumped by a high power Yb:fiber laser, a high finesse broadband cavity, and a fast-scanning Fourier transform spectrometer with <b>autobalancing</b> detection. The comb spectrum with a bandwidth of 200 nm centered around 3. 75 μm is simultaneously coupled to the cavity and both degrees of freedom of the comb, i. e., the repetition rate and carrier envelope offset frequency, are locked to the cavity to ensure stable transmission. The <b>autobalancing</b> detection scheme reduces the intensity noise by a factor of 300, and a sensitivity of 5. 4 × 10 ^- 9 cm^- 1 Hz^- 1 / 2 with a resolution of 800 MHz is achieved (corresponding to 6. 9 × 10 ^- 11 cm^- 1 Hz^- 1 / 2 per spectral element for 6000 resolved elements).

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} hand grinding machine with an <b>autobalancing</b> device has been developed. The scientific statements, conclusions and recommendations {{are based on the}} analysis of the solutions of the movement equations corresponding to the stable balancing conditions of the rotor with the help of balls, by using Puankare - Lyapunov's method. The required capacity of the <b>autobalancing</b> device (ABD) at force and kinematic excitation of oscillations has been determined. The influence of ABD on the wear of the grinding wheel has been determined, the form of the wheel being corrected and its service life being increased for the same efficiency. A possibility of using and the field of efficient application of the ABD of the hand grinding machines have been defined. The theoretical results have been substantiated by the data obtained as a result of numerous experimental studies, {{as well as by the}} serviceability tests of the developed balancing devices and their commercial operation.

Automatic equalizer with torus-shaped adjustment mass moving freely within the autoequalizer's body both circularly and crosswise. Automatic equalizer's torus-shaped form reduces to the minimum the force of resistance when the ball moves, but simultaneously decreases the chance of launching the automatic equalizer in the <b>autobalancing</b> regime. The main task of the research {{is to determine the}} torus-shaped cross-section's size effect on the ball's motion mode.

40|$|The {{principle}} for <b>autobalancing</b> {{by the use}} of balls running freely in a ring concentric with the rotor center has been known for a long time. However, only in recent times has it been used in real machinery, such as grinding machines and laundry machines. By the increased need for higher precision, it is likely to come into use more frequently in the future. This means {{that it is important to}} know its application possibilities better. By using a time averaging technique, it has been possible to find analytical solutions to a number of problems. This article deals with; (1) the case of a rotor with anisotropic bearings and damping, where precise conditions for possible balancing are presented; (2) influence from inaccuracy of balancing ring and a rotor with longitudinal extension and thus having not only a point mass but also a moment of inertia; and (3) using two balancing planes to allow both static and dynamic balancing...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a TDLS-based sensor for determining the temperature of ambient water vapour is described. For the purposes of ground testing, aeroengine intake temperature is typically measured using platinum resistance temperature detectors but under certain conditions these devices become unreliable and an alternative is needed. The sensor requirements are to measure gas temperature over the range of 0 - 40 °C with an absorption path determined by the intake cross section, whilst recording continuously in a harsh environment. Wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) with balanced detection is used to interrogate two water vapour absorption features near 1430 nm. The lines can both be accessed by a single DFB laser current scan, yet have good spectral isolation and temperature sensitivity[1 - 3]. The use of <b>autobalanced</b> noise cancellers[4 - 6] for stand alone two-line ratio thermometry sensors is investigated. When {{used in conjunction with}} second harmonic detection in WMS, the detector bandwidth and dynamic range need to be optimised to ensure any temperature calibration is not susceptible to long-term drift and changing optical conditions. Initial calibration and testing is performed in an environmental chamber with temperature and humidity control...|$|R
40|$|Stimulated Raman {{scattering}} microscopy allows label-free chemical {{imaging and}} has enabled exciting applications in biology, material science and medicine. It provides a major advantage in imaging speed over spontaneous Raman scattering and has improved image contrast and spectral fidelity compared to coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. Wider {{adoption of the}} technique has, however, been hindered by {{the need for a}} costly and environmentally sensitive tunable ultrafast dual-wavelength source. We present the development of an optimized all-fibre laser system based on the optical synchronization of two picosecond power amplifiers. To circumvent the high-frequency laser noise intrinsic to amplified fibre lasers, we have further developed a high-speed noise cancellation system based on voltage-subtraction <b>autobalanced</b> detection.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of vibrations in rotary systems is {{necessary condition for}} the development of constructions with high quality requirements. Among the devices that are able to reduce rotor’s vibrations are automatic balancers with balls, liquid, etc. Autoequalizers with torus-shaped body contain one ball-shaped adjustment mass that can freely roll both in the ring direction and in the cross section. This enables reducing to the minimum the force of resistance at the ball’s moving, but simultaneously decreases the chance of launching the autoequalizer in the <b>autobalancing</b> regime. Experimental researches of the autoequalizer have shown that along with the working state in which the ball stops relative to the rotating body from the opposite to the imbalance side, there is another state in which the ball continuously moves relative to the body of the autoequalizer. It has been stated that the ball in the working state is influenced by forces that are aimed at moving it {{in the body of the}} autoequalizer towards the side opposite to the imbalance. The design of an autoequalizer that ensures working state in which at rotation the ball stops relative to the autoequalizer’s body opposite to the imbalance has been experimentally worked out. The autoequalizer is made up of the mathematical model with two differential equations. In the result of the calculations it has been proved that the ball of an equalizer with the torus-shaped body has at least two movement conditions one of which is a working state, and another one is a spare state...|$|R
40|$|NASA Ames Research Center is {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Space Station Biological Research Project (SSBRP) which will support non-human life sciences research on the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA). The SSBRP is designed to support both basic research to understand the effect of altered gravity fields on biological systems and applied research to investigate the effects of space flight on biological systems. The SSBRP will provide the necessary habitats to support avian and reptile eggs, cells and tissues, plants and rodents. In addition a habitat to support aquatic specimens will be provided by our international partners. Habitats will be mounted in ISSA compatible racks at u-g and will also be mounted on a 2. 5 m diameter centrifuge except for the egg incubator which has an internal centrifuge. The 2. 5 m centrifuge will provide artificial gravity levels over the range of 0. 01 G to 2 G. The current schedule is to launch the first rack in 1999, the Life Sciences glovebox and a second rack early in 2001, a 4 habitat 2. 5 in centrifuge later the same year in its own module, and to upgrade the centrifuge to 8 habitats in 2004. The rodent habitats will be derived from the Advanced Animal Habitat currently under development for the Shuttle program and will be capable of housing either rats or mice individually or in groups (6 rats/group and at least 12 mice/group). The egg incubator will be an upgraded Avian Development Facility also developed for the Shuttle program through a Small Business and Innovative Research grant. The Space Tissue Loss cell culture apparatus, developed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, is being considered for the cell and tissue culture habitat. The Life Sciences Glovebox is crucial to all life sciences experiments for specimen manipulation and performance of science procedures. It will provide two levels of containment between the work volume and the crew through the use of seals and negative pressure. The glovebox will accommodate use by two crew persons simultaneously and the capability for real time video down-link and data acquisition. In house testbeds and Phase B studies of the centrifuge validated the concepts of vibration isolation and <b>autobalancing</b> systems to meet the ISSA microgravity requirements. The vibration isolation system is effective above the centrifuge rotation frequency while the <b>autobalancing</b> system on the rotor removes vibration at and below the rotation rate. Torque of the Station, induced by spin-up/spindown of the centrifuge, can be minimized by controlling spin-up/spin-down rates. The SSBRP and ISSA will provide the opportunity to perform long-term, repeatable and high quality science. The long duration increments available on the Station will permit multigeneration studies of both plants and animals which have not previously been possible. The u-g habitat racks and the eight habitat centrifuge will accommodate sufficient number of specimens to permit statistically significant sampling of specimens to investigate the time course of adaptation to altered gravity environments. The centrifuge will, for the first time, permit investigators to use gravity itself as a tool to investigate fundamental processes, to investigate the intensity and duration of gravity to maintain normal structure and function, to separate the effects of u-g from other environmental factors and to examine artificial gravity as a potential countermeasure for the physical deconditioning observed during space flight...|$|R
40|$|ISO 8662 - 4, Hand-held {{portable}} {{power tools}} - Measurement of vibrations at the handle - Part 4 : Grinders is under revision. The new revision shall harmonize ISO 20643 Mechanical vibration - Hand-held and hand-guided machinery - Principles {{for evaluation of}} vibration emission which, among others, requires measurements in three directions and declared values related to the upper quartile of real-use vibration. To get the most suitable test method, a round robin test was made for evaluation of the two test methods proposed by the ad-hoc group working with this standard revision. Methods Seven laboratories measured the vibration from four grinders of different sizes, with and without <b>autobalancing</b> units. The laboratories come from universities, health & safety laboratories and grinder manufacturers. Two measurement methods are evaluated with respect to repeatability and reproducibility: 1. Grinding on a well-defined mild steel bar with depressed center wheels according to detailed test instructions. The test sequence starts and ends with 10 seconds of running the grinder in the air, when measuring the unbalance contribution to the vibration coming from the unbalance of the grinding wheel. Between these runs the average vibration during 60 seconds of grinding is measured. Three operators do five grinding tests per grinder. 2. Measurements using an aluminum unbalance disc {{similar to the one}} defined in ISO 8662 - 4. Each operator runs the grinder four times, between each run the unbalance is moved 180 degrees to avoid variations caused by the play between the test wheel and the spindle. The averaging time is 10 seconds. Each grinder is tested by three operators. Repeatability is the spread within a lab between operators and over short time period for one machine and reproducibility is the spread between laboratories and over longer time periods for one machine. Instrumentation and transducer location are chosen according to ISO 8662 - 4 and circulated test instructions. Results Both the repeatability and reproducibility is poor for the real grinding test, see figure 1. The coefficient of variation for repeatability is approximately 40 % higher for the grinding test and the coefficient of reproducibility is 60 % higher for the grinding test than for the unbalance disc test...|$|R
