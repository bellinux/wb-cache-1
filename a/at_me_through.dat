2500|$|Kerouac was {{demoralized}} by {{criticism of}} Dharma Bums from such respected {{figures in the}} American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers Ruth Fuller Sasaki and Alan Watts. [...] He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with D. T. Suzuki, that [...] "even Suzuki was looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> slitted eyes as though I was a monstrous imposter." [...] He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to Philip Whalen, [...] "I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit. [...] I'm not a Buddhist any more." [...] In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's cafe recitation, Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul: [...] "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light." [...] Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.|$|E
60|$|The {{physician}} {{shook his}} head, gazing <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> his glasses.|$|E
60|$|Grosse's eyes glared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> his {{spectacles}} with a {{dignity and}} gravity worthy of Mr. Finch himself.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bolder glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> distrustfully <b>through</b> his spectacles.|$|R
60|$|My friend looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{significantly}} <b>through</b> {{his cigarette}} smoke, and shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Again the {{old woman}} looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> intently <b>through</b> her spectacles; then, as if her mind was made up to confide in our honesty, she disburthened it of its secrets.|$|R
60|$|I stopped, {{and looked}} up at Giuliana. She smiled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> unshed tears that {{magnified}} her matchless eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} smile <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> her tears. We were in the old sitting-room, {{surrounded}} by the books.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you hear}} what I say? I hear the boy as plainly as you hear me. The voice screams <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the clear moonlight, as it screamed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the sea-fog. Again and again. It's all round the house. That way now, where the light just touches {{on the tops of}} the heather. Tell the {{servants}} to have the horses ready the first thing in the morning. We leave Vange Abbey to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling again <b>through</b> her tears, {{and shook}} her head a little.|$|R
6000|$|The {{man looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> gravely <b>through</b> {{the smoke of}} his pipe, and said, [...] "You're in a passion, my young buck, that's all; and, in case you didn't know it, I thought I'd tell ye." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....Lou's sallow skin {{almost as}} whitish yellow as his hair, whole face and frame so transcendently {{emaciated}} he had indeed become insectival. His eyes were rusty, two copper coins lying in desert sands {{under the sun}} all day with telephone wires humming overhead, but he looked straight <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Maybe <b>through</b> me..." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Hans awoke, {{and sitting}} up, stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the bright flame which I had {{recently}} fed with dry wood.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense. Once I {{heard you}} playing scales in the drawing-room, and once I {{positively}} saw you peeping <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the curtains.' ...|$|E
60|$|The grave {{face of a}} not too {{recently}} washed angel peeps shyly <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the railings, then, as I turn my head, darts {{back and}} disappears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, if I only could!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{could have}} once. But now I'm afraid--afraid of getting lost." [...] Slowly she {{straightened}} up, her hands falling into her lap. I seized them again, I {{was on my}} knees in front of her, before the fire, and she, intent, looking down <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> into <b>me,</b> <b>through</b> <b>me</b> it seemed--at something beyond which yet was me.|$|R
60|$|He {{waited until}} Gabriel, with a last frightened glance <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> had passed <b>through</b> the gap, {{and then he}} turned upon me with an {{expression}} so murderous that I stepped back a pace or two, and tightened my grasp upon my oak stick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you needn't play innocent," [...] snarled Aaron Poole. [...] "You just fired a shot <b>at</b> <b>me!</b> It went <b>through</b> my buggy top." [...] And the money-lender {{pointed to}} the back road, where stood his horse and carriage. [...] "Nice doings, I must say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You put me out, {{standing}} there staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> your horrid spectacles!" [...] she said irritably. [...] "Don't look at me, and I {{will tell you}} directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Terrified at {{the effect}} which her attempt at {{explanation}} produced on Percy, helplessly ignorant {{when she was}} called upon to account for her daughter's absence, Mrs. Bowmore could only shed tears and express a devout trust in Providence. Her husband looked at the new misfortune from a political point of view. He sat down and slapped his forehead theatrically {{with the palm of}} his hand. [...] "Thus far," [...] said the patriot, [...] "my political assailants have only struck <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the newspapers. Now they strike <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> my child!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I do suppose, now,' said Mr. Peggotty, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> {{the smoke}} of his pipe, 'that {{in the way of}} book-larning he'd take the wind out of a'most anything.' ...|$|E
60|$|Whilst I was talking, I was {{conscious}} {{that the new}} tenant of Cloomber Hall was peering <b>at</b> <b>me</b> very closely <b>through</b> the darkness. As I concluded, he stretched out a long, tremulous arm, and turned the gig-lamp {{in such a way}} as to throw a flood of light upon my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou knowest naught of it, Mopo?" [...] {{said the}} king. And again he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> terribly <b>through</b> the reek of the fire. [...] "Thou knowest naught of it, Mopo? Surely thou art a-cold; thy hands shake with cold. Nay, man, fear not--warm them, warm them, Mopo. See, now, plunge that hand of thine {{into the heart}} of the flame!" [...] And he pointed with his little assegai, the assegai handled with the royal wood, to where the fire glowed reddest--ay, he pointed and laughed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{wiped his}} lips, using the napkin with indignation, and looking <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It flashed <b>through</b> my {{mind in the}} midst of my {{depression}} that if all the meat in the town was like these table d'hote chops, Falk wasn't so far wrong. I was on the point of saying this, but Schomberg's stare was intimidating. [...] "He's a vegetarian, perhaps," [...] I murmured instead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blodgett {{was driving}} {{in some of}} Tyner's calves, and I caught him. I told him what I thought of him, and he shot <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> his pocket. That was all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me you don't suspect why we want to get you out of our place here?" [...] said the man, looking in distrustfully <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is it? Who is it?" [...] he exclaimed, {{blinking}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> {{a pair of}} horn spectacles. [...] "Who {{comes to}} disturb our solitude, the solitude of the holy Lamas of the Mountains?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan {{called out}} my name I really cannot tell how I ever {{got up on}} that platform. I felt as if a million eyes were looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and <b>through</b> <b>me,</b> and for one dreadful moment I was sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, Diana. So I started in, and my voice {{seemed to be coming}} from ever so far away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced those recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never {{have been able to get}} through. Did I groan all right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I'm {{not sure}} that that man had {{anything}} to do with it," [...] went on Songbird. [...] "But he was the only fellow around who seemed to notice me when I got the money. When the bills were passed over to me, there were forty one-hundred-dollar bills. I took them to a little side stand, to place them in a wallet Mr. Sanderson had lent me, and then I wrapped the wallet in a piece of paper with a stout string around it. As I did this I noticed the man who stuttered and whistled peering <b>at</b> <b>me</b> hungrily <b>through</b> a side window of the bank." ...|$|R
60|$|In any by-time Alan {{must teach}} me to use my sword, for my ignorance had much distressed him; and I think besides, as I had {{sometimes}} the upper hand {{of him in the}} fishing, he was not sorry to turn to an exercise where he had so much the upper hand of me. He made it somewhat more of a pain than need have been, for he stormed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> all <b>through</b> the lessons in a very violent manner of scolding, and would push me so close that I made sure he must run <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the body. I was often tempted to turn tail, but held my ground for all that, and got some profit of my lessons; if it was but to stand on guard with an assured countenance, which is often all that is required. So, though I could never in the least please my master, I was not altogether displeased with myself.|$|R
60|$|As I rose {{to my feet}} {{the first}} thing I saw was the {{malignant}} countenance of Issus glaring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the heavy bars of a grated door at {{one side of the}} chamber.|$|E
60|$|He beamed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> his glasses. The sententious use of long words was {{a playful}} habit with him, {{that and a}} slight {{deliberate}} humour, habits occasional Extension Lecturing was doing very much to intensify.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish to {{look about}} the store? Oh, oh, by all means, sir," [...] he said. Then as {{he rubbed his}} hands {{together}} in an urbane fashion he directed a piercing glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>through</b> his spectacles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pugh's a {{straight}} man," [...] retorted Perry. [...] "That's more than I {{can say for}} any of the other gang, saving your presence. The unpleasant truth is that Scherer and the Boyne people want the Ribblevale, and you ought to know it if you don't." [...] He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> very hard <b>through</b> the glasses he had lately taken to wearing. Tom, who was lounging by the fire, shifted his position uneasily. I smiled, and took another cigar.|$|R
6000|$|She {{lifted her}} veil and smiled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> brightly <b>through</b> her tears. [...] "Yes," [...] she said; [...] "come to-morrow and be {{introduced}} to my mother. Oh! how glad my dear mother will be to see you, when I tell her what has happened! I am a selfish wretch; I have not borne my sorrow and suspense as I ought; I have made her miserable about me, because I was miserable about Fritz. It's all over now. Thank you again and again. There is our address on that card. No, no, we must say good-bye till to-morrow. My mother is waiting for her letter; and Mr. Keller is wondering what has become of you." [...] She pressed my hand warmly and left me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, did he. He ran <b>at</b> <b>me</b> ere I could draw, {{like the}} coward he is, sink him, and had <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the {{shoulder}} in the twinkling of an eye." ...|$|R
