40|$|Abstract. A cDNA of the 30 -terminus of {{classical}} <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (LPC vaccine strain) was cloned and sequenced. The 3431 nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequences {{were compared with}} those of other pestiviruses, and the similarity of nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences were found to be 84 – 95 % and 95 – 98 %, respectively. Similar to other isolates {{of classical}} <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus, the sequenced region included the non-structural gene p 58 (NS 5 A) and part of p 76 (NS 5 B) gene. The p 76 gene of LPC vaccine strain also contained a highly conserved motif G-D-D (Gly-Asp-Asp) that is present in the RNA replicase of positive-stranded RNA viruses. With the sequence data currently available, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis and obtained a genealogical relationship among members of the classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus.

2500|$|On Duvalier's {{death in}} April 1971, power passed to his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as [...] "Baby Doc"). Under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's {{economic}} and political condition continued to decline, {{although some of the}} more fearsome elements of his father's regime were abolished. Foreign officials and observers also seemed more tolerant toward Baby Doc, in areas such as human-rights monitoring, and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The United States restored its aid program in 1971. In 1974, Baby Doc expropriated the Freeport Tortuga project and this caused the venture to collapse. Content to leave administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovid Duvalier, while living as a playboy, Jean-Claude enriched himself through a series of fraudulent schemes. Much of the Duvaliers' wealth, amounting to {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} over the years, came from the Régie du Tabac (Tobacco Administration), a tobacco monopoly established by Estimé, which expanded to include the proceeds from all government enterprises and served as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept. His marriage, in 1980, to a beautiful mulatto divorcée, Michèle Bennett, in a $3million ceremony, provoked widespread opposition, as it was seen as a betrayal of his father's antipathy towards the mulatto elite. At the request of Michèle, Papa Doc's widow Simone was expelled from Haiti. Baby Doc's kleptocracy left the regime vulnerable to unanticipated crises, exacerbated by endemic poverty, most notably the epidemic of <b>African</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus—which, at the insistence of USAID officials, led to the slaughter of the creole pigs, the principal source of income for most Haitians; and the widely publicized outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s. Widespread discontent in Haiti began in 1983, when Pope John Paul II condemned the regime during a visit, finally provoking a rebellion, and in February 1986, after months of disorder, the army forced Duvalier to resign and go into exile.|$|E

40|$|All EU {{member states}} share a {{strategy}} consisting of prompt detection, eradication and limiting {{the spread of}} classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> within the entire community. Implementation of the strategy requires a sufficient level of readiness in the member states. Reaching a sufficient state of readiness requires identifying how widely spread a possible classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> epidemics are within individual member states. In 2002, the Food and Health Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry asked the National Veterinary and Food Research Institute {{to carry out a}} risk assessment of the consequences of a possible classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> epidemic within Finnish territory. Models simulating the spread and detection of classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> were built and used to produce values with the help of which the final assessment figures were reached. According to the results it is unlikely that a classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> infection in a Finnish production pig farm would lead to an eruption of an epidemic; more than likely, the infection would remain an isolated, sporadic case. The probability of an epidemic outbreak in Finland is 0. 46 and the most likely source would be in the concentrated pig farm regions in South West Finland or South Ostrobothnia. Most probably, the epidemic would be contained to these regions leaving {{the rest of the country}} free of infection. Upon spreading, it is most likely that two to four farms would be infected. Even at its most widespread, the infection would probably be confined to fewer than 15 farms.
