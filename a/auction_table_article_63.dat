We propose an econometric method that exploits data from <b>auction</b> <b>tables</b> and we determine variables influencing the shape of market bid functions and their fluctuations across auctions.

Second, we measure, by simulations, the impact of different environments on auction rates. Third, we provide new empirical perspectives on {{the debate about the}} best procedure between the discriminatory and the uniform price auctions. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
