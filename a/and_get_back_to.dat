500|$|While {{working on}} Nimrod, Green Day {{explained}} to Cavallo {{their desire to}} create a more experimental album as the band had grown tired of its traditional three chord song structure. [...] Armstrong drew inspiration from The Clash's landmark record London Calling, and referred to Nimrod as [...] "the record I've wanted to make since the band started." [...] The album was intended to break the constraints of typical punk rock music. [...] To preserve the quality of his songwriting, Armstrong began writing each song on acoustic guitar, to which the rest of the band would later add heavier instrumentation and faster tempos. [...] Green Day recorded around 30 songs for Nimrod and picked 18 of them for the record. Dirnt explained that the recording was much more loosely structured than previous albums, and that creating songs was the focus as opposed to making a cohesive record. [...] He observed, [...] "We've always screwed around with different types of music during our jams, but we'd say, 'OK let's stop <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the album.'

500|$|Kohli {{and other}} senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh {{ahead of the}} England tour. India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading it 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series {{averaging}} just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39. He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging {{the ball to the}} wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times, while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers. Geoffrey Boycott said, [...] "Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He is playing with his bat too far away from his pad. He has to look at video replays of his technique <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> basics". India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings. In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour. India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{after having}} {{wrestled}} with other partners, including {{a stint as}} The Internationals with Karl Von Brauner, Costello decided {{that he wanted to}} reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. He got in touch with a friend from Great Britain, Tinker Todd, and asked him to be his new partner and reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. Todd agreed, taking the name [...] "Ray St. Clair" [...] and adopting an [...] "Australian" [...] persona. George [...] "Crybaby" [...] Cannon had managed Costello and Von Brauner when they wrestled as The Internationals, and he was brought in to be The Kangaroos new manager. Not long after Costello and St. Clair hit the circuit, they captured both gold and the hatred of the crowd, just like the original Kangaroos. A couple of months after reforming, Costello and St. Clair won the NWA Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Fred Curry and Billy Red Lyons, but lost the titles to Fred Curry and Dan Miller a few weeks later. Costello and St. Clair showed the same gift for riling up the fans as Costello and Heffernan had and even caused their own share of riots. One particular event in Cincinnati, Ohio saw the predominantly African American crowd start a riot after The Kangaroos spat {{in the eye of the}} African American Bobo Brazil during a match. The crowd rushed towards the ring when a fan fell from the balcony, causing a diversion that enabled Costello and St. Clair to escape the ring <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their dressing room. When fans started to break down the door to the dressing room, The Kangaroos ducked out the back, ran down an alley and hid in a half full dumpster overnight. The next morning when The Kangaroos returned to their car, they found all four tires slashed. Despite the success of the new version of The Fabulous Kangaroos, the Costello / St. Ray team did not last more than six tumultuous months. St. Clair missed his native Britain and was suffering from a debilitating knee injury that meant he had to retire from wrestling altogether.|$|E
