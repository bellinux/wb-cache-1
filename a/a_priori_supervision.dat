40|$|High-throughput biomolecular {{profiling}} {{techniques such}} as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are increasingly being used in in vivo studies to recognize and characterize effects of xenobiotics on organs and systems. Of particular interest are biomarkers of treatment-related effects which are detectible in easily accessible biological fluids such as blood. A fundamental challenge in such biomarker studies is selecting among the plethora of biomolecular changes induced by a compound and revealed by molecular profiling, to identify biomarkers which are exclusively or predominantly due to specific processes. In this work we present a cross-compartment correlation network approach, involving no <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> <b>supervision</b> or design, to integrate proteomic, metabolomic and transcriptomic data for selecting circulating biomarkers. The case study we present is the identification of biomarkers of drug-induced hepatic toxicity effects in a rodent model. Biomolecular profiling of both blood plasma and liver tissue from Wistar Hannover rats administered a toxic compound yielded many hundreds of statistically significant molecular changes. We exploited drug-induced correlations between blood plasma analytes and liver tissue molecules across study animals in order to nominate selected plasma molecules as biomarkers of drug-induced hepatic alterations of lipid metabolism and urea cycle processes.

40|$|Abstract The {{distinction}} between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori knowledge {{has been the}} subject of an enormous amount of discussion, but the literature is biased against recognizing the intimate relationship between these forms of knowledge. For instance, it seems to be almost impossible to find a sample of pure <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> or <b>a</b> posteriori knowledge. In this paper, it will be suggested that distinguishing between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori is more problematic than is often suggested, and that <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori resources are in fact used in parallel. We will define this relationship between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori knowledge as the bootstrapping relationship. As we will see, this relationship gives us reasons to seek for an altogether novel definition of <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori knowledge. Specifically, we will have to analyse the relationship between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> knowledge and <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> reasoning, and it will be suggested that the latter serves as a more promising starting point for the analysis of aprioricity. We will also analyse a number of examples from the natural sciences and consider the role of <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> reasoning in these examples. The focus of this paper is the analysis of the concepts of <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori knowledge rather than the epistemic domain of a posteriori and <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> justification. ...|$|R

40|$|Roughly speaking, <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> {{knowledge}} is {{knowledge that is}} independent of introspection and sensory experience. But is there any such knowledge? Many philosophers believe that W. V. Quine says or implies that there is not. For example, Laurence BonJour claims that ”Quine […] rejects {{the very existence of}} <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> justification”, 1 and Hartry Field says that according to Quine ”there is no <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> knowledge at all, not even in logic and mathematics”. 2 I shall argue, on the contrary, that there is indeed <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> justification and that this is quite consistent with Quine’s philosophy. How do we know that we know things a posteriori? Quine would say that we know this a posteriori; it is something that is supported by empirical science. 3 It is justified by our ordinary standards of justification. So perhaps all {{knowledge is}} a posteriori. But, if so, how do we know this? Clearly, we cannot know <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> that we cannot know anything <b>a</b> <b>priori.</b> But this can perhaps be known <b>a</b> <b>priori.</b> If so, there is <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> knowledge. 1. EMPIRICISM BEFORE QUINE Earlier empiricists thought that there is <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> knowledge, for example in logic and mathematics. But they held that we could only know <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> what is expressed by so-called analytic propositions – and that logical and mathematical propositions are analytic. A proposition is analytic, according to A. J. Ayer, ”if it is true solely in virtue of the meaning of its constituent symbols”. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{whether there}} is a tenable {{distinction}} between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> justification and <b>a</b> posteriori justification. My research considers three possible conceptions of a priori: (1) Justification Independent of Experience, (2) Mere Meaning Based Justification and (3) Justification by Rational Insight, and examines whether they can provide a sound and significant distinction between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori. This thesis contains five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the background knowledge of the a priori/a posteriori distinction. Chapter 2 analyzes the traditional conception of <b>a</b> <b>priori,</b> i. e. justification independent of experience, and considers whether the distinction based on it is tenable. Five approaches for defining “experience” are examined, but none of them succeed in providing a distinction between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori. Chapter 3 focuses on the empiricist conception of the <b>a</b> <b>priori,</b> i. e. <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> as mere meaning based justification, and argues that the distinction based on it has a problem of classification. Chapter 4 concerns the rationalist conception of the <b>a</b> <b>priori,</b> i. e. <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> as justification by rational insight, and argues that neither the idea of justification by rational insight itself nor the distinctive features of rational insight could provide a distinction between <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> and <b>a</b> posteriori.
