5|$|Although Geastrum quadrifidum {{has a wide}} distribution, it is not {{a common}} species. European {{countries}} from which the fungus has been reported include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. In Asia, it has been collected in China and Japan. The North American distribution extends from Canada south to Mexico, and includes Hawaii. It is also found in Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, and South <b>America.</b> <b>Because</b> of its rarity, it has been placed on the Regional Red Lists of several European countries, including Montenegro, Denmark, Norway, and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Rainy Lobe of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} was {{the most}} recent of the glaciation events, and it retreated about 10,000years ago. Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement. This direction is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges. The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock lakes in North <b>America</b> <b>because</b> their long axes lie transverse to the general movement of the glaciers.|$|E

There is an obvious dissatisfaction with society, yet he still approves of the society as a whole. Howell makes it clear that Altruria's society is better than <b>America's</b> <b>because</b> of its lack of money and class. The belief is that if men acknowledge their commonalities and work for each other, they will dispense with differences of rank and class. He believes that men should treat each other as equals.

The Japanese licensor of the series refused {{to allow it to}} be published in North <b>America,</b> <b>because</b> it was thought that Americans might take offense to it.|$|E
5|$|In South America, dire wolves {{have been}} dated younger than 17,000 YBP and {{reported}} from only three localities: Muaco in Falcón state, Venezuela; Talara Province in Peru; and Tarija Department in Bolivia. If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South <b>America</b> <b>because</b> of the favorable cool, dry, and open habitats {{that characterized the}} region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of tropical rain forest.|$|E
5|$|Players have {{discovered}} that {{the cover of the}} North American Wii version of Ōkami includes a watermark from IGN, and traced the source to an image taken from IGN's site. To make up for the error, Capcom offered for a limited time to replace the cover with one of three high-resolution covers free of charge to users in North <b>America.</b> <b>Because</b> of delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered.

25|$|It {{would have}} been problematic, in any case, for the British to {{continue}} the war in North <b>America</b> <b>because</b> of Napoleon's escape from Elba on February 26, 1815, which ensured their forces were needed in Europe. Also, since the Treaty of Ghent did not specifically mention the vast territory America had acquired with the Louisiana Purchase, it only required both sides to give back those lands that {{had been taken from}} the other during the war.|$|E
25|$|Manitoba Hydro {{is unusual}} in North <b>America</b> <b>because</b> it is the sole {{commercial}} provider of electrical power {{in the province of}} Manitoba. It is a Crown corporation closely regulated by the Provincial government. This status arose because of the history of electrification in the Province, where early private commercial developers required a large initial return on investment owing to the high risks of the projects. This limited the economic benefits that electrification would bring. Manitoba Hydro is required by its regulating legislation to give priority to public benefit over profit.|$|E

25|$|In 1935 the Scheinbergs {{returned}} to <b>America</b> <b>because</b> his American citizenship would have expired {{after more than}} five years abroad. Soon after his return, Scheinberg was offered the position of mashgiach ruchani (spiritual supervisor) of the Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Queens founded by Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz. He served in that position for 25 years until leaving to open his own yeshiva, Torah Ore. Scheinberg was known for the warm and caring relationship he developed with his students, and for the kindnesses he and his wife did for neighbors and visitors in their small apartment. Often their daughters slept two to a bed to make room for unexpected guests. During this time, Scheinberg also became the Rav of Congregation Bakash Shalom Anshei Ostrov on the Lower East Side, where he gave Torah lectures to working men.|$|E
25|$|The period {{beginning}} in 1990 marked {{a shift in}} the politics of Mexico which would change the country from the hegemonic control of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In 1989, the first governorship in the country in 60 years, passed from the PRI to a National Action Party (PAN) candidate. That event was followed in 1997 by PRI's loss of control of the lower house and in 2000, loss of the presidency. The impact that end of the virtual one-party-rule would have on women in Mexico was an open question. 1990 also saw the birth of Debate Feminista (Feminist Debate) a publication founded by Marta Lamas and aimed connecting academic feminist theory with the practices of activists in the women’s movement. Debate {{has become one of the}} most important journals in Latin <b>America,</b> <b>because</b> it also prints articles written by men.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 2008, {{members of}} UE Local 1110 at Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago, when the plant closed {{with only three}} days notice to the employees, {{occupied}} the plant in protest of the closing and company's failure to pay employees their accrued vacation pay, and payments required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The WARN Act requires 60 days notice of a plant closing, or 60 days pay if timely notice is not given. The workers' action drew extensive media coverage and attracted wide support, including from US President-elect Barack Obama, and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich banned state business with Bank of <b>America,</b> <b>because</b> the bank's cancellation of the company's line of credit had prompted the shutdown. Protest demonstrations at Bank of America branches took place in dozens of US cities during the sit-in. On December 10 the union members voted to end the occupation after Republic, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and the union negotiated a settlement that paid each worker eight weeks wages, plus all accumulated vacation pay, and health insurance for two months.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mayflower {{passenger}} list, {{just over}} a third of the passengers were Puritan Separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Others were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of Mayflower pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618. Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council. In 1959, it was conclusively shown that the four More children were sent to <b>America</b> <b>because</b> they were deemed illegitimate. Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, but Richard lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish–American War in 1898, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. US {{military}} authorities discussed Puerto Rico's military value. It offered tremendous commercial value in expanding commerce among the US, Central and South <b>America.</b> <b>Because</b> {{of the political}} changes {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century, the strategic military importance of Puerto Rico grew. In 1906, a group of Puerto Ricans met with the Governor Winthrop, and the Commissioner of Interior, Lawrence H. Graham, to organize a National Guard of Puerto Rico. The public supported this effort and some companies were organized, in different towns around the island: Yauco under the command of Captain Santiago Vivaldi; Juana Díaz, commanded by Captain Diaz-Brik; Peñuelas by Captain Gabino Balasquide; and two in Ponce by Pedro Juan Armstrong, Mario Belaval, J. Oppenheimer, F. del Valle and Doctor Laguna. In San Juan three companies were organized under Federico Vall-Spinosa, Justo Barros, J. del Barril, R. Swigett, J. Doere, Lugo Vinas and F. Fano. As the companies were being formed, all of the officers and soldiers had to purchase their own uniforms and supplies, since there was no government funding for the enterprise. This organization failed due to existing US federal law, which prohibited the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without authorization from Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} New Orleans {{contrasts}} significantly with {{the histories of}} other cities that {{became part of the}} Confederate States of <b>America.</b> <b>Because</b> it was founded by the French and owned by Spain for a time, New Orleans had a more cosmopolitan culture and diverse population. Only 13 percent of the 1810 population was Anglo-American. The census population of that time was made up of mostly French speaking refugees from the Haitian Revolution, the French and Indian War, and French and Spanish Creoles along with some smuggled slaves. New Orleans also benefited more by the Industrial Revolution, international trade, and geographical position. Its position by the mouth of the Mississippi River, which drained {{an important part of the}} United States, made New Orleans one of the most significant transportation centers in the early United States before the establishment of railroad and road systems. Of particular significance were the inventions of the steamboat and the cotton gin. Before the steamboat, keelboat men bringing cargo downriver would break up their boats for lumber in New Orleans and travel overland back to Ohio or Illinois to repeat the process. Steamboats had enough power to move upstream against the current of the Mississippi, making two-way trade possible between New Orleans and the cities in the interior river network. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, which greatly expanded international trade, and the development of the cotton gin, cotton became a valuable export product, adding to the volume of cargo moved through the city.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the name [...] "antlion" [...] is uncertain.

The antlion larva is often called a [...] "doodlebug" [...] in North <b>America</b> <b>because</b> of the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating, which look as if someone has been doodling.|$|E
