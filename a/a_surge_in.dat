5|$|In the Late Classic {{the site}} {{appears to have}} {{recovered}} from its earlier defeat. Naranjo-style ceramics diminished greatly in quantity and there was <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> new large-scale construction. Many monuments broken by the conquerors were re-erected at this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of shoe polish paralleled a general rise in leather and synthetic shoe production, {{beginning in the}} 19th century and continuing into the 20th. The World Wars saw <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> demand for the product, in order to polish army boots.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to female political figures, Traister also discusses {{women in the}} media who played influential roles in the election coverage. These include Rachel Maddow, whose political commentary led to <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> her popularity; television journalist Katie Couric, who led a critical interview with Sarah Palin; and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who parodied Palin and Clinton, respectively, in several Saturday Night Live skits.|$|E

5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century and led to <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo {{program also}} {{affected}} environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos {{taken by the}} astronauts. The most famous, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts, is The Blue Marble. This image, which was released during <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> environmentalism, {{became a symbol of}} the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.|$|E
5|$|The {{reforms of}} Djedkare Isesi played an {{important}} role in flourishing of the arts during the later Old Kingdom, as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king. This created <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the number of commissions leading to a general improvement of the artistic works. This also provided the artisans with a new wealth, which they used to build their own large funerary complexes.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|During {{the general}} election, Humphrey faced former Vice President Richard Nixon of New York, the Republican Party nominee. Nixon led in most polls {{throughout}} the campaign, and successfully criticized Humphrey's role in Vietnam, connecting {{him to the}} unpopular president and the general disorder in the nation. Humphrey experienced <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the polls in the days prior to the election, largely due to incremental progress {{in the peace process}} in Vietnam and a break with the Johnson war policy, but was defeated by Nixon on Election Day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack}} of maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much of their time to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E

The song charted within the top ten, peaking at number six, on the Billboard Hot Digital Songs on July 11, due to digital download sales. The song debuted on Swedish charts at number 30 on July 3, and peaked at number 24 the following week. On July 4, the song re-entered the United Kingdom charts at number 47, and peaked at number 34 the following week.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Bonds batted as the leadoff hitter. With Van Slyke {{also in the}} outfield, the Pirates had a venerable {{defensive}} tandem that worked together to cover {{a lot of ground}} on the field although they were not close off the field. The Pirates experienced <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener. That year, he hit 25home runs in his second season, along with 32stolen bases and 59RBIs.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, FAU has {{increased}} its admission requirements for prospective freshmen. The fall 2013 freshmen profile for the mid-50% includes 3.38-3.98 high school GPA, a 22-26 ACT composite score, and a 1520-1740 SAT total score. Following <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the university's popularity, in early 2009, the university created its first wait-list for undergraduate enrollment. After February 15, 2009, applicants for admission in the 2009â€“2010 academic year were required to have a 3.5 GPA or an SAT score of 1600 {{to be considered for}} admission.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in industrial production and <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.|$|E
5|$|Most common ravens prefer wooded {{areas with}} large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In {{some areas of}} dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take {{advantage}} of a plentiful food supply and have seen <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} a moon other than the Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the number of moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, {{all of which are}} irregular.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, the New York City Subway {{experienced}} <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual {{passengers were}} riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just {{seven years before}} the war. In 1919, the New York Public Service Commission launched a study {{at the behest of}} engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. Turner's final paper, titled Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System, was a massive plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Among the plans were was a massive trunk line under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx; in turn, the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines were to be knocked down {{to make room for the}} 6-track subway. The paper was revised in January 1927.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, AndrÃ© RÃ©ville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. RÃ©ville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with late 1987 the Caucasus {{region was}} {{experiencing}} <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> political turmoil with large and near constant demonstrations {{being held in}} the capital of Yerevan beginning in February 1988. For the fifteen months prior to the earthquake and at times up to hundreds of thousands of protesters, represented by the Karabakh Committee, were demanding both democracy and the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh (administered by Soviet Azerbaijan but disputed autonomous territory with an 80% Armenian majority and the Azerbaijani minority) in the mountains of the Karabakh region. The unrest and the opposition movement began in September 1988 with negotiations between the Karabakh Committee and Gorbachev taking place throughout most of 1989. The relationship between the Soviet authorities and the Armenian society took {{a turn for the worse}} in March and the developments climaxed in November when a state of emergency was declared, along with a nighttime curfew, and a mass movement of up to 50,000 Armenians fleeing ethnic violence arrived from Azerbaijan.|$|E
