50|$|Earnshaw's theorem proved {{conclusively}} {{that it is}} {{not possible}} to levitate stably using only static, macroscopic, paramagnetic fields. The forces acting on any paramagnetic object in any combinations of gravitational, electrostatic, and magnetostatic fields will make the object's position, at best, unstable along at least one axis, and it can be unstable equilibrium along all axes. However, several possibilities exist to make levitation viable, for example, the use of electronic stabilization or diamagnetic materials (since relative magnetic permeability is less than one); it can be shown that diamagnetic materials are stable along at least one axis, and can be stable along all axes. Conductors can have a relative permeability to alternating magnetic fields of below one, so some configurations using simple <b>AC</b> <b>driven</b> electromagnets are self stable.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{stirring}} explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry. This property {{can be used}} {{to induce}} spin polarization in conventional semiconductors by purely electric means. Strictly speaking stirring is a non-linear effect, because in linear response theory (LRT) an AC driving induces an AC current with the same frequency. Still an adaptation of the LRT Kubo formalism allows the analysis of stirring. The quantum pumping problem (where we have an open geometry) can be regarded as a special limit of the quantum stirring problem (where we have a closed geometry). Optionally the latter can be analyzed within the framework of scattering theory. Pumping and Stirring devices are close relatives of ratchet systems. The latter are defined in this context as <b>AC</b> <b>driven</b> spatially periodic arrays, where DC current is induced.|$|E

50|$|Regenerative <b>AC</b> <b>drives</b> are {{a type of}} <b>AC</b> <b>drive</b> {{which have}} the {{capacity}} to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the motor speed (an overhauling load) and return it to the power system.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Unit 1, which {{utilizes}} a once-through {{cooling system}} and discharges its heat {{directly to the}} Monticello reservoir, Units 2 and 3 will have cooling towers. The project will be using mechanical-draft multi-cell cooling towers due to their lower visual profile as they are {{low to the ground}} compared to the tall natural draft towers used at many nuclear plants with the main drawback being that cell towers take up more ground space and require <b>AC</b> <b>driven</b> fans increasing the total of the plant's own electrical load. The large main cooling towers will cool the Circulating Water System, which removes heat from the main condenser, and serves as the power generation main heat sink while the plant is online. In addition, smaller cooling towers will serve as the heatsink for the Service Water System, which removes the decay heat from the reactor when it is shut down as well as process heat from various large pump motors and other components in the nuclear (primary) side of the plant. None of the cooling towers are safety critical in an AP1000 design, as emergency cooling is provided by very large tanks of water both inside and outside of the containment building, ensuring that the plant can be safely shutdown and cooled for at least 72 hours, with no operator action required, in the highly unlikely event of an accident.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{operators}} had {{to prepare}} an alternate injection line for each unit, as the RCIC can run indefinitely only {{while there is}} sufficient pressure and steam in the reactor to drive its turbine; once reactor pressure drops below a certain level, the RCIC shuts down automatically. The normal <b>AC</b> <b>driven</b> Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) were {{for the most part}} unavailable due to the loss of ultimate heat sink and damage to some of the electrical infrastructure. Operators prepared for this and set up an alternate injection line using a non-emergency system known as the Makeup Water Condensate System to maintain water level which was an accident mitigation method TEPCO put in place at all its nuclear plants. The system was started and stopped in all 4 units, including unit 3, as needed to maintain the water level. The RCICs in each unit later shut down due to low reactor pressure. Operators had to also use the MUWC and the makeup water purification and filtering (MUPF) system to try to cool the suppression pool and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high. Operators were later able to restore the High Pressure Core Spray portion of the ECCS in unit 4 and switched emergency water injection for unit 4 from the MUWC system to the HPCS. While the water level was maintained in the three cores using emergency water injection, pressures in the containment vessel continued to rise due to lack of suppression pool cooling and the operators prepared to vent the containments making restoration of heat removal urgent. Unit 1 was prioritized as it had the highest drywell pressure.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ac</b> <b>driven</b> sine-Gordon {{equation}} is studied analytically and numerically, {{with the aim}} of providing a full description of how soliton solutions behave. To date, there is much controversy about when <b>ac</b> <b>driven</b> dc motion is possible. Our work shows that kink solitons exhibit dc or oscillatory motion depending on the relation between their initial velocity and the force parameters. Such motion is proven to be impossible in the presence of damping terms. For breathers, the force amplitude range for which they exist when dissipation is absent is found. All the analytical results are compared with numerical simulations, which in addition exhibit no dc motion at all for breathers, and an excellent agreement is found. In the conclusion, the generality of our results and connections to others systems for which a similar phenomenology may arise are discussed.

40|$|We numerically {{study the}} {{behavior}} of two-dimensional skyrmions {{in the presence of}} a quasi-one-dimensional sinusoidal substrate under the influence of externally applied dc and <b>ac</b> <b>drives.</b> In the overdamped limit, when both dc and <b>ac</b> <b>drives</b> are aligned in the longitudinal direction parallel to the direction of the substrate modulation, the velocity-force curves exhibit classic Shapiro step features when the frequency of the <b>ac</b> <b>drive</b> matches the washboard frequency that is dynamically generated by the motion of the skyrmions over the substrate, similar to previous observations in superconducting vortex systems. In the case of skyrmions, the additional contribution to the skyrmion motion from a non-dissipative Magnus force shifts the location of the locking steps to higher dc drives, and we find that the skyrmions move at an angle with respect to the direction of the dc drive. For a longitudinal dc drive and a perpendicular or transverse <b>ac</b> <b>drive,</b> the overdamped system exhibits no Shapiro steps; however, when a finite Magnus force is present we find pronounced transverse Shapiro steps along with complex two-dimensional periodic orbits of the skyrmions in the phase-locked regimes. Both the longitudinal and transverse <b>ac</b> <b>drives</b> produce locking steps whose widths oscillate with increasing <b>ac</b> <b>drive</b> amplitude. We examine the role of collective skyrmion interactions and find that additional fractional locking steps occur for both longitudinal and transverse <b>ac</b> <b>drives.</b> At higher skyrmion densities, the system undergoes a series of dynamical order-disorder transitions, with the skyrmions forming a moving solid on the phase locking steps and a fluctuating dynamical liquid in regimes between the steps.

40|$|Cold {{atoms in}} optical lattices {{have emerged as}} an ideal system to {{investigate}} the ratchet effect, as demonstrated by several recent experiments. In this work we analyze theoretically two aspects of <b>ac</b> <b>driven</b> transport in cold atoms ratchets. We first {{address the issue of}} whether, and to which extent, an <b>ac</b> <b>driven</b> ratchet for cold atoms can operate as a motor. We thus study theoretically a dissipative motor for cold atoms, as obtained by adding a load to a 1 D non-adiabatically driven rocking ratchet. We demonstrate that a current can be generated also {{in the presence of a}} load, e. g. the ratchet device can operate as a motor. Correspondingly, we determine the stall force for the motor, which characterizes the range of loads over which the device can operate as a motor, and the differential mobility, which characterizes the response to a change in the magnitude of the load. Second, we compare our results for the transport in an <b>ac</b> <b>driven</b> ratchet device with the transport in a dc driven system. We observe a peculiar phenomenon: the bi-harmonic ac force stabilizes the dynamics, allowing the generation of uniform directed motion over a range of momentum much larger than what is possible with a dc bias. We explain such a stabilization of the dynamics by observing that a non-adiabatic ac drive broadens the effective cooling momentum range, and forces the atom trajectories to cover such a region. Thus the system can dissipate energy and maintain a steady-state energy balance. Our results show that in the case of a finite-range velocity-dependent friction, a ratchet device may offer the possibility of controlling the particle motion over a broader range of momentum with respect to a purely biased system, although this is at the cost of a reduced coherency...|$|E
