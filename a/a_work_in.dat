5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform.

This had been <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> progress for several years, {{and most of the}} finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|Greek epigrams {{contribute}} {{their share}} in Pliny's descriptions of pictures and statues. One {{of the minor}} authorities for books XXXIV–XXXV is Heliodorus of Athens, {{the author of a}} work on the monuments of Athens. In the indices to XXXIII–XXXVI, an important place is assigned to Pasiteles of Naples, the author of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating the substance of the earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by Kalkmann, who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of Apollodorus of Athens, as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:173, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).|$|E

5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as <b>a</b> <b>work,</b> <b>in</b> all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} novels were {{published}} in 1894 to mixed reviews. Love on a Mortal Lease (title from George Meredith) was released in June, followed in November by The Journey of High Honour, at 30,000words considerably shorter than the 355 pages of Love on a Mortal Lease. Each novel sold {{only a few hundred}} copies. Harwood describes the early work such as Love on a Mortal Lease as showing stylistic similarities to contemporary women novelists such as Craighie and Rhonda Broughton, with witty dialogue in Craighie's style, although he thinks Olivia brought a more serious voice to her work. He describes Love on a Mortal Lease as <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> which the heroine is well-characterised but the background is weak.|$|E
5|$|The trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a {{set back}} for his health but he soon {{recovered}} and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the Chronologia, {{a list of all}} significant events {{since the beginning of the}} world compiled from his literal reading of the bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3965 years before the birth of Christ. This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.|$|E
