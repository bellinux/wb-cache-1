5|$|As a final factor, Lee faced {{a new and}} {{formidable}} {{opponent in}} George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle {{in the face of}} fierce Confederate attacks.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during the 18thcentury copper boom, it was {{customary}} throughout the Cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour. There are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece-rate {{for the amount of}} work done. Instead, mine accounts invariably show them being paid a fixed daily rate and employed only as <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, water shortages meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents in the mines caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended.|$|E
5|$|Salford Docks (also called Manchester Docks) {{were opened}} by Queen Victoria in 1894, {{providing}} docks in Manchester and Salford for the Manchester Ship Canal which linked Manchester to the sea. During the 1970s, the docks fell into decline as they proved {{too small for}} new, larger ships, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> abandoned in 1982 over 3,000 people lost their jobs. Salford City Council purchased the docks in 1984 and since then they underwent regeneration as a centre of tourism in Salford, which included {{the construction of the}} Lowry Centre. More than 10,000 people are employed in the Quays in jobs such as retail, construction, and e-commerce. In 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC would be moving five of its departments to a new development on Pier 9 of Salford Quays, to be called MediaCityUK. The move, which is expected to be completed by 2011, will create up to 15,500 jobs and add £1bn to the regional economy over 5 years.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor {{conditions}} {{across the}} United States, and {{the victory of}} anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers. A group of workingmen led by Jacob S. Coxey began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies. This group, known as Coxey's Army, agitated {{in favor of a}} national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts. By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the United States Capitol, the group scattered. Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E
5|$|While single {{passenger}} cars were sometimes {{moved around the}} system, either between depots or to Acton Works, these movements were infrequent, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> necessary, standard stock motor cars borrowed from the passenger fleet were normally used. Following {{the introduction of the}} 1959 passenger stock, single cars and parts of units were moved around much more frequently, and normal passenger motor cars could not be used to perform this task, as the equipment they needed to operate was spread around the unit, rather than confined to the motor car. Eight Standard Stock motor cars, dating from 1927 and 1934, were therefore allocated as pilot motor cars. In 1967, they were painted maroon, numbered L130 to L137, and became part of the ballast motor fleet. Four were withdrawn in 1971 without performing this work, however. Following withdrawal, L137 was shipped to the Isle of Wight, to replace a car on the Island Line which had been damaged. The remaining four cars worked as two pairs, and were still working as pilot motor cars in 1987, but had been withdrawn by 1993.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the late}} 12th century chronicler Roger of Howden, the main source for {{information}} on the 1198 carucage, assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each hundred (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the bailiffs or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury. Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record the payments, which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts. These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.|$|E
5|$|Animals have {{repeatedly}} been used through {{the history of}} biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the Dublin Zoo {{were members of the}} medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dead. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1880s, Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. In World War I, German agents infected sheep bound for Russia with anthrax, and inoculated mules and horses of the French cavalry with the equine glanders disease. Between 1917 and 1918, the Germans infected mules in Argentina bound for American forces, resulting in the death of 200 mules. Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On November 3, 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.|$|E
