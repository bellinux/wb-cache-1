For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many things as happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a young man will relate to you, I mean those after death, those after the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained {{in the suburbs of}} the city....|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems <b>among</b> <b>our</b> pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E

25|$|In {{his third}} book, Why is Sex Fun?, also {{published}} in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features {{of human sexuality}} that are generally taken for granted but that are highly unusual <b>among</b> <b>our</b> animal relatives. Those features include a long-term pair relationship (marriage), coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory, provision of parental care by fathers {{as well as by}} mothers, having sex in private rather than in public, concealed ovulation, female sexual receptivity encompassing most of the menstrual cycle (including days of infertility), female but not male menopause, and distinctive secondary sexual characteristics.|$|E

The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, <b>among</b> <b>our</b> own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.|$|E

Concrete values of a communication are generated through constraints which are imposed locally on each participant object. The proposed interaction (and communication) model is very versatile and can be used as an abstract specification mechanism...|$|R

500|$|Citing {{continuing}} {{divisions within}} the Democratic Party, the ongoing Cold War, and the boom and bust cycle, journalist Samuel Lubell in 1952 stated: [...] "After seven years of Truman's hectic, even furious, activity the nation seemed to be about on the same general spot as {{when he first came}} to office... Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through... All his skills and energies—and he was <b>among</b> <b>our</b> hardest-working Presidents—were directed to standing still." [...] When he left office in 1953, Truman {{was one of the most}} unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month Nixon resigned, but matched by Nixon's all-time low in January 1974.|$|E
500|$|One {{chapter of}} the {{pamphlet}} describes the physiognomy of the [...] "sodomitical type", claiming that gentle, soft, and delicate men are predisposed toward sodomy. The next criticizes the feminine dress and hairstyling of young men whom it describes as [...] "those Gentlemen who call themselves pretty Fellows". It characterizes their appearance, in which men styled their hair and dressed {{in a manner similar}} to their footmen, as history's most preposterous. (In contemporary Britain fears about the consequences of homosexual relationships often centred on their perceived tendency to ignore (and thus weaken) class boundaries: an effeminate gentleman who dressed like his footman, a servant, embodied this class transgression in a threatening way.) The habit of wearing makeup, the pamphlet says, was [...] "as much in Vogue <b>among</b> <b>our</b> Gentlemen, as with the Ladies in France." [...] Italian opera, too, is criticized for its attributed tendency to feminize men.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{historic}} championship title, Gore was not {{enthusiastic about}} the new sport of lawn tennis. In 1890, thirteen years after winning his championship title, he wrote: [...] "...it is want of variety that will prevent lawn tennis {{in its present form}} from taking rank <b>among</b> <b>our</b> great games... That anyone who has really played well at cricket, tennis, or even rackets, will ever seriously give his attention to lawn tennis, beyond showing himself to be a promising player, is extremely doubtful; for in all probability the monotony of the game as compared with others would choke him off before he had time to excel in it." [...] He did return for the 1878 Championship to defend his title in the Challenge Round but lost in straight sets to Frank Hadow, a coffee planter from Ceylon, who effectively used the lob to counter Gore's net play. It was Gore's last appearance at the Wimbledon Championships.|$|E

500|$|A more {{thorough}} evaluation of Creangă's literature began after 1900. At the time, {{it became a}} topic {{of interest to the}} emerging traditionalist and populist trend, illustrated by the two venues rivaling Junimea: the right-wing Sămănătorul, led by Nicolae Iorga, and the left-wing Poporanists, among which was Garabet Ibrăileanu. The new editions of his works enlisted the collaboration of Sămănătorist intellectuals Ilarie Chendi and Ștefan Octavian Iosif. Tudor Vianu however noted that, unlike Eminescu's outlook, Creangă's [...] "authentic ruralism" [...] did not complement the [...] "spiritual complications", global social class perspective and intellectual background associated with these trends, making Creangă [...] "the least Sămănătorist <b>among</b> <b>our</b> writers." [...] According to Ornea, Creangă has [...] "nothing in common" [...] with the Sămănătorul ideology in particular: while the group shared his nostalgic outlook on the rural past {{in stark contrast to the}} modernized world, the Moldavian author could [...] "maintain, intelligently, the middle ground between contraries". Likewise, Mircea Braga reacted against the perception of Creangă as announcing a [...] "series" [...] of authors, noting that, for all imitation, he was [...] "an exceptional and, as far as Romanian literary history goes, unique creator." ...|$|E

[...] A 25 August 1978 review in The Hindu stated that the film [...] "reflects the healthy trend towards a simple short story, vivid picturisation of sylvan scenery, arresting characterisation, catchy folk tunes and picturesque rustic dances {{that seem to have}} caught on <b>among</b> <b>our</b> film producers, instead of the usual formula of fights, duets, intrigues and cabaret dances... Mahendran has handled the theme deftly. [...] shows his mature artistry in a portrayal of a turbulent illiterate worker with a blind passion for his sister." [...] It also praised the performances of Shoba and Jayalaxmi, and called Balu Mahendra's camera work a [...] "feast for the eyes", noting that although {{the first half of the}} film moves at a [...] "leisurely pace", the second half is [...] "eventful". Ananda Vikatan, in a 3 September 1978 review, praised Mahendran's filmmaking skills in the film, the fact that he told the story in a sharp manner without long dialogues, and likened the film to Kurinchi flowers, while rating it 61 out of 100.|$|E
