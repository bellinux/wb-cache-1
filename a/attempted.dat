40|$|Background It {{is unclear}} whether any {{particular}} {{time of the day}} is Vulnerable for suicide <b>attempts.</b> Suicide <b>attempt</b> is a known risk factor for future completed suicide. Aim To investigate the relationship between the time of suicide <b>attempt</b> and the sociodemograpic and illness characteristics of suicide attempters. Method Time of <b>attempt,</b> clinical and demographic data and illness variables of 74 patients presenting to hospital following suicide <b>attempt</b> were analyzed. Results Our results showed 8. a. m. to 11. 59 a. m. is the most preferred time of <b>attempt</b> and it is statistically significant. Suicide <b>attempt</b> is significantly more in the day time (between 8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.). The above time period is significantly associated with place of <b>attempt</b> of the suicide attempters. This is the time period where more young males (20 – 29 years) from rural back ground, married, illiterates and unemployed (significant no. of house wives also) <b>attempt</b> suicide during this time. Depression is the common psychiatric illness and pesticide is the common mode of <b>attempt.</b> More number of cases <b>attempt</b> during the months of August, September and October. Majority of them have experienced more than 5 life events before the <b>attempt.</b> Therefore we conclude that forenoon (8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.) is the most vulnerable period for <b>attempting</b> suicide. Conclusion The assessment of patients with history of suicide <b>attempt</b> in relation to the time of <b>attempt</b> is beneficial in formulating suicide prevention strategies...|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} whether schizophrenia patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm have earlier age of onset of psychotic and depressive symptoms {{and higher levels}} of clinical symptoms compared to patients with only suicide <b>attempts</b> or without suicide <b>attempt.</b> Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, 251 patients (18 – 61 years old, 58 % men) with schizophrenia treated at hospitals in Oslo and Innlandet Hospital Trust, Norway, were assessed with a comprehensive clinical research protocol and divided into three groups based on their history of suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm. Results: Suicide <b>attempts</b> were present in 88 patients (35 %); 52 had suicide <b>attempts</b> only (29 %) and 36 had both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm (14 %). When compared with nonattempters and those with suicide <b>attempts</b> without non-suicidal self-harm, patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm were more frequently women, younger at the onset of psychotic symptoms, had longer duration of untreated psychosis, and had higher levels of current impulsivity/aggression and depression. Patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm were more likely to repeat suicide <b>attempts</b> than patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> only. Conclusions: Patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm had different illness history and clinical characteristics compared to patients with only suicide <b>attempts</b> or patients without suicidal behavior. Our study suggests that patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm represent a distinct subgroup among patients with schizophrenia and suicidal behavior with their early onset of psychotic symptoms, high rate of repeated suicidal behavior and significant treatment delay...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that a history of suicide <b>attempts</b> confers risk for subsequent attempts; however, efforts to explain how variables may change after a previous <b>attempt</b> and in turn relate to future suicide <b>attempts</b> are rare in the literature. This study presents longitudinal data on adolescent suicide <b>attempts</b> in Hong Kong, and examines whether the data support the "crescendo" model to explain repeat suicide <b>attempts.</b> One thousand and ninety-nine community adolescents aged 12 - 18 years were evaluated at two assessment points 12 months apart (T 1 and T 2). The study assessed (1) risk factors at T 1 for a suicide <b>attempt</b> between T 1 and T 2, (2) whether a suicide <b>attempt</b> during the 12 months prior to T 1 predicted an <b>attempt</b> between the two assessment points, and (3) whether the indicators of distress worsened from T 1 to T 2 if an <b>attempt</b> had taken place in the interim. The results indicated that: (1) depressive symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation measured at T 1 were independent predictors of a suicide <b>attempt</b> between T 1 and T 2; (2) suicide <b>attempt</b> in the year prior to T 1 predicted suicide <b>attempt</b> between T 1 and T 2 after controlling for other predictors; and (3) suicide <b>attempt</b> between T 1 and T 2 was a predictive factor for a negative change from T 1 to T 2 in substance use, suicidal ideation, family relationships, depression, anxiety, and life stress. These findings are consistent with the "crescendo" model proposing that the risk of repeat <b>attempts</b> is enhanced following a previous suicide <b>attempt.</b> © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Background Suicide {{and suicide}} <b>attempts</b> {{represent}} a severe problem {{for public health}} services. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the socio-demographic and psychopathological variables associated with suicide <b>attempts</b> in the population admitted to a General Hospital. Methods An observational-descriptive study of patients admitted to the A Coruña University Hospital (Spain) during the period 1997 - 2007, assessed by the Consultation and Liaison Psychiatric Unit. We include n = 5, 234 admissions from 4, 509 patients. Among these admissions, n = 361 (6. 9 %) were subsequent to a suicide <b>attempt.</b> Admissions arising from a suicide <b>attempt</b> were compared with admissions occurring due to other reasons. Multivariate generalised estimating equation logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with suicide <b>attempts.</b> Results Adjusting by age, gender, educational level, cohabitation status, being employed or unemployed, the psychiatric diagnosis at the time of the interview and the information on previous suicide <b>attempts,</b> we found that the variables associated with the risk of a suicide <b>attempt</b> were: age, psychiatric diagnosis and previous suicide <b>attempts.</b> The risk of suicide <b>attempts</b> decreases with age (OR = 0. 969). Psychiatric diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of suicide <b>attempts,</b> with the highest risk being found for Mood or Affective Disorders (OR = 7. 49), followed by Personality Disorders (OR = 7. 31), and Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders (OR = 5. 03). The strongest single predictive factor for suicide <b>attempts</b> was a prior history of <b>attempts</b> (OR = 23. 63).

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of psychotic patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> in a Chinese rural community. Method: An epidemiological investigation of psychotic patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> among 123 572 population (over 15 years of age) was conducted in Xinjin County, Chengdu. Results: The rate of suicide <b>attempts</b> {{was found to be}} 8. 17 % among all the psychotic patients (906 cases). Patients with affective psychosis showed a significantly higher rate of suicidal <b>attempts</b> (15. 3 %) than those with schizophrenia (7. 5 %) (P < 0. 005). Suicide <b>attempts</b> were significantly associated with depression and hopelessness in both schizophrenia and affective psychosis (P < 0. 001). Patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> were younger and had an earlier age of onset than those without suicide <b>attempts</b> (P < 0. 05). Patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders were the major patients with suicide <b>attempts.</b> Conclusion: The rate of suicide <b>attempts</b> in psychotic patients may be largely influenced by the illness itself. Community-based services should be necessary for these patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
