40|$|Background: Determination of {{the lung}} outline and {{regional}} lung <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> is {{of value in}} analysis of three-dimensional (3 D) distribution of aerosol deposition from radionuclide imaging. This study describes a technique for using computed tomography (CT) scans for this purpose. Methods: Low-resolution CT scans of the thorax were obtained during tidal breathing in 11 healthy control male subjects on two occasions. The 3 D outline of the lung was determined by image processing using minimal user interaction. A 3 D map of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> was derived and total lung <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> calculated. The regional distribution of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> from center to periphery of the lung was analyzed using a radial transform and the outer-to-inner ratio of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> determined. Results: The average total <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> in the lung was 1, 900 ± 126 ?mL (1 SEM), which is in general agreement with the expected value for adult male subjects in the supine position. The fractional <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> concentration increased from the center toward {{the periphery of the}} lung. Outer-to-inner (O/I) ratios were higher for the left lung [11. 5 ± 1. 8 (1 SD) ] than for the right [10. 1 ± 0. 8 (1 SD) ] (p< 0. 001). When normalized for the region sizes, these ratios were 1. 37 ± 0. 16 and 1. 20 ± 0. 04, respectively. The coefficient of variation of repeated measurement of the normalized O/I ratio was 5. 9 %. Conclusions: A technique for outlining the lungs from CT images and obtaining an image of the distribution of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> is described. The normal range of various parameters describing the regional distribution of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> is presented, together with a measure of intrasubject repeatability. This technique and data will be of value in analyzing 3 D radionuclide images of aerosol deposition. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Background Determination of {{regional}} lung <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> has several clinical applications. This study investigates {{the use of}} mid-tidal breathing CT scans to provide regional lung volume data. Methods Low resolution CT scans of the thorax were obtained during tidal breathing in 11 healthy control male subjects, each on two separate occasions. A 3 D map of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> was derived, and total lung volume calculated. The regional distribution of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> from centre to periphery of the lung was analysed using a radial transform and also using one dimensional profiles in three orthogonal directions. Results The total <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> for {{the right and left}} lungs were 1035 +/? 280 ml and 864 +/? 315 ml, respectively (mean and SD). The corresponding fractional <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> concentrations (FAVC) were 0. 680 +/? 0. 044 and 0. 658 +/? 0. 062. All differences between the right and left lung were highly significant (p?<? 0. 0001). The coefficients of variation of repeated measurement of right and left lung <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> and FAVC were 6. 5 % and 6. 9 % and 2. 5 % and 3. 6 %, respectively. FAVC correlated significantly with lung space volume (r?=? 0. 78) (p?<? 0. 005). FAVC increased from the centre towards the periphery of the lung. Central to peripheral ratios were significantly higher for the right (0. 100 +/? 0. 007 SD) than the left (0. 089 +/? 0. 013 SD) (p?<? 0. 0001). Conclusion A technique for measuring the distribution of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> in the lung at mid-tidal breathing is described.

In the case of constant <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> system, the simulation results indicated that if the designed air supply rate was properly determined, the indoor particle concentrations would satisfy the speci-fied requirements of indoor air quality standards. For a variable <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> system, if the strength of indoor particle source is, in a relative sense, large compared to the cooling load, the particle concentrations could markedly increase and would probably bring about indoor air quality problem.

Particularly intriguing is {{the observation}} {{that they seem to}} dive on inspiration, which contributes to increasing oxygen stores but which increases their buoyancy. It has been concluded that buoyancy is a major factor in determining the energetics of shallow diving birds and there is a positive correlation between estimated <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> in the body (respiratory system and feathers) and the maximum depth in the dive of free-ranging penguins. However, it is not known whether the variation in the total <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> is caused by the variation in the <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> in the respiratory system or in plumage. In the present study, underwater weights of restrained Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae (n= 27 birds) were continuously measured in a experimental tank. The birds lost much air from their feathers within 1 - 2 min of submergence. The maximum weights in the water were used to calculate the minimum <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> that diving birds are expected to have in their body. These volumes were compared with estimated <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> from two free-ranging Adelie penguins. Most estimated values of the free-ranging birds were larger than values from the restrained birds, which indicates that variation in the former <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> is likely caused by the variation in the air in the respiratory system.

40|$|In a VAV (variable <b>air</b> <b>volume)</b> system, the {{set point}} of the static {{pressure}} (usually measured at 213 downstream of the main supply air duct) is maintained by modulating the fan speed or inlet guide vane position. The set {{point of the}} static pressure is often set at a constant value, which is adequate to provide design flow to each room. This method consumes more fan power than necessary under partial load conditions. The fan speed or inlet guide vane can also be controlled based on the maximum damper position of the terminal boxes. This method is called <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> control logic. Under this control logic, terminal box airflow requirements are met with reduced static pressure. Fan power consumption is minimized.

Moreover, cooling fan energy consumption for underfloor VAV systems can be significantly less than that for overhead VAV systems. Results show also that constant <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> (CAV) systems can be an effective approach for zones, such as core areas, that have little load variation (assuming oversizing is minimized). For these situations a UFAD-CAV system can offer low installed cost, simplicity, and provide modest energy savings compared to an overhead VAV system...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Post-craniotomy {{intracranial}} air can {{be present}} in patients scheduled for air ambulance transport to their home hospital. We aimed to assess risk for in-flight intracranial pressure (ICP) increases related to observed intracranial <b>air</b> <b>volumes,</b> hypothetical sea level pre-transport ICP, and different potential flight levels and cabin pressures. METHODS: A cohort of consecutive subdural hematoma evacuation patients from one University Medical Centre was assessed with post-operative intracranial <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> measurements by computed tomography. Intracranial pressure changes related to estimated intracranial <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> effects of changing atmospheric pressure (simulating flight and cabin pressure changes up to 8000 ft) were simulated using an established model for intracranial pressure and volume relations. RESULTS: Approximately {{one third of the}} cohort had post-operative intracranial air. Of these, approximately one third had intracranial <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> less than 11 ml. The simulation estimated that the expected changes in intracranial pressure during 'flight' would not result in intracranial hypertension. For intracranial <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> above 11 ml, the simulation suggested that it was possible that intracranial hypertension could develop 'inflight' related to cabin pressure drop. Depending on the pre-flight intracranial pressure and <b>air</b> <b>volume,</b> this could occur quite early during the assent phase in the flight profile. DISCUSSION: These findings support the idea that there should be radiographic verification of {{the presence or absence of}} intracranial air after craniotomy for patients planned for long distance air transport. CONCLUSIONS: Very small amounts of air are clinically inconsequential. Otherwise, air transport with maintained ground-level cabin pressure should be a priority for these patients...|$|R
