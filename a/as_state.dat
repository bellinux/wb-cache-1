5|$|A {{major focus}} for Kenyatta {{during the first}} {{three and a half years}} of Kenya's {{independence}} were the divisions within KANU itself.

Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he formed the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system.|$|E
