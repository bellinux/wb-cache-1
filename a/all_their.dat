40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{grandparents}} 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their quality of life (QOL) after the diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<b>ALL)</b> in <b>their</b> grandchild. The following questions were addressed: (a) How do grandparents of children with <b>ALL</b> perceive <b>their</b> current QOL; (b) How do grandparents of children with <b>ALL</b> perceive <b>their</b> current QOL has changed since their grandchild was diagnosed; (c) What specific changes in QOL have grandparents experienced since the diagnosis of <b>ALL</b> in <b>their</b> grandchild; (d) What is the grandparents 2 ̆ 7 overall attitude about life with leukemia; (e) Is there a relationship between the length of time since the diagnosis of <b>ALL</b> in <b>their</b> grandchild and the grandparents 2 ̆ 7 current QOL; (f) Is there a relationship between length of time since the diagnosis of <b>ALL</b> in <b>their</b> grandchild and perceived changes in the grandparents 2 ̆ 7 QOL? Using Roy 2 ̆ 7 s Adaptation Model as a theoretical framework, a descriptive research design was used. A convenience sample of 29 grandparents completed the Varricchio-Wright Impact of Leukemia Questionnaire-Grandparents and a Demographic Information Sheet. Measures of central tendency were used to answer the first two research questions. Grandparents 2 ̆ 7 perceived their current QOL to be good to neither good nor poor. They reported their QOL to be the same as prior to <b>ALL</b> in <b>their</b> grandchild. There was no relationship found between length of time from diagnosis and either current QOL or changes in QOL. Implications for nursing practice are discussed...|$|R
