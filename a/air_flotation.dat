Applications where hydrocyclones are found are in industry where oily water sources arise in workshops, vehicle wash bays, transport hubs, fuel depots and aluminium billet processing. Animal fats from meat processing and dairy manufacturing can also be removed without the need of chemical treatment that often is required for dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> (DAF) systems.|$|E
25|$|Effluent {{from the}} {{pulp and paper}} {{industry}} is generally high in suspended solids and BOD. Plants that bleach wood pulp for paper making may generate chloroform, dioxins (including 2,3,7,8-TCDD), furans, phenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as sedimentation or dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation.</b> Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as activated sludge or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. For mills with high inorganic loadings like salt, tertiary treatments may be required, either general membrane treatments like ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.|$|E

This paper examines the dynamic adsorption of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and Dowfroth 250, which is a commercial mixture of polyglycols used to control the dispersion of <b>air</b> in <b>flotation.</b> The dynamic adsorption process was modelled based on either the diffusion-controlled or kinetics-controlled theories.

Comparison between the theoretical results and experimental data shows that the kinetics-controlled model for the surfactant adsorption describes the experimental data better for both surfactant systems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. A instant <b>air</b> {{dissolution}} <b>flotation</b> {{method was}} used to harvest microalgal cells from culture to evaluate its feasibility. Effects of microalgae cell density, coagulant dosage, flocculant dosage, surfactant dosage and duration of air dissolution on recovery rate were studied by orthogonal experiment. The {{results show that the}} optimal recovery rate reaches 89. 57 % under one of the test combination conditions. The factors can be ordered by coagulant dosage, cell density, flocculant dosage, air dissolution duration and surfactant dosage according to their effect degree on recovery rate, and coagulant dosage, cell density were the marked factors when confidence level was given as 90 %. Under test conditions, recovery rate rides up when the coagulant dosage increase, and the optimal dose of flocculant appears at 20 mJ·L- 1. As seawater medium contains salts which own the similar fuction like surfactant, surfactant do not affect the recovery rate significantly. The time of air dissolution should not be too long, a 2 -second duration is enough to providing dissolved air, and the recovery rate may reduce because of the disturbance induced by the redundant air...|$|R

Local Government requires that fish processors remove total suspended solids (TSS), fats, oil and grease (FOGs) and colloidal materials almost completely {{in order to allow}} for efficient disinfection. The OCS plant had only a limited amount of space. Clean Water Technology, Inc. (CWT) and OCS teams designed the system with an underground equalization tank, 1 / 8 inch rotating drum screens, flocculation flotation (GEM System) and chlorination dechlorination. Hybrid centrifugal dissolved <b>air</b> flocculation <b>flotation</b> (the GEM System), is the key component of the wastewater treatment plant. The GEM System built to treat 500 GPM of wastewater required only an 8 16 area. The System has operated since 2004. TSS and FOGs are almost completely removed to less than 20 mg/l and 1 mg/l, respectively. This allowed for successful breakpoint chlorination dechlorination and fecal coliform removal (99. 995 %). The produced sludge after overnight drainage contains over 15 % of solids. Novel ultrahigh molecular weight polyacrylamide flocculants used in the process enabled TSS and FOG removal even at high salinity.

A series of experiments were conducted using a laboratory-scale mechanical flotation cell at various methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) concentrations and aeration rates. It was found that air recovery has a strong correlation with dynamic froth stability determined by measuring the maximum froth height in a non-overflowing froth column.

40|$|Interaction forces between solid {{particles}} and <b>air</b> bubbles during <b>flotation</b> are of significant academic and practical importance. An {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) probe technique {{was used to measure}} the interaction forces between an air bubble and a hydrophobic/hydrophilic spherical particle. In the case of hydrophobic spheres, strong attraction between the surfaces, leading to the rupture of the intervening water film and the attachment of the particle to the air bubble was observed. In the case of hydrophilic spheres, the rupture of the intervening water film and the attachment of the particle to the air bubble did not take place. In each case, however, the repulsive interaction force during approach prior to attachment was dependent on the speed of the bubble (the piezoelectric translator) indicating that the hydrodynamic interaction between the bubble and the particle at short separation distances is significant. The force analysis together with the deformation of the gas-liquid interface during the interaction is described, which gives a more detailed description of the bubble-particle interaction.
