25|$|A {{whiplash}} injury from {{an automobile}} accident is called a cervical acceleration–deceleration injury. Cadaver {{studies have shown that}} as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a kyphosis while the upper cervical spine maintains its lordosis. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} conditions have a considerable {{effect on the}} critical load of slender columns. The {{boundary conditions}} determine the mode of bending of the column and the distance between inflection points on the displacement curve of the deflected column. The inflection points in the deflection shape of the column are the points at which the curvature of the column changes sign and are also the points at which the column's internal bending moments of the column are zero. The closer the inflection points are, the greater the resulting <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> capacity (bucking load) of the column.|$|E
25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> along the shaft of the femur results in compressive stress. Bending load at {{the neck of the}} femur causes tensile stress along {{the upper part of the}} neck and compressive stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as we age, these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Although {{clavicle}} biomechanical response under <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> was {{studied by}} a number of researchers, no injury criteria has been established. An injury criterion could help interpret the results from anthropometric test device and human clavicle finite element modeling. Therefore, the goal {{of this study is to}} construct a database of clavicle <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> response, develop an injury criterion for clavicle under <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> and study the effect of arameter s such as age, gender, loading rate, aspect(right vs left),boundary condition on clavicle injury risk. Four clavicles were loaded to failure under <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> configurations at loading rate of 1 m/s to further expand the current available clavicle failure data in literature. Then a database of 68 clavicle specimens under <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> failure was compiled. A multivariate Weibull survival analysis was performed with this database to obtain the clavicle injury risk criterion under <b>axial</b> <b>loading.</b> It was found that the clavicle injury risk decreases as the age increase until 56 years old, and then the clavicle injury risk increases as age increases. It was also observed that female subject has a higher clavicle injury risk than male under the same loading condition. The boundary conditions could also change the clavicle injury risk significantly. However, loading rate and aspect (Left VS Right) do not have statistically significant effects on clavicle injury risk in this studyPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R

A short column under the action of an <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> will fail [...] by direct compression before it buckles, but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by springing suddenly outward laterally (buckling) in a bending mode.

However, intermediate-length columns will fail by a combination of direct compressive stress and bending.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{structural}} columns {{are commonly}} of intermediate length, the Euler formula has little practical application for ordinary design. Issues that cause {{deviation from the}} pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear stress strain behaviour of the column's material. Consequently, a number of empirical column formulae have been developed that agree with test data, all of which embody the slenderness ratio. Due to the uncertainty {{in the behavior of}} columns, for design, appropriate safety factors are introduced into these formulae. One such formula is the Perry Robertson formula which estimates the critical buckling load based on an assumed small initial curvature, hence an eccentricity of the <b>axial</b> <b>load.</b> The Rankine Gordon formula (Named for William John Macquorn Rankine and Perry Hugesworth Gordon (1899 [...] 1966)) is also based on experimental results and suggests that a column will buckle at a load Fmax given by: ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{vibration}} attenuation of a beam with {{circular cross-section}} by resonantly shunted piezo-elastic supports is experimentally investigated for varying axial tensile and compressive beam <b>loads.</b> Varying <b>axial</b> beam <b>loads</b> manipulate the effective lateral bending stiffness and, thus, {{lead to a}} detuning of the beams resonance frequencies. Furthermore, varying <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> affect the general electromechanical coupling coefficient of transducer and beam, an important modal quantity for shunt-damping. The beam’s first mode resonance frequency and coupling coefficient are analyzed for varying <b>axial</b> <b>loads.</b> The values of the resonance frequency and the coupling coefficient are obtained from a transducer impedance measurement. Finally, frequency transfer functions of the beam with one piezo-elastic support either shunted to a RL-shunt or to a RL-shunt with negative capacitance, the RLC-shunt, are compared for varying <b>axial</b> <b>loads.</b> It is shown that the beam vibration attenuation with the RLC-shunt is less influenced by varying <b>axial</b> beam <b>loads...</b>|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} {{of a new}} class of flight control actuators that rely on post-buckled recompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements is investigated. While past research has proven that PBP actuators are capable of generating deflections three times higher than conventional bimorph actuators, this paper quantifies the work output and power consumption under various <b>axial</b> <b>loads,</b> at various frequencies. An analytical model is presented that supports the experimental findings regarding the increasing work output and natural frequency shift under increasing <b>axial</b> <b>loads.</b> Furthermore, increasing <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> shows an increase in open-loop piezoelectric hysteresis, resulting in an increasing phase lag in actuator response. Current measurements show an electromechanical coupling that leads to power peaks around the natural frequency. Increasing <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> has no effect on the power consumption, while increasing the work output by a factor of three, which implies a significant increase in work density over the piezoelectric material itself.

40|$|The {{effect of}} distal radial and ulnar length change on forearm bone loading {{is not well}} {{understood}} during simulated dynamic wrist loading. This thesis presents two studies which investigate {{the effect of these}} length changes on distal forearm loading under simulated dynamic wrist motion. The first study investigates the effect of radial length change on <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> at the distal radius and ulna and relationship between ulnar variance and distal forearm loading. The complex variation in <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> in the distal radius and during length change and dynamic wrist motion were studied and discussed.

The second study investigates the effect of ulnar change on <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> at the distal radius and ulna and the effect of triangular fibrocartilage ligament complex (TFCC) on this relationship.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E
