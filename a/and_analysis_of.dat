5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E

5|$|Hao Fengjun, another {{defector}} to Australia, {{had worked}} for the 610 Office of Tianjin city and claims that his job involved the collection <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> intelligence reports on Falun Gong from Europe, Australia, and North America. The implication was that local 610 offices are involved in the espionage efforts abroad. Another defector from China's Ministry of State Security—which conducts both domestic and international intelligence—claimed that the repression and monitoring of underground Christians and Falun Gong practitioners is a major focus of the ministry.|$|E

5|$|Network {{forensics}} {{is concerned}} with the monitoring <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> computer network traffic, both local and WAN/internet, for the purposes of information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection. Traffic is usually intercepted at the packet level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time.

5|$|Professor Pete Wilson, {{on behalf}} of English Heritage's Portico Properties Research Project, has {{suggested}} questions for future research and investigation of the site, including: excavation to establish its date and function; examination of historic documentation for medieval mention of use of the monument as a route or in a boundary dispute; <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the site via a detailed aerial survey, lidar or other remote sensing technique to establish {{the extent of the}} monument beyond the length so far excavated.|$|E

5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E

5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the skulls {{is the best way}} to distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} experimentation for {{the modern}} restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others, who took as their guidelines the Rules for restoration {{of works of art}} as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the artwork. Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer Takashi Okamura for Nippon Television Network Corporation.|$|E
