40|$|Evaluation {{of metals}} to predict service life of metal-based {{structures}} in corrosive environments has long relied on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> sites. Traditional accelerated corrosion testing relies on mimicking the exposure conditions, often incorporating salt spray and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and exposing the metal to continuous or cyclic {{conditions similar to}} those of the corrosive environment. Their reliability to correlate to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> results is often a concern when determining the timescale to which the accelerated tests can be related. Accelerated corrosion testing has yet to be universally accepted as a useful tool in predicting the long-term service life of a metal, despite its ability to rapidly induce corrosion. Although visual and mass loss methods of evaluating corrosion are the standard, and their use is crucial, a method that correlates timescales from accelerated testing to atmospheric exposure would be very valuable. This paper presents work that began with the characterization of the atmospheric environment at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Beachside Corrosion Test Site. The chemical changes that occur on low carbon steel, during atmospheric and accelerated corrosion conditions, were investigated using surface chemistry analytical methods. The corrosion rates and behaviors of panels subjected to long-term and accelerated corrosion conditions, involving neutral salt fog and alternating seawater spray, were compared to identify possible timescale correlations between accelerated and long-term corrosion performance. The results, as well as preliminary findings on the correlation investigation, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion studies {{began at}} NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 1966, during the Gemini/Apollo Programs, with the {{evaluation}} of long-term anti-corrosion coatings for carbon steel structures. NASAIKSC's <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Test</b> Site was established at that time on the beach near the launch pad. In the years that followed, numerous studies at the site have identified materials, coatings, and maintenance procedures for launch hardware and equipment exposed to the highly corrosive environment at the launch pad. The atmosphere at the launch pad is highly corrosive due to {{the proximity of the}} Atlantic Ocean, high heat from rocket exhaust, and since the introduction of the Space Shuttle, the acidic combustion products of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs). Currently, NASAIKSC maintains about $ 2 billion worth of unique equipment and facilities, not including the orbiters, each valued at about $ 1. 8 billion. Among the items: two launch complexes, two crawler transporters, three mobile launch platforms, and specialized testing equipment. Atmospheric exposure provides very valuable data but {{it takes a long time}} and relies on human visual inspection. NASA Technical Standard for Protective Coatings requires 18 months of good performance at the <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Test</b> Site for preliminary approval and continued good performance for 5 years for final approval of a coating system. The use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was introduced at KSC in 1989 as a supplement to the traditional dc electrochemical techniques and atmospheric exposure studies. This paper presents and overview of several projects in which EIS was used in order to select materials and coatings to be used at NASA's launch facilities [1 - 2]...|$|E

Fourteen countries were involved in this project: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

During the last decade a new generation of aluminium-lithium alloys have been developed due to their low density and high elastic modulus. From corrosion viewpoint most of the work published on these alloys are based on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> and accelerated laboratory tests. Recently, an increasing interest has been paid in the use of electrochemical techniques on aluminium alloys due to their main advantages: determining of corrosion kinetics in real time and knowledge of the corrosion mechanism. This paper attempts to establish a correlation between the evolution of the impedance diagrams and the process of the attack undergone by a commercial 8090 T 8171 alloy in sodium chloride solutions. During the first 100 h of immersion the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that the corrosion process is under charge transfer resistance control.

The paint systems were applied as films of variable thickness over rusted steel surfaces cleaned to different grades of surface preparation (Sa 3, Sa 2 (1 / 2), Sa 2 and St 2). Pre-rusting of steel was carried out in a clean (uncontaminated) rural atmosphere. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted for 14 years at three Spanish test sites of different atmospheric corrosivity.

40|$|The marine {{environment}} at NASAs Kennedy Space Center (KSC) {{has been documented}} by ASM International (formerly American Society for Metals) as the most corrosive in North America. With {{the introduction of the}} Space Shuttle in 1981, the already highly corrosive conditions at the launch pads were rendered even more severe by the highly corrosive hydrochloric acid (HCl) generated by the solid rocket boosters (SRBs). Numerous failures at the launch pads are caused by corrosion. The structural integrity of ground infrastructure and flight hardware is critical to the success, safety, cost, and sustainability of space missions. NASA has over fifty years of experience dealing with unexpected failures caused by corrosion and has developed expertise in corrosion control in the launch and other environments. The Corrosion Technology Laboratory at KSC evolved, from what started as an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> site near NASAs launch pads, into a capability that provides technical innovations and engineering services in all areas of corrosion for NASA, external partners, and customers. This paper provides a chronological overview of NASAs role in anticipating, managing, and preventing corrosion in highly corrosive environments. One important challenge in managing and preventing corrosion involves the detrimental impact on humans and the environment of what have been very effective corrosion control strategies. This challenge has motivated the development of new corrosion control technologies that are more effective and environmentally friendly. Strategies for improved corrosion protection and durability can have a huge impact on the economic sustainability of human spaceflight operations...|$|E
