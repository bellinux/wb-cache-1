40|$|Systems {{for sound}} {{retrieval}} are usually "sourcecentred ". This means that retrieval {{is based on}} using the proper keywords that define or specify a sound source. Although this type of description is of great interest, {{it is very difficult}} to implement it into realistic <b>automatic</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>systems</b> because of the necessity of dealing with thousands of categories, hence with thousands of different sound models. Moreover, digitally synthesised or transformed sounds, which are frequently used in most of the contemporary popular music, have no identifiable sources. We propose a description framework, based on Schaeffer's research on a generalised solfeggio which could be applied to any type of sounds. He defined some morphological description criteria, based on intrinsic perceptual qualities of sound, which doesn't refer to the cause or the meaning of a sound. We describe more specifically experiments on automatic extraction of morphological descriptors...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{bottlenecks}} in {{the development}} of text-to-speech synthesizers based on segment concatenation is the need for large, segmented and labeled corpora. Consequently, as manual segmentation and labeling is a tedious and time consuming task, there is a strong demand for <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> which can <b>label</b> speech from many languages. Several systems have been proposed already, but they usually require hand labeled training utterances before they can be used for a new language. We have developed a system that adapts to a new language without the need for any hand labeled utterances of that language. Our system contains a segmentation and a broad phonetic classification network, which was originally trained on one task (Flemish continuous speech), and which is subsequently adapted to the new task using an embedded training procedure.

40|$|Some phoneme {{boundaries}} {{correspond to}} abrupt {{changes in the}} acoustic signal. Others are less clear-cut because the transition from one phoneme to the next is gradual. This paper compares the phoneme boundaries identified by {{a large number of}} different alignment systems, using different signal representations and Hidden Markov Model structures. The variability of the different boundaries is analysed statistically, with the boundaries grouped in terms of the broad phonetic classes of the respective phonemes. The mutual consistency between the boundaries from the various systems is analysed to identify which classes of phoneme boundary can be identified reliably by an <b>automatic</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>system,</b> and which are ill-defined and ambiguous. The results presented here provide a starting point for future development of techniques for objective comparisons between systems without giving undue weight to variations in those phoneme boundaries which are inherently ambiguous.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{influential}} cognitive models of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) suggests that a failure to adequately monitor the production of one's own inner speech leads to verbal thought being misidentified as an alien voice. However, it is unclear whether this theory can explain the phenomenological complexity of AVH. We aimed to assess whether subjective perceptual and experiential characteristics may be linked to neural activation in the inner speech processing network. Methods: Twenty-two patients with schizophrenia and AVH underwent a 3 -T functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, while performing a metrical stress evaluation task, which has been shown to activate both inner speech production and perception regions. Regions of interest (ROIs) comprising the putative inner speech network were defined using the Anatomical <b>Automatic</b> <b>Labeling</b> <b>system.</b> Correlations were calculated between scores on the "loudness" and "reality" subscales of the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) and activation in these ROIs. Second, the AHRS subscales, and general AVH severity, indexed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, were correlated with a language lateralization index. Results: Louder AVH were associated with reduced task-related activity in bilateral angular gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, left insula, and left temporal cortex. This could potentially be due to a competition for shared neural resources. Reality on the other hand was found to be associated with reduced language lateralization. Conclusion: Strong activation of the inner speech processing network may contribute to the subjective loudness of AVH. However, a relatively increased contribution from right hemisphere language areas may be responsible for the more complex experiential characteristics, such as the nonself source or how real AVH are...|$|R
40|$|Facial {{expressions}} play {{an important}} role in human communication giving real substance to face-to-face interaction in real life speech. For many years researchers have been involved in automatic recognition and generation of facial expressions. Motivated by this issue, we investigate the design of a system that is able to recognize the emotional character of the speech, being able to enhance it adding facial expressions that convey its sense. The recognition is automatic which means that it doesn’t need subjective human annotations. The lexical database, Wordnet, and some scripts to access it are used to classify the emotional words in a 2 D-space. This space allows us to classify the words according to their degree of pleasure and their degree of activation. Calculating the distances between the words in this space we conclude which facial expression conveys better the emotion of speech.

40|$|The {{integration}} of electronic airport moving map displays into modern cockpits {{is a valuable}} contribution to the situational and positional awareness of pilots during taxi maneuvers. Labels are a key for {{the perception of the}} presented map. Comparing labeled map elements with airport signage enables the crew to constantly cross check their position. This reduces the risk of inadvertently entering a wrong taxiway or runway and the risk of related mishaps. The goal of this work is the development of an <b>automatic</b> map <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> for airport moving maps. The development of the system is based on a thorough analysis of structure and contents of the most comprehensive aerodrome mapping database world-wide. The design focuses on a high quality and good legibility of the computed labeling solutions. Key aspects are the display of the right information at the right point in time, an unambiguous association of labels to their related map elements, and fully deconflicted labels. The completeness and correctness of data must be guaranteed in all processing steps in order to fulfill the strict requirements for aviation use. The target format as well as required source data and display parameters are defined by analyses of existing paper charts. An expert system is used to accomplish the necessary data conversion. A hierarchical data structure is generated with levels-of-detail fitting to different map scales. Position candidates for different label types are defined based on the hierarchical data structures. The final label placement utilizes existing algorithms. The results of the presented system are demonstrated in two applications.

40|$|Organization of {{an email}} inbox can often become tedious, {{especially}} when one receives numerous emails per day. We propose an <b>automatic</b> <b>label</b> suggestion <b>system</b> for email, which uses an unsupervised approach to cluster related emails together based on both latent features, {{such as the}} semantics of the email, as well as direct features like the sender and recipients. Our approach utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic modeling technique to determine the topical distributions of each email. These latent distributions are then used as features, along with the more direct features, in the clustering of the emails via k-means clustering. Finally, labels are suggested for each cluster, using its most prominent features, to describe the emails within it. 1. Data collection Email inbox data was collected in two ways for this task. Two personal email inboxes were downloaded by the authors, consisting of approximately 6, 000 and 18, 000 emails respectively. Additionally, smaller sized inboxes {{were taken from the}} Enron email corpus. We only report tests that have been run on the smaller Enron inboxes. The data was cleaned using simple regular expressions to remove email headers and unwanted characters, such as forwarded email metadata, hyperlinks and numbers. 2. Topic Modeling We ran LDA over a number of inboxes of the Enron email dataset. We utilized the LDA implementation of the Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox 1, using the default parameters of the toolbox for 1500 iterations and 30 topics. The sizes of our inboxes varied from 971 emails to 1377. In Table 1, we demonstrate some of the topics we observed. Topic 8 shows a topic relating to financial matters, particularly about banks and lenders, while Topic 24 deals with personal, partly cheerful emails and Topic 28 is a topic about management. Despite running our tests on a very restricted corpus, there are still some clear themes that we can see in output of the topic model. ...|$|R
