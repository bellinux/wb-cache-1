5000|$|Bofors 155 Bonus ( [...] / [...] ) - submunition-carrying <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The gun {{fired the}} Type 12 high-explosive shell, which {{contained}} 41 grams of explosive, {{as well as}} an ineffective <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Panzergranate 39 or Pzgr. 39 was a German armor-piercing shell {{used during}} World War II. It was {{manufactured}} in various calibers {{and was the}} most common <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> used in German tank (German: Kampfwagenkanone; shorted to KwK) and anti-tank guns (German: Panzerabwehrkanone(n); shortened to PaK) of 37 to 88 mm caliber.|$|E
50|$|On 26 September 2015, Saudi Arabia {{announced}} that an Iranian fishing boat loaded with weapons, including rockets and <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells,</b> was intercepted and seized in the Arabian Sea, 150 {{miles southeast of}} the Omani Port of Salalah, by Arab coalition forces.|$|R
50|$|Most {{artillery}} fuzes are nose fuzes. However, base fuzes {{have been}} used with armour piercing shells and for squash head (HESH or HEP) <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells.</b> At least one nuclear shell and its non-nuclear spotting version also used a multi-deck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base.|$|R
50|$|Alexander Nadiradze {{who would}} later {{become one of the}} most {{important}} Soviet missile engineers, developed <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> during WW2. He was also among the first scientists to research and implement early Soviet turbo jet engines. After being appointed chief of an OKB he took on various other projects.|$|R
50|$|A shaped charge <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> {{was under}} {{development}} in Canada, but {{the introduction of}} the three-inch (76.2 mm) calibre QF 17 pounder, an anti-tank gun, in 1944 ended its development. After the Second World War, the UK replaced AP shot with a HESH shell. Coloured marker shells (dye and PETN) were also developed but not introduced.|$|E
50|$|Hines {{graduated}} from West Point in 1927, {{and served in}} World War II with the 6th Armored Division as a colonel, commanding the division's Combat Command A from November 1944 to March 1945. He was twice decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross and was severely wounded outside Frankfurt, Germany when an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> struck his face.|$|E
50|$|As a King's Own Scottish Borderer, Gray {{had half}} of his left foot blown off by an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> in the Second World War when in France. Working for an {{insurance}} company, he was posted to Northampton; a town at {{the centre of the}} shoe industry. Gray had special boots made and this allowed him to play rugby and also kick conversions and penalties.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{there were}} no special sea target shells, instead, regular {{fragmentation}} shells were used with timed, immediate and delayed fuses for differences in desired effect. A first attempt to develop sea target shells failed in the 1980s, with the company going bankrupt. A fresh start {{was done in the}} beginning of the 1990s for payload shells similar to some <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
50|$|Naval and <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> have to {{withstand}} the extreme shock of punching through armor plate. Shells designed for this purpose sometimes have a greatly strengthened case with a small bursting charge, and sometimes are solid metal, i.e. shot. In either case, they almost always have a specially hardened and shaped nose to facilitate penetration. These are known as armor-piercing (AP) projectiles.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht felt the need for a more mobile and more {{powerful}} anti-tank solution than the existing towed anti-tank guns, such as the Pak 36, or self-propelled tank destroyers such as the Panzerjäger I. This need became urgent in 1942, when <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> fired from said anti-tank guns failed to penetrate the armor of new Soviet tanks such as the T-34 and KV-1.|$|R
50|$|This gun used HE shells {{from the}} 7.5 cm Gebirgsgeschütz (Mountain Gun) 36 and the <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> of the 7.5 cm Feldkanone 16, neuer Art (Field Cannon, New Model). This meant that its {{ammunition}} {{could not be}} optimized {{to benefit from the}} peculiar ballistic characteristics of recoilless weapons. On the other hand, it saved significant research time and effort and meant that existing production lines and stocks of shells could be used at a considerable saving.|$|E
5000|$|Goldman {{worked for}} Smith, Hinchman & Grylls in Detroit as a {{principal}} designer of ammunition. An electrical engineer with a Master's degree in business engineering, Goldman designed and developed the 155 mm howitzer <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> during World War II that allowed the Allied Forces to turn the 1944 tide against Germany's [...] "invincible" [...] Tiger tanks. He later worked as an executive with both Federal Engineering and Fisher Body in Detroit, retiring in 1965. He then resumed his teaching career at Oakland Community College in 1970, teaching math until he finally retired for good in 1995 {{at the age of}} 85.|$|E
5000|$|High-explosive, squash-head (HESH) {{is another}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> {{based on the}} use of explosive. A {{thin-walled}} shell case contains a large charge of a plastic explosive. On impact the explosive flattens, without detonating, against the face of the armour, and is then detonated by a fuze in the base of the shell. Energy is transferred through the armour plate: when the compressive shock reflects off the air/metal interface on the inner face of the armour, it is transformed into a tension wave which spalls a [...] "scab" [...] of metal off into the tank damaging the equipment and crew without actually penetrating the armour.|$|E
5000|$|AP shells with a {{bursting}} charge were sometimes distinguished by appending the suffix [...] "HE". At {{the beginning of}} the Second World War, solid shot AP projectiles were common. As the war progressed, ordnance design evolved so that APHE became the more common design approach for <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> of 75 mm caliber and larger, and more common in naval shell design as well. In modern ordnance, most full caliber AP shells are APHE designs.|$|R
50|$|The Medium Mark I successor, the Vickers Medium Mk II {{combined}} some of {{the best}} traits of WWI tanks into a much faster tank. It was derived from the Vickers Medium Mark I, and was developed to replace the last of the Medium Mark Cs still in use. It had a fully rotating turret on top like the FT, but mounted a dual-use 3-pounder gun (that could fire both high-explosive and <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells)</b> with a coaxial machine gun.|$|R
25|$|The {{corvette}} then {{carried out}} her second {{thrust into the}} cove, and at 11:55 opened fire. To her commander's disappointment, the 20mm guns jammed after the first shot, and the 40mm mounting after firing just six rounds. The 100mm gun became useless after the first shot. Completely exposed, the warship {{had no other choice}} but to go ahead in order to put about. At 11:59, the corvette was hit by small arms fire and 84 mm Carl Gustav <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{turned down}} for {{military}} service due to a duodenal ulcer, Gray later managed to enlist in the Gordon Highlanders, who had their barracks in Aberdeen, and succeeded in becoming what he called an [...] "ordinary Jock" [...] (having claimed some Scottish ancestry). In 1941, he was commissioned into the King's Own Scottish Borderers, becoming battalion education officer at Llanberis in North Wales. Gray left the Army briefly to appear with Dame Vera Lynn in the film We'll Meet Again (1943). In 1944, he was injured by a German <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> in Caen, France and his left arm was amputated.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, in the US, a {{half-inch}} high velocity round was being developed for use against aircraft. It {{would be used}} with the Browning-designed [...]50 calibre machine gun. This round was based on current US [...]30-06 calibre infantry ammunition. When word of the German <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> spread, there was some debate as to if it should be copied and used {{as a base for}} the new machine gun cartridge. However, after some analysis the German ammunition was ruled out, as its performance was inferior to the modified Springfield [...]30-06 round and was semi-rimmed, making it difficult to feed into an automatic weapon. The Browning M2 [...]50 cal machine gun would, however, go on to function as an anti-armour machine gun.|$|E
50|$|Two months later, on 17 January 1944, Mariya {{fought in}} another night attack {{that was her}} last. The attack {{happened}} at the village of Shvedy near Vitebsk. During the battle, she drove T-34 about the German defenses, destroyed resistance in trenches and machine-gun nests. The tank crew also destroyed a German self-propelled gun. Their success didn't last long however, and tank {{was hit by a}} German <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell,</b> again in the tracks and was immobilized. Mariya immediately got out of the tank and began to repair the track, amid fierce small arms and artillery fire. She managed to repair the track, but she was hit in the head by shell fragments and lost consciousness. After the battle Oktyabrskaya was transported to a Soviet military field hospital at Fastov, near Kiev, where she remained in a coma for two months, before finally dying on 15 March. The following August, Oktyabrskaya was posthumously awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union award in recognition of her bravery in the battles around Vitebsk.|$|E
25|$|The main {{by-product}} of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the U-238 isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some {{is used in}} applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells,</b> and {{on at least one}} occasion even a sailboat keel. It is also used with plutonium for making mixed oxide fuel (MOX) and to dilute, or downblend, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.|$|R
50|$|The AML-245 {{was once}} {{regarded}} as one of the most heavily armed scout vehicles in service, fitted with a low velocity DEFA D921 90mm (3.54 in) rifled cannon firing conventional high explosive and high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells,</b> or a 60mm (2.36 in) breech loading mortar with 53 rounds and dual 7.5mm MAS AA-52 NF-1 machine guns with 3,800 rounds, all mounted coaxially in the turret. An AML is capable of destroying targets at 1,500 meters with its D921 main gun. In this configuration it is considered a match for second-line and older main battle tanks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, {{one year}} after Georgia adopted its post-USSR Constitution, the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs began a {{campaign}} to detain tons of religious literature belonging to Jehovah's Witnesses. Government officials refused permits for Jehovah's Witnesses to organize assemblies, {{and law enforcement officials}} dispersed legal assemblies. In September 2000, [...] "Georgian police and security officials fired blank <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> and used force to disperse an outdoor gathering of some 700 Jehovah's Witnesses in the town of Natuliki in northwestern Georgia on 8 September, AP and Caucasus Press reported." ...|$|R
50|$|Some French {{guns were}} modernized between the wars, {{in part to}} adapt them for {{anti-tank}} fire, resulting in the Canon de 75 Mle 1897/33 which fired a high-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell.</b> Many were captured by Germany during the Fall of France in 1940, in addition to Polish guns captured in 1939. Over 3,500 were modified with a muzzle brake and mounted on a 5 cm Pak 38 carriage, now named 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 they were used by the Wehrmacht in 1942 as an emergency weapon against the Soviet Union's T-34 and KV tanks. Its relatively low velocity {{and a lack of}} modern armor-piercing ammunition limited its effectiveness as an anti-tank weapon. When the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 became available in sufficient numbers, most remaining Pak 97/38 pieces were returned to occupied France to reinforce the Atlantic Wall defenses or were supplied to Axis nations like Romania and Hungary. Non-modified remainders were used as second-line and coastal artillery pieces under the German designation 7.5 cm FK 231(f) and 7,5 cm FK 97(p).|$|E
50|$|Late on 22 March {{the three}} German {{divisions}} assembled at Jeno, a town midway between lakes Velence and Balaton and 12 km from safety. A narrow gap still existed, {{through which the}} Germans intended to break out, but the Soviet units had brought up anti-tank guns into blocking positions and could sweep the entire corridor with artillery, mortar and machine gun fire. The German units created mixed columns, with the few remaining tanks in the lead, followed by armoured infantry, the divisional commands, artillery, supply units and rearguards, with more infantry on the flanks. In the darkness the columns set off and finally reached friendly lines by dawn. Disaster had been averted but for the 44th the cost had been heavy; the division commander, van Rost, was killed {{along with some of}} his staff, when the armoured half-track he was travelling in was hit by an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> and destroyed. Overall 65 officers from the division, had in two days fighting been killed, captured or badly injured, and the infantry had suffered severe losses overcoming the Soviet units blocking positions. Intact but badly mauled, the division retreated rapidly back towards Radkersburgf on the Austrian frontier.|$|E
5000|$|Palestinian {{historian}} Aref al-Aref {{placed the}} death toll at 426, including 179 he said were later killed {{in one of the}} mosques, during a confusing incident that sources variously refer to as a massacre or a battle. Thousands of male Muslim detainees had been taken to two of the mosques the day before. Christian detainees had been taken to the church or a nearby Greek Orthodox monastery, leaving the Muslims in fear of a massacre. Morris writes that some of them tried to break out, thinking they were about to be killed, and in response the IDF threw grenades and fired anti-tank rockets into one of the mosque compounds. Kadish and Sela say it was a firefight that broke out between armed militiamen inside the mosque and Israeli soldiers outside and responding to attacks originating from the mosque, the Israelis fired an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shell</b> into it, then stormed it, killing 30 militia men inside. In 2013, in testimony provided to Zochrot, Yerachmiel Kahanovich, a Palmach fighter present on the scene, stated he himself, amid the shelling of a mosque, had fired a PIAT anti-tank missile with enormous shock wave impact inside the mosque, and on examining it afterwards found the walls scattered with the remains of people. He also stated that anyone straying from the flight trail was shot dead. [...] According to Morris, dozens died, including unarmed men, women and children; an eyewitness published a memoir in 1998 saying he had removed 95 bodies from one of the mosques.|$|E
50|$|Basically {{a guided}} {{anti-tank}} mortar munition, the KSTAM flies {{with the energy}} applied to it from the firing of the munition from the main gun. It does not possess any kind of propellants, {{and should not be}} confused as a missile or a rocket. The trajectory of the munition is curved, giving it a mortar- or artillery-like capability to strike targets taking cover behind obstacles. Its main use is to destroy entrenched and/or covered enemy vehicles that are unreachable with regular <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> due to the restrictions in terrain and/or hazards imposed upon the friendly vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Wickrematunge's {{assassination}} {{caused a}} national frenzy being the country's most influential media personnel {{and one of}} the biggest political figures and raised questions about freedom of expression in the country. Wickrematunge's murder was widely condemned across the world. The Daily Mirror called it the [...] "biggest blow" [...] to media freedom in Sri Lanka, and the Editors Guild held the government responsible for the killing as it has failed to stop attacks against media personnel. The government also expressed shock at the killing, pledging to do everything in its power to catch his killers.Wickrematunge had been on Amnesty International's endangered list since 1998, when <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> were fired on his house.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{design was}} the Vickers Medium Mk II, a pivotal design which {{combined}} {{some of the}} best traits of World War I tanks into a much faster tank. It had a fully rotating turret on top like the FT, but mounted a dual-use 3-pounder gun (that could fire both high-explosive and <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells)</b> with a coaxial machine gun. It also had a radio, a machine-gunner position {{in the front of the}} hull, and some limited use of sloped armour. Some of these tanks would go on to serve in World War II, though most of the significance of the design lies in the amount of features that were copied (or at least also used) in later tank designs.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{simplest}} plastic explosives was Nobel's Explosive No. 808, also known as Nobel 808 (often just called Explosive 808 in the British Armed Forces during the Second World War), developed by the British company Nobel Chemicals Ltd well before World War II. It had the appearance of green plasticine with a distinctive smell of almonds. During World War II it was extensively used by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) for sabotage missions. It is also the explosive used in HESH <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> and was an essential factor in the devising of the Gammon grenade. Captured SOE-supplied Nobel 808 was the explosive used in the failed 20 July plot assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler in 1944.|$|R
25|$|Wittmann led a {{group of}} seven Tiger tanks, from the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, {{supported}} by additional tanks and infantry. His group of Tigers, crossing open terrain towards the high ground, was ambushed by tanks from A Squadron 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, A Squadron Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, and B Squadron 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps. During the ambush, <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells</b> – fired from either the British or Canadian tanks – penetrated the upper hull of Wittmann's tank, igniting the ammunition. The resulting fire engulfed the tank and blew off the turret. The crew of the destroyed tank were buried in an unmarked grave. In 1983, the German war graves commission located the burial site. Wittmann and his crew were reinterred together at the La Cambe German war cemetery in France.|$|R
2500|$|Around this period, Yemeni {{officials}} {{claimed to}} have captured a boat in the Red Sea that was transporting <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells.</b> Five Iranian [...] "instructors" [...] were also captured. [...] Various official Iranian sources responded, calling it a politically motivated fabrication and stating that the ship was traveling for business activities carrying no consignment. In Saana, the government shut down an Iranian sponsored hospital on suspicion {{that some of the}} staff, which included eight Iranians, were providing aid to the rebels. Government officials claimed that services were closed down due to a delay in rent payments, but security surrounded and blocked off patients from receiving aid. As the Hajj approached during the month of November, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad noted that [...] "appropriate measures" [...] would be taken in case Iranian pilgrims faced restrictions.|$|R
50|$|When {{unable to}} escape the Ruhr pocket, Carius ordered the guns of the {{remaining}} Jagdtigers destroyed and surrendered to American forces. The 10 Jagdtigers of 2nd Company, Panzerjagerabteilung 512 destroyed one American tank for one Jagdtiger lost to combat, one lost to friendly fire, and eight others lost to breakdown or destroyed by their crews to prevent capture.On 17 January 1945, two Jagdtigers used by XIV Corps engaged a bunker line in support of infantry near Auenheim. On 18 January, they attacked four secure bunkers at 1,000 meters. The armored cupola of one bunker burned out after two shots. A Sherman attacking in a counter-thrust was set afire by explosive shells. The total combat included 46 explosive <b>shells</b> and 10 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells,</b> with no losses to the Jagdtigers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of artillery}} contact fuze is a soft metal {{nose to the}} shell, filled with a fulminating explosive such as lead azide. An example is the British World War II Fuze, Percussion, D.A., No. 233 ('direct action') The primary explosive transmits its detonation to an explosive booster within the fuze, then in turn to the main charge of the shell. As an artillery shell lands with a considerable impact, the [...] "soft" [...] nose may be made robust enough to be adequately safe for careful handling, without requiring any protection cap or safety mechanism. As a matter of normal practice though, fuzes and shells are transported separately and the fuze is only installed shortly prior to use. These simple contact fuzes are generally used for <b>anti-tank</b> <b>shells,</b> rather than high-explosive.|$|R
