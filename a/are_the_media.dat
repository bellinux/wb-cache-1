The Tower Buildings are home to the public entrance of the Scottish Parliament and to the Main Hall which {{is located on the}} eastern side of the parliamentary complex, beneath the debating chamber. [...] A stone vaulted ceiling is the principal feature of the Main Hall, which has cross like representations carved into it, reminiscent of the Saltire—the national flag of Scotland. The main hall contains permanent exhibitions on the role of the Scottish Parliament, as well as public seating, a visitor information desk, a shop, lockers and a creche. Like much of the parliamentary complex, the materials used to construct the Main Hall and its vaulted ceiling include Kemnay Granite from Aberdeenshire in north east Scotland and Caithness stone which is used in much of the flooring in the buildings. Connected to the Tower Buildings in the eastern portion of the complex <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Media</b> and Canongate Buildings, which house the IT and procurement departments of the Parliament, as well as media offices and the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe). The centrepiece of the Canongate Building is a two-storey cantilever structure, with the building connected at one end by reinforced concrete and 18 metres (60ft) of the building suspended above ground and protruding outwards unsupported by any columns.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper audits the {{newspapers}} of Swaziland {{in the context}} of their abilities to encourage and foster good governance. Swaziland, a non-democracy with an ailing economy, severe poverty and the highest HIV/AIDS rate in the world, is in crisis. Freedoms of the press, expression and association are restricted. The paper sets out four research questions: (i) How pluralistic is media ownership? (ii) How independent <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> from government? (iii) How representative <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> of different opinions and how accessible are they to different sections of society, including poor and vulnerable groups and political parties? (iv) What are the capacities of Swazi journalists and where might there be areas for development? The paper utilizes a content analysis of the editorial of the kingdom’s two daily newspapers identifying the main news agendas and also the sources of information that journalists rely on for their reports. In addition, contributions from journalistic practitioners give valuable insights into the realities of working in the media under restrictions. The paper concludes that there is much still to be done in Swaziland before the news media can be said to be fully contributing to fostering and encouraging good governance in the kingdom...|$|E
