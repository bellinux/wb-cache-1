5|$|Anti-vitamins are {{chemical}} compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins. For example, <b>avidin</b> is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits {{the absorption of}} biotin; it is deactivated by cooking. Pyrithiamine, a synthetic compound, has a molecular structure similar to thiamine, vitamin B1, and inhibits the enzymes that use thiamine.|$|E
25|$|Raw {{egg whites}} contain a protein (<b>avidin)</b> that blocks the {{absorption}} of biotin, so people who regularly consume {{a large number of}} eggs may become biotin-deficient. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be 35 to 70micrograms per day (143–287nmol per day).|$|E
25|$|Biotin binds {{tightly to}} the tetrameric protein <b>avidin</b> (also {{streptavidin}} and neutravidin), with a dissociation constant Kd {{on the order}} of 10−15 M, {{which is one of the}} strongest known protein-ligand interactions. This is often used in different biotechnological applications. Until 2005, very harsh conditions were thought to be required to break the biotin-streptavidin bond.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, with a {{succession}} of students and postdocs, the lab developed a series of chemical, photochemical, and cross-link labels for determining the position and relationships of proteins in biological membranes (...) , including glutaraldehyde and what {{was one of the}} two first general uses of the exceptionally tight interaction of biotin with <b>avidin,</b> anchored to ferritin for use in electron microscopy. [...] The biotin–avidin system quickly became a central method in cell biology, immunology, and protein engineering, as well as electron microscopy.|$|E
2500|$|Sub-picomolar {{dissociation}} constants as {{a result}} of non-covalent binding interactions between two molecules are rare. [...] Nevertheless, there are some important exceptions. [...] Biotin and <b>avidin</b> bind with a dissociation constant of roughly 10−15 M = 1 fM = 0.000001 nM.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin {{is widely}} used {{throughout}} the biotechnology industry to conjugate proteins for biochemical assays. Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein {{will most likely be}} unaffected. This process is called biotinylation. Because both streptavidin and <b>avidin</b> bind biotin with high affinity (Kd of [...] 10−14mol/l to 10−15mol/l) and specificity, biotinylated proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. [...] The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the biotinylated protein of interest. [...] Any other proteins binding to the biotinylated molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away. [...] However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads (typically 6M guanidine HCl at pH1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest. [...] To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric <b>avidin</b> can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ~10−8mol/l, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.|$|E
50|$|As a {{basically}} charged glycoprotein, <b>avidin</b> exhibits {{non-specific binding}} in some applications. Neutravidin, a deglycosylated <b>avidin</b> with modified arginines, exhibits a more neutral isoelectric point (pI) {{and is available}} {{as an alternative to}} native <b>avidin,</b> whenever problems of non-specific binding arise. Deglycosylated, neutral forms of <b>avidin</b> are available through Sigma-Aldrich (Extravidin), Thermo Scientific (NeutrAvidin), Invitrogen (NeutrAvidin), and e-Proteins (NeutraLite).|$|E
5000|$|Raw eggs {{should be}} avoided in those with biotin deficiency, because egg whites contain high levels of the anti-nutrient <b>avidin.</b> The name <b>avidin</b> {{literally}} means that this protein has an [...] "avidity" [...] (Latin: [...] "to eagerly long for") for biotin. <b>Avidin</b> binds irreversibly to biotin and this compound is then excreted in the urine.|$|E
50|$|Streptavidin is not {{the only}} protein capable of binding to biotin with high affinity. <b>Avidin</b> is the other most notable biotin-binding protein. Originally {{isolated}} from egg yolk, <b>avidin</b> only has 30% sequence identity to streptavidin, but almost identical secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. It has a higher affinity for biotin (Kd ~ 10−15M) but in contrast to streptavidin, it is glycosylated, positively charged, has pseudo-catalytic activity (it can enhance the alkaline hydrolysis of an ester linkage between biotin and a nitrophenyl group) and has a higher tendency for aggregation. Also, streptavidin is the better biotin-conjugate binder; <b>avidin</b> has a lower binding affinity than streptavidin when biotin is conjugated to another molecule, despite <b>avidin</b> having the higher affinity for free, unconjugated biotin. Because streptavidin lacks any carbohydrate modification and has a near-neutral pI, it has the advantage of much lower nonspecific binding than <b>avidin.</b> Deglycosylated <b>avidin</b> (NeutrAvidin) is more comparable to the size, pI, and nonspecific binding of streptavidin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avidin</b> is a tetrameric biotin-binding protein {{produced}} in the oviducts of birds, reptiles and amphibians and deposited in the whites of their eggs. There are also dimeric members of the <b>avidin</b> family found in some bacteria. In chicken egg white, <b>avidin</b> makes up approximately 0.05% of total protein (approximately 180 μg per egg). The tetrameric protein contains four identical subunits (homotetramer), each of which can bind to biotin (Vitamin B7, vitamin H) {{with a high degree}} of affinity and specificity. The dissociation constant of <b>avidin</b> is measured to be KD ≈ 10−15 M, making it one of the strongest known non-covalent bonds.|$|E
5000|$|The thermal {{stability}} and biotin binding activity of <b>avidin</b> are of both practical and theoretical interest to researchers, as avidin's stability is unusually high and <b>avidin</b> is an antinutrient in human food. A 1966 {{study published in}} Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications found that the structure of <b>avidin</b> remains stable at temperatures below [...] Above , avidin's structure is rapidly disrupted and by , extensive loss of structure and ability to bind biotin is found. A 1991 assay for the Journal of Food Science detected substantial <b>avidin</b> activity in cooked egg white: [...] "mean residual <b>avidin</b> activity in fried, poached and boiled (2 min) egg white was 33, 71 and 40% of the activity in raw egg white." [...] The assay surmised that cooking times were not sufficient to adequately heat all cold spot areas within the egg white. Complete inactivation of avidin's biotin binding capacity required boiling for over 4 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|A 1992 {{study found}} that thermal {{inactivation}} of the biotin binding activity of <b>avidin</b> was described by D121 °C = 25 min and z = 33 °C. The study disagreed with prior assumptions [...] "that the binding site of <b>avidin</b> is destroyed on heat denaturation".|$|E
50|$|In its tetrameric form, <b>avidin</b> is {{estimated}} to be between 66-69 kDa in size. 10% of the molecular weight is attributed to carbohydrate content composed of four to five mannose and three N-acetylglucosamine residues. The carbohydrate moieties of <b>avidin</b> contain at least three unique oligosaccharide structural types that are similar in structure and composition.|$|E

50|$|The biotin-binding {{properties}} of <b>avidin</b> were exploited {{during the development}} of idrabiotaparinux, a long-acting low molecular weight heparin used {{in the treatment of}} venous thrombosis. Due to the long-acting nature of idraparinux, concerns were made about the clinical management of bleeding complications. By adding a biotin moiety to the idraparinux molecule, idrabiotaparinux was formed; its anticoagulant activity in the setting of a bleeding event can be reversed through an intravenous infusion of <b>avidin.</b>|$|E

50|$|NeutrAvidin {{protein is}} a deglycosylated version of <b>avidin,</b> {{with a mass}} of {{approximately}} 60,000 daltons. As a result of carbohydrate removal, lectin binding is reduced to undetectable levels, yet biotin binding affinity is retained because the carbohydrate is not necessary for this activity. <b>Avidin</b> has a high pI but NeutrAvidin has a near-neutral pI (pH 6.3), minimizing non-specific interactions with the negatively charged cell surface or with DNA/RNA. Neutravidin still has lysine residues that remain available for derivatization or conjugation.|$|E
50|$|The {{extremely}} strong complexation between <b>avidin</b> and biotin is {{instrumental in}} blood clotting, {{and has been}} used as the recognition motif to construct synthetic systems.|$|E
50|$|In captivity, tegus {{commonly}} are fed {{high protein}} diets that include raw or cooked flesh, eggs, insects, and small rodents. The inclusion of fruit {{in the diet}} is recommended, though many captive tegus do not readily eat fruit. However, there is evidence that, as in most husbandry of carnivores, it is good practice to cook most of the egg in the diet, so as to denature the protein <b>avidin,</b> that occurs in the albumen. Raw <b>avidin</b> immobilises biotin, so excessive feeding of raw eggs may cause fatal biotin deficiency.|$|E
50|$|Research in the 1970s helped {{establish}} the avidin-biotin {{system as a}} powerful tool in biological sciences. Aware of the strength and specificity of the avidin-biotin complex, researchers began to exploit <b>avidin</b> and streptavidin as probes and affinity matrices in numerous research projects. Soon after, researchers Bayer and Wilchek developed new methods and reagents to biotinylate antibodies and other biomolecules, allowing {{the transfer of the}} avidin-biotin system to a range of biotechnological applications. Today, <b>avidin</b> is used in applications ranging from research and diagnostics to medical devices and pharmaceuticals.|$|E

50|$|Functional <b>avidin</b> {{is found}} only in raw egg, as the biotin avidity of the protein is {{destroyed}} by cooking. The natural function of <b>avidin</b> in eggs is not known, {{although it has been}} postulated {{to be made in the}} oviduct as a bacterial growth-inhibitor, by binding biotin helpful for bacterial growth. As evidence for this, streptavidin, a loosely related protein with equal biotin affinity and a very similar binding site, is made by certain strains of Streptomyces bacteria, and is thought to serve to inhibit the growth of competing bacteria, in the manner of an antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|A non-glycosylated form of <b>avidin</b> {{has been}} {{isolated}} from commercially prepared product; however, {{it is not}} conclusive {{as to whether the}} non-glycosylated form occurs naturally or {{is a product of the}} manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>avidin</b> itself, NeutrAvidin is a tetramer with {{a strong}} {{affinity}} for biotin (Kd = 10−15 M). In biochemical applications, streptavidin, which also binds very tightly to biotin, may be used interchangeably with NeutrAvidin.|$|E
5000|$|Snell's {{interest}} in isolating and characterizing unknown nutrients and growth factors {{also led to}} the serendipitous discovery of useful biochemical tools. While working to characterize the yeast growth factor that would become known as biotin, Snell and coworkers discovered the egg white protein <b>avidin,</b> which binds biotin with extremely high affinity. At the time <b>avidin</b> was noted {{as a cause of}} [...] "egg white injury", a form of biotin deficiency in animals. The rarity and expense of obtaining biotin at the time limited further investigations, but the extremely high avidin-biotin binding affinity was later exploited and is now widely used in molecular biology for purification and molecular detection applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avidin</b> immobilized onto solid {{supports}} is {{also used}} as purification media to capture biotin-labelled protein or nucleic acid molecules. For example, cell surface proteins can be specifically labelled with membrane-impermeable biotin reagent, then specifically captured using a NeutrAvidin support.|$|E
50|$|Anti-vitamins are {{chemical}} compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins. For example, <b>avidin</b> is a protein in egg whites that inhibits {{the absorption of}} biotin. Pyrithiamine is similar to thiamine, vitamin B1, and inhibits the enzymes that use thiamine.|$|E
50|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{nutritional disorder}} which can become serious, even fatal, if allowed to progress untreated. It can occur in people of any age, ancestry, or gender. Biotin {{is part of the}} B vitamin family.Biotin deficiency rarely occurs among healthy people because the daily requirement of biotin is low, many foods provide adequate amounts of it, intestinal bacteria synthesize small amounts of it, and the body effectively scavenges and recycles it from bodily waste. However, deficiencies can be caused by consuming raw egg whites over a period of months to years. Egg whites contain high levels of <b>avidin,</b> a protein that binds biotin strongly. When cooked, <b>avidin</b> is partially denatured and binding to biotin is reduced. However one study showed that 30-40% of the <b>avidin</b> activity was still present in the white after frying or boiling. But cooked egg whites are safer to consume. Genetic disorders such as Biotinidase deficiency, Multiple carboxylase deficiency, and Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency can also lead to inborn or late-onset forms of biotin deficiency. In all cases - dietary, genetic, or otherwise - supplementation with biotin is the primary method of treatment.|$|E
50|$|In biochemistry, {{biotinylation}} is {{the process}} of covalently attaching biotin to a protein, nucleic acid or other molecule. Biotinylation is rapid, specific and is unlikely to perturb the natural function of the molecule due to the small size of biotin (MW = 244.31 g/mol). Biotin binds to streptavidin and <b>avidin</b> with an extremely high affinity, fast on-rate, and high specificity, and these interactions are exploited in many areas of biotechnology to isolate biotinylated molecules of interest. Biotin-binding to streptavidin and <b>avidin</b> is resistant to extremes of heat, pH and proteolysis, making capture of biotinylated molecules possible {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Also, multiple biotin molecules can be conjugated to a protein of interest, which allows binding of multiple streptavidin, <b>avidin</b> or Neutravidin protein molecules and increases the sensitivity of detection of the protein of interest. There is a large number of biotinylation reagents available that exploit the wide range of possible labelling methods. Due to the strong affinity between biotin and streptavidin, the purification of biotinylated proteins has been a widely used approach to identify protein-protein interactions and post-translational events such as ubiquitylation in molecular biology.|$|E
50|$|In pretargeted radioimmunotherapy, two {{or three}} {{medications}} are applied in succession. At first, an antibody-drug conjugate is administered, which consists of a monoclonal antibody designed to target the tumour, and a chemical marker which {{in the case of}} DOTA-biotin therapy is one of the proteins <b>avidin</b> and streptavidin. After a time of typically one or two days to let the antibody accumulate in the tumour, a clearing agent may be given to eliminate residues of antibody that are still circulating in the bloodstream; this is especially done in humans. After a further waiting time, the radiotherapy (90Y-DOTA-biotin) is administered. Due to the high affinity of biotin to <b>avidin</b> and streptavidin, the radiotherapy accumulates where the antibody is, namely in the tumour, where it delivers its radioactivity.|$|E
50|$|Proteins {{are capable}} of forming very tight complexes. For example, {{ribonuclease}} inhibitor binds to ribonuclease A with a roughly 20 fM dissociation constant. Other proteins have evolved to bind specifically to unusual moieties on another protein, e.g., biotin groups (<b>avidin),</b> phosphorylated tyrosines (SH2 domains) or proline-rich segments (SH3 domains).|$|E
50|$|Raw {{egg whites}} contain a protein (<b>avidin)</b> that blocks the {{absorption}} of biotin, so people who regularly consume {{a large number of}} eggs may become biotin-deficient. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be 35 to 70 micrograms per day (143-287 nmol per day).|$|E
50|$|Several {{proteins}} {{were brought}} to market as research and bioproduction reagents, mostly by Sigma-Aldrich. ProdiGene struck agreements with Sigma to distribute ProdiGene's corn-produced aprotinin, trypsin, beta-glucuronidase (GUS), and <b>avidin.</b> Large Scale Biology and SIgma agreed that Sigma would distribute LSBC's tobacco-produced aprotinin. Sigma also agreed to distribute Ventria's rise-produced Lactoferrin and Lysozyme.|$|E
50|$|Biotin binds {{tightly to}} the tetrameric protein <b>avidin</b> (also {{streptavidin}} and neutravidin), with a dissociation constant Kd {{on the order}} of 10−15 M, {{which is one of the}} strongest known protein-ligand interactions.
