40|$|Up to now, {{the process}} of <b>adjusting</b> <b>clamping</b> devices in car body {{manufacturing}} {{has been driven by}} expertise; it has been repeated in costly iterations until the necessary quality has been achieved. Absent appropriate methods, even the high-performance numerical representations of this process have only been able to support this process to a limited extent. This paper outlines a method to assist the adjustment activities carried out on machinery based on numerically represented model functions, which will subsequently improve the usability of FE simulations during the machinery ramp-up...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{constructional}} design of the industry dryer meant {{for the production of}} the current and voltage transformers of the KPB Intra s. r. o. company. The basic theory of the drying and the heat balance of the dryer are processed in this thesis, and also the brief overview of the constructional solutions of the industry dryers and their usage. In detail it focuses on the constructional possibilities of the chosen dryer for the given application. Essential parts of the thesis are the constructional calculations for the power determination of the ventilator, heating units, condensational units, the exchanger, engine with transmission and the calculations for the mechanism dimensioning of the shelf <b>adjusting,</b> <b>clamping</b> case and the springs for the chain stretching. Last but not least it consists of the technical-economical evaluation of the suggested solution and its risk analysis. Drawing documentation, 3 D model and the animation of its moving components form also the part of this thesis...|$|R
25|$|A {{carbon pile}} {{resistor}} {{is made of}} a stack of carbon disks compressed between two metal contact plates. <b>Adjusting</b> the <b>clamping</b> pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters. A carbon pile resistor {{can also be used}} as a speed control for small motors in household appliances (sewing machines, hand-held mixers) with ratings up to a few hundred watts. A carbon pile resistor can be incorporated in automatic voltage regulators for generators, where the carbon pile controls the field current to maintain relatively constant voltage. The principle is also applied in the carbon microphone.|$|R
40|$|The MC 33364 {{series are}} {{variable}} frequency SMPS controllers that {{operate in the}} critical conduction mode. They are optimized for high density power supplies requiring minimum board area, reduced component count, and low power dissipation. Integration of the high voltage startup saves approximately 0. 7 W of power compared {{to the value of}} the resistor bootstrapped circuits. Each MC 33364 features an on−board reference, UVLO function, a watchdog timer to initiate output switching, a zero current detector to ensure critical conduction operation, a current sensing comparator, leading edge blanking, a CMOS driver and cycle−by−cycle current limiting. The MC 33364 D 1 has an internal 126 kHz frequency clamp. The MC 33364 D 2 is available without an internal frequency clamp. The MC 33364 D has an internal 126 kHz frequency clamp which is pinned out, so that the designer can <b>adjust</b> the <b>clamp</b> frequency by connectin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of small clamping eccentricity on the measurement and evaluation of involute profile, analyzes the cause of clamping eccentric error, establishes a clamping eccentric error compensation model, and introduces a computing method of clamping eccentric parameters. Experimental testing of the computing method of clamping eccentric parameters proves that the computing method of clamping eccentric parameters is correct and feasible when the clamping eccentric value is within {{three quarters of the}} measurement range of the probe. The results of the clamping eccentricity error compensation experiment show that the clamping eccentric error compensation model can compensate measurement results to the results attained under operating conditions, and achieve precision measurement of involute profiles. The highest allowed clamping eccentric value can be extended to three quarters of the measurement range of the probe by the clamping eccentricity error compensation model proposed in this paper, thereby saving time otherwise spent <b>adjusting</b> for <b>clamping</b> eccentricity...|$|R
40|$|During anaesthesia, {{drugs are}} {{frequently}} adminis-tered i. v. via the self-sealing rubber injection site at the patient {{end of an}} i. v. administration set. If, during surgery, {{the position of the}} i. v. cannula is inaccessible, the injection site can be moved to a more convenient place by the use of extension tubing. When this was done during clinical investigations involving neostigmine, it was noted that, on several occasions following its injection, there was an unexpected delay of over 6 min before the effect of neostigmine was seen. Therefore it was decided to investigate the delivery time of drugs injected via extension tubing and to see how this varied with the rate of the i. v. infusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental investigation A 1 -litre container of physiological saline was connected to a cannula (Abbocath 16 -gauge) via a standard i. v. fluid administration set (Avon Medicals type A 100) and extension tubing (Avon Medicals type A 60, length 1250 mm, volume 15 ml) as shown in figure 1. The infusion rate was controlled over a wide range by raising or lowering the bag of saline and <b>adjusting</b> a gate <b>clamp</b> on the tubing of the giving set. Injections were made with physiological saline coloured with bromophenol blue, the concentration of which was measured by absorption at 590 nm on a u. v. spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments type CE 595). The following procedure was used to establish the delivery time of a given fraction of the injectate. First, the nominal infusion rate was set by <b>adjusting</b> the gate <b>clamp</b> on the tubing (fig. 1) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} used version of the spigot gun was the tree spigot gun. This had its spigot mounted on a {{ball and socket joint}} {{attached}} to a large wood screw. A pair of handles were provided to turn the screw so that it could be secured in a tree or other suitable wooden support; one of the handles had a chisel-shaped end for removing bark from trees. When this had been done, a sighting tool could be placed on the spigot, and the spigot was then <b>adjusted</b> and <b>clamped</b> into position. The sight was then removed and replaced with the mortar projectile. The weapon was fired by pulling on a lanyard, by a trip wire as part of a booby trap or by a pencil detonator delay mechanism. The tree spigot had a range of 200 yd. As part of a booby trap, it could be positioned to fire downwards onto the relatively thin armour on top of a tank. One account of its use describes a trip wire for a locomotive; placed up high it was likely to be missed by track walkers looking for bombs on the railway line.|$|R
50|$|The wash phase {{begins when}} the wash bowl is {{appropriately}} filled with red cells. The pump continues a counterclockwise rotation and <b>clamps</b> <b>adjust,</b> enabling {{the transfer of}} wash solution to the wash bowl. The washing phase removes cellular stromata, plasma free hemoglobin, anticoagulant solution, activated clotting factors, any plasma bound antibiotics, intracellular enzymes, plasma, platelets, and white cells. The unwanted fluid passes out of the wash bowl and into a waste reservoir bag. Washing continues until the reinfuse button is depressed (or the program ends, {{in the case of}} an automatic device) and the appropriate amount of wash solution has been delivered to the wash bowl. The wash phase is terminated when one to two liters of wash solution has been transferred, or the fluid transferred to the waste bag appears transparent (or both).|$|R
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} the Iron Cobra {{was known for}} adjustability. Through all the generations, the pedal has {{had the ability to}} adjust the footboard angle independently of the beater shaft angle, adjust the beater head angle, <b>adjust</b> the hoop <b>clamp</b> size, <b>adjust</b> the beater shaft length, adjust the feel of the beater with a sliding weight, and adjust the spring tension. Not all of these adjustments are universally possible on all other pedals from other manufacturers. The cam shape is not adjustable on the Iron Cobra, except on the third gen. duo-glide model, but the pedal has historically been offered with two different optional cams. The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a kevlar strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case.|$|R
50|$|When engaged, an {{automatic}} wire stripper first simultaneously grips the wire in {{one side and}} in the other side closes its shaped blades cutting the insulation around the conductor. After the sides have completed their strokes {{the two sides of the}} mechanism spread apart to push the cut tube of insulation from the end of the conductor. To use it, one simply places the wire in the jaws at the cutting slot matching the size of the conductor and squeezes the handles together. This device allows even a novice to strip most wires very quickly. The automatic wire stripper's cutter must be short, because it causes the jaws to twist, as described by Wood in the 1943 patent. All wire strippers are inherently limited to those wire sizes the cutting jaw notches will accommodate. An automatic wire stripper's short cutter limits it to fewer notches and a smaller range of wire sizes than most other types of wire strippers. The accuracy of the cutting blade opening determines the smallest conductor that can be reliably stripped. If the cutter opening is to small it will impinge on the conductor causing excess friction and more tension than the wire can withstand. If the cutter opening is too large the tension required to tear the remaining annulus of uncut insulation may be greater than the wire can withstand. Some models have an adjustable grip tension, to <b>adjust</b> the <b>clamping</b> force of the gripping jaw. The knob below the jaw on the yellow automatic strippers in the image below is a grip tension adjustment. Although in principle applicable to wire of any size, automatic wire strippers that are widely available have cutters that can accommodate conductors in a range of sizes no larger than 8 AWG nor smaller than 26 AWG, but not the entire range.|$|R
30|$|Study {{included}} 779 patients, 521 {{of them in}} the randomized group. PVT {{was diagnosed}} in 201 (38, 6 %) and was linked to mean glycemia (7, 67 ± 1, 31 vs 6, 99 ± 1, 17 ± p < 0, 001). All three glucose variability markers were associated with PVT (p < 0, 01). Analyzing the decimiles of GluDiff (B 10 th=- 2, 1 to B 90 th= 1, 92) and GluSD (B 10 th=- 2, 82 to B 90 th= 1, 8) in ordinal regression revealed growth of estimates linked to the PVT (p < 0, 05). This association persisted in multivariate regression analysis <b>adjusted</b> for aortic <b>clamping</b> time, bypass time, gender, age and other predictors of glucose variability. Furthermore, rate of PVT was higher in GluHH group (32 (61, 5 %) vs 129 (37 %) p= 0, 001) suggesting OR of 2, 73 (CI 95 % 1, 49 - 4, 97 p= 0, 001). In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for aforementioned criteria PVT persisted as an independent predictor of GluHH (OR = 2, 38 CI 95 % 1, 18 - 4, 8 p= 0, 016).|$|R
40|$|Faster {{optimization}} algorithms, increased computer {{power and}} amount of available data, can leverage the area of simulation towards real-time control and optimization of products and production systems. This concept — {{often referred to as}} Digital Twin — enables real-time geometry assurance and allows moving from mass production to more individualized production. To master the challenges of a Digital Twin for Geometry Assurance the project Smart Assembly 4. 0 gathers Swedish researchers within product development, automation, virtual manufacturing, control theory, data analysis and machine learning. The vision of Smart Assembly 4. 0 is the autonomous, self-optimizing robotized assembly factory, which maximizes quality and throughput, while keeping flexibility and reducing cost, by a sensing, thinking and acting strategy. The concept is based on active part matching and self-adjusting equipment which improves geometric quality without tightening the tolerances of incoming parts. The goal is to assemble products with higher quality than the incoming parts. The concept utilizes information about individual parts to be joined (sensing), selects the best combination of parts (thinking) and <b>adjust</b> locator positions, <b>clamps,</b> weld/rivet positions and sequences (acting). The project is ongoing, and this paper specifies and highlights the infrastructure, components and data flows necessary in the Digital Twin in order to realize Smart Assembly 4. 0. The framework is generic, but the paper focuses on a spot weld station where two robots join two sheet metal parts in an adjustable fixture...|$|R
40|$|Electroluminescent (EL) wire is {{a unique}} kind of wire because it glows when {{attached}} to a power source. EL wire has many applications, both creative and practical. For example: Burning Man enthusiasts like to adorn their clothing with the flexible wire, and emergency responders use it to mark off accidents on the road at night. What makes EL wire glow is the electrical reactions between its copper wires and phosphor coating. The problem with this wire, however, {{is that it is}} very difficult to connect it to a battery. This is due to the wire’s structure. Beneath its protective plastic shielding, EL wire has a core copper wire, double wrapped with a very fine pair of copper wires. These fine copper wires are hard to solder to, and can break without much effort. Standard soldering methods use a basic alligator tooth style double clamp to hold EL wires in place for soldering. This device is very poorly made, as one must tighten and re-tighten every moveable joint for a precision solder. <b>Adjusting</b> these <b>clamps</b> can be maddening, especially when many EL solder joints must be made. There must be a better way to terminate EL wire, therefore various connection methods are considered as possible solutions. They are: improved hand soldering, machine soldering, conducive epoxy, and crimping. Ultimately it was decided that an improved solder technique would prove to be the best solution. And it entailed manufacturing a custom fixture that would hold the EL wire for easy soldering. The design went though many phases and was tested to see if it commanded a faster soldering time over its clamping counterpart. The results suggest the fixture has a mean soldering time that is statistically significantly less than the mean soldering time of the alligator clamps, with ninety-five percent confidence. An economic analysis determined that if even just one electrician were to try to profit off of making EL wire assemblies, working either full-time or part-time, he or she would save money in labor hours by purchasing the fixture. A hobbyist on the other hand, who makes only a few EL wire assemblies a month, might be stretching his or her wallet too far by spend the money for the fixture. The bottom line is that if someone stands to make a profit off EL wire assemblies, or is serious about making all kinds of EL artwork, this fixture will save the user time...|$|R
