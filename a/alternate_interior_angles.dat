40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{recent research}} that {{was conducted in}} the field of computational origami. First, it examines previous work done by Kan Chu Sen in 1721 on the idea of a fold-and-cut problem. Second, the paper will look at Kawasaki’s Theorem, which states that the sum of the <b>alternating</b> <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of a given figure is 180 °. Then the sum of the fold pattern of a folded origami figure explained in Maekawa’s Theorem will be explored. By combining these three ideas a new problem arises: given multiple folds that bisect the vertex and making a complete straight cut of the vertex, can the sum of the alternating fold-cut angle be determined by just the number of folds of the paper alone? This paper will present and prove a formula for solving this problem...|$|R

50|$|Euclid's proof makes {{essential}} {{use of the}} fifth postulate, however, modern treatments of geometry use Playfair's axiom instead. To prove proposition 29 assuming Playfair's axiom, let a transversal cross two parallel lines and suppose that the <b>alternate</b> <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> are not equal. Draw a third line through {{the point where the}} transversal crosses the first line, but with an angle equal to the angle the transversal makes with the second line. This produces two different lines through a point, both parallel to another line, contradicting the axiom.|$|E
50|$|Euclid's Proposition 27 {{states that}} if a {{transversal}} intersects two lines so that <b>alternate</b> <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> are congruent, then the lines are parallel. Euclid proves this by contradiction: If the lines are not parallel then they must intersect and a triangle is formed. Then one of the alternate angles is an exterior angle equal to the other angle which is an opposite interior angle in the triangle. This contradicts Proposition 16 which states that an exterior angle of a triangle is always greater than the opposite interior angles.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{properties}} of tangential and cyclic polygons proposed by Lopez-Real are proved rigorously using the theory of circulant matrices. In particular, the concepts of slippable tangential polygons and conformable cyclic polygons are defined. It is shown that an n-sided tangential (or cyclic) polygon Pn with n even is slippable (or conformable) and the sum {{of a set of}} non-adjacent sides (or <b>interior</b> <b>angles)</b> of Pn satisfies certain equalities. On the other hand, for a tangential (or cyclic) polygon Pn with n odd, it is rigid and the sum of a set of non-adjacent sides (or <b>interior</b> <b>angles)</b> of Pn satisfies certain inequalities. These inequalities give a definite answer to the question raised by Lopez-Real concerning the <b>alternating</b> sum of <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of a cyclic polygon. postprin...|$|R

The triacontagon is the largest regular polygon whose <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> {{is the sum of}} the <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of smaller polygons: 168° is the sum of the <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of the equilateral triangle (60°) and the regular pentagon (108°).|$|R
50|$|Euclid's Proposition 29 is a {{converse}} to {{the previous}} two. First, if a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then the <b>alternate</b> <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> are congruent. If not, then one {{is greater than the}} other, which implies its supplement is less than the supplement of the other angle. This implies that there are interior angles {{on the same side of}} the transversal which are less than two right angles, contradicting the fifth postulate. The proposition continues by stating that on a transversal of two parallel lines, corresponding angles are congruent and the interior angles on the same side are equal to two right angles. These statements follow in the same way that Prop. 28 follows from Prop. 27.|$|E
50|$|Proposition 31 is the {{construction}} of a parallel line to a given line through a point not on the given line. As the proof only requires the use of Proposition 27 (the Alternate Interior Angle Theorem), it is a valid construction in absolute geometry. More precisely, given any line l and any point P not on l, {{there is at least one}} line through P which is parallel to l. This can be proved using a familiar construction: given a line l and a point P not on l, drop the perpendicular m from P to l, then erect a perpendicular n to m through P. By the alternate interior angle theorem, l is parallel to n. (The alternate interior angle theorem states that if lines a and b are cut by a transversal t such that there is a pair of congruent <b>alternate</b> <b>interior</b> <b>angles,</b> then a and b are parallel.) The foregoing construction, and the alternate interior angle theorem, do not depend on the parallel postulate and are therefore valid in absolute geometry.|$|E
30|$|To give {{a better}} idea of the meaning of holes death, let us {{consider}} some examples. The smallest cycle in H 1 is an empty triangle, one of such cycles is given by the three simplices {(Schur’s lemma, Stone-Von Neumann Theorem), (Schur’s lemma, Spectral Theorem), (Spectral Theorem, Stone-Von Neumann Theorem)} which is killed by a 2 -simplex when the three concepts appear together in the paper (Mantoiu et al. 2004). Another interesting example is a 5 -step long cycle in H 1, {(Boltzmann equation, <b>Alternate</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>Angles</b> Theorem), (Boltzmann equation, Vlasov equation), (Inverse function theorem, Vlasov equation), (Arzelá - Ascoli theorem, <b>Alternate</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>Angles</b> Theorem), (Arzelá - Ascoli theorem, Inverse function theorem)}, that is killed by the 10 -simplex which nodes are: { Blum’s speedup theorem, Boltzmann equation, <b>Alternate</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>Angles</b> Theorem, Kramers theorem, Perpendicular axis theorem, Ordinary differential equation, Kronecker’s theorem, Arzelá - Ascoli theorem, Navier - Stokes equations, Vlasov equation, Moreau’s theorem} (Gottlieb 2000). The article, classified in arXiv as Probability, establishes the conditions for a family of n-particles Markov processes to propagate chaos, and shows its application to kinetic theory. We think this is a another possible interpretation of killing holes: a theoretical result that has several applications, hence bridges related areas and closes a homological cycle.|$|E
