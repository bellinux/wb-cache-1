5|$|At {{the party}} that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her, but is unable to hurt her feelings. She is {{becoming}} infatuated with him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda that she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's request. Elphaba herself arrives, wearing the hat Galinda gave her, a witch's hat. The other students laugh and stare while Elphaba awkwardly dances on her own. Galinda feels terrible, and goes to dance with Elphaba. Soon everyone joins them, and the two girls look <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> a new light.|$|E

In the credits, Mahesh is seen joining with Jimsy.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, on 27 October 1940, a Messerschmitt Me 109E {{flown by}} Fw Lothar Schieverhofer, of 3 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 52, was damaged in a dogfight with Supermarine Spitfire IIa P7494 of No. 74 Squadron RAF, flown by Plt Off Peter Chesters. The Messerschmitt made a wheels-up landing at RAF Penshurst, where Chesters also landed {{a few minutes}} later as he was short of fuel. Chesters dragged the German from his aircraft. Schieverhofer spat in his face, and a fist-fight {{developed}} with both combatants swearing <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> German. The fight was broken up by the arrival of an ARP Warden, a policeman and a soldier. Chesters was forced to hand back Schieverhofer's Iron Cross, which he had snatched as a souvenir, and instead took the first aid kit from the Messerschmitt. Schieverhofer was taken away from RAF Penshurst as a prisoner of war.|$|E

Longtime Muppets writer and puppeteer Jerry Juhl said he believed there was no connection {{and that this was}} a coincidence. The episode Elmo Saves Christmas (1996), which featured a clip from the film, pokes fun at the persistent reports of a connection, having them look <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> disbelief as George calls Bert and Ernie by name.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2004, Jay-Z {{was named}} {{president}} of Def Jam Records, {{which led to}} Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies. Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake. The publicized split between Jay-Z, Dash, and Biggs led to the former partners sending jabs <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> interviews.|$|E

Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son {{and the demands of}} the family business in favour of her newfound celebrity, while Chris believes Annie welcomes the Mother Teresa-like status to which she's been elevated that allows her to cater to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail. All is resolved eventually, and the women return home to resume life as it was before they removed their clothing.|$|E

As the {{instruction}} booklet is not with the game, Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy look <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras {{that he has the}} money, stating, [...] "And that... is Dallas", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement.|$|E

Video projections of the pair shooting <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> an abandoned church, dressed in wedding attire followed as images of guns flashed across the screen with the words [...] "this is not real".

500|$|During Casino Night, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) wins {{a game of}} craps {{and kisses}} Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) on the cheek, {{disregarding}} their attempts to keep their intimate relationship a secret. She slaps him and walks away, the two quietly enjoying the experience. Jan and Carol share an awkward conversation when they realize Michael has invited them both. Jim tells Jan that he's made a decision about the transfer. After Roy leaves, Jim tells Pam {{that he is in}} love with her. After a stunned pause, she states she cannot be with him. He tells her he wants to be more than friends, but she is sorry he [...] "misinterpreted things." [...] Heartbroken, Jim apologizes for misinterpreting their friendship and discreetly wipes a tear from his cheek as he walks away. Jan leaves Michael and Carol, noticeably upset at the night's events, and it is revealed she packed an overnight bag in her car, implying she had planned to spend the night with Michael. Pam returns to the office and talks to her mother over the phone about Jim's statement. Jim enters the room and approaches her as she hastily hangs up. She begins to say something but Jim kisses her, and after hesitating, she returns the kiss, with the two staring <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> silence.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the episode's airing, NBC {{set up a}} {{web site}} for the new Michael Scott Paper Company at www.michaelscottpapercompany.com, which {{included}} a mission statement for the company, photos of the new office space and a downloadable copy of the coupon for [...] "unparalleled customer service" [...] featured in the episode. The official website for The Office included four cut scenes from [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] {{within a week of}} the episode's original release. In one 85-second clip, Dwight and Andy pretend to shoot, stab and throw grenades <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> pantomime in anticipation of their hunting trip; they pretend to kill Jim and pester him until he plays dead, after which Charles walks in and believes he is napping. A second one-minute clip includes Pam and Ryan fighting around the new office until they are interrupted by a janitor who believes the room is still a closet and leaves water jugs on the floor. In a third, 40-second clip, Jim asks Charles directly what a [...] "run-down" [...] is, but when an annoyed Charles asks if this is [...] "one of your pranks", Jim gives up and leaves. The fourth and final clip, which is 85 seconds long, features Andy and Dwight both making passes at Erin; Andy discusses how easy it would be to learn sign language, while Dwight tells her {{to be careful not to}} get her hair or clothes caught in the nearby paper shredder.|$|E
500|$|Battle – In battle mode, {{the player}} fights against up to 3 (or up to 15 with LAN) human-controlled opponents using items {{scattered}} throughout a battle arena. There {{is the traditional}} balloon-popping battle game, in which the player must use items to pop an opponent's three balloons while defending their own. Players can also steal items from one another by speeding towards them with a mushroom or star. In Co-op battles, the player {{in the back of}} the kart can perform a slide-attack on another driver, which can also steal balloons. Additionally, two new games have been implemented: the first involves capturing a Shine Sprite and maintaining possession of it for a certain amount of time, usually starting out with 55 to 60 seconds. Each time the Shine Sprite is lost, the counter will somewhat reset the time. For instance, if a player is able to keep possession of the Shine Sprite for only 30 seconds, the counter would reset to 40 instead of 60. The other mode involves throwing Bob-ombs at each other to collect points. With two players, 3 points are needed to win, but when playing with 3 or 4, 4 points are required to win. If two or more players throw a bomb <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> unison, no points will be awarded to anybody. In a way, it's similar to a tie. As in previous installments, the battle arenas are enclosed (the exception being Tilt-A-Kart), with a varying layout and a replenishing arsenal of items. (2P-16P only) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Austrian {{government}} {{feared that}} Piedmont wanted {{to drop out}} of the alliance and even change sides. Therefore, Beaulieu received secret instructions not to fully trust his ally. Consequently, he neglected to fully inform the Sardinians of his plans. Colli deployed his army between Dego and Cuneo, with his main weight to the west guarding the Col de Tende. He posted two battalions at Dego and part of Giovanni Marchese di Provera's Austrian brigade at Millesimo. Meanwhile, François Christophe de Kellermann's French Army of the Alps and the Prince of Corrigan's Sardinian army, each about 20,000 strong, glared <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the mountains west of Cuneo and Turin.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah related {{that a woman}} once came to Rabbi Akiva {{and told}} him that she had {{observed}} a bloodstain. He asked her whether she perhaps had a wound. She replied that she had a wound, but it had healed. He asked whether it was possible that it could open again and bleed. She answered in the affirmative, and Rabbi Akiva declared her clean. Observing that his disciples looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> astonishment, he told them that the Sages did not lay down the rule for bloodstains to create a strict result but rather to produce a lenient result, for [...] says, [...] "If a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood" [...] — only blood, not a bloodstain.|$|E

The leadership of Los Zetas, on the other hand, was kept under the control of Lazcano Lazcano. However, Cárdenas Guillén allegedly continued to command the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars; with his extradition to the United States in 2007, Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel kept their alliance under a loose relationship, but each of their respective leaders attempted to fill the leadership void. Following several disagreements and internal power struggles, both criminal organizations broke their alliance and declared war <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> early 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Mícheál's musical {{literacy}} {{was encouraged}} throughout his early years. At {{the age of}} six, he started taking piano lessons from the Kells nuns, which left a lasting influence on him. He also sang in a choir founded by his father. At the age of twelve, Mícheál suffered an appendicitis. To ease the boredom of his recuperation, a religious brother who taught at Mícheál's school gave him a guitar. By the age of sixteen, Mícheál began devoting his musical energies to the guitar. Throughout his early years, he and his sisters Tríona and Maighréad continued to sing the Irish songs together in close harmony. With their father's advise to [...] "listen across one another" [...] to pick up subtle shifts in harmony, the siblings developed a seamless texture to their singing. Tríona would later recall, [...] "We could just look <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst of a}} song, and that look would communicate so much. When you've close family ties, it's instinctive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two look <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the}} most suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key I remember I was doing it fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally I yelled, 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E
