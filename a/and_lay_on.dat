5|$|Governor Johnson, {{despite his}} {{presumptive}} official position, his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General John C. Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the Battle of Shiloh. On April 7, Johnson was severely {{wounded in the}} thigh and abdomen, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the battlefield until the following day. Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the modern}} county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, {{the history of}} its {{constituent}} settlements goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, {{believed to have been}} an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes. Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth, are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human occupation around Stretford comes from Neolithic stone axes {{found in the}} area, dating from about 2000BC. Stretford {{was part of the}} land occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe before and during the Roman occupation, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the Mersey. By 1212, there were two manors in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by Hamon de Mascy, while the land in the north, closer to the River Irwell, was held by Henry de Trafford. In about 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, since when the two manors descended together.|$|E

25|$|Pocklington {{developed}} through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline. Pocklington owed {{much of its}} prosperity in the Middle Ages {{to the fact that}} it was a local centre for the trading of wool <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the main road to York, an important national centre for the export of wool to the continent. Wool was England’s principal export in the earlier Middle Ages.|$|E
500|$|The Parrett was {{established}} as {{the border between}} the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the Brythonic kingdom of Dumnonia in 658, following the Dumnonians' defeat at the Battle of Peonnum that year. This natural border endured for almost a century until further fighting between the Anglo-Saxons and Britons in the mid-8th century, when the border shifted west to its current location between the modern ceremonial counties of Somerset and Devon. It is thought a ford, usable only at low tide, crossed the river near its mouth, between Combwich and Pawlett (east bank). This crossing, at the western end of the Polden Hills, was known since Roman times <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the route of a Saxon herepath. It was here, or in the immediate vicinity, that Hubba, the Danish raider, was defeated and killed by Odda in 878. In the Domesday Book Combwich was known as Comich, which means [...] "the settlement by the water", from the Old English cumb and wic. The ford was later replaced by a ferry, one of which was in operation from at least the 13th century. In the 15th century the ferry was regarded as part of the King's Highway, and both passengers and cattle were carried in the 16th and 17th centuries. Records of the joint Manorial ownership and costs of the ferry exist for 1589 and 1810. The White House Inn, a licensed victualler and part-owner of the ferry, traded on the Pawlett bank from 1655 to 1897; the building was retained as a farm dwelling for another 20years. The Combwich river crossing, which was a main route until the 18th century, fell out of use due to turnpike trusts improving what were to become the A38 and A39 roads, and traffic went via Bridgwater; the former inn was demolished c.1930.|$|E

2500|$|On [...] March 24, 2008, {{during the}} Olympic torch {{lighting}} ceremony in Olympia, a French activist of the French-based group Reporters Without Borders managed to breach {{the security and}} tried to unfurl a banner behind China's Olympic chief Liu Qi who was making his speech at the moment. The protester was quickly removed by security personnel. Later on, as the torch relay began, another Tibetan woman covered herself with red paint <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground, forcing torchbearers to weave around her as other protesters shouted [...] "Flame of shame."

2500|$|After the {{fighting}} in March 1916, the British front line near [...] had become a blunt salient known as the Kink, between the [...] Redoubt and the Cité St. Elie quarries. The salient was about [...] wide <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a slight slope down to [...] and had two outcrops, the Kink {{on the right and}} Hussar Horn on the left. The area was overlooked from the [...] Redoubt, by [...] and from several mine craters in no man's land. The area was regularly bombarded with great accuracy by German artillery and trench mortars. German mining had left no man's land, which was only [...] wide, a crater field occupied by both sides. Many British troops considered that the area was the worst place on the Western Front. The 170th Tunnelling Company RE had eventually managed to gain dominance over the German miners {{and by the end of}} April all of the craters except for one just north of the Kink had been re-captured. As a precaution, the old front line was maintained and further back, Hussar Horn and Anchor trenches crossed, making switch lines. A reserve line ran along Hulluch Alley and Sackville Street [...] further back and the Village Line lay another [...] beyond.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} is [...] wide and [...] long, {{and has a}} domed Greek cross plan. It is oriented in a northeast – southwest direction. It has 3 polygonal apses, and the narthex has been destroyed. The edifice has no galleries, and the dome, which has no drum, is almost certainly Ottoman, although the arches and the piers which sustain it are Byzantine. The arms of the cross, the pastophoria, the Prothesis and Diaconicon are covered with barrel vaults, and communicate through arches. The north and south walls have a floor level with three arcades, a first level with three windows, and a second level with a window with three lights. On the southeast side, the three apses project boldly outside with three sides. The roof, the cornice and the wooden narthex, which replaced the old Byzantine narthex, are Ottoman. A cruciform font which belonged to the baptistery of the church <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of}} the street has been moved to the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. The dome piers, which form the internal side of the cross, are L-shaped. They are an example of the stage preceding that of the cross-in-square church with four columns. Remains of frescoes placed on the south side of the building have been published. Moreover, during the floor renewal in the 1990s, several tesserae have been found, showing the previous existence of mosaics panels and frescoes in the building. Despite its architectural significance, the building has never undergone a systematic study.|$|E

2500|$|Charlotte {{was officially}} {{designated}} as Princess Royal on 22 June 1789. After {{the birth of}} three sons in a row, her parents were delighted to have a Princess in the nursery. Like all of her siblings, Charlotte was inoculated—in her case, in December 1768 along with her brother William. As the eldest daughter of the monarch, Charlotte {{was assumed to be}} destined for an important marriage on the continent, and her education was considered to be of the utmost importance, beginning when she was only eighteen months old. Since French was the official language in every European court, the little Princess was given a Frenchwoman to be her tutor, in order that she should have no accent. Her memory was another of her beginning subjects. She was taught to recite little verses and stories, and as a result had an almost uncanny ability to recall detail {{for the rest of her}} life. Her early childhood was not all scholarly pursuits. When she was almost three years old, she took place in her first tableau dressed like Columbine, where she danced with her seven-year-old brother George, Prince of Wales. She was not a naturally musical child and later abhorred such displays of children, declaring that they made children vain and self-important. This did not stop her parents from continuing to show her off. In late 1769, she and the Prince of Wales were once again displayed, this time to the public in a [...] "junior drawing room" [...] in St. James' Palace. Charlotte was dressed in a Roman toga <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a sofa. Though this type of thing was common in German courts, it was considered vulgar in England, where in reaction a London mob drove a hearse into the Palace courtyard. Afterward, the Prince of Wales told Lady Mary Coke that the whole event had made Charlotte [...] "terribly tired." [...] Wisely, the King and Queen decided to never repeat the experience.|$|E
