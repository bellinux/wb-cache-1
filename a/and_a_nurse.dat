5|$|On January 6, 1925, Haynes, the Apperson brothers, {{and other}} {{automotive}} pioneers were awarded gold medals by the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce at a New York City auto exhibition {{for their contributions}} to the industry. On his return trip home, he contracted influenza and his health began to deteriorate rapidly. In March, he asked his son to take over his business interests while he traveled to Florida to seek rest in the warmer climate. His condition steadily worsened, causing him to cancel his planned trip to Cuba and return to Kokomo. He remained in his home, attended by his personal physician <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> until his death from congestive heart failure on April 13, 1925. Haynes' funeral was held in Kokomo before his interment at the city's Memorial Park cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E

25|$|The next year, 1923, Soviet {{authorities}} {{were eager to}} expand the Toikino experiment of 1922. The Soviet People's Commissariat of Agriculture offered a large tract of fertile land in the Kuban region, {{just north of the}} Black Sea for another model farm. Working with the Friends of Soviet Russia organization, Hal Ware organized a party of 40 to make the trip, including agricultural specialists, a doctor, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse.</b> Ware arrived in Soviet Russia to inspect the land designated for the project only to be told by Soviet officials that the deal was off — local peasants had begun to allocate the land reserved for the project amongst themselves.

25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
500|$|Greg Focker is {{a middle-class}} Jewish nurse whose social and {{cultural}} position is juxtaposed against the Byrnes family of upper-class White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. With respect to Greg as a Jew <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> {{when compared to the}} Byrnes and Banks families, a distinct cultural gap is created and subsequently widened. The cultural differences are often highlighted and Greg is repeatedly made aware of them. This serves to achieve comedic effect through character development and has also been commented upon as being indicative of thematic portrayal of Jewish characters' roles in modern film as well as being a prime example of how male nurses are portrayed in media. Speaking about character development in Meet the Parents, director Jay Roach stated that he wanted an opportunity to [...] "do character-driven comedy" [...] and [...] "to create realistic characters, but heighten the comedic situations and predicaments." ...|$|E
500|$|The series concludes {{the revelation}} that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a {{simulation}} by the Shadowy Figure.

They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous {{as to whether or not}} it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved– Golden Joe says [...] "I thought this was done," [...] to which Fitz replies, [...] "I thought so too.

500|$|Teresa Hsu Chih (7 July 1898 – 7 December 2011), or {{commonly}} known as Teresa Hsu (...) , was a Chinese-born Singaporean social worker, known affectionately as [...] "Singapore's Mother Teresa", in recognition for her active lifelong devotion in helping the aged sick and destitutes locally. The retired nurse was {{the founder of the}} non-profit charities—Heart to Heart Service and the Home for the Aged Sick, one of the first homes for the aged sick in Singapore. She had been a social worker in China and Paraguay <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> in England, before coming to Singapore to start similar non-profit charities since 1961. As a supercentenarian, Hsu was still involved in charity work and was one of very few supercentenarians who were recognised for reasons other than their longevity. She had spent almost all her savings on feeding and housing the poor and the elderly, all of whom are younger than she was, but she herself led a simple and humble lifestyle. In 2005, she received the Special Recognition Award from the Singapore government in recognition of her contribution to the country.|$|E
500|$|One {{kilometre}} {{from the}} summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Taylor and Hall {{arrived in the}} team car to help him.

[...] They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were 'On, on, on.' The words 'Put me back on my bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not there at the time and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road.

Tommy, supervisor Pam (Melanie Kinnaman), and a young boy named Reggie (Shavar Ross) manage to defeat Roy.

500|$|Tresham {{suffered}} from a strangury caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his health began to decline. [...] Lieutenant of the Tower William Waad, wondering if Tresham would live long enough for justice to take its course, described his condition as [...] "worse and worse". [...] Tresham preferred {{the services of a}} Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower's regular doctor Matthew Gwinne; apparently Foster understood his case, indicating that it was not the first occasion on which he had treated him. [...] During his last days he was attended by three more doctors <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse,</b> along with William Vavasour, a rumoured illegitimate child of Thomas Tresham and possibly Francis's half-brother. [...] As Tresham's wife, Anne, was apparently too upset, Vavasour wrote Tresham's deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours. [...] Tresham apologised to the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet for implicating him in the Spanish Treason, and used the rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence. [...] Anne and William read prayers at his bedside; he died at 2:00am on 23December. [...] Despite not being tried, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy on display at Northampton, while his body was thrown into a hole at Tower Hill. [...] His estates passed to his brother Lewis. [...] Tresham's apology never reached its intended target, and his letter, along with the discovery of Garnet's Of Equivocation, found among the [...] "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" [...] at Tresham's chamber in the Inner Temple, was used to great effect by Sir Edward Coke in Garnet's trial.
