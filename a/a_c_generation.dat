40|$|The superconducting a. c. {{generator}} {{is expected}} to be the optimum choice among <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>generation</b> systems in future because of its reduced size, high efficiency, high terminal voltage and its contribution to the stability of the power system. Such machines also exhibit unique design problems which remain unsolved. The optimal selection of the basic design parameters is a current problem of interest. This thesis is intended as a contribution in this direction, and a general design strategy has been developed for the superconducting a. c. generator. Elements of the design process include magnetic field analysis, losses, and mechanical performance all which of are discussed in the thesis. An analytical model has been developed to help determine the distribution of magnetic flux density inside the superconducting machine. This model takes into account the number, and the geometric structure, of the winding slots and allows the rotor of the superconducting machine to be designed with optimum magnetic field distribution. A general design strategy has been developed for the superconducting a. c. generator rotor for predicting the optimum design. The design optimization process incorporates "direct search" and random-shrinkage methods. Two direct search methods of minimization have been compared on mathematical functions and also on machine design problems. The best method is highlighted and discussed. A general computer program package is presented that will optimize and analyse machine design problems. The package is organised in such away that future addition or deletion of performance specifications, constraints, optimization methods and design process elements are readily implemented...|$|E

40|$|The {{interior}} of the eye, or uvea, is a site of immune privilege where certain immune responses are attenuated or completely excluded to protect non regenerating tissues essential for vision. One consequence of this immunoregulation is compromised immune mediated elimination of intraocular tumors. For example, certain murine tumor cell lines which are rejected by host immune responses when transplanted in the skin grow progressively when placed in the anterior chamber (<b>a.</b> <b>c.)</b> of the eye. Progressive ocular tumor growth occurs despite induction of tumor-specific CD 8 + T cell responses capable of eliminating a subsequent tumor challenge in the skin or opposite eye. Why these CD 8 + T effectors fail to eliminate established ocular tumors is not known. It is well appreciated that growth of tumors in the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> induces the <b>generation</b> of immunosuppressive CD 8 + T regulatory (Treg) cells. However, the contribution of CD 8 + Treg in ocular tumor progression remains unclear. Several studies indicate that these CD 8 + Treg target responding CD 4 + T cells to inhibit their induction of macrophage-dependent delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to tumor antigens. However, induction of tumor-specific CD 4 + T cell responses does not assure intraocular tumor elimination. This review is focused on how CD 8 + Treg could influence the tumoricidal activity of ocular tumor specific CD 8 + T effector cells...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStandardized {{ecotoxicity}} bioassays {{show some}} limits to assess properly long-term residual toxicity of complex mixture of pollutants often present at low concentration, such as stormwaters. Among invertebrate organisms used for ecotoxicity testing, the microcrustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia (C. dubia) is {{considered as one}} of the most sensitive, especially regarding reproduction impairment as a toxicity endpoint. Consequently, the present work explores the interest to perform a multi-generational assay based on the study of the reproduction of C. dubia to assess long-term ecotoxicity of complex mixture, using stormwater samples. With this in mind, a battery of standardized bioassays (Daphnia magna mobility, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata population growth, Heterocypris incongruens growth and one <b>generation</b> <b>C.</b> dubia reproduction inhibition assays) was performed in parallel to <b>a</b> three <b>generation</b> <b>C.</b> dubia reproduction inhibition assay on 2 stormwater samples.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{throughput}} and delay {{that can be}} achieved by various forwarding schemes, employing multiple paths and different degrees of redundancy, focusing on linear network coding. The key contribution of the study is an analytical framework for modeling the throughput and delay forvarious schemes, considering wireless mesh networks where unicast traffic is forwarded and hop-by-hop retransmissions are employed for achieving reliability. The analytical framework is generalized for an arbitrary number of paths and hops per path. Another key contribution of the study is the evaluation and extension of the numerical results, drawn from the analysis, through system-level simulations. Our results show that, in scenarios with significant interference, the best throughput-delay tradeoff is achieved by single path forwarding. Moreover, when significant interference is present and network coding employs the larger packet generation size, it experiences higher delay than the other schemes.
