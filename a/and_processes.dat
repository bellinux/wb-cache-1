40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the effects of institutional support on product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation <b>and</b> firm performance and describe how dysfunctional competition influences relevant outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a research model based on institution-based view and tests it using structural equation modeling and empirical data collected from 300 manufacturers in China. Findings: The results show that institutional support positively affects product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation <b>and</b> firm performance. Both product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation improve firm performance. The findings reveal that dysfunctional competition significantly reduces the positive effects of institutional support on product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation but leaves the effects of institutional support <b>and</b> product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation on firm performance unaffected. Originality/value: This study contributes to innovation literature by providing insights into the impact of China’s institutional environment on manufacturing firms’ product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation decisions. The findings also contribute to institution-based view literature by providing empirical evidence on the joint effects of institutional support and dysfunctional competition on product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation <b>and</b> firm performance. This study can help manufacturers in China take advantage of institutional environment and adjust product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation decisions accordingly...|$|R

5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E
