The gender difference may be attributable to several factors: sociocultural traditions that encourage, or permit, the greater expression of <b>avoidance</b> <b>coping</b> strategies by women (including dependent and helpless behaviors), women perhaps being more likely to seek help and therefore be diagnosed, and men being more likely to abuse alcohol in reaction to anxiety and be diagnosed as an alcoholic.

40|$|Background & Aim: Since {{people have}} {{different}} coping styles, {{the purpose of}} the present research was to compare the relationship between family communication patterns and self-concept with coping styles among male and female students of Eram Higher Education Institution in Shiraz. Methods: In the present correlation study conducted in 2011 at Eram Higher Education Institution in Shiraz, 229 participants (91 males & 119 females) were selected by simple random sampling method. Data was collected by using the revised version of family communication patterns questionnaire (RFCP), Koerner & Fitz patrik (2002), Beck's Self-concept Test (CST) (1990) and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) Endler & Parker (1990). Data was analyzed using correlation matrix & independent t-test analysis. Results: According to the result, there was significant correlation between family communication patterns and self-concept with coping styles among male and female students. In the female group, task oriented <b>coping</b> and <b>avoidance</b> oriented <b>coping</b> with conversation orientation and emotion oriented coping with conforming orientation showed positive significant correlation. In male group <b>avoidance</b> orientation <b>coping</b> with conversation orientation and emotion oriented coping with conforming orientation showed positive significant correlation. Also, related to self concept variable, results showed female students task oriented <b>coping</b> and <b>avoidance</b> oriented <b>coping</b> had significant correlation with the self concept variable, but the male students <b>avoidance</b> oriented <b>coping</b> had significant correlation with the self concept variable(P< 0 / 05). Also, the result showed significant difference between two male and female students, in emotion oriented coping, so the female group, emotion oriented coping with (51 / 48) was more than the orientation within the male group with (48 / 18), (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Family communication patterns and the concept are effective on coping styles. Therefore, strategies to improve teaching and learning factors in the family, especially for young people is essential...|$|R
50|$|The term {{distancing}} is also applied as {{an attachment}} style. Attachment theory {{is a theory}} describing the formation of emotional bonds between people {{and the effects of}} a person’s attachment history on emotion regulation and other aspects of personality. Studies have shown that a person’s attachment style (secure, anxious, or avoidant) becomes stable with age. Attachment style is assessed by what kind of insecurity an individual has, either through attachment-related anxiety or attachment-related avoidance (distancing). Secure individuals, those with low levels of anxiety and <b>avoidance,</b> <b>cope</b> well with stress because they seek support from trusted attachment figures or use mental depictions of support from the past. Insecure individuals, those with high levels of anxiety or avoidance, do not feel as confident in the availability and responsiveness of others.|$|R

5000|$|Literature on coping often distinguishes coping avenues {{into two}} broad categories: approach/active coping and avoidance/passive coping. Approach coping {{includes}} behaviors {{that attempt to}} reduce stress by alleviating the problem directly, and <b>avoidance</b> <b>coping</b> includes behaviors that reduce stress by distancing oneself from the problem. Traditionally, approach coping {{has been seen as}} the healthiest and most beneficial way to reduce stress, while <b>avoidance</b> <b>coping</b> has been associated with negative personality traits, potentially harmful activities, and generally poorer outcomes. [...] However, research has shown that some types of <b>avoidance</b> <b>coping</b> have beneficial outcomes. A study by Long and Haney found that both jogging and relaxation techniques were equally successful at lessening anxiety and increasing feelings of self-efficacy. Therefore, it seems that positive forms of passive coping such as exercise and meditation have qualitatively different outcomes from negative forms such as binge eating and drug use. These positive forms of passive coping may be particularly beneficial for alleviating stress when the individual does not currently have the resources to eliminate the problem directly, indicating the advantage of flexibility when engaging in coping behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{current study}} aimed to examine two {{possible}} explanations for why higher levels of posttraumatic growth (PTG) were repeatedly found to be predicted by both approach - and <b>avoidance</b> - oriented <b>coping,</b> focusing on individuals recently diagnosed with a spinal cord injury (SCI). First, negative changes (posttraumatic depreciation, PTD) may moderate the association between PTG and {{the two types of}} coping indicating that PTG reflects avoidance of PTD for some individuals, but a constructive view on posttraumatic life changes for others. Second, it may be that a flexible use of different types of coping strategies (coping flexibility) enables the experience of PTG. Method: A sample consisting of 122 patients admitted to one of the four national SCI rehabilitation centers was examined in a longitudinal study. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the two competing explanations. Results: Both approach - (β =. 30, p =. 001) and <b>avoidance</b> - oriented <b>coping</b> (β =. 23, p =. 011) measured three months after SCI diagnosis predicted higher PTG levels at discharge from clinical rehabilitation. PTD did not moderate the relationship between approach - (β =. 03, p =. 743) and <b>avoidance</b> – oriented <b>coping</b> (β = -. 04, p =. 656) and PTG. However, coping flexibility (β =. 23, p=. 012) predicted higher PTG levels. Conclusion: These results suggest that a flexible use of different types of coping strategies potentially according to situational demands may explain findings that PTG was predicted by both approach-and avoidance-oriented coping...|$|R

40|$|While {{improvements}} in healthcare {{have resulted in}} children with complex and life-threatening conditions living longer, a proportion of them still die. The {{death of a child}} puts parents at increased risk for anxiety, depression, and complicated grief. Increasing our understanding of the coping strategies that parents use under such extreme circumstances will enable us to best provide support to families, before and after a child's death. Our aim herein was to develop a theoretical framework of parental coping. Evidence from the literature was employed to develop a theoretical framework to describe parental coping in the context of having a child with a life-limiting illness who is declining and facing eventual death. The reasoning and argument consists of three guiding elements: (1) the importance of approach as well as <b>avoidance</b> (as <b>coping</b> strategies) in the context of managing the extreme emotions; (2) the importance of the social aspect of coping within a family, whereby parents cope for others as well as for themselves; and (3) the importance of a flexible and balanced coping profile, with parents using different coping strategies simultaneously. Central to the proposed framework is that effective coping, in terms of adjustment, is achieved by balancing coping strategies: accessing different coping strategies simultaneously or in parallel with a specific focus on (1) approach and <b>avoidance</b> and (2) <b>coping</b> aimed at self and others. Understanding of parental coping strategies is essential for health professionals in order to support parents effectively...|$|R

5000|$|Coping {{styles are}} a person's {{behavioral}} responses to schemas. Maladaptive coping styles (such as overcompensation, avoidance, or surrender) very often wind up reinforcing the schemas.

Those who displayed maladaptive perfectionistic tendencies, such as rumination over past events or fixation on mistakes, tended to utilize more passive or <b>avoidance</b> <b>coping.</b> Despite these differences, both groups tended to utilize self-criticism as a coping method. This is consistent with theories that conceptualize self-criticism as a central element of perfectionism.|$|E

40|$|Summary This study {{explored}} psychosocial {{predictors of}} relapse and survival {{in early stage}} melanoma patients. Patients with locoregional melanoma whose tumour thickness exceeded 0. 69 mm, seen at the Sydney Melanoma Unit between 1991 and 1996 participated in the study. Questionnaires were sent to participating patients every 3 months for 2 years. Domains measured included cognitive appraisal of threat, coping, psychological adjustment, {{quality of life and}} perceived aim of treatment. Disease and demographic data were obtained from medical records. Multivariate analyses from baseline data used the Cox proportional hazards model. Of the 682 patients invited to participate 426 (62 %) agreed. 91 (21 %) relapsed and 60 (14 %) died within the follow-up period, that ended in October 1997. After controlling for known prognostic indicators, several psychosocial variables predicted time to relapse and/or survival duration. Patients who perceived their aim of treatment to be cured, who did not use <b>avoidance</b> as a <b>coping</b> strategy or who were concerned about their disease experienced longer periods without relapse. Shorter survival duration was associated with a positive mood, the use of <b>avoidance</b> as a <b>coping</b> strategy, not being concerned with their disease and concern {{about the impact of the}} disease on family.

5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any <b>avoidance</b> or <b>coping</b> strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|R
