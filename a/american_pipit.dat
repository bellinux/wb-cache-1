5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common redpoll and <b>American</b> <b>pipit.</b> The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the high}} alpine country, plant {{communities}} are mostly meadows, herbs and shrubs with some scattered groves of foxtail pine and stunted whitebark pine. Trees often create krummholtz formations, or a stunted, deformed growth pattern characterized by branches closely hugging the ground. Talus slopes {{are home to}} small mammals such as pikas and yellow-bellied marmots. Birds such as gray-crowned rosy finches and <b>American</b> <b>pipits,</b> and sensitive amphibian species such as mountain yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite toads, feed on insects near alpine lakes and wetlands. Larger animals such as bears may venture into the alpine zone {{in search of food}} (a behavior now exacerbated by improper disposal of waste by campers), but do not winter there.|$|R
40|$|Nontarget bird use of DRC- 1339 bait sites was {{assessed}} during operational baiting programs from 2000 - 2002 in Louisiana and from 2001 - 2002 in Texas. DRC- 1339 is an avicide {{registered with the}} U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to manage blackbirds causing damage to agriculture. It was used in Louisiana between 15 February to 15 March and in Texas from January though March to protect newly planted rice. In Louisiana, there were 55 bait sites observed during 316 observation periods (158 observation hours) and 312 flush-counts conducted from 2000 - 2002. In Texas, there were 26 bait sites observed during 182 observation periods (91 observation hours) and 174 flush-counts conducted from 2001 - 2002. The nontarget bird species most commonly observed on DRC- 1339 bait sites in Louisiana and Texas was the savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus, Mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) and <b>American</b> <b>pipits</b> (Anthus rubescens,/i 3 ̆e) were observed less frequently than savannah sparrows. Of these, mourning doves in Louisiana and meadowlarks in Texas are of greatest concern because of their foraging habits, susceptibility to DRC- 1339, and frequency and rate of occurrence at DRC- 1339 bait sites...|$|R
50|$|The {{buff-bellied pipit}} (Anthus rubescens), or <b>American</b> <b>pipit</b> {{as it is}} known in North America, is a small {{songbird}} found {{on both sides of the}} northern Pacific. It was first described by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 Ornithologia Britannica. It was formerly classified as a form of the water pipit.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} low-lying and flat, {{dominated}} by rock and sand. It is devoid of trees, {{although there are}} grasses and other hardy plants. It is frequented by Arctic fox, Ringed seal, Beluga whale, caribou, and polar bears. A major migration route for geese, notable bird populations include <b>American</b> <b>pipit,</b> Arctic tern, black guillemot, common eider, common loon, great black-backed gull, gyrfalcon, herring gull, Pacific loon, purple sandpiper, red-necked phalarope, red-throated loon, and semipalmated plover.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} pipits, the buff-bellied pipit is an undistinguished-looking species which usually {{can be seen}} to run around on the ground. The rubescens {{subspecies}} (or <b>American</b> <b>pipit)</b> has lightly streaked grey-brown upperparts and is diffusely streaked below on the buff breast and flanks. The belly is whitish, the bill and legs are dark. The japonicus subspecies (or Japanese pipit) is darker above and has bolder black streaking on its whiter underparts; its legs have a reddish hue. The call is a squeaky sip.|$|E

40|$|CHANGES IN THE A. O. U. CHECK-LIST The Thirty-seventh Supplement to the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Check-list of North American Birds (Auk, 106 : 532 - 538) {{made these}} changes in species which {{may be found in}} Nebraska: Common Barn-Owl (Tyto alba) to Barn Owl; Barn-Owl is no longer used for another species, so the hyphen is no longer needed, nor is a modifier. Northern Hawk-Owl (Surnia ulula) to Northern Hawk Owl; this species does not belong in the Hawk-Owl group and so the hyphen is removed. Western Flycatcher (Empidonax diffieilis) is {{replaced}} by Pacific-slope Flycatcher (E. diffieilis) and Cordilleran Flycatcher (E. oeeidentalis). The latter would be the one to be found east of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, and SO in Nebraska. Water Pipit (Anthus soinoletta) to <b>American</b> <b>Pipit</b> (A. rubeseens) to distinguish it from the Old World form. Brown Towhee (Pipilo fuseus) is repiaced by California Towhee (P. erissalis) and Canyon Towhee (P. fuseus). The latter would be the form found roughly east of the Rockies, and so in Nebrask...|$|E
40|$|Introduction As {{many of you}} know, the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (AOU) {{has changed}} some generic names and rearranged the taxonomic order for shortbirds in the {{expanded}} genus Tringa and for the terns. This Spring Report uses the new taxonomic order. Observers (thank you, I think!) submitted {{a huge amount of}} data that I distilled for this report; I entered more than 3, 500 sightings into my database, which allows for a comprehensive overview of what birds were doing this spring. As has been the case the last few years, there were several record or near-record early arrival dates, some requiring documentation (readily supplied!) and some only marginally early relative to the previous early dates. Shorebirds had several of these early dates, with at least eight species at or near record-early arrival dates. Two species of grebes and Blue-winged Teal also were early. Three species of swallow, along with Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Rock Wren, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Thrush, and <b>American</b> <b>Pipit</b> also showed up early. Finally, three 2 ̆ 2 southern 2 ̆ 2 warblers that breed north to Nebraska were record early: Yellow-throated, Prothonotary and Louisiana Waterthrush...|$|E
40|$|In {{a rapidly}} {{changing}} climate, effective bird conservation requires not only reliable information about the current vulnerability of species of conservation concern, but also credible projections of their future vulnerability. Such projections may enable managers to preempt or reduce emerging climate-related threats through appropriate habitat management. We used NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to predict vulnerability to climate change of 168 bird species that breed in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, USA. The CCVI assesses species-specific exposure and sensitivity to climate change within a defined geographic area, through the integration of (a) species' range maps, (b) information about species' natural history traits and ecological relationships, (c) historic and current climate data, and (d) spatially explicit climate change projections. We conducted the assessment under two different downscaled climate models with divergent projections about future precipitation {{through the middle of}} the 21 st century. Assessments differed relatively little under the two climate models. Of five CCVI vulnerability ranking categories, only one species, White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), received the most vulnerable rank, Extremely Vulnerable. No species received the second-highest vulnerability ranking, Highly Vulnerable. Sixteen species scored as Moderately Vulnerable using one or both climate models: Common Merganser (Mergus merganser), Osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Prairie Falcon (Falco mexicanus), Spotted Sandpiper (Actitis macularius), Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa), Black Swift (Cypseloides niger), Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), American Dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), <b>American</b> <b>Pipit</b> (Anthus rubescens), Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch (Leucosticte tephrocotis), Pine Grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator), and Evening Grosbeak (Coccothraustes vespertinus). Species associated with alpine/subalpine habitats and aquatic habitats received significantly more vulnerable rankings than birds associated with other habitats. In contrast, species of foothill, sagebrush, and chaparral habitats ranked as less vulnerable than other species, and our results suggest these species may respond to climate change in the region with population increases or range expansions...|$|E
