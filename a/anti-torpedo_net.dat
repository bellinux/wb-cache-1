500|$|Operation Catechism, {{the final}} British attack on Tirpitz, {{took place on}} 12 November 1944. The ship again used her 38cm guns against the bombers, which {{approached}} the battleship at 09:35; Tirpitzs main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack. A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss. Several other bombs landed within the <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit amidships between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown into the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship {{on the port side}} of turret Caesar. The amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20degrees. In ten minutes, the list increased to 30 to 40degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown [...] into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. Tirpitz rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.|$|E

50|$|The outer-harbour defences {{detected}} {{the entry of}} the first midget submarine, No.14, at about 8 p.m., {{but it was not}} identified until it became entangled in an <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> that was suspended between George's Head and Green Point. Before HMAS Yarroma was able to open fire, the submarine's two crew members destroyed their vessel with demolition charges and killed themselves.|$|E
50|$|Abele {{was ordered}} to Tinian on 5 August to recover the <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> located there. Following the formal Japanese {{surrender}} early in September, the ship got underway {{to return to the}} west coast of the United States. She reached San Francisco in late November. Abele was decommissioned on 1 March 1946, her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1946, and the vessel was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 7 May 1947.|$|E

50|$|Following {{her return}} to the atoll, Anaqua {{assisted}} in closing down the large fleet anchorage at Ulithi. The vessel helped remove 20 mi of <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net.</b> This salvage work was completed by 17 October, when she headed home with a barge in tow. The ship paused at Saipan to unload nets being transported by the barge and then proceeded to Hawaii. During this passage, rough seas and inclement weather slowed her progress, and Anaqua headed for Midway Islands to refuel. The vessel finally reached Pearl Harbor on 12 November.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the spring}} of 1945 Nutmeg was engaged in {{maintaining}} and repairing net defenses in Boston Harbor. In May she was attached to Commander Task Force 24 {{for the purpose of}} maintaining the <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> in Placentia Harbor, Argentia, Newfoundland. She departed Argentia 19 June with Gate Craft (Non-self propelled) YNG-27 in tow, arriving 23 June at South Boston Navy Yard for overhaul and repairs. Nutmeg had been scheduled for duty at Pearl Harbor when she departed Boston, Massachusetts, 21 July for transit to the U.S. West Coast via Key West, Florida, the Panama Canal Zone, and San Pedro, California.|$|E
50|$|On 16 February, Boxwood sailed for Indian Island, Washington, and {{was soon}} busily engaged in work at the Net Depot there, {{installing}} an antisubmarine net line at Port Townsend, a combination antisubmarine and <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> line at Marrowstone Spit, and a fine mesh net line across the Portage Canal. She completed the installation of approximately {{a mile and a}} half of netting on 11 July and remained in the Puget Sound area tending nets for the remainder of 1942. Placed in full commission on 2 January 1943, Boxwood resumed her tending tasks after her overhaul at Todd, Seattle, shipyard and carried them out through the spring of 1943.|$|E

50|$|Baretta {{worked at}} Ulithi into late June, retrieving, rigging, and laying <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> moorings, until getting {{underway}} for the Ryukyus on 28 June in a 16 ship convoy. Detached on 4 July when five {{miles west of}} the southern tip of Okinawa, Baretta proceeded independently to Kerama Retto to relieve Terebinth (AN 59). She and her sister ships then recovered the anchor legs of the fleet telephone moorings in Kerama Retto for transfer to Buckner Bay. Before proceeding to that place, Baretta assisted LCT-466 that had lost her ramp and taken a 10 degree list to starboard. Baretta built a wooden jury ramp, repaired the tank landing craft's leaking starboard ballast tank and shifted the cargo load to port.|$|E
50|$|Tuscana {{embarked}} {{passengers on}} 11 November and, {{on the following}} day, got underway and steamed via Eniwetok to the Hawaiian Islands. Throughout most of December, she remained at Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs. Then, on 27 December, she set her course again for the Marshalls and spent a week at Eniwetok before proceeding on to the western Carolines. Shortly after midday on 20 January 1945, she passed through Mugai Channel and anchored at Ulithi. Although hampered at first by rough seas. Tuscana supplied moorings and assembled 1,260 yards of <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> for Towachi Channel and an additional 6,390 yards for use elsewhere in the approaches to Ulithi. On 12 February 1945, her assignment completed, she departed Ulithi.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} {{operation}} the Tirpitz was sunk when three Tallboys hit it, {{and several others}} fell close by. Several bombs landed within the <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed, removing much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit amidships between the aircraft catapult and the funnel, completely destroying the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit and blowing a very large hole in the ship's side and bottom, causing significant flooding and a port list to 60 degrees. A third bomb struck the ship {{on the port side}} of turret Caesar, eventually leading to a magazine explosion that caused the ship to capsize.|$|E
5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov {{was built}} by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 21 August 1889, {{launched}} on 13 September 1890, and sailed to Sevastopol for fitting out on 11 May 1892. She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 she was used to test a new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov and also to evaluate the proper dimensions for <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>nets</b> and their booms. For this last test torpedoes were fired at the ship with the <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>nets</b> deployed. One gun, of an unknown calibre, burst in 1903, killing one man and wounding two others.|$|R
50|$|Convoy HX 239 {{departed}} New York on 13 May 1943 {{and arrived}} at Liverpool on 28 May. Empire Coleridge was bound for Avonmouth, Somerset. Empire Coleridge was equipped with <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>nets.</b> She was praised by the Convoy Commodore for her exceptional behaviour while {{a member of the}} convoy.|$|R
2500|$|Her {{hull and}} gun turret were unarmored, {{but she was}} {{protected}} by two <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>nets.</b> Her main guns could elevate 20Â° and her turret could traverse 30Â° to either side. They fired an [...] armor-piercing shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] {{to a range of}} [...] at maximum elevation.|$|R
50|$|Cliffrose sailed from San Pedro, California, 21 June 1944 for Pearl Harbor, {{arriving}} 4 July {{for local}} duty. She departed 8 August for the Florida Islands and {{the invasion of}} Peleliu on 15 September. She carried out surveys for the installation of moorings, and then laid an <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> across the western entrance of Kossol Passage, remaining in the Palau Islands until 8 December, when she sailed for Ulithi. Arriving 10 December, she was briefly overhauled and had duty repairing nets. Cliffrose put out from Ulithi 25 March 1945 for the Okinawa invasion, arriving on 1 April, {{the day of the}} first landings, for duty installing and repairing nets until 5 August. After upkeep at Saipan, she returned to Okinawa 20 September, loaded supplies, and cleared 25 October for Bungo Suido, Japan, arriving 29 October. Here she laid navigational aids {{until the end of the}} year, sailing then for Pearl Harbor and San Pedro, California, where she arrived 1 January 1946. Cliffrose cleared San Pedro, after local operations, 3 July 1946 for Pearl Harbor, where she operated from 16 July to 16 August; Guam and Subic Bay, arriving 14 September. She served in Philippine waters until 25 December, when she cleared Subic Bay for Shanghai, arriving 31 December.|$|E
5000|$|Fidelity {{restarted}} {{main engines}} at 0500 and declined the offer to dispatch a tug from Gibraltar. Speed {{was limited to}} two knots while streaming anti-torpedo nets when observed by Meteor and Milne at 0530. [...] found Fidelity while her main engines were again stopped for repairs between 1015 and 1100. U-615 identified Fidelity as a Q-ship and shadowed her cautiously. A reconnaissance flight by Fidelitys remaining Kingfisher observed two shadowing submarines and two of Empire Shackletons lifeboats. Fidelity launched LCV-752 and LCV-754 to tow-in the lifeboats. Fidelity recovered the Kingfisher and the two landing craft with Empire Shackletons survivors that afternoon and launched MTB-105 to conduct anti-submarine patrols through the night. U-615 launched four torpedoes at Fidelity at about 2000, but the <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>net</b> protected the ship from damage. MTB-105 experienced engine problems and lost contact with Fidelity at about 2300. MTB-105 heard radio calls from Fidelity shortly after dawn, but had inadequate battery power to respond. U-435 torpedoed Fidelity at 1630 and {{was surprised by the}} size of the resulting explosion and by the large number of men subsequently seen floating in the water where the ship had sunk. MTB-105 rigged a makeshift sail to try and reach land.|$|E

50|$|The Japanese {{were not}} aware of the baseâs {{existence}} during the April 1942 carrier raids in the Indian Ocean, and Somervilleâs fleet used it extensively. Later in the war, submarine reconnaissance established the baseâs existence, but by this point the Imperial Navy had no designs for a large-scale offensive in the Indian Ocean. The German submarine U-183 did torpedo the tanker British Loyalty in March 1944, making an impressive long-range shot from outside the atoll through a gap in the <b>anti-torpedo</b> <b>nets.</b>|$|R
