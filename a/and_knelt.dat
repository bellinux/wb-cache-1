During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly got {{up in the middle of}} the service <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E

25|$|On the {{day before}} his execution, Peace was visited {{for the last time}} by his family; out of {{deference}} to their feelings, he did not ask to see Mrs. Thompson, though he had very much wished to.

25|$|In an instant, Foreman had {{regained the}} title {{he had lost}} to Muhammad Ali two decades before. He {{went back to his}} corner <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this {{historic}} victory, Foreman broke three records: he became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win the World Heavyweight Championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 67, {{during a}} banquet to {{celebrate}} Lü Meng and Gan Ning's victory at Wan County (皖縣), {{just before the}} Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, Ling Tong was angry when he saw Lü Meng praising Gan Ning, so he offered to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to avenge his father. Gan Ning sensed Ling Tong's intention so he also offered to perform with his pair of jis. Lü Meng realised that {{they were about to}} fight, so he drew his sword, carried a shield, and stood between the two men to separate them. When Sun Quan heard about the incident, he came to the banquet hall and everyone put down their weapons. When Sun Quan chided them for fighting, Ling Tong cried <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> down. Sun Quan had to repeatedly urge him to stop provoking Gan Ning.|$|E
25|$|While {{some of his}} trips (such as to the United States and the Holy Land) were {{to places}} {{previously}} visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the White House in October 1979, where he was greeted warmly by then-President Jimmy Carter. He was the first pope ever to visit several countries in one year, starting in 1979 with Mexico and Ireland. He was the first reigning pope {{to travel to the}} United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen ElizabethII, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in Britain he also visited Canterbury Cathedral <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> in prayer with Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the spot where Thomas à Becket had been killed, as well as holding several large-scale open air masses, including one at Wembley Stadium, which was attended by some 80,000 people.|$|E

25|$|Salvatore Giuliano is a 1962 Italian film {{directed}} by Francesco Rosi. Shot in a neo-realist documentary, non-linear style, it follows {{the lives of}} those involved with Giuliano. When Rosi came to Sicily in 1961 to re-enact the Portella Della Ginestra sequence massacre for the film, the trauma from 14 years earlier was still fresh. He asked 1,000 peasants to go back and enact exactly what they, their friends and relatives had been through. Events nearly slipped out of control. When the gunfire sound effects started, the crowd panicked and knocked over one of the cameras in rush to escape; women wept <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> in prayer; men threw themselves to the ground in agony. One old woman, dressed entirely in black, planted herself before the camera and repeated in an anguished wail, 'Where are my children?' Two of her sons had died at the hands of Giuliano and his band.|$|E
25|$|Rey Cometa was {{accompanied}} by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After looking like he would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450° splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> down as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and bleached hair he left the official CMLL barber finish up, shaving all of Namajague's hair off while still sitting {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E

Meanwhile, it was said that Wang and Guo had several hundred soldiers with them; initially, the soldiers stood outside Danfeng Gate (...) , outside Hanyuan Hall.

Harris had been holding the shotgun with one hand at this point and the weapon hit his face in recoil, breaking his nose. Initial reports suggest that Harris asked Bernall [...] "Do you believe in God?", to which she replied yes, before getting killed. However, three students who witnessed Bernall's death, including Emily Wyant, who had been hiding beneath the table with her, have testified that Bernall did not exchange words with Harris after his initial taunt, although Wyant stated Bernall had been praying prior to her murder.|$|E
2500|$|Although Darius's {{wife was}} renowned for her beauty, [...] "Alexander, esteeming it more kingly to govern himself than to conquer his enemies, sought no {{intimacy}} {{with any of}} them." [...] The painting focuses on a misunderstanding involving Sisygambis, Darius's mother, which was not mentioned by Plutarch, but was recounted by several late Classical writers, among them Arrian, Valerius Maximus and Quintus Curtius Rufus. According to Quintus Curtius's History of Alexander the Great, Alexander went to the women's tent accompanied only by Hephaestion, counselor to the king and his intimate friend since the two had been children. Sisygambis mistook the taller Hephaestion for Alexander, <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> before him to plead for mercy. When her error was realized, Alexander magnanimously said that Hephaestion, too, was Alexander; this assuaged Sisygambis's embarrassment over her confusion, {{and served as a}} compliment to his friend.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{decided to}} leave Britain for Australia. There were complications; having married Balawaider, Florance had {{acquired}} Polish nationality and was classified as an alien. Balawaider had war service credentials {{and was able to}} fly ahead to Australia, but Florance had to deal with official obstacles before she and the three children could embark on the Aberdeen & Commonwealth Line vessel [...] "Esperance Bay" [...] on 6 March 1948. On arrival in Fremantle, Peter Oyston recalls that his mother [...] "ran down the gangplank ahead of everyone else and against the orders of the Captain or the crew, <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> on the soil in the port, and then grabbed a handful of gravel and started eating it, and saying, 'Oh, Australia, Australia, I'm home, I'm home.

2500|$|The Kennedy eternal flame {{has also}} {{attracted}} some unwanted attention as well. The {{leader of a}} group protesting segregation in housing was nearly arrested at the grave site in August 1967 after attempting to lead a group of protesters in the singing of [...] "America the Beautiful". A mentally ill individual attempted to throw red paint on the grave in August 1971. A 23-year-old Army veteran committed suicide at the grave in 1972 by plunging a knife into his chest. The cross and the headstone marking Robert F. Kennedy's grave were stolen in 1981 and never recovered. In December 1982, an intoxicated Salvadoran immigrant broke into the cemetery at night <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> before the eternal flame. He experienced a fatal heart attack, and fell into the flame. In 1997, thieves pried loose one of the paving stones from the terrace {{in front of the}} eternal flame and attempted to make off with it. They gave up after realizing the [...] stone was too heavy to move.|$|E
2500|$|One famous {{crossing}} at Putney {{was that}} of Cardinal Wolsey in 1529 upon his 'disgrace' in falling out of favour with Henry VIII and on ceasing to be the holder of the Great Seal of England. As he was riding up Putney Hill he was overtaken {{by one of the}} royal chamberlains who presented him with a ring as a token of the continuance of his majesty's favour. When the Cardinal had heard these words of the king, he quickly lighted from his mule <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> down in the dirt upon both knees, holding up his hands for joy, and said [...] "When I consider the joyful news that you have brought to me, I could do no less than greatly rejoice. Every word pierces so my heart, that the sudden joy surmounted my memory, having no regard or respect to the place; but I thought it my duty, that in the same place where I received this comfort, to laud and praise God upon my knees, and most humbly to render unto my sovereign lord my most hearty thanks for the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the campaign, Sun Quan had two boxes made to {{hold the}} heads of Huang Zu and Su Fei (蘇飛). After Huang Zu's defeat, Su Fei was also {{captured}} and he immediately asked someone to inform Gan Ning. Gan Ning said, [...] "If Su Fei did not speak up, I'd have forgotten about him." [...] Later, when Sun Quan and his officers were celebrating the victory, Gan Ning left his seat <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> down before his lord. He kowtowed until his face was covered in blood and with tears in his eyes, he pleaded with Sun Quan, [...] "I owe Su Fei a favour. If not for him, I'd have been dead and my body abandoned in a ravine. I'd {{not have been able}} to serve under you. Now, even though Su Fei's actions warrant death, I still hope you can spare him." [...] Sun Quan was moved and he asked, [...] "What if he leaves after I spare his life?" [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Su Fei will be grateful if he is spared from death. He'll not leave even if you try to chase him away. Why would he still seek his own doom? If he really does that, I'm willing to use my head to replace his in the box." [...] Sun Quan then pardoned Su Fei.|$|E
