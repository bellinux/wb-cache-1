50|$|In {{a typical}} MAC {{flooding}} attack, a switch is fed many Ethernet frames, each containing different source MAC addresses, by the attacker. The {{intention is to}} consume the limited memory set aside in the switch to store the MAC <b>address</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Another way {{to protect}} against the problem, when using rewritable media (CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM), is to use the UDF file system, which organizes data in smaller [...] "packets", {{referenced}} by a single, updated <b>address</b> <b>table,</b> which can therefore be written in shorter bursts.|$|E

50|$|A TLB has a fixed {{number of}} slots {{containing}} page table entries and segment table entries; page table entries map virtual addresses to physical <b>addresses</b> and intermediate <b>table</b> <b>addresses,</b> while segment <b>table</b> entries map virtual addresses to segment <b>addresses,</b> intermediate <b>table</b> <b>addresses</b> and page <b>table</b> <b>addresses.</b> The virtual memory is the memory space {{as seen from}} a process; this space is often split into pages of a fixed size (in paged memory), or less commonly into segments of variable sizes (in segmented memory). The page table, generally stored in main memory, keeps track of where the virtual pages are stored in the physical memory. This method uses two memory accesses (one for the page table entry, one for the byte) to access a byte. First, the page table is looked up for the frame number. Second, the frame number with the page offset gives the actual address. Thus any straightforward virtual memory scheme would {{have the effect of}} doubling the memory access time. Hence, the TLB is used to reduce the time taken to access the memory locations in the page table method. The TLB is a cache of the page table, representing only a subset of the page table contents.|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, normal open {{addressing}} {{is a poor}} choice for large elements, because these elements fill entire CPU cache lines (negating the cache advantage), and {{a large amount of}} space is wasted on large empty table slots. If the open <b>addressing</b> <b>table</b> only stores references to elements (external storage), it uses space comparable to chaining even for large records but loses its speed advantage.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} this attack may vary across implementations, however the desired effect (by the attacker) is to force {{legitimate}} MAC addresses out of the MAC <b>address</b> <b>table,</b> causing significant quantities of incoming frames to be flooded out on all ports. It is from this flooding behavior that the MAC flooding attack gets its name.|$|E

50|$|Layer 2 {{switching}} {{uses the}} {{media access control}} address (MAC address) from the host's network interface cards (NICs) to decide where to forward frames.

One way to think of a layer 2 switch is as multiport bridge.|$|R

50|$|Linking to dynamic {{libraries}} {{is usually}} handled by linking to an import library when building or linking {{to create an}} executable file. The created executable then contains an import <b>address</b> <b>table</b> (IAT) by which all DLL function calls are referenced (each referenced DLL function contains its own entry in the IAT).

50|$|Today vendor's {{defenses}} {{are based on}} more sophisticated packers/protectors, e.g. Themida, Armadillo or ASProtect which pack the program code and tamper with entry point addresses so {{it is hard to}} find the program's original entry point (OEP).

50|$|Content-addressable {{memory is}} often used in {{computer}} networking devices. For example, when a network switch receives a data frame from one of its ports, it updates an internal table with the frame's source MAC address and the port it was received on. It then looks up the destination MAC address in the table to determine what port the frame needs to be forwarded to, and sends it out on that port. The MAC <b>address</b> <b>table</b> is usually implemented with a binary CAM so the destination port can be found very quickly, reducing the switch's latency.|$|E
50|$|In the Itanium architecture, this {{advanced}} load order may {{be issued}} by an ld.a instruction.

5000|$|... ===Symbol {{resolution}} and binding=== Each function exported by a DLL is identified by a numeric ordinal and optionally a name.

For most Windows API functions only the names are preserved across different Windows releases; the ordinals are subject to change.

5000|$|The {{data link}} layer {{addresses}} data packets based on the destination hardware’s physical Media Access Control (MAC) address. Switches within the network maintain Content <b>Address</b> <b>Tables</b> (CAMs) that maps the switch’s ports to specific MAC <b>addresses.</b> These <b>tables</b> allow the switch to securely deliver the packet to its intended physical address only. Using the switch to connect only the systems that are communicating provides much greater security than a network hub, which broadcasts all traffic over all ports, allowing an eavesdropper to intercept and monitor all network traffic. A CAM Table Exhaustion Attack basically turns a switch into a hub. [...] The attacker floods the CAM table with new MAC-to-port mappings until the table’s fixed memory allotment is full. At this point the switch no longer knows how to deliver traffic based on a MAC-to-port mapping, and defaults to broadcasting traffic over all ports. An adversary is then able to intercept and monitor all network traffic traversing the switch to include passwords, emails, instant messages, etc.|$|R
