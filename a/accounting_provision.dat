40|$|Thesis (MAcc (Accountancy)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{potential}} buyer {{of a business}} evaluates the attractiveness of the transaction by considering the financial status of the business being sold. In determining the financial status of a business {{it is more important}} to determine the nature of the assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet rather than the mere existence thereof. Included in the liabilities are accounting provisions recorded in terms of the Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to reflect a fair representation of the financial status. Although these provisions are made for accounting purposes, they cannot necessarily be deducted under the terms of the Income Tax Act, no 58 of 1962. The tax deductibility of accounting provisions has long been a potential contention when a business is sold. The Income Tax Act has specific sections that must be applied in determining the deductibility of accounting provisions, for example, section 11 (a), which is the general deduction formula; section 23 (g), which prohibits expenses not laid out for the purposes of trade; and section 23 (e), which does not allow a deduction when a reserve fund is created (for example a leave pay provision). In conducting this study, seven types of <b>accounting</b> <b>provision</b> generally recorded by businesses were identified: the bonus provision, leave pay provision, warranty provision, settlement discount and incentive-rebate provision, post employment provision, retrenchment cost provision and other provisions. These provisions are discussed in view of their possible income tax deductibility, and relevant case studies were identified to confirm the possible deductibility of these accounting provisions. In this study, the transfer of accounting provisions during the sale of a business is considered for the purposes of both the buyer and seller. The tax implications for the buyer and seller are then evaluated, as well as the subsequent treatment of the accounting provisions for the purposes of the buyer. Because the wording of the purchase contract is extremely important when a business is acquired, three examples of the wording of a purchase contract are discussed as well as the income tax implications thereof. The extent of the advice given by a tax practitioner will depend on the allegiance of the practitioner (either for the buyer or seller) and will determine how the contract will be concluded. In conclusion a tax practitioner would want to assist his client to obtain the most effective tax position for the transaction and therefore each purchase contract must be reviewed on its own set of facts...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} an attempt to assess the duality check of wealth {{determination}} through corporate reporting using the currently accepted accounting equation and/or conventional accounting. That is, the theory of interest here is to explicate as to whether prevailing accounting equation is adequate to capture all plausible realities in determining absolute economic (or otherwise) wealth of an entity. Design/methodology/approach: In enhancing a theory of interest and sensitising our argument on conventional accounting, there is a necessity to use methodical discretions; which ultimately 2 ̆ 7 inform and reflect the implicit epistemology and metaphysics 2 ̆ 7 (Ravenscroft and Williams 2009) of our discipline of accounting. We have used extant (critical) accounting literature to put forward a theoretical discourse on the context of determining an enterprise 2 ̆ 7 s wealth using two metaphors - sign to referent (Baudrillard 1983, 1994 a, 1994 b), in particular, when conventional accounting and/or Balance Sheet approach is considered. Method/data: An extensive literature both theoretical and practicing issues on accounting are collated from differing journal articles, books (mostly interdisciplinary in nature), websites, accounting standards and conceptual frameworks issued by professional accounting bodies. Findings: An augmented accounting framework is suggested in order to indicate the gaps that may arise in the prevalent accounting equation. This is inherent in the system when compared through different layers - sign to referent. That is, in a dynamic environment it is suggested {{that there is a need}} for augmentation for better representation of economic and social reality through corporate reporting. Research contributions: We argue that this augmented framework will enhance our understanding within the domain of fair value accounting, confidence <b>accounting,</b> <b>provision</b> of integrated value creating elements and discharging social responsibility, in relation to the missing elements and the nature of corporate reporting. We conclude from our discussion that prevalent accounting standards such as IFRSs (or otherwise) are considered to be signs and have epistemic objectivity. That is, the determination of wealth (in accounting) based on the current signs is, as always, objective. Whilst any different layer is considered other than the sign layer and if a comparison is made pairwise, there will always be differentials/gaps in determining absolute wealth for an entity using signs that exist at any time and space and, therefore, there is a need for augmented thinking. Therefore, we see the determination of wealth for an enterprise in accounting not only is considered to be subjective, it is socially constructed and constructing; and there needs to be an ongoing discourse which should have dialectical force for change. Originality and value: Not only is the augmented framework applicable for the measurement perspective for corporate financial (or otherwise) reporting; it is also applicable for ideological debate on accountability and sustainability of how we see the improvement of a greater humanity and justice across the world economies through corporate reporting...|$|E

30|$|In this context, ETR {{represents}} {{the relationship between}} overall tax expense, including deferred taxes, and pre-tax earnings of the year.

In contrast to this, CurrETR depicts only the current tax expenses excluding deferred taxes, and CashETR indicates the relative size of cash taxes paid (Hanlon and Heitzman 2010). As in most cases of international double taxation the German tax system imposes the exemption method by following the worldwide approach to taxing foreign income, Germany-based multinationals can easily use the benefits of lower foreign tax rates (Spengel 2005).
