40|$|Today, {{undergraduate}} students enter college with increasing-ly more sophisticated computer skills {{compared to their}} counterparts of 20 years ago. However, many instructors are still using traditional instructional strategies to teach this new generation. This research study discusses a number of strategies that were employed to teach a college-level introductory computer literacy class. The strategies included a hands-on computer skills assessment, {{the introduction of a}} flexible attendance policy, elimination of the required textbook, and the use of learning teams. We explored alternative teaching methodologies in an effort to close the gap between classroom practice and real-world application and improve student learning. Over the past 20 years, essentially all undergraduate education programs have replaced their state-mandated <b>audio-visual</b> <b>course</b> with a require...|$|E
40|$|With the great, {{constant}} renovation {{and development}} of various knowledge and economy, talents of compound, high quality and high skills are in urgent need in society; a new educational reform runs through the whole foreign teaching courses, including <b>audio-visual</b> <b>course,</b> speaking, reading, writing and translating courses. With the aid of computers, films (DVD, Mp 3 etc.) {{play an important role}} in foreign language labs in China. More and more students are interested in not only for oral but also for the process of acquiring languages. Now students are becoming stronger and stronger in their curiosity for knowledge and comprehension for acquiring languages. Therefore, the foreign teachers are confronted with the great challenges: 1) How to make audio-visual classes become effective learning process instead of pure entertainment in class; 2) How to make students become active participants in class. 3) How to practice rehearse the kinds of listening and speaking in the classroom? 4) How to help students build confidence in dealing with the language? 5) How to design classroom procedures on students ’ listening and speaking abilities? So, the purpose of this paper is to introduce some useful and practical methods to build students ’ confidence in learning English; and also to exploit the design of films ’ class through multimedia...|$|E

50|$|Sally Watson {{was born}} in Seattle, Washington and is an alumna of Reed College. She began writing fiction in 1953; while doing so she worked for Great Books and co-wrote the <b>audio-visual</b> reading <b>course,</b> Listen and Learn with Phonics. In 1964 she moved to England, where she lived for 24 years, writing meticulously {{researched}} juvenile historical fiction featuring feisty and adventurous heroines, such as Jade, published by Henry Holt and Company. Her other activities included Scottish highland dance, teaching Judo, in which she earned a black belt, and Mensa International. The publishing climate for juvenile fiction eventually changed, and by the mid-1970s her books {{had gone out of}} print.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem was}} to {{investigate}} current thoughts concerning the beginning piano class at the college level, Data were collected from published and unpublished materials from 1964 to 1976. It was found that class piano instruction usually occurs in a three- to four-semester sequence, with classes meeting from two to five periods per week, containing from four to twenty-five students. Classification of students is by interview, placement test, and/or audition. Varying room arrangements are used with either conventional or electronic pianos, plus a variety of <b>audio-visual</b> equipment, <b>Course</b> content, with varying emphases, includes sight-reading, functional skills, technique, and repertoire. Teaching techniques used are numerous and varying. Recommendations were submitted for administrators, teachers, and researchers...|$|R
40|$|It is {{the duty}} of the school and the teacher to do the best job {{possible}} in helping the students understand, and work effectively in, the society in which they must live. The use of audio-visual aids as a supplement to teaching techniques has received special emphasis in recent years. Many studies have been made regarding the use of teaching aids. However, a study of the use of teaching aids by vocational agriculture teachers has not been conducted in Nebraska. The goal {{of this study is to}} provide valuable information which could be utilized to facilitate the use of such aids in the future. Some of the results of this study are: 1. There is a limited amount of some teaching aids equipment and materials available to vocational agriculture instructors in Nebraska. 2. Teaching aids are not being used by vocational agriculture instructors as extensively as they could be. 3. Vocational agriculture trainees should be encouraged to take an <b>audio-visual</b> aids <b>course</b> in their undergraduate preparation for teaching vocational agriculture. Advisor:Arthur B.

40|$|Prior to {{the work}} carried out in 1968 {{by the author of}} this thesis, a French reading course for use in the primary school had been {{designed}} in the Department of Education at Durham University and given a small-scale trial. This thesis describes the work carried out in assessing the use of the course in a larger number of primary classes under as near as possible normal conditions. Part I of the thesis describes the background to the experiment: the rapid growth of primary French teaching in the sixties, the basic need for oral competence, and the problems expected in introducing reading. In Part II of the thesis the designing and initial trial of the reading course is described. After it had been established that the introduction of French reading did cause problems, an <b>audio-visual</b> reading <b>course</b> was designed which used a partly look-and-say, partly phonetic method. At the same time tests were designed which were to indicate how successful the course was. The course was taught to two primary classes in 1967 by a research student and the results, compared to a grammar school control group, were promising. Part III of the thesis describes the preparations made for a larger-scale assessment of the material using firstly a group of eight primary school classes taught by their usual teachers, and then in the following year a smaller group of five similar classes. The make-up of the sample and the running of the assessment programme are described. In Part IV the results of the experiment are given, and reasons suggested for the lower level of success achieved. The results of the five-class group are examined separately. Part IV concludes with a consideration of some of the linguistic problems brought to light...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the project called Online Study Support for the Subject of Business English within the Fund of Higher Education Development of the Czech Republic. It will be created {{in the form of}} a twelve-module course in the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) on the B 1 level of the Common European Framework of References for Languages. Moodle is an open source Virtual Learning Environment which is free, {{developed}} by a worldwide community and is used for study purposes. It allows the teachers to create online courses and the students to enrol in them. The course is focused on the development of business and economic terminology, on reading comprehension, listening comprehension and the work with up-to-date authentic <b>audio-visual</b> materials. The <b>course</b> comprises the topics such as business and its basic terms, business letters, business organizations, macroeconomics and microeconomics, personnel management, marketing, email, accounting and finance etc. Single units have the following structure: lead in, key words and definitions, specialist material, various activities such as filling in the gaps, multiple choice, matching, word formation, word order etc. These electronic activities are created in the most famous authoring tool in our field called Hot Potatoes, they can be stored on a central server and accessed from anywhere through the Internet. Online support will be intended for students of all faculties and fields o...|$|R
