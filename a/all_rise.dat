The site was purchased by Seattle City Light in October 2008 and vacated by Greyhound in 2010. From 2012 to 2014, Seattle City Light demolished the Greyhound facility and removed contaminated soils in preparation for construction. During the period between environmental cleanup {{and the start of}} construction, the vacant lot was used for a series of temporary public art installations collectively called <b>All</b> <b>Rise.</b>|$|E

25|$|Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. These {{prayers are}} said by the sacred ministers {{standing}} {{on the floor at}} the bottom of the steps leading up to the High Altar. They are also said to each other, kneeling, by the acolytes and those servers sitting in the liturgical choir. If the acolytes are close enough, they may say them with the sacred ministers. These prayers consist primarily of Psalm 42 with the verses said alternately between the celebrant and the other sacred ministers. While these prayers are being said, the musical choir is singing the text of the Introit. After the prayers are finished, <b>all</b> <b>rise.</b> The sacred ministers ascend the steps to the altar to cense it.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} part of their career, Rise Against's music was {{characterized}} by its gritty combination of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. With the release of Appeal to Reason, the band's music shifted toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. Rise Against is well known for their outspoken social commentary, which often permeates their lyrics. Songs like [...] "Hero of War" [...] and [...] "Survivor Guilt" [...] question the brutality of modern warfare, while [...] "Prayer of the Refugee" [...] is about forced displacement. Not <b>all</b> <b>Rise</b> Against songs discuss controversial topics, such as [...] "Savior", which is about forgiveness and broken relationships.|$|E

500|$|Not <b>all</b> <b>Rise</b> Against songs discuss {{controversial}} topics. More {{personal stories}} about broken relationships and forgiveness are common lyrical themes, {{as is the}} concept of self-reflection. The Unraveling is an early example of this style of songwriting, as the majority of the album's songs focus on friendships and memories. It was not until Revolutions per Minute that McIlrath began to incorporate social issues into their music. Despite the grim subject matter, Rise Against songs are often hopeful in nature, a decision the band conscientiously made from the very beginning. Will Rausch of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Unlike typical emo rants filled with despondency and arm chair philosophy, [...] songs deal with the reality that life sucks, but we must move on." ...|$|E

The česnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his or her own share of the loaf. The family member whose share contains the coin hidden in the česnica, will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The main course of Christmas dinner is roast pork of the pečenica.

The three sacred ministers genuflect at the foot of the altar steps, then ascend and form a line. (The deacon and subdeacon usually lift the ends of the celebrant's alb whenever they ascend the steps together, and place their closest hand under his elbows when they descend together.) The celebrant intones, i.e. sings the first few words of, the Gloria, after which the choir sings the rest and the deacon and subdeacon ascend the steps to stand at either side of the celebrant, while he says in a low voice the remainder of the Gloria independently of the choir. When they are finished they remain in this position until the singing is nearly done or, if it is a long musical setting, they may go down and sit (first genuflecting), as mentioned above at the Kyrie.
