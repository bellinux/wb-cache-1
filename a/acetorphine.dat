50|$|<b>Acetorphine</b> is a Schedule I {{controlled}} substance in the United States. Its DEA Administrative Controlled Substances Control Number is 9319 {{and the one}} salt in use, <b>acetorphine</b> hydrochloride, has a freebase conversion ratio of 0.93.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acetorphine</b> was {{developed}} in 1966 by the Reckitt research group that developed etorphine. <b>Acetorphine</b> {{was developed}} for the same purpose as etorphine itself, namely as a strong tranquilizer for use in immobilizing large animals in veterinary medicine. Despite showing some advantages over etorphine, for instance producing less toxic side effects in giraffes, <b>acetorphine</b> was never widely adopted for veterinary use, and etorphine (along with other tranquilizers such as carfentanil and azaperone) remains the drug of choice in this application.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acetorphine</b> is {{a potent}} opioid analgesic, up to 8700 times {{stronger}} than morphine by weight. It is a derivative of the more well-known opioid etorphine, which {{is used as a}} very potent veterinary painkiller and anesthetic medication, primarily for the sedation of large animals such as elephants, giraffes and rhinos.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acetorphine</b> is a {{schedule}} 9 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2017). A schedule 9 drug is {{outlined in the}} Poisons Act 1964 as [...] "Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Single Convention allows only {{drugs with}} morphine-like, cocaine-like, and cannabis-like effects {{to be added}} to the Schedules. The {{strength}} of the drug is not relevant; only the similarity of its effects to the substances already controlled. For instance, etorphine and <b>acetorphine</b> were considered sufficiently morphine-like to fall under the treaty's scope, although they are many times more potent than morphine. However, according to the Commentary: ...|$|E
50|$|Ro4-1539 (Furethylnorlevorphanol) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug from the morphinan series {{that was developed}} by the pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1950s. It acts as a potent μ-opioid agonist, and was found to be around 30-60x more potent than the related drug levorphanol in animal experiments. While it is notable for its high potency and therapeutic index (1100 in animal studies), being among the more potent μ-agonist found in the morphinan series of drugs (though not on the scale of <b>acetorphine</b> and other morphinans in the extremity of their level of potency), Ro4-1539 had no particular clinical advantages over other available opioid drugs, and was never commercially marketed.|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{derivatives}} then {{result from}} further modification of this template, with saturation of the 7,8-double bond of etorphine {{resulting in the}} even more potent dihydroetorphine (up to 12,000× potency of morphine) and acetylation of the 3-hydroxy group of etorphine resulting in <b>acetorphine</b> (8700× morphine)—although while the isopentyl homologue of etorphine is nearly three times more potent, its 7,8-dihydro and 3-acetyl derivatives are less potent than the corresponding derivatives of etorphine at 11000× and 1300× morphine respectively. Replacing the N-methyl group with cyclopropylmethyl results in opioid antagonists such as diprenorphine (M5050, which is used {{as an antidote to}} reverse the effects of etorphine, M99), and partial agonists such as buprenorphine, which is widely used in the treatment of opioid addiction.|$|E
