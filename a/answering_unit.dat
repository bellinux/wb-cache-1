40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} for visual question answering {{based on a}} recurrent deep neural network, where every module in the network corresponds to a complete <b>answering</b> <b>unit</b> with attention mechanism by itself. The network is optimized by minimizing loss aggregated from all the units, which share model parameters while receiving different information to compute attention probability. For training, our model attends to a region within image feature map, updates its memory based on the question and attended image feature, and answers the question based on its memory state. This procedure is performed to compute loss in each step. The motivation {{of this approach is}} our observation that multi-step inferences are often required to answer questions while each problem may have a unique desirable number of steps, which is difficult to identify in practice. Hence, we always make the first unit in the network solve problems, but allow it to learn the knowledge from the rest of units by backpropagation unless it degrades the model. To implement this idea, we early-stop training each unit as soon as it starts to overfit. Note that, since more complex models tend to overfit on easier questions quickly, the last <b>answering</b> <b>unit</b> in the unfolded recurrent neural network is typically killed first while the first one remains last. We make a single-step prediction for a new question using the shared model. This strategy works better than the other options within our framework since the selected model is trained effectively from all units without overfitting. The proposed algorithm outperforms other multi-step attention based approaches using a single step prediction in VQA dataset...|$|E

40|$|In visual {{question}} answering (VQA), an algorithm must answer text-based questions about images. While multiple datasets for VQA {{have been created}} since late 2014, they all have flaws in both their content and the way algorithms are evaluated on them. As a result, evaluation scores are inflated and predominantly determined by answering easier questions, {{making it difficult to}} compare different methods. In this paper, we analyze existing VQA algorithms using a new dataset. It contains over 1. 6 million questions organized into 12 different categories. We also introduce questions that are meaningless for a given image to force a VQA system to reason about image content. We propose new evaluation schemes that compensate for over-represented question-types and make it easier to study {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} algorithms. We analyze the performance of both baseline and state-of-the-art VQA models, including multi-modal compact bilinear pooling (MCB), neural module networks, and recurrent <b>answering</b> <b>units.</b> Our experiments establish how attention helps certain categories more than others, determine which models work better than others, and explain how simple models (e. g.

40|$|Cellular {{structures}} are present from the atomic level {{all the way}} up to patterns found in human skeleton. They are prevailing structures in the nature and known for their excellent mechanical, thermal, and acoustic properties. Two typical types of cellular structures, lightweight structures and compliant mechanisms, are investigated. Lightweight {{structures are}} rigid and designed to reduce weight, while increasing strength and stiffness. Compliant mechanisms are designed to transform motions and forces. Most available artificial lightweight structures are patterns of primitives. However, the performance of lightweight structures can be enhanced by using adaptive cellular structures with conformal strut orientations and sizes, like the trabeculae in femoral bone. Bending, torsion, and nonlinear behaviors of compliant mechanisms have not been sufficiently studied. In order to design adaptive cellular structures, a new unit cell, the unit truss is proposed. The unit truss approach facilitates the design of adaptive cellular structures for enhanced mechanical properties via geometric modeling, finite element analysis, shape optimization, and additive fabrication. Four research questions, which address representation, structural analysis, design synthesis, and manufacturing respectively, are raised and <b>answered.</b> <b>Unit</b> truss enables representation and mechanics analysis for adaptive cellular structures. A synthesis method using engineering optimization algorithms is developed to systematically design adaptive cellular structure. Two examples, graded cellular structure for prosthesis and compliant mechanism for morphing wings, are studied to test the unit truss approach. Ph. D.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} age-related {{differences in}} the optimality of decision boundary settings in a diffusion model analysis. In the model, {{the width of the}} decision boundary represents the amount of evidence that must accumulate in favor of a response alternative before a decision is made. Wide boundaries lead to slow but accurate responding, and narrow boundaries lead to fast but inaccurate responding. There is a single value of boundary separation that produces the most correct answers in a given period of time, and we refer to this value as the reward rate optimal boundary (RROB). We consistently found across a variety of decision tasks that older adults used boundaries that were much wider than the RROB value. Young adults used boundaries that were closer to the RROB value, although age differences in optimality were smaller with instructions emphasizing speed than with instructions emphasizing accuracy. Young adults adjusted their boundary settings to more closely approach the RROB value when they were provided with accuracy feedback and extensive practice. Older participants showed no evidence of making boundary adjustments in response to feedback or task practice, and they consistently used boundary separation values that produced accuracy levels that were near asymptote.
