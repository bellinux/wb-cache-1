5000|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The albums title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the titles meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you cant put a record out without people saying its derivative of something else. So by saying the records already been heard, its kind of like saying, Yeah, youre right. Were doing something thats already been done before." [...] He reinforced, [...] "Were not trying to break new ground in music. Were {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesnt seem like were departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential <b>and</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there." ...|$|E
5000|$|More than 25 years later, Evangelistas quote {{about the}} $10,000 a day has {{continued}} to be referenced in the media, being mentioned as late as July 2017. Evangelista herself has said, [...] "I saw a movie, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, <b>and</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> line in it where Brad Pitt says he wont {{get out of bed}} for less than half a million dollars. Thats my line! Only now its a half million and its a man saying it." [...] Over the years, various different t-shirts emblazoned with the $10,000 a day quote have been sold, and there is even an embroided pillow containing the quote. The G Hotel in Galway, Ireland, includes a presidential suite that was named in honor of Evangelista, with its interiors designed by Treacy. The September 1991 issue of Vogue had a photo spread titled [...] "Wild At Heart" [...] that featured Evangelista, photographed by Lindbergh. One of the images from that spread is known as [...] "The Wild Ones", and a platinum-palladium print of the image was sold at a Sothebys auction for over $30,000. In October 2012, a picture of Evangelista and McMenamy that was photographed by Meisel for Vogues October 1992 issue was sold at a Phillips auction for $86,500. In May 2016, a 1988 picture of Evangelista and five other models that was photographed by Lindbergh sold at a Sothebys auction for $118,462.

5000|$|Anonymous: [...] "...so, if we {{dislike the}} {{certificate}} {{model in the}} (tls) PKI, but we like, say, the SSH PKI, which seems to work fairly well, basically the fundamental thing is: if I give my data to someone, I trust them with the data. So I should be remembering their certificate. If someone else comes in with a different certificate, signed by a different authority, I still dont trust them. And if we did it that way, then that would solve {{a lot of the}} problems- it would solve the problems of rogue CAs, to some extent, it wouldnt help you with the initial bootstrapping but the initial bootstrapping would use the initial model, and then for continued interaction with the site you would use the ssh model which would allow you continued strength beyond what we have now. So the model we have now can be continued to be re-used, for only the initial acceptance. So why dont we do this?"Dan: [...] "So, Im a former SSH developer, and let me walk very quickly, every time theres an error in the ssh key generation, the user is asked, please type yes to trusting this new key, or, please go into your known hosts file and delete that value, and every last time they do it, because its always the fault of a server misconfiguration. The SSH model is cool, it dont scale".Moxie: [...] "And I would just add, what youre talking about is called Trust on First Use, or tofu, <b>and</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> project that Im involved in called perspectives, that tries to leverage that to be less confusing than the pure SSH model, and I think its a really great project and you should check it out if youre interested in alternatives to the CA system." ...|$|E

5000|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assanges friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assanges performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assanges legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, <b>and</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> good reason hes controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We staff dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tempest {{described}} Josh as {{an accidental}} ladies man, [...] "The thing about Josh is he's never {{trying to be}} a ladies man. But as it turns out, chicks really dig that." [...] Upon his arrival to the show, Josh was placed in scenes with the returned character of Paige Munroe (Rachel Foreman) and a partnership was established between the two. Tempest believed that the characters got on well due to both having checkered pasts, Josh having lost his fiancé to a drug overdose and Paige having recovered from a drug addiction that saw the death of Jill Kingsbury (Natalie Medlock). Foreman explained, [...] "The two definitely cross paths, <b>and</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> connection, but Paige can't put her finger on it. There are a lot of mixed feelings. It's quickly very clear that Josh doesn't want to reveal himself to anyone, so that makes getting into a relationship difficult. But it's all part of his charm." [...] Tempest believed the characters backgrounds incidentally lead them to each other, [...] "There is what seems like flirting, but it's really just a lot of awkwardness. Both of them are wary about getting into a relationship. Paige has her issues and Josh has his." [...] Foreman agreed with Tempest's view, [...] "I think Josh and Paige are quite similar but just cursed by their respective pasts. They both have baggage and aren't very good at acknowledging it!" [...] Josh and Paige briefly dated but in August, Josh started to develop feelings for Lana Jacobs (Brooke Williams), much to the angst of her ex-boyfriend, Daniel Potts (Ido Drent). Lana warned Josh that she was too preoccupied for a serious romance but he promised there would be little strings attached. However shortly into the relationship in what Tempest described a shortened [...] "honeymoon period", Lana began to shut Josh off in favour of mingling with her recently arrived friends Emma Franklin (Amy Usherwood) and Kylie Brown (Kerry-Lee Dewing). Tempest compared this to how Josh treated Paige, [...] "Its almost like karma. Josh was stand offish with Paige and now he's getting a taste of his own medicine. The roles are reversed and he doesn't like being on the receiving end." [...] Josh soon realized the three girls were starting a smear campaign against Boyd Rolleston (Sam Bunkall) and began to question if Lana was who he wanted to date. Williams didn't think Lana and Josh were well suited together, describing Josh as being [...] "mean" [...] to Lana and not [...] "loose" [...] or [...] "kind" [...] enough.|$|E
