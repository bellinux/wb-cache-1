5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E
5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E

A survey of 80 American women showed that 30% <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by {{altruism}} alone, another 20% were attracted only by monetary compensation, while 40% of donors <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by both reasons. The same {{study found that}} 45% of egg donors were students {{the first time they}} donated and averaged $4,000 for each donation.|$|R

Agathias also claimed there was a short-lived effect on the attitude of the population: the wealthy <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to charity, doubters <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to pray, and the vicious <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to virtue, all in an apparent effort of propitiation. Agathias reports that soon enough everyone lapsed into their former attitudes.|$|R
5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin's {{interest}} in Taoism influenced {{much of her}} science fiction work.

She was also influenced by her early {{interest in}} mythology, and her exposure to cultural diversity as a child. Her protagonists are frequently interested in the cultures they are investigating, and <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> to preserve them rather than conquer them. Authors who influenced Le Guin include Victor Hugo, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Italo Calvino, and Lao Tzu.|$|E
