40|$|The most {{frequently}} used speech coding paradigm is ACELP, famous because it encodes speech with high quality, while consuming a small bandwidth. ACELP performs linear prediction filtering in order to eliminate {{the effect of the}} spectral envelope from the signal.

Four different transformation algorithms have been implemented (DCT, DFT, Eigenvalue decomposition and Vandermonde decomposition) in order to decorrelate the samples of the innovative excitation in ACELP.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} pupils' {{learning}} of algebra have been inclined to study errors in given answers. The present study attempts to investigate pupils' thinking {{processes in the}} early stages of learning algebra by examining and comparing responses made by English and Thai pupils to the researcher's algebra test. The research was conducted among pupils during their "normal" lessons in secondary school algebra. Pupil participants were in the first two years of secondary education. Data collection included lesson observations, interviews, and the researcher's algebra test. The thinking processes were first categorised from the interview data to provide a framework for analysing pupils' written responses to the researcher's test. Later, a codebook was kept in which pupils' responses to the researcher’s test were coded. The study goes on to analyse the outcomes from this coding procedure. The research indicates that the differences in the way pupils think appear to be closely related to the teaching and curriculum provided. In both countries, success in algebra is dependent on having good arithmetic skills. Also the reluctance of pupils to use algebra to solve easy problems results in algebraic skills being inadequately developed to solve more difficult problems. An implication for practice is that the Thai school should consider the bearing which the understanding of simplification of like terms has upon a pupil's ability to solve linear equations. Both schools could consider ways of making effective use of patterns and sequences to develop <b>algebraic</b> thinking. The <b>codebook</b> developed in this research could serve as a tool for mathematics teachers in helping them to understand the complexity of their pupils thinking processes in solving algebraic problems. An investigation involving more schools in other settings could follow this. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT⎯This letter {{proposes a}} new {{embedded}} speech coding structure {{based on the}} Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) standard codec. The proposed coding scheme consists of three different bitrates where the two lower bitrates are embedded into the highest one. The embedded bitstream was achieved by modifying the <b>algebraic</b> <b>codebook</b> search procedure adopted for the AMR-WB codec. The proposed method provides the advantage of scalability due to the embedded bitstream, while it inevitably requires some additional computational complexity for obtaining two different code vectors of the higher bitrate modes.

These methods include using extended cost horizon in the fixed codebook search process, as well as joint optimization and delayed decision coding of the adaptive and fixed codebook parameters. Based on our simulations for the IS- 641 speech coder, substantial improvements in terms of objective performance are achieved especially by using delayed decision coding, while the subjective improvements are more marginal. This paper also presents the justification for efficient coding methods based on the distribution of adaptive and <b>algebraic</b> <b>codebook</b> indices in the modified IS- 641 coders, as well as demonstrates the performance improvements achieved by using a shaped lattice structure and adaptive pulse positioning to encode the adaptive and <b>algebraic</b> <b>codebook</b> indices. While the simulations were made using the IS- 641 speech coder or a modified version of it, the results and observations can be generalized to most ACELP and CELP coders.

30|$|In a bid {{to enhance}} the search performance, this paper {{presents}} an improved version of reduced candidate mechanism (RCM), an <b>algebraic</b> <b>codebook</b> search conducted on an algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP) speech coder. This improvement is made based on two findings {{in a piece of}} our prior work. The first finding is that a pulse with a high contribution in the associated track is more likely to serve as an optimal pulse in the optimal codevector and the second is that the speech quality can be well maintained at a search accuracy above 50 % approximately. Subsequently, a new finding in this study concerning a structured <b>algebraic</b> <b>codebook</b> in G. 729 indicates that there is a 0.8321 probability that the number 1 ranked pulse in a global sorting by pulse contribution is indeed one of the optimal pulses. Hence, the number 1 pulse in the global sorting is labeled as one of the optimal pulses, following which a sequence of search tasks are fulfilled through RCM. This proposed complexity reduction algorithm, implemented on a G. 729 A speech codec, takes as few as eight searches, a search load tantamount to 2.5 % of G. 729 A, 12.5 % of global pulse replacement method (iteration = 2), 16.7 % of iteration-free pulse replacement method, and 50 % of RCM (N = 2). This proposal is thus found to successfully reduce the required computational complexity to a great extent as intended.|$|E

Thus, this proposal is validated as a superior candidate in the aspect of search performance. In addition, the proposed approach can be implemented to other ACELP-based speech coders.|$|E
30|$|For this sake, full search {{scheme is}} hardly adopted in most {{prominent}} speech coding standards. There {{have been a}} great number of studies proposed on search load reduction, say, the focus search in G. 729 [3] and the depth-first search in G. 729 A [5], among other approaches. In recent times, to further reduce the computational complexity, there are many effective <b>algebraic</b> <b>codebook</b> search algorithms [6]–[14] proposed to reduce the pulse combinations. For example, the candidate scheme [6] attempts to decrease the number of the candidate positions. The least important pulse replacement [7] is presented to repeatedly measure the contribution of each pulse and replace the least important pulse with a new one. Analogous to [7], the global pulse replacement (GPR) [8], adopted by G. 729.1 [9], and the iteration-free pulse replacement (IFPR) [10],[11] methods are proposed to further efficiently reduce the search complexity.|$|E

For 2 -D EMG recordings of 56 signals, the coding technique resulted in SNR greater than 3. 4 ± 1. 3 dB with respect to independent coding of the signals in the grid when the compression ratio was 89 %. For EEG recordings of 15 signals and the same compression ratio as for EMG, the average gain in SNR was 2. 4 ± 0. 1 dB.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityThis thesis studies lattice vector {{quantization}} (LVQ) with application to audio and image sources. The performance of nonzero pulse amplitude quantization implicit in <b>algebraic</b> <b>codebook</b> code-excited linear prediction (ACELP) is examined {{and it is}} demonstrated that the quantization used in ACELP is effective in a rate-distortion sense at the encoding rates commonly used. A block-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to model the marginal distribution and the block energy distribution of transform audio data. The expectation-maximization algorithm is used to estimate the GMM parameters. A GMM-based rate-distortion function is derived and shown to closely match the observed spherical LVQ performance. Then, we move forward to the lattice VQ on transformed image. The GMM is used to motivate a subband image coding algorithm based on lattice-based spherical VQ and lattice-based pyramid VQ. The algorithm partitions a subband image into blocks of various sizes, depending on their energy and complexity constraints on the enumeration encoding of lattice codevectors. Using the cubic lattice, the algorithm provides performance competitive with the set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm. A bit-plane coding method is developed for the encoding of binary lattice codevectors as binary codewords, yielding an embedded bitstream. In sign-magnitude representation, only a few least significant bit-planes are constrained due {{to the structure of}} the lattice, while there is no restriction on other more significant bit-planes. Simple encoding methods for the lattice-defining bit-planes of the $D_ 4 $, $RE_ 8 $, and Barnes-Wall 16 -dimensional lattices are described. Simulation results for these lattices show that partial decoding of the resulting embedded bitstream provides about the same performance as for the integer lattice. When the entire bitstream is fully decoded, the granular gain of the lattice is realized. Department of Electrical Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|E
