He intensified the strict segregation of patients through the construction of barbwired fences, and the building of a special prison. At that time, two nurses performed a vasectomy and an <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion,</b> with no records of him performing either operation. Tada declared that the mark of a red cross would prevent air-raids, but the sanatorium was destroyed by air-raids. Since the houses of the sanatorium workers were also destroyed, he and other leaders of the sanatorium escaped in a shelter of the army, while 110 in-patients died either of malaria, malnutrition, or as direct effect of air-raids in 1945. After the war, he worked in Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium between 1947 and 1950. He died in 1950.|$|E
40|$|Criminal Aspects of <b>Artificial</b> <b>Abortion</b> This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion,</b> {{especially}} its criminal aspects. Legal aspects are not the most important aspects of <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion.</b> Social, ethical or ideological aspects are of the same importance but this diploma thesis cannot analyse all of them. The main issue with <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion</b> is whether it is possible to force a pregnant woman to carry a child and give birth to a child when she cannot or does not want to do so, and whether a state can prosecute a pregnant woman or anyone else for interrupting her pregnancy. The thesis is divided into an introduction, seven chapters and conclusion. After a short introduction, the author of this thesis briefly defines the concept of <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion.</b> The following chapter focuses on two ideological groups - pro choice and pro life. The first group prefers mother's right to self-determination. The second group regards a human foetus as a person and considers killing the human foetus as a murder. The third chapter is dedicated to historical development of <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion.</b> The author regards historical development as an important part of this thesis, especially for understanding the current legislation.

The relevance of intrauterine infection to spontaneous embryonic death is rarely studied and remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between intrauterine bacterial infection and early embryonic developmental arrest. Methods: Embryonic chorion tissue and uterine swabs for bacterial detection were obtained from 33 patients who underwent <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion</b> (control group) and from 45 patients who displayed early embryonic developmental arrest (trial group). Results: Intrauterine bacterial infection was discovered in both groups. The infection rate was 24. 44 % (11 / 45) in the early embryonic developmental arrest group and 9. 09 % (3 / 33) in the <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion</b> group. Classification analysis revealed that the highest detection rate for Micrococcus luteus in the early embryonic developmental arrest group was 13. 33 % (6 / 45), and none was detected in the <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion</b> group. M. luteus infection was significantly different between the groups (P < 0. 05 as shown by Fisher's exact test).

This study aimed to {{investigate}} aneuploidy in spontaneous abortion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes for 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y chromosomes. Methods: A total of 840 chorionic samples from spontaneous abortion were collected and examined by FISH. We analyzed the incidence and type of abnormal cases and sex ratio in the samples. We also analyzed the relationship between the rate of aneuploidy and parental age, the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent abortion and sporadic abortion, the difference in incidence of aneuploidy between samples from previous <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion</b> and those from no previous induced abortion. Results: A total of 832 samples were finally analyzed. 368 (44. 23 %) were abnormal, in which 84. 24 % (310 / 368) were aneuploidies and 15. 76 % (58 / 368) were polyploidies. The first was trisomy 16 (121 / 310), followed by trisomy 22, and X monosomy. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of aneuploidy in the advanced maternal age group (≥ 35 years old) and young maternal age group (< 35 years old). However, the rate of trisomy 22 and the total rate of trisomies 21, 13, and 18 (the number of trisomy 21 plus trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 together) showed significantly different in two groups. We found no skewed sex ratio. There was no significant difference in the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent miscarriage and sporadic abortion or between the samples from previous <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion</b> and those from no previous <b>artificial</b> <b>abortion.</b> Conclusions: Aneuploidy is a principal factor of miscarriage and total parental age is a risk factor.
