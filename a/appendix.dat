It is listed on <b>Appendix</b> II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. It is also covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to assess t e role of ibopamine, in the {{treatment}} of patients with heart failure. Ibopamine is an orally active dopamine agonist which has beneficial hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects. In the 10 <b>Appendices</b> both clinical and experimental studies are reported that were designed to examine the efficacy and safety of ibopamine. The clinical studies, which constitute <b>Appendices</b> 1 - 7, were conducted in patients with mild, moderate and severe heart failure. In these studies, we evaluated the influence of ibopamine on hemodynamics (<b>Appendices</b> 3, 4, 6), renal function (<b>Appendices</b> 5, 6), neurohumoral parameters (<b>Appendices</b> 1, 2, 3), arrhythmias and electrophysiology (<b>Appendices</b> 1, 3), exercise tolerance (<b>Appendices</b> 1, 2), signs and symptoms of heart failure and side-effects (<b>Appendices</b> 1, 5, 7).

5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under <b>Appendix</b> II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} <b>Appendix</b> II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either <b>Appendix</b> I or <b>Appendix</b> II protection. <b>Appendix</b> II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under <b>Appendix</b> II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to <b>Appendix</b> I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|E

Firstly, it addresses {{the problem of the}} definition of these constructions and of their classification. The authors also address the question of the grammaticalization of these constructions. They argue that this question is highly important in the analysis of the pragmatic functions of <b>appendixes.</b> In this discussion, a distinction is made between construction and configuration. In {{the second part of the}} article, the various pragmatic functions of <b>appendixes</b> are examined. Two related hypotheses are presented, which are assumed to explain many <b>appendixes.</b> The first one concerns informational flow; the second one concerns prosodic properties of discourse, especially in conversation. These hypotheses make it possible to account for many semantic, pragmatic, and interactional «effects» of <b>appendixes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with Go Man Go's registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, the <b>Appendix</b> and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was originally registered in the <b>Appendix,</b> as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the <b>Appendix</b> into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. Go Man Go certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go Man Go needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his <b>Appendix</b> number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of Go Man Go's first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|E
