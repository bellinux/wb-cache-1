At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety <b>and</b> <b>shuffled</b> across the crease.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult {{for the first few}} weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety <b>and</b> <b>shuffled</b> across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|The genus Leptocharias {{was coined}} by South African {{physician}} and zoologist Andrew Smith, without any associated species, in an 1838 Magazine of Natural History article by Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle. Müller and Henle added a species {{a year later}} in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, but adopted the name Triaenodon smithii because they regarded Leptocharias as a junior synonym of Triaenodon. Later authors recognized the validity of Leptocharias, <b>and</b> <b>shuffled</b> it between the families Carcharhinidae and Triakidae before placing it in its own family.

25|$|The wet {{beans are}} then transported to a {{facility}} {{so they can}} be fermented and dried. They are fermented for four to seven days and must be mixed every two days. They are dried for five to 14 days, depending on the climate conditions. The fermented beans are dried by spreading them out over a large surface and constantly raking them. In large plantations, this is done on huge trays under the sun or by using artificial heat. Small plantations may dry their harvest on little trays or on cowhides. Finally, the beans are trodden <b>and</b> <b>shuffled</b> about (often using bare human feet) and sometimes, during this process, red clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color, polish, and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Drying in the sun is preferable to drying by artificial means, as no extraneous flavors such as smoke or oil are introduced which might otherwise taint the flavor.|$|E

She said there was overcapacity in the fishing industry and that fish processing plants would need to close. Minister Jackman, who represents a district that relies heavily on the fishing industry, continued to face much criticism for his performance in the fisheries portfolio and was re-elected by just 40 votes. The day after winning a majority government, Dunderdale stated {{in an interview that}} tough decisions were looming in the industry.

500|$|Woodfull {{batted in}} a manner which had little {{aesthetic}} pleasure or grace, with Wisden describing stating that [...] "at first sight, he {{gave the impression of}} being clumsy". Affected by a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood, he had stiff-jointed style, and played with little noticeable backlift. This gave the impression of a laboured playing style. Despite this, he scored consistently through good placement and powerful drives generated by his strong forearms. Despite his leaden appearance, he often advanced down the pitch to spin bowling. He was known for playing with a straight bat and a close watch on the ball, which were the core features of a strong defensive ability. He typically took block on leg stump <b>and</b> <b>shuffled</b> across to cover his stumps. His defensive prowess yielded names such as [...] "the unbowlable" [...] (a reference {{to the fact that he}} was rarely bowled as a result of missing the ball) and [...] "wormkiller". The latter epithet was given to him by English bowlers who said that his backlift was so small that it was only enough to decapitate worms that had raised their heads above ground level. He was also known for his reliability in crisis match situations, leading to epithets such as [...] "The Rock" [...] and [...] "Old Steadfast". Woodfull formed an opening partnership with Bill Ponsford at state and international level which yielded 18 century opening stands. Dubbed [...] "Mutt and Jeff" [...] by teammates after the famous comic strip duo, as well as [...] "Willy Wo and Willy Po", they were regarded as one of the finest opening partnerships in Test history. Their Victorian teammates had such faith in the pair that if they were batting, the wicket-keeper and bowlers who batted low in the order would leave the ground to go to work.|$|E

Additionally, most of the songs' structures do not follow the standard verse-chorus-verse form. Skeleton Tree has been also described as an alternative rock album, which features elements of electronica—including use of synthesisers, drum machines <b>and</b> <b>shuffled</b> beats. The album's [...] "sparse and restrained" [...] arrangements, as well as its use of loops and downtempo rhythms, have been cited by several critics as reminiscent of ambient music.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOperations on {{strings and}} languages, such as shuffle, {{iterated}} <b>shuffle,</b> inverse <b>shuffle</b> <b>and</b> cancellation, {{have been used}} to describe sequentialized execution histories of concurrent processes. The power of these operations and their relation to the usual AFL-operations is studied and it is shown that flow expressions [11, 12], event expressions [8 – 10] and even very restricted variants of them define all the recursively enumerable sets. The family of recursively enumerable languages is equal to the least full trio which is in addition closed under iterated <b>shuffle,</b> <b>and</b> it is also equals the the smallest family of languages containing the finite sets <b>and</b> closed under(a) <b>shuffle,</b> iterated <b>shuffle,</b> <b>and</b> inverse shuffle;(b) <b>shuffle,</b> iterated <b>shuffle,</b> <b>and</b> cancellation;(c) product, iterated <b>shuffle,</b> <b>and</b> cancellation with finite sets;(d) product, iterated <b>shuffle,</b> <b>and</b> inverse <b>shuffle</b> with regular sets;(e) product, iterated <b>shuffle,</b> homomorphisms, <b>and</b> inverse homomorphisms.
