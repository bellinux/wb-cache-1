5|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Court {{overturned}} the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented. By giving <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> a broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision prepared {{the way for}} Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions.

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas. At other points the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian border guards and harassed civilians, hoping to provoke a retaliation that would serve as <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> a full-scale military attack.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> {{existence}} by {{the national}} monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney's office, headed by Janet Reno. In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation {{that all of the}} town's elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> the holding.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> a large-scale U.S. {{military intervention in}} Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, {{as part of its}} commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role in}} the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{bibliographer}} Vaclovas Biržiška, between 1800 and 1864, {{when the}} press ban was enacted, 926 book titles {{were published in}} the Lithuanian language using its Latin alphabet.

25|$|Numerous {{literary}} figures {{developed a}} conservative sensibility and warned of threats to Western Civilization. In the 1900–1950 era Henry Adams, T. S.

Instead they searched for <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> promoting traditional cultural values in the face of their fear of an onslaught by moral nihilism based on historical and scientific relativism.|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{economics}} presents <b>a</b> “paternalistic” <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> benevolent government intervention. This paper {{presents a}} model of public debt where voters have self-control problems and attempt to commit using illiquid assets. In equilibrium, government accumulates debt to respond to individuals’ desire to undo their commitments, which leads individuals to rebalance their portfolio, in turn feeding into a demand for further debt accumulation. As a consequence, (i) large (and distortionary) government debt accumulation occurs, and (ii) banning illiquid assets could improve individuals’ welfare. These results offer <b>a</b> new <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> balanced budget rules in constitutions to restrain governments’ responses to voters’ self-control problems...|$|R

25|$|As a philosophy, kintsugi {{can be seen}} to have {{similarities}} to the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, an embracing of the flawed or imperfect. Japanese aesthetics values marks of wear by the use of an object. This can be seen as <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> keeping an object around even after it has broken and as a justification of kintsugi itself, highlighting the cracks and repairs as simply an event in the life of an object rather than allowing its service to end {{at the time of its}} damage or breakage.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 10th century {{no attempt}} was made to use a human to symbolize God the Father in Western art. Yet, Western art {{eventually}} required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. <b>A</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of Man in the image of His own (thus allowing Human to transcend the other animals).|$|E
25|$|The Torah also relates God's {{instructions}} to Moses that {{the exodus of}} the Israelites from Egypt must be celebrated early on the holiday of Passover (Pesaḥ פסח); the rituals observed on Passover recall the events surrounding the exodus from Egypt.

This event is also commemorated by the Fast of the Firstborn on the day preceding Passover but which is traditionally not observed because a siyum celebration is held which obviates {{the need for a}} fast.|$|E
