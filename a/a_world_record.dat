5|$|England faced {{a target}} of 596, which would have {{required}} <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 {{the club}} faced {{financial}} difficulties {{and so was}} forced to sell David Jack to Arsenal to raise funds. Despite the pressure to sell, the agreed fee of £10,890 was <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record,</b> {{more than double the}} previous most expensive transfer of a player.|$|E

Special effects were created using almost all formats, including model work, CGI and practical effects.

Revenge of the Sith has 2,151 shots that use special effects, <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|The victory made Woodfull {{the only}} captain {{to regain the}} Ashes twice. He scored 1,268 runs at 52.83 during the tour with three centuries. His tally of 25 Tests as captain was <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> and {{remained}} unsurpassed {{for a quarter of}} a century.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe began {{competition}} in 2002 at the Australian Championships in Brisbane in March, which {{were used to}} select the team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Spitz's seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> was the talking point. He claimed the 100m and 200m events in times outside his best, making {{it the first time}} that he had failed to break <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> at a major meet since 1999. He also experimented by adding the 100m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second. This earned him a Commonwealth spot in a seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.|$|E
50|$|In the men's competition, Im Dong-Hyun of South Korea set <b>an</b> {{individual}} <b>world</b> <b>record</b> of 699 {{points for}} 72 arrows. The South Korean team also set <b>a</b> new <b>world</b> <b>record</b> for <b>a</b> 216 arrow total, with 2,087 points.|$|R

5|$|Washbrook and Hutton put on 168 for {{the first}} wicket, the first time England had put on more than 42 for opening stand, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series.

5|$|After Commonwealth {{disappointment}} on home turf, Chambers {{won gold}} medals in the 100m and 4×100m relay at the 2002 European Championships in Munich, setting a championship record of 9.96s. Chambers recorded a time of 9.94s at the Weltklasse Zürich meeting, again beating world record holder Greene. He finished the season by equalling Linford Christie's European record at the 2002 IAAF Grand Prix Final. His run of 9.87s with a maximum allowable wind of +2.0m/s left him second to Tim Montgomery, who set <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> of 9.78s. Chambers received the 2002 European Athlete of the Year Trophy for his achievements on the track that year.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving {{and when he was}} out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It would take <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
50|$|He ran {{his first}} {{marathon}} {{at the end}} of October, 1931. Ten days later he ran <b>a</b> new <b>world</b> <b>record</b> in 30 km (1:42:30.4). Later, before the 1936 Summer Olympics, Zabala would run <b>a</b> new <b>world</b> <b>record</b> in 20 km (1:04:00.2).|$|R
50|$|LaVallee set <b>a</b> new <b>World</b> <b>Record</b> unofficially {{during his}} jump landing at a {{distance}} of 412 ft. Robbie Maddison landed his jump at 378 ft, 9 inches also <b>an</b> unofficial <b>World</b> <b>Record,</b> but short of his stated goal of 400 ft.|$|R

5|$|At the World Championships Chambers {{finished}} {{sixth in}} 100m final with a season's best of 10.00seconds. He {{was the only}} sprinter from outside the Americas in the final and was some distance behind Bolt who ran <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> of 9.58seconds. However, he was very pleased with his performance {{and said he was}} happy just {{to be involved in the}} fastest 100m race ever. He pulled out of the 200m with a calf injury and called an end to his season.|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{may have}} competed against {{individuals}} with different classifications {{in the same}} event. For example, track and field athlete Jim Bob Bizzell competed in the men's 200meters T44; the prefix T designated a track event and 44 was the disability classification. Although he finished behind Oscar Pistorius (competing under the T43 class), Bizell set <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> in the T44 classification. For specific classification information, see the pages for individual sports at 2008 Summer Paralympics#Sports.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Berces set <b>a</b> 24-hour <b>world</b> <b>record</b> on the {{treadmill}} and set <b>a</b> 100-mile <b>world</b> <b>record</b> as well en route. Both of these records still stand {{and the strength of}} the 24 record is shown by the fact that at the time, it was better than the men's <b>world</b> <b>record.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hank Thompson set <b>a</b> <b>World</b> Series <b>record</b> for bases on balls {{received}} {{during a}} four-game series with seven and Bob Lemon set <b>a</b> <b>World</b> Series <b>record</b> for bases on balls given up during a four-game Series with eight.|$|R

5|$|Australia had {{retained}} the Ashes, but England struck back at The Oval, where they posted the then-record Test score of 7/903. Early on, O'Reilly trapped Edrich lbw for 12, to secure his 100th Test wicket against England. In a timeless match, Len Hutton made <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> Test score of 364 in a fastidious and watchful innings of 13 hours, surpassing Bradman's 334. When {{he was on}} 333, O'Reilly deliberately bowled two no-balls {{in an attempt to}} break Hutton's concentration by tempting him to hit out, but the Englishman blocked them with a straight bat.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was still}} {{unavailable}} for the Fourth Test, but Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett {{was promoted to}} open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Although Hassett failed with only 13 and 17 in his two innings, Harvey struck 112 in the first innings, before Australia chased down 404 {{on the final day}} to set <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> for the highest successful run-chase in Test cricket and won by seven wickets.|$|E
5|$|During the drawn Third Test, opening batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This {{opened up}} a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Hamence made 30 as Australia {{defeated}} Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match before the Fourth Test at Headingley. Hamence was overlooked for the vacancy as Harvey was called in. Australia scored 3/404 to set <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>record</b> for the highest successful Test run chase; Harvey scored a century.|$|E
