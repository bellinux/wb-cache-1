Admitting {{that each of these}} faint spots is a sidereal system, so far removed that its countless stars give less light than one small star of our own sidereal system; the admission is in no way inconsistent with the belief that stars, and their attendant planets, have been formed by the aggregation of nebulous matter. Though, doubtless, if the existence of nebulous matter now in course of concentration be disproved, one of the evidences of the Nebular Hypothesis is destroyed, yet the remaining evidences remain.

And, indeed, it might be argued that the still-continued existence of diffused nebulous matter is scarcely to be expected; seeing that the causes which have resulted in the aggregation of one mass, must have been acting on all masses, and that hence the existence of masses not aggregated would be a fact calling for explanation.

The position taken must be this:--Though mucous membrane in a highly-evolved individual organism, thus shows the powerful effect of the medium on its surface; yet we must not suppose that the medium had the effect of producing such a cell-structure on the surfaces of primitive forms, undifferentiated though they were; or, if we suppose that such an effect was produced on them, we must not suppose that it was inheritable. Contrariwise, we must suppose that such effect of the medium either was not wrought at all, or that it was evanescent: though repeated through millions upon millions of generations it left no traces. And we must conclude that this skin-structure arose only in consequence of spontaneous variations not physically initiated (though like those physically initiated) which natural selection laid hold of and increased.

In our current climate in the postmodern world, the concept of knowledge as a commodity has became a viable and accepted custom. Intrinsic to this notion of knowledge as capital, culture is viewed as a production in itself and as an artefact by which to examine both the dimensions and layers of thinking pertinent to the navigation of cultural demarcations. This paper contends that the principal framework of ‘doing business’ needs to engender Cultural Connectivity and that this should be placed at the forefront of interpersonal interactions. Cultural Connectivity utilises both cultural intelligence as the thinking within culturally diverse exchanges; and cultural competence as the dexterity of the user to successfully negotiate through the maze of cultural contexts. Cultural Connectivity is the broader construct of how we can perceive similarities within culturally diverse contexts to make connections at a ‘humanness’ level. American President Barrack Obama, as an effective example of this practice, is tendered as representational of the positive role model in this instance. As a recognizable ‘global citizen’, he is in <b>a</b> strong, <b>tenable</b> <b>position</b> to be accepted across a range of cultural boundaries.

40|$|It is {{well known}} {{that one of the most}} famous {{arguments}} for scientific realism, called "no miracles argument," is begging the question against anti-realism because it has the same inferential form with "inference to the best explanation," whose legitimacy is at stake in the scientific realism debate.

40|$|The problem {{discussed}} in this paper emerges from work I’ve done on the modern ideal of autonomy. 1 I found that autonomy is often seen as a morally neutral term.

6000|$|Ruskin {{may be very}} roughly {{regarded}} as the young lieutenant of Carlyle in his war on Utilitarian Radicalism: but as an individual he presents many and curious divergences. In the matter of style, he enriched English without disordering it. And {{in the matter of}} religion (which was the key of this age as of every other) he did not, like Carlyle, set up the romance of the great Puritans as a rival to the romance of the Catholic Church. Rather he set up and worshipped all the arts and trophies of the Catholic Church as a rival to the Church itself. None need dispute that he held <b>a</b> perfectly <b>tenable</b> <b>position</b> if he chose to associate early Florentine art with a Christianity still comparatively pure, and such sensualities as the Renaissance bred with the corruption of a Papacy. But this does not alter, as a merely artistic fact, the strange air of ill-ease and irritation with which Ruskin seems to tear down the gargoyles of Amiens or the marbles of Venice, as things of which Europe is not worthy; and take them away with him to a really careful museum, situated dangerously near Clapham. Many of the great men of that generation, indeed, had a sort of divided mind; an ethical headache which was literally a [...] "splitting headache"; for there was a schism in the sympathies. When these men looked at some historic object, like the Catholic Church or the French Revolution, they did not know whether they loved or hated it most. Carlyle's two eyes were out of focus, as one may say, when he looked at democracy: he had one eye on Valmy and the other on Sedan. In the same way, Ruskin had a strong right hand that wrote of the great mediæval minsters in tall harmonies and traceries as splendid as their own; and also, so to speak, a weak and feverish left hand that was always fidgeting and trying to take the pen away--and write an evangelical tract about the immorality of foreigners. Many of their contemporaries were the same. The sea of Tennyson's mind was troubled under its serene surface. The incessant excitement of Kingsley, though romantic and attractive in many ways, was a great deal more like Nervous Christianity than Muscular Christianity. It would be quite unfair to say of Ruskin that there was any major inconsistency between his mediæval tastes and his very unmediæval temper: and minor inconsistencies do not matter in anybody. But it is not quite unfair to say of him that he seemed to want all parts of the Cathedral except the altar.|$|R

40|$|The {{experience}} of pain {{is something that}} most people are extremely familiar with. However, once we begin to examine the subject from an ethical point of view, and particularly when we examine so-called marginal cases such as nonhuman animals, we are quickly confronted with difficult questions. This thesis, through an examination of a particular feature of moral language and a description of recent research on pain, provides an analysis of how pain fits into ethical theory. It is argued that universalizability is an important feature of ethical systems and provides a basis for claiming that an agent is acting inconsistently if he or she evaluates similar situations differently. Though the additional features prescriptivity and overridingness provide an important connection between moral judgment and action in Hare??????s two-level utilitarianism, it is argued that they ultimately lead to claims incompatible with lived moral experience. Arguments by Parfit and Sidgwick are discussed which tie acting morally to acting consistently, and it is concluded that selfinterest theory is not <b>a</b> <b>tenable</b> <b>position.</b> After the features of moral judgment are discussed, the necessary features of a moral subject are examined. It is concluded that sentience, or the ability to feel pleasure or pain, is a sufficient condition for being a moral subject. Arguments are examined that attempt to show which animals likely consciously experience pain. Difficulties for these arguments are discussed and an original argument is presented that at least partially addresses these difficulties. It is concluded that from an ethical perspective our current practices such as factory farming are probably not justified. It appears especially likely that our treatment of other mammals is unethical, but the answers are not as clear with other animals. However, all of the conclusions are tentative, as no doubt future scientific investigation will shed more light on our knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Most {{philosophers}} {{agree that}} {{some form of}} physicalism is the solution to the mind-body problem. It is also generally accepted that accommodating the existence of qualia—i. e., the properties of phenomenally conscious mental states in virtue of which there is something it is like to occupy those states—is the biggest stumbling block in the way of physicalist theories of mind. Thomas Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s central argument in “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” captures and codifies the basic intuition that qualia are a problem for physicalism, and consequently it has received much critical attention from physicalists. I show that Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s argument cannot be dismissed as easily as many physicalists contend and that the cost of defeating it is, in the end, too high for the physicalist to pay. More specifically, I show that the physicalist can answer Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s challenge only by retreating to non-reductionism, and I argue that the two mainstream forms of non-reductive physicalism are unacceptable. ^ Some maintain that the physicalist need not take Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s argument seriously because qualia do not exist. So, after giving a characterization of qualia and explaining the relationship between qualia and consciousness, I respond to a variety of eliminativist strategies. I argue that qualia do exist and that the physicalist must account for them. Then, after explicating and clarifying Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s central argument, I defend it against all the significant objections that have been raised against it that do not require abandoning reductionism. Given the failure of these objections, I maintain that the physicalist 2 ̆ 7 s only recourse is non-reductionism. After briefly characterizing non-reductive physicalism, I argue that neither of its mainstream forms—viz., realization physicalism and supervenience physicalism—is <b>a</b> <b>tenable</b> <b>position.</b> I show that realization physicalism succumbs to Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s argument just as reductive physicalism does. Then, I exploit the shortcomings of a variety of specific supervenience theses to show that the relation of supervenience is incapable of grounding an acceptable form of non-reductive physicalism. I conclude that the physicalist faces a dilemma: the qualia problem—in the form of Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s argument—defeats reductive physicalism, and non-reductive forms of physicalism are not viable alternatives. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} {{the question of}} whether or not dispositional properties are able to necessitate their manifestations. I provide three main discussions that reflect three aspects of my question. The first and second discussions concern different aspects of the 'problem of prevention'. This is the premise that causal interactions can be subject to interference/prevention, generally construed. A number of philosophers have argued that the problem of prevention undercuts the necessitation of lawful regularities in the context of dispositional essentialism. We can term this issue the 'necessitation issue'. In the first discussion I examine whether or not antidotes qua preventative entities are metaphysically possible within the context of Alexander Bird's (2007) dispositional monism. I argue that Bird's theory raises a problem of ontological representation re antidotes. The line of thought in this discussion is that it is difficult for Bird to say what antidotes are and how they operate; nevertheless, in this discussion I provide a solution to my problem that stays within the confines of Bird's dispositional monism. In this section of the thesis I remain neutral on the necessitation issue, but I take myself to clarify {{the question of whether}} or not dispositional properties are able to necessitate their manifestations by criticising Bird's model of antidotes/prevention and setting out a replacement. In the second discussion I examine Stephen Mumford and Rani Lill Anjum's (2011) anti-necessitarian strategies. Mumford and Anjum's 'causal dispositionalism' encompasses a theory of dispositional properties, antidotes, and prevention. Mumford and Anjum's causal dispositionalism is not subject to the problem of ontological representation that Bird's theory raises; nevertheless, I argue that their theory is multiply problematic. The purpose of this discussion, taken as a whole, is to show that a recent strategy for attacking the necessitarian claim of dispositional essentialism is weaker than it has appeared to a number of philosophers. In this section of the thesis I move from a neutral stance on necessitation to a defensive stance. In the first two stages of the thesis, which concern the problem of prevention, I work with the background assumption that dispositional essentialism is <b>a</b> <b>tenable</b> <b>position.</b> In the third section of this thesis, however, I begin by endorsing Stephen Barker's (2013) essay The Emperor's New Metaphysics of Powers, which argues that the main articulations of dispositional essentialism are either internally inconsistent or otherwise disguised versions of brute modalism, where brute modalism focuses upon possible worlds as oppose to properties. In response, I develop a replacement position for dispositional essentialism that I term 'temporal essentialism'. I advance temporal essentialism as a prototype position in the properties and laws debate. It aims to provide a metaphysical explanation for lawful regularities by drawing upon the passage of time. In short, temporal essentialism is the position that it is built into a system of ontology that it dynamically adds new entities to its ontological categories and constructs states of affairs in a rule-following way. ...|$|E

Hasan wrote: [...] "the entire 45-minute speech is primarily an attack on Muslim extremists who try and justify violence against non-Muslims on an 'ends justify the means' basis", but noted of his 2009 comments that his [...] "phraseology was ill-judged, ill-advised and, even, inappropriate".|$|R

The Treaty of San Lorenzo (Pinckney's Treaty), signed in 1795, established latitude 31 N as the boundary between Spanish West Florida and Mississippi Territory. U.S. General James Wilkinson selected Loftus Heights for a military post in 1798 on the advice of Captain Isaac Guion. The site, on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River about six miles upriver from the new international boundary, was judged to be a good position for observing and thwarting military movements on the river and was described by Wilkinson as the [...] "most southerly <b>tenable</b> <b>position</b> within our limits." [...] The new fort was named for the sitting U.S. President, John Adams.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLife {{safety is}} one of the {{objectives}} of fire engineering design for road tunnels. Fire engineering design requires maintaining <b>a</b> <b>tenable</b> condition for <b>a</b> period of time to allow occupants to evacuate to safety. This will be achieved by controlling the smoke under credible design fire scenarios in a tunnel. The critical location in a tunnel fire emergency condition is the tunnel region upstream of the fire, where occupants are most likely to reside as traffic jam can usually be created by the fire incident. Tenability for the downstream region of fire is not the main focus of this research because vehicles can generally drive out of the tunnel at a higher speed than that of the smoke flow, and local damper smoke extraction can help keep <b>a</b> <b>tenable</b> condition in the downstream region beyond the local fire zone, in case there is a congestion in the downstream region of the fire. To maintain <b>a</b> <b>tenable</b> condition in the upstream tunnel region from the fire incident, the required minimum longitudinal flow velocity to prevent smoke backlayering can be calculated based on NFPA 502 recommendations. This critical velocity takes no credit of the smoke extraction or active overhead fixed fire suppression effects. Smoke extraction with a dedicated smoke duct along {{the entire length of the}} tunnel is gaining popularity because of its efficiency and robustness in providing <b>a</b> <b>tenable</b> environment in the tunnel with unknown upstream and downstream traffic conditions. In this paper, a modified critical velocity to control smoke back-layering while smoke extraction and fire suppression systems are operating has been analyzed. This modified critical velocity is approximately 20 % lower than the critical velocity that is recommended in NFPA 502. This allows significant savings on ventilation capacity for road tunnels which have a local smoke exhaust capability using a dedicated smoke duct. It is concluded that the smoke extraction performance is similar whether using ceiling dampers or vertical wall-mounted dampers for smoke capture to maintain tunnel tenability. However, tunnel gradients play a major role on the modified critical velocity for a nominated design fire and the required smoke extraction rate...|$|R
