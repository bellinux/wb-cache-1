5000|$|Quality arms employ an <b>adjustable</b> <b>counterweight</b> {{to offset}} {{the mass of the}} arm and various {{cartridges}} and headshells. On this counterweight, a calibrated dial enables easy adjustment of stylus force. After perfectly balancing the arm, the dial itself is [...] "zeroed"; the stylus force can then be dialed in by screwing the counterweight towards the fulcrum. (Sometimes a separate spring or smaller weight provides fine tuning.) Stylus forces of 10 to 20 mN (1 to 2 grams-force) are typical for modern consumer turntables, while forces of up to 50 mN (5 grams) are common for the tougher environmental demands of party deejaying or turntablism. Of special adjustment consideration, Stanton cartridges of the 681EE(E) series others like them feature a small record brush ahead of the cartridge. The upforce of this brush, and its added drag require compensation of both tracking force (add 1 gram) and anti-skating adjustment values (see next paragraph for description).|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the microscopic hardness testing of workpieces comprising a device for applying a test load {{on a test}} unit, a microscope located underneath the test unit, position encoders and force sensors and an evaluation device, whereby the device for applying load to a balance arm of a balance beam is held and at the other arm, the test load can be balanced by <b>adjustable</b> <b>counterweights</b> and is continuously adjustable...|$|R
50|$|Due to the offset {{between the}} cartridge's axis (which is {{approximately}} tangential to the disc) and the tonearm's pivot, the force applied (through friction) by the rotating disc to the cartridge tends {{to draw the}} tonearm {{toward the center of}} the record and distort the balance of the sound and of the wear suffered by the stylus and the vinyl groove. To prevent this, an appropriately-sized opposing force (a rotational torque) is applied at the tonearm. This is accomplished in various ways by dedicated mechanisms, depending on the tonearm's manufacturer, and ranging from a small <b>counterweight</b> <b>adjustable</b> by a knob, to adjustable spring or magnetic mechanisms, usually calibrated in grams of force.|$|R
