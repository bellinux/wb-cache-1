In 2010 he was inducted into the Ciudad Juárez Lucha Libre Hall of Fame along with the other two Espantos. The team of Espanto I and Espanto II are considered among the best rudo (those that portray the bad guys) teams in the history of lucha libre.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, the Italian flag <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> flag have been compared over time. However, the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter shades of green and red and the two have different aspect ratios; the Italian flag's aspect ratio is 2:3, while the Mexican flag's aspect ratio of 4:7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape. When Italy became a republic in 1946, the Mexican naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E

Known for their brutal tactics, Los Escorpiones is composed of at least 60 former state, judicial, and municipal police officers.

Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988.

Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, San Bruno and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce {{on his second}} voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R.

In addition, the Civil Protection Agency in Baja California, the Baja bush Pilots, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Red Cross asked for donations of such as utensils, flashlights, lanterns, batteries, clothing, and light bedding.
