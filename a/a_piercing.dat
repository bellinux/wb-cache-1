She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (<b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> near the upper lip that resembles a beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (<b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> {{on each side of the}} lower lip).|$|E
5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This {{was based on the}} principle of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} time it {{typically}} takes <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> to heal varies widely according to the placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral hood and Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> jestrum <b>piercing,</b> {{also known}} as a {{vertical}} medusa, is <b>an</b> upper lip <b>piercing</b> that is very similar to <b>a</b> labret <b>piercing,</b> or more specifically <b>a</b> vertical labret <b>piercing.</b> It is placed in the philtrum of the upper lip, directly under the nasal septum. Unlike the similar medusa <b>piercing,</b> <b>a</b> jestrum <b>piercing</b> uses <b>a</b> curved bar-bell, and both ends of the piercing are visible externally with {{the lower part of the}} bar-bell curving around the underside of the upper lip. Sometimes it is combined with <b>a</b> lower labret <b>piercing</b> to form <b>a</b> symmetrical look.|$|R

5|$|The {{piercing}} gun: The {{vast majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears pierced with <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> gun. The safety of piercing guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for piercing body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that piercing guns not be used for any piercing, requiring members to agree not to use piercing guns in their practice.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in <b>a</b> <b>piercing,</b> as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E

25|$|An earring is a {{piece of}} {{jewellery}} attached to the ear via <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> in the earlobe or another external part of the ear (except in the case of clip earrings, which clip onto the lobe).

25|$|Barbell {{earrings}} {{get their}} name from their resemblance to a barbell, generally {{coming in the}} form of a metal bar with an orb on either end. One of these orbs is affixed in place, while the other can be detached to allow the barbell to be inserted into <b>a</b> <b>piercing.</b> Several variations on this basic design exist, including barbells with curves or angles in the bar of the earring.|$|E
25|$|Dowels and rivets are {{physical}} ways {{in which}} ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. Dowels are cylindrical rods that consist of wood, metal, or plastic. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive {{that is used to}} repair the ceramic piece. Removing dowels can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators will cut through dowels with <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> saw and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another.|$|E

25|$|With the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce {{providing}} security, the British space programme under Professor Ralph Cornish {{oversees the}} launch of the Recovery Seven probe. This has been sent into Earth orbit to make contact with the missing Mars Probe Seven and its two astronauts, who lost contact with Earth eight months earlier. The pilot of Recovery Seven, Van Lyden, makes contact with the Mars probe but is then silenced by <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> unearthly sound. The noise troubles the Doctor who travels with his assistant Liz Shaw to the Space Centre to investigate the situation, offering insights into the origin and meaning of the sounds, which he interprets as coded messages. He also identifies a reply sent from Earth, which is triangulated as coming from a warehouse seven miles away. Led by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, UNIT troops attack the warehouse and engage in a gun battle with troops commanded by General Charles Carrington.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with <b>a</b> <b>piercing</b> sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> navel <b>piercing</b> (also {{referred}} to as <b>a</b> belly button <b>piercing</b> or <b>an</b> umbilical dip <b>piercing)</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>piercing</b> located in, or around, the navel. It may heal quickly and with no problems, like <b>an</b> ear <b>piercing,</b> or may heal more like <b>a</b> surface <b>piercing</b> with the associated extended healing time. Healing usually takes less than six months, {{and as long as}} it is cleaned, it will heal nicely. Unlike most surface piercings, this is one of the few that do not normally reject, although the rejection rate is higher than non-surface piercings, such as ear piercing. The actual navel is not <b>pierced</b> when <b>a</b> navel <b>piercing</b> is performed. The most common form of navel piercing is through the upper rim of the navel.|$|R
