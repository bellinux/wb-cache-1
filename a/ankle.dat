5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in his <b>ankle.</b> An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing bone in his <b>ankle.</b> Kemp was told that if he kept playing his <b>ankle</b> could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E

40|$|Viscoelastic {{stiffness}} in the <b>ankles</b> of nine female {{subjects with}} fibromyalgia and nine control subjects was quantified by assessing passive sinusoidal movement. Increased elastic muscle stiffness in the <b>ankles</b> {{as well as}} different viscous muscle stiffness in the two <b>ankles</b> was observed in the subjects with fibromyalgia. In conclusion, measuring the resistance to the passive sinusoidal movement of the <b>ankles</b> could offer a valuable method of quantifying the subjective feeling of stiffness described by people with fibromyalgia...|$|R
30|$|The {{preoperative}} Malhotra classification was: Malhotra grade 0 {{for five}} <b>ankles,</b> Malhotra grade 1 for 16 <b>ankles</b> and Malhotra grade 2 for nine <b>ankles.</b> Comparison {{of the first}} radiographs with measurements with the radiographs made {{at the time of}} plate removal or closure of the distal tibial physis revealed that no significant change in Malhotra classification had occurred.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify his <b>ankle</b> problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not being fully fit. Celtic had a fairly good start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that they dropped into the Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to heal the <b>ankle</b> injury. This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up his <b>ankle</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|His {{appearance}} in the final was remarkable {{for the fact that}} he was the top scorer of the day with five points, despite having suffered an <b>ankle</b> injury in the previous match, and was not expected (or advised) to play. He started the final and was taken off before half time. During the break, and even some way into the second half, he was receiving treatment to his <b>ankle,</b> including pain-killing injections.|$|E
30|$|The final patient {{population}} for analysis consisted of 18 patients with 30 involved <b>ankles</b> who {{were considered to}} have completed treatment because either the implant had been removed (12 <b>ankles)</b> during follow-up or the distal tibial physis had closed {{as a result of}} skeletal maturity during follow-up (18 <b>ankles).</b> Treatment was not complete in the remaining nine patients, and these patients were therefore excluded from this analysis.|$|R

All patients had preoperative peroneal tenderness; 9 of 12 <b>ankles</b> had active peroneal tendon subluxation on examina-tion. All patients had failed results from nonoperative treatments of rehabilitation and bracing. Before the fibular grooving procedure, 10 <b>ankles</b> were shown to have intraarticular pathologic changes on arthroscopic evaluation. Postoperatively, there were no resubluxa-tions.

5|$|Ahead of the club's 2009–10 campaign, May scored five second-half {{goals in}} Scunthorpe's 12–0 {{pre-season}} victory against Brigg Town. He also scored in friendlies against Jersey and Lincoln City.

Having returned to training in October 2009, May suffered another setback after injuring his other <b>ankle</b> – ruling him out of first-team action for six weeks. He made his first appearance of the 2009–10 season as a late substitute in a 3–1 home defeat against West Bromwich Albion on 28 December 2009.
