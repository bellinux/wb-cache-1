5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote. <b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. <b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has <b>another</b> <b>strategy</b> to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E
40|$|Many {{claims about}} {{political}} behavior {{are based on}} implicit assumptions about how people think. One such assumption, that political actors use identical conjectures when assessing others’ strategies, is nested within applications of widely-used game theoretic equilibrium concepts. When empirical research calls this assumption into question, the self-confirming equilibrium (SCE) concept is an alternate criterion for deriving theoretical claims. Using a series of examples, we examine opportunities and challenges inherent in applying the SCE concept. Our main example focuses on Feddersen and Pesendorfer’s (1998) claim that unanimity rules can lead juries to convict innocent defendants. Using SCE, we show that the claim depends {{on the assumption that}} jurors have identical beliefs about one <b>another’s</b> <b>strategies.</b> When juror beliefs vary in ways that follow from empirical jury research, we show that fewer false convictions can occur in equilibrium. Generally, the SCE confers advantages when actors have different conjectures about one <b>another’s</b> <b>strategies.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> {{that has}} been {{explored}} is the stabilization of reactions that develop partial negative charges in the transition state. Examples of successful applications are most commonly reactions that are approximated concerted and pericyclic in nature.

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> is {{to remove}} {{dendritic}} cells from the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The dendritic cells are activated {{in the presence of}} tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor cell lysate (a solution of broken down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> {{is to use}} {{anaerobic}} {{bacteria that}} have been transformed with an enzyme that can convert a non-toxic prodrug into a toxic drug. With the proliferation of the bacteria in the necrotic and hypoxic areas of the tumor, the enzyme is expressed solely in the tumor. Thus, a systemically applied prodrug is metabolised to the toxic drug only in the tumor. This has been demonstrated to be effective with the nonpathogenic anaerobe Clostridium sporogenes.|$|E
25|$|Vocabulary: A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} reading comprehension is vocabulary development. When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word {{in print and}} decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word {{if it is in}} the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive {{the meaning of the word}} using <b>another</b> <b>strategy,</b> such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.|$|E

25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. <b>Another</b> <b>strategy,</b> passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E
25|$|In areas {{prone to}} urban flooding, one {{solution}} is the repair {{and expansion of}} man-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure. <b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets, parking lots and buildings through natural drainage channels, porous paving, and wetlands (collectively known as green infrastructure or sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)). Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by floodwalls and levees, or designed to withstand temporary inundation. Property owners can also invest in solutions themselves, such as re-landscaping their property to take {{the flow of water}} away from their building and installing rain barrels, sump pumps, and check valves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> Blackwell devised {{was aimed}} at {{constitutional}} conventions. In 1889 when the territories of North Dakota, Montana, and Washington began drafting state constitutions for entry into the Union, the AWSA mobilized to press for inclusion of woman suffrage. But Blackwell realized the chances for success were slim and devised a backup plan – persuading pro-suffrage delegates, if and when it became apparent a suffrage provision would fail, {{to push for a}} clause that would enable a future state legislature to extend suffrage to women by statute. Blackwell obtained endorsements for the strategy from leading politicians and judges in other states, traveled to the constitutional conventions, lobbied their leaders, got his resolution introduced, and was given a hearing at each one. Though the effort failed, North Dakota and Montana came very close to adopting it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Another</b> common <b>strategy</b> is {{to guess}} vowels first, as English only has five vowels (a, e, i, o, and u, while y may sometimes, but rarely, {{be used as}} a vowel) and almost every word has at least one.|$|R
25|$|Due to the aim {{to design}} photoswitchable {{materials}} that have higher working temperatures than those reported to date (~80 K), along with long-lifetime photoexcited states, <b>another</b> <b>strategy</b> for SCO called Ligand-Driven Light Induced Spin Change (LD-LISC) has been studied. This method consists {{of using a}} ligand that is photosensitive in order to trigger the spin interconversion of the metal ion and exciting this ligand with light. The LD-LISC effect {{is followed by a}} structural change of the photoresponsive ligands in contrast to the SCO process where the structures of the ligands are essentially unaffected. The driving force behind the metal ion SCO in this photochemical transformation is cis-trans photoisomerization. The prerequisite for LD-LISC to be observed is that the two complexes formed with the ligand photoisomers, must exhibit different magnetic behaviors as a function of temperature. Upon successive irradiations of the system at two different wavelengths within a temperature range where the metal ion can either be LS or HS, a spin-state interconversion should occur. In order to achieve this, it is convenient to design a metal environment to where {{at least one of the}} complexes exhibits a thermally induced SCO. The LD-LISC has been observed in several iron(II) and iron(III) complexes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} strategies for a team is their forecheck. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking {{is an important part of}} the dump and chase strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: 2–1–2, 1–2–2, and 1–4. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1–2–2 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. <b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> is the left wing lock, which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.|$|E
25|$|While repressive {{measures}} were relaxed {{starting in the}} mid-1970s, gaining new converts proved difficult. One method involved members traveling in pairs by train, starting a conversation on religious topics and beginning to proselytize after gaining the interest of others in their compartment. <b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> was to start religious discussions in cemeteries or in crowded areas like rail and bus stations. The Watchtower was sent into Romania in English, translated by Witnesses into Romanian, the manuscript sent into Austria and copies then brought back into Romania, distributed to members and used in conversion efforts. According to British political scientist Tom Gallagher, by the 1980s, one source of converts to the Witnesses, {{as well as to}} Protestant denominations, was the new working class housed in urban high-rise settlements, as the Orthodox hierarchy was reluctant {{to take care of this}} group's religious needs. In an interview with the World Council of Churches' official magazine, Metropolitan Antonie Plămădeală of the dominant Romanian Orthodox Church said that gaining official recognition would have been very difficult for Jehovah's Witnesses in Romania because of their attitude toward the Communist state and to military service, but it would not have been impossible if the state had better understood their views and been less paranoid. He claimed that if they kept a low profile and were not active against the state, the authorities would be unconcerned about them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{real-time}} <b>strategy</b> game {{known as}} StarCraft was released {{two years after}} Star Command: Revolution, and quickly overshadowed it.

50|$|Rabbit {{syndrome}} can {{be treated}} with anticholinergic drugs.

25|$|In {{situations}} where multiple referees disagree substantially {{about the quality}} of a work, {{there are a number of}} strategies for reaching a decision. When a publisher receives very positive and very negative reviews for the same manuscript, the publisher will often solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. As <b>another</b> <b>strategy</b> in the case of ties, the publisher may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. If a publisher does not feel confident to weigh the persuasiveness of a rebuttal, the publisher may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. A publisher may convey communications back and forth between authors and a referee, in effect allowing them to debate a point. Even in these cases, however, publishers do not allow multiple referees to confer with each other, though each reviewer may often see earlier comments submitted by other reviewers. The goal of the process is explicitly not to reach consensus or to persuade anyone to change their opinions, but instead to provide material for an informed editorial decision. Some medical journals, usually following the open access model, have begun posting on the Internet the pre-publication history of each individual article, from the original submission to reviewers' reports, authors' comments, and revised manuscripts.|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> is {{to create}} new {{reserves}} inland. To compensate for the inevitable loss of the important reedbeds at Cley, the Environment Agency and the Norfolk Wildlife Trust have been working since 2010 {{to make a new}} wetland near Hilgay. The [...] Hilgay Wetland Creation Project is converting former farmland into a variety of wetland habitats by using banks, ditches and a lake to manage water levels. The Trust sees this as the first stage of a long-term plan to create a roughly [...] Wissey Living Landscape.|$|E
500|$|Pellets also spawn {{from other}} snake avatars. By either {{pressing}} the space bar or {{clicking on the}} mouse or trackpad, the player can activate [...] "boost mode", which causes the avatar to speed up. When a player uses [...] "boost mode", the snake loses some mass, causing the snake's size to shrink slightly, with the mass that is lost from the boost appearing as a line of dots where the boost was used. This feature is useful to outmaneuver and defeat opponents. <b>Another</b> <b>strategy</b> that players use to defeat opponents is coiling around them in a loop until the opponent, trapped in the loop, crashes into the player.|$|E
