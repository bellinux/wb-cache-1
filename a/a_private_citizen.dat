5|$|Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) {{is a case}} {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen</b> has the right to record video and audio of public {{officials}} in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen,</b> filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|With Tiberius's departure, {{succession}} rested {{solely on}} Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in AD2 {{with the death}} of Lucius. Augustus, with perhaps some pressure from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen</b> and nothing more. In AD4, Gaius was killed in Armenia, and Augustus had no other choice but to turn to Tiberius.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen</b> paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1815, {{four days}} after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette {{arranged}} for the former emperor's passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended his days {{on the island of}} Saint Helena. The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that was ignored by the victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over La Grange as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen</b> again.|$|E
5|$|Pausanias {{returned}} to Byzantium as <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen</b> in 477 BC, and took {{command of the}} city until he was expelled by the Athenians. He then crossed the Bosporus and settled in Kolonai in the Troad, until he was again accused of collaborating with the Persians and was recalled by the Spartans for a trial after which he starved himself to death. The timescale is unclear, but Pausanias may have remained in possession of Byzantium until 470 BC.|$|E

5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen.</b> He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E
5|$|The coup d'état {{established}} the Republic of Hawaii, but {{the ultimate goal}} was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was temporarily blocked by President Grover Cleveland. After an unsuccessful uprising to restore the monarchy, the oligarchical government placed the former queen under house arrest at the ʻIolani Palace. Attempts were made to restore the monarchy and oppose annexation, but with {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish–American War, the United States annexed the Republic of Hawaii via the Newlands Resolution.

5|$|To deter smuggling, Madison {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} make Norfolk the state's only legal port of entry. Five other ports, including Alexandria, were eventually added, but the Port Act proved unpopular despite the support of Washington. Mason, an opponent of the act, accepted election to the House of Delegates in 1786, and many believed that his influence would prove decisive for the repeal effort. Due to illness, Mason {{did not come to}} Richmond during the initial session, though he sent a petition, as <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen,</b> to the legislature. The Port Act survived, though additional harbors were added as legal entry points.|$|E

5|$|Usage of {{the flag}} is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws {{relating}} to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use {{of the flag}} by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen,</b> Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use {{in conjunction with other}} national and non-national flags.|$|E
5|$|Years later colonial trader Ludovick Grant, {{who lived}} in Great Tellico and briefly {{accompanied}} Cuming during his tour, described the latter's techniques. In each town, Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders. He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house, in defiance of custom. There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen</b> wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he would take them. He asked them to join his party in a toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
5|$|Davis, an {{advocate}} of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker's unauthorized expedition into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts. Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15million to $10million. Congress also included a protection clause for <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen,</b> Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse {{the final version of the}} treaty, which was ratified nonetheless. The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, the devoutly Catholic Diệm was {{appointed}} Interior Minister of Vietnam, serving under Emperor Bảo Đại. However, {{a few months}} thereafter he resigned and became <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen</b> because the French colonialists would not give Vietnam any meaningful autonomy. During World War II, Imperial Japan attacked Indochina and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum was created. The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh fought for Vietnamese independence, while the French attempted {{to regain control of}} their colony by creating the French Union-allied State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950. He spent the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among Vatican officials and fellow Catholic politicians in America. The success of the effort was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking Vatican officials in Rome a few decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|In May 1796, Kentucky's gubernatorial electors convened {{to choose}} Shelby's successor. Their votes were split among four candidates; frontiersman Benjamin Logan {{received}} 21 votes, Baptist minister James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and Breckinridge's cousin, Senator John Brown, received 1. The Kentucky Constitution {{did not specify}} whether a plurality or a majority was required for election, but the electors held a runoff vote. Most of Todd's supporters voted for Garrard, and he won the election. Breckinridge claimed he had no authority to intervene but declared that, as <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>citizen,</b> he believed Logan should be governor. The state senate was authorized to settle disputed elections, but they, too, refused to intervene. Breckinridge resigned as attorney general on November 30, 1797; {{the extension of the}} attorney general's duties to include representing the state in federal district court as well as the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and reluctance to serve under Garrard after publicly declaring he had no right to his office {{may have contributed to the}} decision. A month later, he declared his candidacy to fill a vacancy in the Fayette County delegation to the Kentucky House of Representatives. Of the 1,323 votes cast, he garnered 594 (45%), the most of any of the six candidates in the race.|$|E

During World War II, Imperial Japan attacked Indochina and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum emerged. The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and fought for independence, while the French attempted to regain control of their colony, and created the State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại, which was an associated free state within the French Union. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950, leaving Vietnam {{for the first time in}} his life. He did so as the communists had sentenced him to death in absentia, while the French refused to give him protection, claiming that they had no resources. Diệm spent most of the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among fellow Catholic politicians in America and Vatican officials. Diệm's success with the latter group was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking priests in Rome.|$|E
