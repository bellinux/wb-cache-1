He is in love with Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true feelings, that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>like</b> Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E

25|$|The most {{well-known}} of his literary jabs at Boulstred is his “Epigram on the Court Pucell,” which many critics call a “disturbingly ‘personal’ {{attack on a}} woman.” Jonson supposedly wrote this poem {{as a response to}} a criticism Boulstred made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out of his pocket when he was drunk and given to Boulstred, which he had not wanted to happen. Regarding the title of the poem, “pucell” was the early modern term for prostitute, so Jonson seems to be calling Boulstred a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses Boulstred of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and much more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Boulstred, the work was meant to be one of a “generic court pucelle, and by that means, an image of the false world.” Yet another reading is that the poem is a representation of Jonson’s frustration with having to rely on <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>like</b> the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent “inversion of traditional gender codes,” so he used the “trope of prostitution” in this poem to reassert his position of power as a male.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} novel, Chase {{knew that her}} female protagonist had to {{be strong enough to}} equal Dain's {{forceful}} personality. Chase admits that because the novel is set in the period leading up to the Victorian era, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>like</b> Jessica could not have dealt with Dain, writing that [...] "if Jessica were like what we assume to be the typical young lady of her time, she could never handle Dain, and he’d think her too boring to live". Chase instead modeled Jessica after the type of women who lived a few generations previously and who had [...] "a more practical, frank attitude toward sex".|$|E
500|$|Nagle {{credited}} {{herself with}} [...] "dragging the Jockey Club {{into the twentieth}} century". She said: [...] "This {{was a matter of}} principle. I am a feminist. I believe in equal rights for women. Things should be decided by ability, not sex". [...] At odds with Nagle's view, in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that [...] "No doubt there are occupations, such as boxing, which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women", and Lord Denning had gone on to say that [...] "It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>like</b> that of a jockey or speedway-rider"; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972. When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse, Nagle replied: [...] "My dear man, it used to be said women couldn't stand up to three-day-eventing. Now they're beating the men regularly– and the same will happen in racing. Give them time." [...] Her endeavours led to her being described as [...] "the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing" [...] in Stud & Stable Magazine and [...] "Racing's Emily Pankhurst".|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] a {{score of}} 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "Great" [...] episode, and praised the titular character, who he thought was [...] "expertly played" [...] by Atwell, {{as well as her}} dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling [...] "like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)", and was happy that series was attempting to [...] "entertain on its own merits", rather than try [...] "to add some huge important element to [...] giant overarching storyline". Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, but stated that [...] "With only eight episodes, that hopefully will change quickly". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix found that the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying [...] "not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a tough thing to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while it would be foolish to pretend <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>like</b> Peggy wouldn't have had to deal with these kinds of idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} {{which appeared in}} The New York Times, Williams said that the choices {{for many of the}} pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that [...] "hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to." [...] Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because [...] "t {{seemed to me to be}} the kind of thing <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>like</b> this would play on the radio." [...] The New York Times characterized the score as [...] "evocative" [...] and said it was [...] "thoroughly modern" [...] while also being [...] "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks." [...] The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system [...] "I'm home" [...] is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, known as the [...] "Pathetique" [...] Symphony.|$|E

2500|$|One {{interpretation}} posits the Lamia {{may have}} been a seductress, as in Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana, where the philosopher Apollonius reveals to the young bridegroom, Menippus, his hastily married wife is really a lamia, planning to devour him. Some harlots were named [...] "Lamia". The connection between Demetrius Poliorcetes and the courtesan Lamia was notorious. In a 1909 painting by Herbert James Draper, the Lamia who moodily watches the serpent on her forearm appears to represent a hetaera. Although the lower body of Draper's Lamia is human, he alludes to her serpentine history by draping a shed snake skin about her waist. In Renaissance emblems, Lamia has the body of a serpent and the breasts and head of <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>like</b> the image of hypocrisy.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{subsequent}} political developments and events, given Ninoy's {{links with the}} Communist, Marcos charged that Aquino was being supported by communists and agreed to share power with them once elected into power. A political novice, Aquino categorically denied Marcos' charge and even stated {{that she would not}} appoint a single communist to her cabinet. Running on the offensive, the ailing Marcos also accused Aquino of playing [...] "political football" [...] with the United States with respect to the continued United States military presence in the Philippines at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base. Furthermore, the male strongman derided Aquino's womanhood, by saying that she was [...] "just a woman" [...] whose place was in the bedroom. In response to her opponent's sexist remark, and in reference {{to the fact that the}} ailing and feeble Marcos was increasingly seen as being largely a front man for his wife, Imelda, Aquino simply remarked that [...] "may the better woman win in this election". Marcos also attacked Aquino's inexperience and warned the country that it would be a disaster if <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>like</b> her with no previous political experience was to be elected president, to which Aquino cleverly and sarcastically responded, admitting that she had [...] "no experience in cheating, lying to the public, stealing government money, and killing political opponents".|$|E
