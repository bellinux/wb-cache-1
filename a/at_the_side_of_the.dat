5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull, was broad. The bony palate {{was long and}} flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E
5|$|The Daniel S. Schanck Observatory is {{a former}} astronomical {{observatory}} on the Queens Campus of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States. It is located along George Street near the corner with Hamilton Street <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car park to Kirkpatrick Chapel, to the northwest of Old Queens and Geology Hall.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull) are variable, {{their size}} is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight {{to a little}} concave. The zygomatic notches, projections {{at the front of}} the plates, are better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E

5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when he stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E
5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return {{to the office and}} work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Effects of {{drafting}} on the hydrodynamic and metabolic {{responses of}} the drafter behind and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a passive and an active lead swimmer {{were related to the}} influence of a lead swimmer on the flow field of the draftee. Methods: Passive drag of the draft swimmer was compared for the nondrafting condition, in the drafting conditions behind a passive and an active lead swimmer, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a passive and an active lead swimmer. The effect was also evaluated with oxygen uptake measurements. Fluid pressure measurements were made behind and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a passive and an active lead swimmer to examine the flow field. Results: Behind a passive lead swimmer, passive drag was significantly reduced by 20 %, and behind an active lead swimmer, it was reduced by 9 %. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a passive lead swimmer, passive drag was significantly increased by 9 %, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> an active lead swimmer, it increased by 8 %. Oxygen uptake was significantly reduced by 25 % behind a passive lead swimmer, by 11 % behind an active lead swimmer, and only marginally changed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a lead swimmer. The pressure measurements indicated a 33 % decrease in mean flow velocity behind an active lead swimmer but an increase in peak flow velocities due to the kick of the lead swimmer. These increases could explain the lesser decrease in passive drag behind an active versus a passive lead swimmer. Conclusion: The best position for a draft swimmer was found to be directly behind an active lead swimmer at a distance of 0. 50 m between the toes of lead swimmer and the hands of drafter, with significant reductions in both passive drag and oxygen uptake when drafting. © 2009 The American College of Sports Medicine...|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to pull over <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E

At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of this stage changed drastically after the dramatic injury sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before brought attention to safety conditions on this and other courses in the Giro. With the course passing over numerous different surfaces, including tram tracks and cobblestones, the peloton collectively protested racing this course, and as such it was neutralized, with everyone receiving {{the same time as}} the stage winner and no points were awarded for the points classification as had been planned. There were also parked cars <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road in many places, forcing the riders into narrow tunnels to get through them.|$|E
5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E
5|$|The current Boehm {{key system}} {{consists}} of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key {{just above the}} thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb. Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument {{at the same height}} as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E

5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} started several minutes late {{due to the}} damp {{conditions}} from the earlier rain. A red flag briefly came out for the No. 5 Swiss Spirit Lola {{a few minutes after}} the session began due to the car being stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track. Although the track was drying, {{it was not until the}} last half hour that teams were able to improve on their first session times. The No. 2 Audi and No. 8 Peugeot swapped the pole position multiple times before the session ended with the No. 8 Peugeot claiming the top position on the final lap of the session with a time of 3:26.344. In GT1 the No. 008 Larbre Aston Martin took the class lead on the final lap with a 3:50.761. The LMP2 and GT2 classes saw very little improvement; the class leading teams remained the same.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} of the nave is characterised by eight bays with stepped buttresses between them, with aisle windows {{featuring}} reticulated heads. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south aisle of the sanctuary is Chapter House, a small, square building, of two storeys. It dates to the mid 13th century and is made from Chipping Camden and Bath limestone, with some local red sandstone from Radyr. The octagonal roof was the brainchild of Prichard, though it was lowered in pitch by Pace and later worked on by Donald Buttress. The buttresses of the building are made from ashlar. The seven stained glass roundels are of 16th century Flemish origin. In the interior is a pulpit featuring Moses. Also of note is the St David's Chapel, added by George Pace in 1953–56, which is accessed through the Norman north door of the cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch {{and was able to}} continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Each half of {{the pitch}} is then divided again by a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the back line (this replaced long corners).|$|E
5|$|Given the {{abundance}} of fresh fish coming it {{at the port of}} Skagen, seafood forms a staple of cuisine in Skagen. Of particular note is the Skagen Fiske Restaurant, one of the most renowned seafood restaurants in Jutland which was established in 1907 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour. It serves shrimp, herring, grilled fillets of sole with lemon sauce and Norwegian lobster. Ruth's Gourmet in Ruth's Hotel on Hans Ruth Vej is also of note and has been cited {{to be one of the}} top five restaurants in Denmark outside of Copenhagen, serving French cuisine under head chef Michel Michaud. Ruths Hotel was originally built by Emma and Hans Christian Ruth in 1904 as a bath and guest house. It was purchased by J. Philip-Sørensen in 2003. The Restaurant Pakhuset, the restaurant of the Brøndums Hotel, and Jakobs Café are also popular; Jakobs Café is a music venue and bar at night. True foodies are also bound to visit the famous butcher, Slagter Munch, who is known for their sausages and for their ham: Skagen Skinken.|$|E
