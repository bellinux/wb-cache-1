50|$|ARC {{provides}} first aid, {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} (CPR), {{automated external defibrillator}} (AED), water safety and lifeguarding, babysitting, disaster preparedness and home safety training throughout the United States. Training programs are primarily aimed at laypersons, workplaces and aquatic facilities. ARC teaches around 12 million Americans these skills annually, ranging from youth to professional rescuers. ARC co-led the 2005 Guidelines for First Aid, which aims to provide up-to-date and peer-reviewed first aid training materials. Many American Red Cross chapters also have for sale first aid kits, disaster kits, and similar, related equipment. Many chapters of ARC offer pet first aid courses to prepare pet owners and pet professionals for emergency situations. ARC also offers a pet first <b>aid</b> <b>reference</b> guide.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} and other traumatic events often draw a greater charitable response than do ongoing misfortunes, {{even those that}} may cause even more widespread misery, such as famine or malaria. Why is the response disproportionate to need? The notion of reference dependence critical to Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) maintains that self-utility, or benefit to self, is not absolute level of wealth but rather gain or loss relative to a reference point. Four studies show that sympathy (Study 1), dictator offers (Study 2), and judgments of deservingness (Study 3 a) are reference-dependent: people respond greater to victims of loss than to victims of chronic conditions. This tendency goes away when people evaluate victims in comparison (Study 3 b) and when evaluating affect-poor "statistical victims", as compared to affect-rich "identifiable victims" (Study 4). Together, these results shed light on seemingly irrational patterns of humanitarian aid. Affect Sympathy Humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>Reference</b> dependence...|$|E

Seventy three per cent (1517 / 2077) of samples were respiratory specimens and mycobacteria were recovered from 20. 6 % (313 / 1517) of these. M. tuberculosis was identified in 94. 2 % (295 / 313) and NTM in 5. 8 % (18 / 313). The yield of positive AFB smear and of positive culture was 6. 1 % (93 / 1517) and 20. 6 % (313 / 1517), respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of AFB for M. tuberculosis was 98. 4 % in expectorated sputum and 96. 4 % in bronchoalveolar lavage. Forty four percent (130 / 295) of specimens with positive culture for M. tuberculosis and 66. 7 % (12 / 18) for NTM were from patients HIV positive.

40|$|For ultra-wideband (UWB) communications, {{acquisition}} is challenging. The {{reason is}} from the ultra short pulse shape and ultra dense multipath interference. Ultra short pulse indicates the acquisition region is very narrow. Sampling is another challenge for UWB design due {{to the need for}} ultra high speed analog-to digital converter. A sub-optimum and under-sampling scheme using pilot codes as transmitted reference is proposed here for acquisition. The sampling rate for the receiver is at the symbol rate. A new architecture, the <b>reference</b> <b>aided</b> matched filter is studied in this project. The <b>reference</b> <b>aided</b> matched filter method avoids using complex rake receiver to estimate channel parameters and high sampling rate for interpolation. A limited number of matched filters are used as a filter bank to search for the strongest path. Timing offset for acquisition is then estimated and passed to an advanced verification algorithm. For optimum performance of acquisition, the adaptive post detection integration is proposed to solve the problem from dense inter-symbol interference during the acquisition. A low-complex early-late gate tracking loop is one element of the adaptive post detection integration. This tracking scheme assists in improving acquisition accuracy. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Matlab Simulink simulations in term of mean acquisition time, system performance and false alarm. Simulation results show proposed algorithm is very effective in ultra dense multipath channels.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{measured}} the efficacy of a digital hearing aid with compression and noise reduction in a well-controlled clinical field trial in two independent centres. The experiments focused {{on a number of}} aspects of the application of the digital hearing aids. The study combines a field test of 2 x 4 weeks with laboratory experiments. We used objective measurements (speech perception tests in background noise, loudness scaling) and subjective assessments (questionnaires). The measurements were performed before and after the field test. The questionnaires were collected after each field test. The results of the digital hearing aids were compared to the results of similar tests with newly fitted analogue <b>reference</b> <b>aids.</b> The study involved 27 sensorineural hearing-impaired subjects, wearing new hearing aids. They comprised a representative sample of in-the-ear users. We used a crossover design in which the subjects used successively digital hearing <b>aids</b> and analogue <b>reference</b> <b>aids</b> in a randomized order. On average, the subjective data are more positive than the objective data. In the end, 20 out of 27 subjects had an overall preference for the digital hearing aid. The financial implications were not taken into consideration. However, objective data do not support this strong subjective preference. A reason could be that the method of analysis (short sentences in a short-duration background noise) is not suited for the digital hearing aid; the testing procedure does not allow the noise-reduction algorithm to adapt to the background noise. There was a striking difference between the results for the two centres. This difference can, to at least a certain extent, be attributed to the timing of speech relative to the background noise in the objective tests. This illustrates that the test conditions are critical in modern non-linear signal-processing hearing aids with long time constants. New evaluation techniques should be developed for this new generation of active non-linear hearing aid...|$|R
