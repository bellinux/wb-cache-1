5|$|It must {{retain the}} gas {{well enough to}} stay <b>aloft</b> for 30days.|$|E
5|$|Diverging winds <b>aloft</b> {{ahead of}} these troughs cause {{atmospheric}} lift within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts {{the force of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, {{her husband}} died from {{injuries}} sustained when he fell from his balloon in the Hague after suffering a heart attack. After his death, Sophie continued to make ascents, specialising in night flights, often staying <b>aloft</b> all night.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds <b>aloft</b> force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds <b>aloft</b> due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind <b>aloft,</b> and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
5|$|The trowal is the {{projection}} on the Earth's {{surface of a}} tongue of warm air <b>aloft,</b> such as may be formed during the occlusion process of a depression.|$|E
5|$|Weather maps {{primarily}} use {{the station}} model to show surface weather conditions, but the model can also show the weather <b>aloft</b> {{as reported by}} a weather balloon's radiosonde or a pilot's report.|$|E
5|$|A cold-core low, {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone <b>aloft</b> which has an {{associated}} cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height {{in accordance with the}} thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold pool of air <b>aloft</b> or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E
5|$|A ridge soaring pilot uses upward air {{movements}} caused {{when the wind}} blows on {{to the sides of}} hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time <b>aloft,</b> although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Also {{under study}} are the {{low-level}} mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level vorticity which tightens into a tornado, in particular, {{what are the}} processes {{and what is the}} relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone <b>aloft</b> (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{cyclones}} {{are stronger}} <b>aloft</b> {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It also means that an isolated pool of cold air <b>aloft</b> is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Laurent {{appeared}} in <b>Aloft,</b> a 2014 drama film {{written and directed}} by Claudia Llosa, alongside Jennifer Connelly and Cillian Murphy. The film premiered in competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. Laurent voiced Mary Katherine in Blue Sky Studios' Epic, and Disgust in Pixar's Inside Out in the French dubs of the animated films.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, he co-starred in {{the film}} <b>Aloft,</b> with Jennifer Connelly, and Wally Pfister's Transcendence, which also starred Johnny Depp and Rebecca Hall. Murphy also reunited with Enda Walsh for the play Ballyturk in 2014. He starred in Ron Howard's 2015 film, In the Heart of the Sea, which also {{features}} Benjamin Walker and Chris Hemsworth.|$|E
5|$|Park did {{not send}} {{all of his}} forces <b>aloft,</b> and he held a reserve. Three Squadrons at RAF Tangmere were kept and made ready to meet more attacks from the south. Six more were in reserve to meet a {{possible}} follow-up to the coming raid.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens {{flew the}} entire gamut of U.S. {{observation}} aircraft, from O-1 Bird Dogs, and U-17s, to T-28s and, eventually more modern O-2 Skymasters and OV-10 Broncos. Each Raven carried <b>aloft</b> a Laotian observer, who could provide almost immediate clearance for air strikes. On the ground, Laotian Forward Air Guides (FAGs) also called in for air support missions.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean {{government}} {{dictates that}} no person may treat the national flag with disrespect, such as allowing the flag {{to touch the}} ground. The flag must not be displayed below any other flag, emblem or object; dipped in salute to any person or thing; or displayed or carried flat or horizontally, but always <b>aloft</b> and free.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} publicly announced Lenin's {{death the}} following day. On 23 January, mourners from the Communist Party, trade unions, and soviets visited his Gorki home {{to inspect the}} body, which was carried <b>aloft</b> in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks. Transported by train to Moscow, the coffin {{was taken to the}} House of Trade Unions, where the body lay in state.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{tropical}} cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when {{the difference between}} temperatures <b>aloft</b> and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month {{in which all the}} {{tropical cyclone}} basins are active.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air <b>aloft</b> formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation <b>aloft</b> remained intact {{and led to}} a burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Alley, Sing {{undergoes}} a transformation {{brought on by}} the Beast's attack, fully healing himself and making him a kung-fu master himself. He sees to the well-being of the Landlords as the Gang arrives. Sing easily defeats the Gang and faces the Beast alone. The Beast uses his Toad style maneuvers to launch Sing high into the air. While <b>aloft,</b> Sing comes to peace with Buddha, and is able to use the Buddhist Palm method to subdue the Beast. The Beast accepts his defeat and asks Sing to be his master.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} seabirds usually found over {{tropical}} oceans. They are large, black or black-and-white birds, with long wings and deeply forked tails.

5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, {{and would have been}} raised to patrician rank if he had not steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith. Belisarius was also named consul ordinarius for the year 535, {{allowing}} him to celebrate a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his consular curule chair, held <b>aloft</b> by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from his share of the war booty.|$|E
5|$|In the Basque {{province}} of Gipuzkoa in Spain, the Okrabario Dantza is performed in Legazpi—a sword dance {{in which a}} participant dances atop a grid of crossed swords held <b>aloft.</b> In Tolosa, on Midsummer Day, the Bordon-Dantza ("walking stick dance") is performed with the figures of the ezpatadantza; some point its origins to the border fights in the Middle Ages, when the Castilian troops from Gipuzkoa won an important victory over the troops from Navarre at the Battle of Beotibar. Sticks simulate some weapons, and halberdsa combination of a spear and a battle-axeare also used.|$|E
5|$|On May31, 2013, a {{prominent}} mid-to-upper level trough and closed mid-level {{low pressure area}} moved east-northeastward, with a lead upper low pivoting over the Dakotas and Upper Midwest region. A moderately strong polar jet moved east-northeastward over the southern Rocky Mountains to the southern Great Plains. With a broad influence of moderately strong cyclonic flow <b>aloft,</b> the air mass was expected to become unstable {{across much of the}} southern Great Plains, through the Upper Midwest and Mississippi Valley, by the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms {{developed during the}} morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a warm front. The front remained over the same areas during the day, as daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm and unstable air northward, resulting in severe weather development. The presence of strong winds <b>aloft</b> aided in development of multiple clusters and lines of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind, hail and tornadoes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Similar solar-heating-driven jets of gaseous {{carbon dioxide}} are {{believed}} to erupt from the south polar cap of Mars each spring. Although these eruptions {{have not yet been}} directly observed, they leave evidence in the form of dark spots and lighter fans atop the dry ice, representing sand and dust carried <b>aloft</b> by the eruptions, and a spider-like pattern of grooves created below the ice by the out-rushing gas.|$|E
5|$|The Ke {{air superiority}} {{campaign}} began in mid-January with nightly harassment attacks on Henderson Field by 3–10 aircraft, causing little damage. On 20 January, a lone Kawanishi H8K bombed Espiritu Santo. On 25 January, the IJN sent 58 Zero fighters on a daylight raid to Guadalcanal. In response, the CAF sent <b>aloft</b> eight Wildcat and six P-38 fighters, which shot down four Zeros without loss.|$|E
5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities <b>aloft.</b> This feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the RSMC Nadi upgraded Tropical Depression 04F to {{a tropical}} cyclone {{and gave it}} the name Tam, making it the first named storm of the 2005–06 season. Several hours later, the storm passed close to Niuafo'ou with winds of 65km/h (40mph). By 0000UTC on January13, the JTWC classified Tam as Tropical Cyclone 06P. Although the storm was tracking towards an area with stronger winds <b>aloft,</b> it was forecast to intensify. Due to the relatively fast movement of the storm, the increasing winds <b>aloft</b> {{had little effect on}} the storm, allowing it to intensify and attain winds of 85km/h (50mph) around 0600UTC. However, with both wind shear and the forward motion of the storm continuing to increase, convection rapidly became dislocated from the center. Around 0000UTC on January14, Tam entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. With forward movement estimated at 75km/h (45mph) almost due south, the cyclone reached an unusually high latitude as a tropical cyclone. Coinciding with the time when Tam reached 33°S, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the storm persisted for several hours before dissipating early on January15.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is {{not strong enough to}} do this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay <b>aloft</b> with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E
5|$|What keeps this densely {{realised}} confection <b>aloft</b> is {{that very}} quality of reverence to {{the writers of}} the past. The chief character in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and {{to add to the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones <b>aloft.</b>|$|E
