5|$|Various changes, {{mostly in}} morphology, {{took place between}} Proto-Semitic and Proto-Central-Semitic, the {{language}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Semitic languages. The phonemic system was inherited essentially unchanged, but the emphatic consonants may have changed their realization in Central Semitic from ejectives to pharyngealized consonants.|$|E
5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{development of the}} patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from {{a very young age}} to be submissive to their fathers, then to their husbands, and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short, not extending between the first molars. The posterolateral palatal pits (small openings {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars) are poorly developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back margin of the palate, does not usually reach forward between the maxillaries. Its roof either is wholly ossified or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. Unlike in some other oryzomyines, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two foramina (openings) in the skull, are not separated by an alisphenoid strut. The pattern of grooves and foramina in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys. Usually, the mastoid bone contains small openings (fenestrations) in T.talamancae, but not in T.bolivaris. In the mandible (lower jaw), the capsular process (a process <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incisor) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar.|$|E

5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, {{and the location}} of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E

25|$|Buse was accorded {{a benefit}} match by Somerset {{in his final}} {{first-class}} season, 1953, and picked the three-day County Championship game against Lancashire at Bath. The match was a sensation, though not to Buse's gain. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensation was a newly-laid pitch, which took vicious spin {{from the start of}} play.

The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion was that {{people do not have}} a statistically correct concept of random. It concluded that human beings are built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.|$|E

25|$|The close {{connection}} between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn maintained that {{the perception of the}} world depends on how the percipient conceives the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{molecular}} {{studies have}} shown that this subdivision of the Zaprionus subgenus is incorrect. The ornamentation has evolved multiple times and is not a reliable characteristic for classification. The tuberculatus species group is now part of the group lacking ornamentation (inermis), and the closet relatives of species with a large composite spines are closely related to species without such a spine. The vittiger species subgroup is now a species group and a new species group, neglectus, has been erected for one species placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zaprionus subgenus.|$|E
25|$|Devices {{found in}} Sanskrit {{literature}} such as frame stories and animal fables are {{seen by some}} scholars as lying <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conception of the Nights. The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources. Indian folklore is represented in the Nights by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient Sanskrit fables. The influence of the Panchatantra and Baital Pachisi is particularly notable. The Jataka Tales are a collection of 547 Buddhist stories, which {{are for the most}} part moral stories with an ethical purpose. The Tale of the Bull and the Ass and the linked Tale of the Merchant and his Wife are found in the frame stories of both the Jataka and the Nights.|$|E
