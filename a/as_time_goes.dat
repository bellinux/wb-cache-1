5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle {{develop a}} strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E

He {{develops}} a rude and narcissistic personality once he discovers {{he has the ability}} to take over another person's body for five seconds, but the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's superhuman ability by possessing them. Yuu is a first-year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council.

Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao.

25|$|Byzantine coins followed, {{and took}} to the furthest extreme, the {{tendency}} of precious metal coinage to get thinner and wider <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on. Late Byzantine gold coins became thin wafers that could be bent by hand.|$|E
25|$|Choral {{music has}} become an {{important}} part of Philippine music culture. It dates back to the choirs of churches that sing during mass in the old days. In the middle of the 20th century, performing choral groups started to emerge and increasingly become popular <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> by. Aside from churches, universities, schools and local communities have established choirs.|$|E

25|$|After {{the battle}} between the 1942 American naval force and the 21st-century {{multinational}} task force, an unsteady peace starts after they both reach Pearl Harbor. However, murders, rapes, and riots happen as the 21st-century people try to mix with the locals. Kolhammer is flown to California to meet President Franklin D.

25|$|The Caeliar {{offer the}} {{remaining}} humans a merging {{of human and}} Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results {{in the creation of}} the first Borg, the name being created due to the fragmented thought of the first drone as he was assimilated (his last thought was that he would not become some cyborg, with his individuality ceasing before he could finish thinking the final word). The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were–albeit accidentally–involved {{in the creation of the}} Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{also uses}} Alice as Dana’s doppelgänger to compare how their {{decisions}} are {{a reflection of}} their environment. According to Missy Dehn Kubitschek, each woman seems to see a reflection of herself in the other; each is the vision {{of what could be}} (could have been) the possible fate of the other given different circumstances. According to Bedore, Butler’s use of repetition blurs the lines between the past and present relationships. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on, Alice and Rufus’ relationship begins to seem more like a miserable married couple while Dana and Kevin become somewhat distant.|$|E

5000|$|In their beginnings, the pop artists made a {{distinction}} between American Pop Culture and High Culture by changing the intent on items that provided {{a major impact on}} American society. However, <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, many of these same artists whose goals were to subvert well-known icons to fit their art became celebrities themselves. As a result, since many avant-garde artists who supported the High Culture began to be well known in Popular culture, {{the differences between the two}} cultures were becoming less distinguishable <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on.|$|R

25|$|According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and Emerging Diseases at FERA (the lead {{wildlife}} {{scientist for}} Defra and responsible {{for research on}} badgers) the benefit of culling a population is outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers. He is reported as saying that {{a huge number of}} badgers would have to be killed to make a difference and while it is cheap and easy to exterminate animals {{in the early days of}} a cull it gets harder and more expensive <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on.|$|E

25|$|In this example, {{the general}} {{deliverables}} within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> by, {{mainly because of}} dependencies between deliverables. For instance, the actual go for the delivery of the software and the other related deliverables are dependent {{on the outcome of}} the deliverable “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier. The customer organization can {{get a feel for the}} use of the software in the target domain, to guarantee that the software is a “fit” within the organization.|$|E

She achieved success in television during this period, in the series A Fine Romance from 1981 until 1984, and in 1992 with a starring role in the romantic comedy series <b>As</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Goes</b> By.

25|$|These {{important}} scientific {{findings may}} begin to shift the neuron-specific perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. The glia's importance is becoming ever more clear <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on and new research is conducted. For the vast part of the last century, scientists have written off glial cells {{to be nothing more}} than the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place. But now, there is direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.|$|E
