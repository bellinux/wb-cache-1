5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing. Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> children less than 2 months old. More severe {{signs and symptoms}} in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{normally}} <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> diamond, {{but it can}} be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Germanium in diamond can be detected optically via the germanium-vacancy center, which has similar properties to those of the Si-vacancy center.|$|E
5|$|Only {{three classes}} of pigment (ommochromes, bilins and guanine) have been {{identified}} in spiders, although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized.

40|$|Minimal absent {{words have}} been {{computed}} in genomes of organisms from all domains of life. Here, we explore {{different sets of}} minimal <b>absent</b> words <b>in</b> the genomes of 22 organisms (one archaeota, thirteen bacteria and eight eukaryotes). We investigate if the mutational biases that may explain the deficit of the shortest <b>absent</b> words <b>in</b> vertebrates are also pervasive <b>in</b> other <b>absent</b> words, namely <b>in</b> minimal <b>absent</b> words, {{as well as to}} other organisms. We find that the compositional biases observed for the shortest <b>absent</b> words <b>in</b> vertebrates are not uniform throughout different sets of minimal absent words. We further investigate the hypothesis of the inheritance of minimal absent words through common ancestry from the similarity in dinucleotide relative abundances of different sets of minimal absent words, and find that this inheritance may be exclusive to vertebrates...|$|R
5000|$|Lines are {{omitted from}} almost every scene. Some {{of the more}} notable {{omissions}} include, in 1.1, Bedford's references to children crying and England becoming a marsh since Henry V died (ll.48-51). In 1.2, Alençon's praise of the resoluteness of the English army is <b>absent</b> (ll.29-34). <b>In</b> 1.5, Talbot's complaint about the French wanting to ransom him for a prisoner of less worth is <b>absent</b> (ll.8-11). <b>In</b> 1.7, some of Charles' praise of Joan is <b>absent</b> (ll.21-27). <b>In</b> 4.6, some of the dialogue between Talbot and John is <b>absent</b> (ll.6-25). <b>In</b> 4.7, twelve of Joan's sixteen lines are cut; the entire seven line speech where she says John Talbot refused to fight her {{because she is a}} woman (ll.37-43), the first three lines of her five line mockery of Lucy's listing of Talbot's titles (ll.72-75), and the first two lines of her four line speech where she mocks Lucy as he is about to take over Talbot's position (ll.86-88).|$|R
5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> {{a number}} of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and conchiolin (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.|$|E
5|$|The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It {{is scarce}} or <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> {{tropical}} rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, {{it occurs in}} riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted hyena outnumbers other large carnivores, including other hyena species. However, the striped and brown hyena occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.|$|E

5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E

Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> some depictions.|$|E
5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern {{across the back of}} its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> others.|$|E

Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who had access to the foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.|$|E
