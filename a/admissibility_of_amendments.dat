30|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> {{simultaneous}} prediction of actual and average values of the unobserved regressand in finite population under the quadratic loss function. Admissibility is an interesting problem in statistical theory and received much attention. [18, 19] and [20] discussed the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> predictions of y_T. [21, 22] and [23] studied the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> estimations of β. We discuss the admissible predictors of δ in classes of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous linear predictors, respectively. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the simultaneous prediction to be admissible are provided.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{relation}} between exponential dichotomy on time scales and <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for an evolution family on time scales. We establish a sufficient criterion {{for the existence}} of exponential dichotomy on time scales in terms <b>of</b> the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for the evolution family. Conversely, with the help of exponential dichotomy on time scales, we give the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for an input-output equation on time scales.|$|R
40|$|The issue <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> {{evidence}} has been regulated only very scarcely in the EU. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters has been embracing {{the increasing number of}} instruments, covering plethora of aspects, however, the field <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> evidence remains almost untouched. Can the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice be called the Common Evidence Area? From the national perspective, the issue <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> evidence is still subject to divergent solutions in the Member States, concerning the common law and continental law systems, i. e. the right of access to a lawyer.

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{checking}} <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> {{rules in the}} modal logic $S 4 $ are presented in [1], [15]. These methods determine <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> rules in $S 4 $, but they don't determine or give substitutions rejecting inadmissible rules. In this paper, we investigate some relations between one of the above methods, based on the reduced normal form rules, and sets of substitutions which reject them. We also generalize the method in [1], [15] for one rule to <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> a set of rules...|$|R

2500|$|Prior to Daubert, {{relevancy}} {{in combination}} with the Frye test were the dominant standards for determining the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> scientific evidence in Federal courts. Frye is based on a 1923 Federal Court of appeals ruling involving the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> polygraph evidence. [...] Under Frye, the Court-based the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> testimony regarding novel scientific evidence on whether it has [...] "gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs."
