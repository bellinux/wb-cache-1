60|$|Just for {{the moment}} no one took any notice of him--every one was shrieking, every one was quarrelling, and M. le duc, placing <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> stole {{cautiously}} round to his daughter. The next instant they were clinging to one another, these two, who had endured so much together--he the father who had wrought such an unspeakable wrong, and she the child who was so lonely, so forlorn and almost happy in finding some one who belonged to her, some one to whom she could cling.|$|E

5000|$|Fields {{spent the}} last 22 months of his life at the Las Encinas Sanatorium in Pasadena, California. In 1946, on Christmas Day—the holiday he said he despised—he {{suffered}} an alcohol-related gastric hemorrhage and died, {{at the age of}} 66. [...] Carlotta Monti wrote that in his final moments, she used a garden hose to spray water onto the roof over his bedroom to simulate his favorite sound, falling rain. [...] According to a 2004 documentary, he winked and smiled at a nurse, put <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and died. This poignant depiction is uncorroborated and [...] "unlikely", according to biographer James Curtis. [...] Fields' funeral took place on January 2, 1947, in Glendale, California.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the little group who had thought prudence {{the better part}} of valour had reached the door.

But how pig-headed they were, seeing nothing but their own point of view! Well, he could not alter his decision. They would go at the June quarter--not a day before, nor after.|$|R
5000|$|The {{figure of}} Saint John of Nepomuk is often {{encountered}} in Central Europe, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland and Lithuania, rarely Ukraine. He is usually portrayed with {{a halo of}} five stars, commemorating the stars that hovered over the Vltava River {{on the night of}} his murder. Other attributes useful to identify his pictures are: a priestly dress, the palm of martyrs, carrying a cross, an angel indicating silence by a finger over the lips. His tomb, a Baroque monument cast in silver and silver-gilt that was designed by Fischer von Erlach, stands in St Vitus Cathedral, Prague. A statue of Saint John of Nepomuk has often been erected on bridges in many countries, such as on the Ponte Milvio in Rome. There is also a commemorative plaque on a bridge leading out of Obergurgl, Austria depicting Nepomuk holding <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> as if protecting a secret.Nepomuk's was extremely popular as late as the 19th Century people when people traveled from Tyrol, Hungary, and particularly Bohemia to Prague to celebrate his feast day, May 16. [...] Amongst English Bellringers there is a tradition that at the midpoint of Spring, on the feast day of St. John Nepomuk, an apprentice bellringer will [...] "shear" [...] the hair from the head of his ringing master. It has been suggested that this tradition may stem from an influx in the seventeenth century of refugees from Malta, who settled at the Western end of Cheapside, and who brought with them the cult of Saint John of Nepomuk. This practice has now generally fallen out of use, except in the parish of St Vedast Foster Lane in London, at the West end of Cheapside, in the shadow of St. Paul's Cathedral, where it is still upheld. Interesting statue of St. John of Nepomuk is also in the small village Divina in Slovakia.|$|E

After a few days of digging and chiseling their ways through the prison walls with spoons and their bare hands, they broke through the wall of Manotas' prison cell and stabbed him over 150 times and cut his body into 84 pieces.

I was like a man emerging from a thicket, and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy. I went to bury him. My mind was still on this research, and I did not lift <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> save <b>his</b> character.

The hue and cry was after him. Human bloodhounds were even now on his track, and he spoke calmly of walking out again {{in the streets of}} Lyons and of affronting that infamous Laporte, who would find glory in sending him to death. I think he guessed what was passing in my mind, for he put <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lip and pointed {{significantly}} to M. le Vicomte.|$|R

That's the next step your Hostels might take ... Incidentally you see this opens a way to a life of relative freedom for the woman who is married.... I don't know if you have read Mrs. Stetson.

5000|$|The calvary {{stands in}} the parish church's {{cemetery}} and comprises a square pedestal, decorated with four bas-reliefs, from which rises a cross depicting the crucifixion. The cross has two crosspieces and at its base is a statue depicting Mary Magdalene kneeling in prayer {{on one side and}} Francis of Assisi showing his stigmata on the reverse side. On the higher crosspiece and just below the depiction of the crucifixion are two horsed cavaliers, one on each side. One of these is Saint Longinus who raises <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> eye <b>to</b> remind the observer that he was cured by Jesus of blindness. On the reverse of the crucifixion there is a [...] "Ecce Homo". As part of the crucifixion, four angels are depicted collecting the blood from Jesus' wounds into chalices, On the second crosspiece below are some back to back statues ("statues géminées") of the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist these on either side of a pietà ("Notre Dame de Pitié" [...] or [...] "Vierge de Pitié") {{on one side and a}} depiction of the resurrected Jesus ("Christ ressuscité") on the other side, set between depictions of St Peter and Mary Magdalene. The calvary was the work of a sculptor called Fayet who worked for the Henry and Bastien Prigent workshop between 1552 and 1563. Fayet is not attributed with the pedestal and it's bas-reliefs. Originally there were crosses bearing the good and bad robbers but what remains of them are now kept in the nearby church. The letters [...] "I.N.R.I" [...] are inscribed above the depiction of the crucifixion and there is also an inscription on the calvary reading [...] "CESTE:CROIX: FUST FAYTE :EN : LAN: MVc LVII1 [...] The structure is 6 metres high. The Calvary was moved back to its original position to the south of the church after a temporary transfer to the cemetery in 1883.

5000|$|During {{the events}} of Dead Beat, Mortimer has become a true ectomancer {{with the ability to}} {{communicate}} freely with spirits, even though he still cons his customers by only pretending to tell them {{what they want to hear}} about their dead relatives and friends. Strangely enough, Lindquist, who has since been perceived by Harry as a selfish, arrogant and all around despicable human being, actually stands up to Harry when he demands his help and the help of the dead against the necromancer threat. Lindquist responds by saying [...] "The dead are terrified of whatever is moving around out there." [...] and that [...] "They may be dead, but that doesn't mean they can't get hurt. I won't risk that for Council infighting." [...] Harry notes that while Mortimer may never lift <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> help <b>his</b> fellow man, he would stand against a powerful wizard and wizard council to protect the dead. They are the only beings other than himself he seems to really care about. This opinion changes again in Ghost Story when Harry realizes that Morty is actually genuinely caring, and thoughtful when he comforts Murphy. Harry regrets that he had not realized this before.|$|R
5000|$|Their similar looks {{became the}} subject of jokes, the most popular of which is the following: [...] "They were united forever except when they visited the hairdresser’s. The secret is that after agreeing on a desired hairstyle one of them enters the salon and, sitting back in the armchair, gets a hairdresser <b>to</b> cut <b>his</b> hair as he becomes absorbed in reading an {{illustrated}} magazine. After a gorgeous haircut is done, with hair gel and eau de cologne added, he makes a payment, not forgetting a tip, and he leaves the salon. Not ten minutes pass by when, outraged, he comes back to make a big hassle saying that the hairdresser only gave him a slight comb and didn’t lift <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> cut <b>his</b> hair properly. And what did he pay for? Is this how a reliable and trustworthy entrepreneur deals with clients? The owner of the barber’s is terrified and asks him for forgiveness; and tells him to be kind enough to take a seat in the armchair once again so that he can make up for his mistake. That is how the Seidenbeutel brothers had their haircut done for half price with plenty of emotions and lots of fun." [...] Tadeusz Wittlin ...|$|R
500|$|The song {{attracted}} widespread praise {{by music}} critics, {{many of whom}} ranked it among West's best songs. [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal compared elements of the song to the rock band The Strokes, and stated that it contained {{some of the best}} lyrics ever written by West. Dan Vidal of URB largely praised the track, writing that it was an excellent song overall, though wrote that [...] "in my personal opinion, I don’t really think Kid Cudi can sing; and I’m not sure why his generally off-key caterwauling is appealing to people, but here it’s hypnotically on point – matching perfectly with the track’s imposing tone." [...] MTV wrote that the song featured West at his most boastful lyrically, musing that [...] "while his lyrics are razor sharp, the production here is softer, resulting in <b>a</b> melodic <b>finger</b> wag <b>to</b> <b>his</b> naysayers rather than searing jabs." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters praised the performance by West on the song but felt that neither guest appearance ultimately left much of an impression. On the other hand, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman felt that both Cudi and Raekwon fit perfectly on the guitar-driven track.|$|R
