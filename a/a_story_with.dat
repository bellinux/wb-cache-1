5|$|In Belle's Tales of Friendship (1999), a {{spin-off}} of {{the film}} series, Belle owns a bookstore in which she teaches valuable lessons to children by reading and retelling well-known stories and fairy tales, narrating four classic Disney animated shorts: The Three Little Pigs (1933), Peter and the Wolf (1946), The Wise Little Hen (1934) and Morris the Midget Moose (1950). For the first time, Belle appears as both animated and live-action versions of herself, voiced and portrayed by actresses Paige O'Hara and Lyndsey McLeod, respectively. In the television series Sing Me <b>a</b> <b>Story</b> <b>with</b> Belle (1995–1999), Belle, in a role reprised by McLeod, owns her own music and bookshop, where she is visited by children to whom she tells and sings stories.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} The Search for Spock, {{cast member}} Leonard Nimoy {{was asked to}} direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote {{different parts of the}} script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor William Shatner, and Paramount. Principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. Unlike previous Star Trek films, The Voyage Home was shot extensively on location; many real settings and buildings were used as stand-ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco. Special effects firm Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) assisted in post-production and the film's special effects. Few of the humpback whales in the film were real: ILM devised full-size animatronics and small motorized models to stand in for the real creatures.|$|E
5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept for <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other}} to resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} WarioWare series, WarioWare: Smooth Moves is a puzzle game focusing on microgames, which are short games that last for about five seconds. Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii Remote in a specific way, such as holding it vertically, or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose. The player is required to use the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii Remote in certain microgames. Before each microgame begins, the required position for the Wii Remote is shown to the player, to allow them time to position the device. The game is broken up into stages, each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> <b>with</b> the microgames divided among the stages. After the player completes a stage's microgames, they advance to the boss stage, which is a microgame that is longer and {{more complex than the}} others. After the player completes all of the single-player stages, the game unlocks a multiplayer mode, in which only one Wii Remote is used and shared by up to 12 players. While a player plays a microgame in this mode, other players watch, and after the microgame is completed, the player passes the Wii Remote to the next person.|$|E

25|$|Prosthetics are used, in a {{narrative}} sense, to either, provide a plot {{point in the}} characters back-story, a plot point to give to character a disability (or more often in Science fiction, an advantage), or just to distinguish the character in some way. Having a character in <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> a prostheses, can sometimes be {{the whole point of}} the story (e.g. Robocop is a full-body cyborg of police officer Alex Murphy, in essence he is a human/robot police officer, which is the basic premise for the film).|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{decided to}} develop <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> a similar {{character}} at its center, but was unsure what other elements to add. He recalled a creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who {{felt he had}} a good ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first instinct was to create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had a way with words but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.|$|E
25|$|Fox {{approved}} Battle for the Planet of the Apes with a $1.2 million budget, {{the lowest}} of the series. The filmmakers went into the project knowing {{it would be the}} last of the series. J. Lee Thompson returned as director. Series writer Paul Dehn submitted a treatment, but illness forced him to leave the film before completing the script. The producers subsequently hired John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington to write the screenplay. Battle continued Conquests focus on racial conflict and domination. However, likely based in part on the studio's wishes, the Corringtons discarded Dehn's pessimistic treatment in favor of <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> a more hopeful, though ambiguous, resolution.|$|E

25|$|NBC head Brandon Tartikoff (who {{had started}} his career in Chicago) gave an order for a two-hour movie, which had a {{theatrical}} release {{in a handful of}} U.S. theaters to invited guests only. Tartikoff also ordered 22 episodes which allowed Reininger and Adamson to tell <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> developing character arcs, and continuing stories (instead of episodic, self standing shows.). Two episodes were made every three weeks, with shooting taking up more than 12 hours in a day, seven days a week. By the second season, an average episode cost between $1.3 and 1.4 million (roughly the same as Miami Vice) because it was shot on location, set during the 1960s (requiring period-accurate props and costumes), and featured a large cast.|$|E
25|$|The Pakistan cricket team toured England from 29 July to 22 September 2010. The tour {{consisted}} of four Tests, two T20I and five ODI. During the Test series, Pakistan lost {{the first two}} Test by 354 runs and 9 wickets. They came back to win the third Test by 4 wickets. However in fourth Test, the spot-fixing took place. On {{the third day of}} the 4th Test, British newspaper News of the World published <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> allegations that an agent loosely affiliated with some of the Pakistani players (later identified as Mazhar Majeed) had accepted a £150,000 (US$232,665) bribe from undercover reporters for information that two Pakistani bowlers (Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir) would deliberately deliver no balls at specific points during the match. The third player was also caught. It was Pakistan's Test skipper Salman Butt, who was revealed to be the master mind of this case. On 1 November 2011, Asif, Amir and Butt were found guilty for their part in the spot-fixing and were given prison sentences, ranging from six months to 30 months.|$|E
25|$|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, {{the third}} {{film in the}} popular Indiana Jones series, went through a flimsy {{scripting}} process before Boam was hired to write a draft. As early as 1984, George Lucas was playing {{with the concept of}} having the fictional archeologist-adventurer encounter the fabled Holy Grail, the cup said to have been used by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper. Director Steven Spielberg rejected Lucas's script outlines, disliking the Grail idea. Screenwriter Diane Thomas wrote a haunted house story for Indiana Jones, but Spielberg said that after producing Poltergeist, he didn't want to do a similar film. Lucas hired Chris Columbus to write a draft for the film, and he submitted Indiana Jones and the Lost City of Sun Wu Kung, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>with</b> evil spirits, ghosts, and demons. Again, Spielberg rejected the story as not believable enough. Lucas convinced him {{to go back to the}} Holy Grail idea, and Menno Meyjes was hired to develop another screenplay. The new script focused on the Arthurian legend aspect of the Holy Grail. Although the script was not to the liking of Lucas and Spielberg, it had elements that eventually became part of the finished film: the Holy Grail, and the introduction of Indiana Jones' father, Henry Jones, Sr.|$|E
