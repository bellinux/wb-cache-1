40|$|Abstract. A {{simulator}} {{based on}} rigid-plastic {{finite element method}} is developed for simulating the plastic flow of material in forging processes. In the forging process likes backward extrusion, a workpiece normally undergoes large deformation around the tool corners that causes severe distortion of elements in finite element analysis. Since the distorted elements may induce instability of numerical calculation and divergence of nonlinear solution in finite element analysis, a computational technique of using the Euler’s fixed meshing method is proposed to deal with large deformation problem by replacing the conventional way of applying complicated remeshing schemes when using the Lagrange’s elements. With this method, the initial elements are generated to fix into a specified <b>analytical</b> <b>region</b> with particles implanted as markers to form {{the body of a}} workpiece. The particles are allowed to flow between the elements after each deformation step to show the deforming pattern of material. The proposed method is found to be effective in simulating complicated material flow inside die cavity which has many sharp edges, and also the extrusion of relatively slender parts like fins. In this paper, the formulation of rigid-plastic finite element method based on plasticity theory for slightly compressible material is introduced, and the advantages of the proposed method as compared to conventional one are discussed...|$|E

In the analyses, the standard Smagorinsky model is chosen as a SGS model using a second order central differential scheme. As the NWM, a wall function and a boundary layer approximation are implemented. As a result of the benchmark analyses, a good agreement is obtained between the experiments and computations. It is demonstrated that the present LES with NWM is useful to investigate turbulent statistics in a large-scale engineering problem numerically with a comparative low computational cost...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of slums {{in a city}} is an indicator of poverty and its proper delimitation {{is a matter of}} interest for researchers and policy makers. Socio-economic data from surveys and censuses are the primary source of information to identify and quantify slumness within a city or a town. One problem of using survey data for quantifying slumness is that this type of data is usually collected every ten years and is an expensive and time consuming process. Based on the premise that the physical appearance of an urban settlement {{is a reflection of the}} society that created it and on the assumption that people living in urban areas with similar physical housing conditions will have similar social and demographic characteristics (Jain, 2008; Taubenb¨ock et al., 2009 b); this paper uses data from Medellin City, Colombia, to estimate slum index using solely remote sensing data from an orthorectified, pan-sharpened, natural color Quickbird scene. For Medellin city, the percentage of clay roofs cover and the mean swimming pool density at the <b>analytical</b> <b>region</b> level can explain up to 59 % of the variability in the slum index. Structure and texture measures are useful to characterize the differences in the homogeneity of the spatial pattern of the urban layout and they improve the explanatory power of the statistical models when taken into account. When no other information is used, they can explain up to 30 % of the variability of the slum index.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Region {{is one of}} the {{elements}} which has differentiated Regional Economics from other fields of Applied Economics. In spite of this, however, researchers in this field of economic analysis have not paid {{a great deal of attention}} to this concept. All too often, Regions have been identified with the politico-administrative units into which nationstates have divided their territory and for which statistical information is widely available. However, a Region can be defined in many different ways. Frameworks which define regions according to analytical/theoretical criteria provide greater scope for applied studies and permit a more complete interpretation of the results contained therein. 	In this research we have proposed a concept of Region which goes beyond the administrative division of territory. Our regional aggregation has been based on agglomeration economies, one of the fundamental concepts in the fields of Economic Geography and Urban and Regional Economics. In accordance with the work of Polèse et al. (2007), the territory has been classified into analytical regions which take into account the size of the population and the distance from the main urban areas. In doing so, we achieve an aggregation which corresponds with the differences in agglomeration economies across space. However, their robustness in comparison with the administrative units commonly used has - to date - not been evaluated. The objective of the first chapter of this thesis was to prove that the functional regions defined under such economic criteria provide better defined regions - in terms of greater compactness and separation - than the administrative ones commonly used to carry out labour market studies at sub-national level. 	Using micro data from the last available Spanish Census, the functional and administrative regions are evaluated using the Theil index and the Davies-Bouldin Validation index. Applied to employment (by gender, industry and level of qualification and occupation), both indexes show better results for the analytical regions than for any of the ordinary administrative ones (NUTS I, II or III regions). In other words, the analytical classification generates areas where the distribution of employment is more homogeneous within and more heterogeneous between the regions. Agglomeration economies and distance (to the metropolis) seem to be relevant for understanding the patterns of distribution of employment, either by gender, by industry or by level of qualification and occupation. In practice, this provides a clearer way for identifying local labour markets and explaining their differences and similarities. In light of the results from the first chapter, we suggest the use of this alternative classification -subject, of course, to the availability of data - when carrying out Labour Economics studies that include a spatial dimension. 	The following chapters have provided two applications of this analytical division of the territory to Labour Economics issues: the factors affecting the probability of being employed (Chapter 2) and the effects that labour mobility and commuting have on the central regions (Chapter 3). 	In the second chapter, we presented a spatial analysis of employment at local level where, among other factors, the demographic and geographical characteristics can and do affect the outcome. The empirical results support the hypothesis that size - in terms of population - and location - in terms of distance to a metropolis - are explanatory variables for the probability of being employed. In other words, employment depends not only on the personal characteristics of the individuals (level of education, age, sex, etc.) but also on the type of <b>analytical</b> <b>region</b> - as defined in Chapter 1 - where they live. 	Regarding the importance of location, our results show a significant gap in the chances of being employed between "central" and "peripheral" types of regions, i. e., the closer the region is to the metropolis, the higher the concentration of economic activity and therefore employment. Likewise, the types of regions, i. e., the closer the region is to the metropolis, the higher the concentration of economic activity and therefore employment. Likewise, the expected negative relationship between employment and the size of the region where the individual lives is confirmed, and this seems to be stronger for non-skilled individuals than for people with university studies. 	In terms of employability, the largest Spanish metropolitan areas (MA 1) seem to be enjoying the full benefits of agglomeration economies while the smaller metropolitan areas (MA 2) seem to be suffering their negative effects. Likewise, for urban areas that cannot be considered "metropolitan areas" (UA 1 and UA 2), size does not seem to be as important as their central-peripheral location. In rural areas (less than 50, 000 inhabitants), both size and distance seem to be relevant determinants of employability. In other words, regardless of the level of studies, there are fewer chances of being employed in rural areas as opposed to urban areas and in peripheral rural areas as opposed to central rural areas. 	Recognizing the importance of these spatially differentiated results should have a significant impact on current policy discussions, shifting the focus from general solutions to more spatially customized ones where size and location are considered. Just as differences in age, gender or industrial structure are taken into account in the design of employment policies (at national or local level), these results suggest that an additional spatial dimension that somehow includes the size and location of the local area where the person lives should be considered. 	Some important migration policy implications can also be derived when using these alternative functional regions to analyze the direct and indirect effects that the arrival of workers has in the core regions. Spain has experienced over the last two decades an intense arrival of both immigrants and in-migrants to its central regions, and as a consequence (though not exclusively) of these inflows, we can observe internal migrations and/or commuting to some areas that might be more attractive. 	Using the last available Census, the estimations for Spain of an input-output multi-regional model that includes the possibility of commuting show that the arrival of in- and im-migration to the core generates a set of effects induced by the redistribution of population among other regions. The arrival of workers from the periphery to the core provokes reallocations of residence in all cases (displacement effect). However, the intensity of these reallocations increases with size, which shows the existence of some agglomeration diseconomies associated with big cities. When the possibility of commuting is also considered, the arrival of workers from the periphery to the core generates the reallocation of both jobs (economic activity) and residences. The larger cities are the ones pushing out more residents to other areas, while keeping most of the jobs. In other words, they are becoming attractive areas to work in, but not to live in (due to, among other reasons, high housing costs, congestion or other negative externalities). The oppposite is true for the smaller cities, which are attractive for residing in but for working in. The distributional pattern of residences proves to be different to the distributional pattern of jobs. 	These results highlight the idea that the effects of the arrival of population are not only felt by the recipient region/city but may generate comparatively far larger effects on other regions in the form of internal migration and commuting flows, something that policy makers should bear in mind. 	To conclude, surpassing the administrative division of the territory, this classification manages to have explanatory power in spatial Labour Economics topics while including relevant geo-economic characteristics such as location and agglomeration economies. The use of this classification has proved to offer a better understanding of the patterns of distribution of employment (by gender, by industry or by level of qualification and occupation), job opportunities, and of the probabilities of being employed depending on the level of qualification or the degree of attractiveness of a region for working or living purposes. Some other questions spatially related to the performance of regional labour markets remain unanswered. 	Future lines of research include the application of this classification to the study of labour economic issues such as the determinants of unemployment, inter-industrial labour mobility or the existence of overqualification taking into account spatial factors (i. e. the type of <b>analytical</b> <b>region</b> where the potential worker lives) which are usually ignored. Agglomeration economies and distance play an important role in the location of economic activity, and therefore should affect the labour outcomes once the worker has decided to live in certain type of region. Obviously, such a decision does not have to be permanent, and workers can move in order to improve their labour opportunities. Therefore, a further possible question of relevance is the internal migration decisions between and within analytical regions. That is, can certain regularities be observed? Are people moving from peripheral regions to central or metropolitan areas or the other way round? Are internal migrations better explained in terms of size, i. e. in terms as counter-urbanization or urbanization? Are these movements linked to job opportunity decisions? Can we observe any differences according to their level of qualification? Even more, workers can be employed in a certain type of region but live in another, i. e., we could observe migration on a daily basis (commuting). Is one type of <b>analytical</b> <b>region</b> attracting workers or attracting residents? Do people tend to live and work in the same type of region? Could the analytical division be improved in order to specifically include the commuting criteria used in the local labour markets literature? We believe that these questions provide a fascinating and important future research agenda...|$|E

Problems with this concept begin with terminology. “Congestion” {{has been applied to}} both the subjective and objective measures. Therefore, the term “fullness” will be used to describe perceptions of nasal mucosal heaviness or blockage that subjects with allergic rhinitis articulate. “Congestion” will refer to the objective measures used to assess patency. Sensations attributed to the nasal mucosa are highly integrated interpretations summed from multiple subsets of nociceptive and other neurons. Activation of sensor systems is required to depolarize afferent neurons. These sensors and other receptor proteins can be modulated by inflammation as part of the neural plasticity that leads to increased sensitivity to nasal stimuli. This plasticity and hyperalgesia may extend from the afferent neuron to spinal cord dorsal horn synapses, and regulatory and <b>analytical</b> <b>regions</b> of the brainstem and cerebrum. Although glandular hypersecretion can deliver obstructing material into the nasal cavities, the dilation of deep venous sinusoids is the strongest factor regulating nasal airspace volumes.

Owing to the odd mode suppression, only two even grating modes determine the even symmetry field distribution at the output plane. In addition, a slanted grating is designed to make the oblique light mainly couple into the normal emission; this is notably different from a rectangular grating, which can never be used to realize this goal. Numerical simulation results verify {{the validity of the}} simplified modal method. We hope that this theoretical work can lay a solid foundation for potential applications of slanted gratings...|$|R
40|$|Support of high {{performance}} queries on {{large volumes of}} scien-tific spatial data is becoming increasingly important in many ap-plications. This growth is driven by not only geospatial problems in numerous fields, but also emerging scientific applications that are increasingly data- and compute-intensive. For example, digital pathology imaging has become an emerging field during the past decade, where examination of high resolution images of human tissue specimens enables more effective diagnosis, prediction and treatment of diseases. Systematic analysis of large-scale pathology images generates tremendous amounts of spatially derived quantifi-cations of micro-anatomic objects, such as nuclei, blood vessels, and tissue <b>regions.</b> <b>Analytical</b> pathology imaging provides high potential to support image based computer aided diagnosis. One major requirement for this is effective querying of such enormou...|$|R
