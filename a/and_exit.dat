40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare muscle activity levels of the lumbar and rectus femoris muscle when entering <b>and</b> <b>exiting</b> RV <b>and</b> passenger vehicles. Background: Three varieties of RVs and two varieties of passenger vehicles were selected for this study. Method: Twenty individual(10 male and 10 female) in their twenties and thirties with no chronic back pain or any other illness participated in this study. Participants performed entering <b>and</b> <b>exiting</b> the three models of RVs and two models of passenger cars. Appropriate rest time was given to participants between entering <b>and</b> <b>exiting</b> each vehicle in order to recover from muscle fatigue while performing their tasks. Results: Results from this study show that muscle activity levels were highest for entering RVs <b>and</b> <b>exiting</b> passenger vehicles. There were no significant differences in muscle activity levels for left and right side muscles in regards to entering <b>and</b> <b>exiting</b> vehicles. Application...|$|R

The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca.

50|$|Many entrances <b>and</b> <b>exits</b> have tolls. In general, exits have tolls {{when they}} precede a barrier toll, <b>and</b> <b>exits</b> are free when they follow a barrier toll. Conversely, entrances that precede a barrier toll are free; and tolls are paid at entrances just beyond a barrier toll. This avoids double tolling (e.g., paying a barrier toll and then {{immediately}} paying again to <b>exit)</b> <b>and</b> under-tolling (e.g., driving {{a long distance}} <b>and</b> then <b>exiting</b> for free just before a barrier toll).|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|In April2006, the Navy {{commenced}} {{construction on}} an {{entrance to the}} Naval Air Station from the intersection of Third Street and Alameda Boulevard. The new entrance was completed in July2007, and the existing entrance <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> on Fourth Street was made an exit-only station. Before then, traffic entering the base had to continue southwest on Alameda Boulevard, making a left on Fourth Street. This change was expected to reduce congestion in downtown Coronado.|$|E
5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1981 season, Greer {{underwent}} {{a number of}} renovations including the addition of over 1,200box seats and over 1,000new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel cable system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> ramps, a new sound system, doubling {{the size of the}} reader panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth.

5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard.

However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E

5|$|The Forge {{junction}} at Telford Town Centre {{was awarded}} relatively late, {{to the company}} Norwest Holst. The junction precipitated the construction of Telford Shopping Centre, and the central commercial area, as the exchange was upgraded to allow traffic from the motorway to join <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> in both directions. The Forge to Cluddley section, from junction 5 to junction 7, opened to traffic in December 1975. The Hilton Park to Forge section, from the M6 to junction 5, opened in November 1983. The motorway cost 65 million pounds to build, which when adjusted for inflation would come to approximately 150 million 2006 GBP.|$|E
5|$|The Outer Harbor Crossing is {{the name}} given to the segment of the Baltimore Beltway that is {{maintained}} by the Maryland Transportation Authority. It consists of the segment of I-695 between Exit 40 (MD 151) <b>and</b> <b>Exit</b> 2 (MD 10), which includes the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The route was originally planned as a two-lane freeway on a four-lane right-of-way, with a two-lane outer harbor tunnel across the Patapsco River. When the tunnel was advertised for construction in 1970, the bids were so high that {{the decision was made}} to construct a four-lane bridge instead. The bridge was to feature two-lane approach roads on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{congestion}} tax {{is being}} introduced at the access <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden {{in order to}} reduce traffic jams in peak periods, and with shorter traffic jams on Essingeleden, the surrounding roads are expected to have shorter tailbacks. The transport agencies involved expected to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10% in peak hours. One week after the tax began to be charged, traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22% compared to a normal day in mid-December.|$|E
