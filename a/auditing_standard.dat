40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the negotiating positions, or preferences over <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> of the interest groups that may set such standards or negotiate changes in <b>standards.</b> We represent <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> by two properties: toughness and vagueness (or lack of precision). Our model predicts that auditors and investors would consider both toughness and vagueness to influence or set <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> (e. g., preference over vague-ness depends {{on the level of}} toughness.) Since the market is composed with auditors with different wealth and different investment projects, the optimal level of standards would be different for these parties. Therefore, in general, <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> with a certain level of vagueness is preferred. By analyzing economic incentives in the process of setting <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> we help explain how the standards have developed into their current form. ∗We greatly appreciate the advice from Kin Lo, Hugh Neary, and Sandra Chamberlain.

5000|$|The auditor's {{report on}} the {{financial}} statements typically provides very limited details on the procedures and findings of the audit. In contrast, auditors provide much more detail {{to the board of}} directors or to the audit committee of the board. Beginning in 2002, many countries have tasked the audit committee with primary responsibility over the audit. For example, in the United States, section 204 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in 2002 required auditors to communicate certain information to audit committees, which were required to be entirely independent, and also made the audit committee responsible for the auditor's hiring.

50|$|Many {{countries}} have government sponsored or mandated organizations who develop and maintain <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> {{commonly referred to}} generally accepted <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> or GAAS. These standards prescribe different aspects of auditing such as the opinion, stages of an audit, and controls over work product (i.e., working papers).|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} auditors {{and external}} auditors {{of the organization}} also measure the effectiveness of internal control through their efforts. They assess whether the controls are properly designed, implemented and working effectively, and make recommendations {{on how to improve}} internal control. They may also review Information technology controls, which relate to the IT systems of the organization. There are laws and regulations on internal control related to financial reporting in a number of jurisdictions. In the U.S. these regulations are specifically established by Sections 404 and 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Guidance on auditing these controls is specified in PCAOB <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standard</b> No. 5 and SEC guidance, further discussed in SOX 404 top-down risk assessment. To provide reasonable assurance that internal controls involved in the financial reporting process are effective, they are tested by the external auditor (the organizations public accountants), who are required to opine on the internal controls of the company and the reliability of its financial reporting.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to an understanding of how <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting is adapted to changing patterns of resistance at various stages of its development. Design/methodology/approach – The research is conducted as a longitudinal single case study of the auditing standard-setting activities of the Danish professional body 1970 - 1978. The case is based on extensive interviews with members of the standard-setting board at that time, supplemented with documentary studies. Findings – The paper identifies and discusses five general measures to deal with the immanent resistance to <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting: alignment of interests, representation, due process, soft texts, and reference to ideology. It concludes by analyzing how these strategies are adapted to changing patterns of standard-setting resistance at various stages. Research limitations/implications – The paper discusses <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting only. Although resistance to accounting standard setting may be dealt with in the same way, the patterns of resistance are most likely different and the adaptation strategies may therefore also be different. Practical implications – Presenting insight into the processes of <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting, the paper is of interest to anyone involved in the process, either as developers or as users. Originality/value – The paper supplements previous studies of standard setting by applying the Actor-Network Theory approach to <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting, thereby outlining a new general framework for the study of standard setting.
