On the other hand, immunotherapy involving T-cells is a promising modality of treatment for many neoplastic diseases including leukemias and lymphomas. The CD 19 /CD 3 -bispecific T-cell-engaging (BiTE®) monoclonal antibody blinatumomab can transiently engage cytotoxic T-cells to CD 19 + target B-cells inducing serial perforin-mediated lysis. In the first clinical trial, blinatumomab showed efficacy in non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, but the most important trials have been conducted in relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in ALL with minimal residual disease. Encouraging reports on the activity of blinatumomab in R/R Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor ALL led to its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 3, 2014 after an <b>accelerated</b> <b>review</b> process.

40|$|Caroline Le Jeune, Xavier Thomas Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre Bénite, France Abstract: Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and {{patients}} whose {{minimal residual disease}} persists during treatment have a poor leukemia-free survival. Despite improvements in front-line therapy, the outcome in these patients remains poor, especially after relapse. As there are no standard chemotherapeutic regimens {{for the treatment of}} patients with R/R B-precursor ALL, T-cell-based therapeutic approaches have recently come to the forefront in ALL therapy. Recently, monoclonal antibodies have been developed to target specific antigens expressed in B-lineage blast cells. In this setting, CD 19 is of great interest as this antigen is expressed in B-lineage cells. Therefore, it has been selected as the target antigen for blinatumomab, a new bi-specific T-cell engager antibody. This sophisticated antibody binds sites for both CD 19 and CD 3, leading to T-cell proliferation and activation and B-cell apoptosis. Owing to its short serum half-life, blinatumomab has been administrated by continuous intravenous infusion with a favorable safety profile. The most significant toxicities were central nervous system events and the cytokine release syndrome. This new therapeutic approach using blinatumomab {{has been shown to be}} effective in patients with positive minimal residual disease and in patients with R/R B-precursor ALL leading to a recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration after an <b>accelerated</b> <b>review</b> process. This review focuses on the profile of blinatumomab and its efficacy and safety.

40|$|Equitable {{access to}} {{medicines}} {{is a right}} of all patients {{and they may have}} great expectations of rapid and efficient regulatory processes that contribute to accelerated access to safe and effective innovative new medicines. A variety of approaches have been developed to accelerate the regulatory review of medicines. We characterise these expedited pathways as facilitated regulatory pathways (FRPs) : designed to accelerate product development, the submission of market authorisation applications, and regulatory reviews. The goal of FRPs is to speed the assessment of new drugs often for serious diseases or where there is an unmet medical need. But FRPs may be applicable to a broader group of products, including generics, biologics and vaccines. In spite of the on-going trend towards global regulatory convergence, no internationally relevant guidelines or best practices have been promulgated that describe the elements or conditions needed to implement an accelerated regulatory review pathway. The diversity of FRPs found across high-, middle- and low-income countries creates confusion for stakeholders, with uncertainty about the <b>accelerated</b> <b>review</b> requirements and processes across jurisdictions; this results in patients questioning the timing or divergences in access to important medicines. Therefore, this research was conducted to identify and characterise the key building blocks that provide context and support for the efficient use of FRPs. We hypothesised that through the methodical assessment of four key themes (stakeholder support and the regulatory environment; processes that contribute to predictability in regulatory decision making; use and interpretation of evidence associated with regulatory outcomes; post-authorisation assessments) {{we would be able to}} characterise a globally applicable pragmatic framework for the use of a diverse set of currently available FRPs. This thesis presents our observations that support our proposal for a globally applicable approach to using FRPs. Using the findings from our specific building block research and developed a 4 -step pragmatic framework approach designed to help agencies of all maturity levels determine how best to address the use of FRPs. Step 1 assesses four domains of the environment preparedness, Step 2 offers process criteria that should be in place to effectively use an FRP, Step 3 tiers agencies through a self-assessment of readiness and capacity, and Step 4 provides a pathway for agencies to determine the most relevant FRP for their use. This framework represents the first endeavour to holistically address the multifaceted aspects that should be considered for the effective use of an FRP. It offers process transparency to address the needs of sponsors and suggests timelines that address the practical considerations of sponsors and agencies and the expectations of patients. By providing supportive evidence for the building blocks of FRP best practices, we believe these approaches can form the basis for aligning the wide variety of review programmes that are in place or that are being developed for the accelerated assessment of important medicines. We trust that the work presented here can serve as the basis for international policies for efficient medicines reviews that can contribute to the equitable access to medicines worldwide...|$|E

Izhaja iz etnografske študije BBC ob koncu 20. stoletja, ki je spodbudila analizo internih posledic teh sprememb. Analiza poudarja, da ja transparentna odgovornost sredstvo legitimizacije BBC, ker v institucijo prinaša neke vrste "institucionalno refleksivnost". Hkrati imata nadzor in odgovornost tudi negativne posledice, saj spodbujata rast menedžerskega sloja,ki je postal nadležna ovira produkcijski veji BBC in spodkopal njegove kreativne zmogljivosti. Članek zato problematizira ustreznost nadzora in odgovornosti v BBC. Opozarja na ironijo, da je uveljavljanje sedanje politike nadzora posledica vladnih pritiskov, medtem ko je BBC napravila malo za obrambo pred nadaljnjimi posegi vlade v ocenjevanje njenih storitev. This paper {{outlines}} the rise during the 1990 s of numerous audit and accountability processes within the BBC. It draws on an ethnographic {{study of the}} BBC {{carried out in the}} later 1990 s, which generated an analysis of the internal impact of these changes on the corporation. The paper frames this development within the larger political and governmental contexts to which it was a response. At the same time it notes the absence in this period of significant progress {{on the part of the}} BBC in reforming its governance arrangements, a source of continuing criticism of the corporation, and one cause of the voracious growth of auditing. The analysis stresses the visible performance of accountability as an attempted means of strengthening the BBC 2 ̆ 7 s legitimation. It is argued that the processes brought a kind of institutionalised reflexivity to the corporation. At the same time audit and accountability had certain deleterious effects, stoking the growth of tiers of new management, which became an onerous burden on the production arms of the BBC and eroded their creative capacities. The paper therefore questions the utility of the kind and the degree of accountability and audit processes to which the BBC has been subject. It points to an irony: while the implementation of these policies responded to governmental pressures, the BBC 2 ̆ 7 s elaborate performance of accountability and audit has done little to defend it against further encroachment by government in the form of <b>accelerating</b> <b>reviews</b> of its services and delivery...|$|R
