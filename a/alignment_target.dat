40|$|Mix-and-match {{lithography}} {{continues to}} gain acceptance {{as a valuable}} strategy for reducing capital costs and increasing throughput productivity in semiconductor manufacturing. The successful implementation of mix-and-match lithography requires consideration of the unique characteristics of all systems being matched. Among these issues are <b>alignment</b> <b>target</b> placement and alignment strategy. The alignment system for each stepper manufacturer uses specially designed targets for wafer alignment. However, the wafer area available for dedicated alignment targets is typically restricted to maximize the quantity of production die per wafer. One approach to remove the target area limitation is to implement an alignment system based on pattern recognition techniques. Using pattern recognition, the optical image of a specified field structure is digitized and interpreted as an <b>alignment</b> <b>target.</b> Since pattern recognition {{has the potential to}} learn and interpret various structures, it provides great flexibility for using alignment structures from other steppers or possibly device structures.

40|$|Purpose: Although several {{anatomical}} landmarks {{have been}} proposed to obtain adequate femoral component alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), {{there is still no}} consensus regarding the best way to correctly position the prosthetic component on the horizontal plane. A previous computed tomography (CT) -based study has demonstrated anatomical transepicondylar axis (aTEA) to be externally rotated relative to surgical transepicondylar axis (sTEA) of approximately 4. 5 °. In this study, it is described a new methodological approach to femoral component rotational positioning through the use of previously reported CT scan information and navigation. Methods: Eight consecutive patients scheduled for navigated TKA were selected. Rotational placement of the femoral component was performed using navigation system. The femoral component was implanted setting 4. 5 ° of internal rotation relative to the aTEA. Within 1 week from surgery, all patients underwent a CT scan, and the posterior condylar angle (PCA) was measured. A PCA of 0. 0 °, meaning component placement parallel to sTEA, was set as femoral rotational <b>alignment</b> <b>target.</b> Clinical evaluation was performed at a mean 14. 3 months of follow-up with KOOS questionnaire. Results: The mean PCA measured on post-operative CT images was 0. 4 ° (SD 1. 3 °), meaning that the femoral component was averagely implanted with 0. 4 ° of internal rotation relative to the sTEA. Seven out of eight cases (87. 5 %) resulted to have within 1 ° deviation from the rotational <b>alignment</b> <b>target.</b> All patients but one reported good clinical results. Conclusions: Relevant finding {{of the present study was}} that the use of navigation and aTEA as a reference demonstrated to be accurate to set up femoral component rotational positioning on the horizontal plane in TKA.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we report}} a new method for {{actuating}} an optical fiber in two axes. This device enables in package active alignment of an optical fiber towards reducing {{the time and}} cost of optoelectronic packaging by {{eliminating the need for}} expensive and slow macroalignment machines. Opposing comb-drive actuators with integrated three-dimensional (3 -D) wedges (fabricated using grayscale technology) create a dynamic v-groove to alter the horizontal and vertical alignment of an optical fiber cantilever. All structural components are fabricated in silicon using a single lithography and dry-etching step, making the system conducive to batch fabrication, an essential element to minimize the cost of including in-package alignment capabilities. Actuation of a cleaved fiber tip greater than 30 m in each direction is demonstrated, with automated fiber alignment times on the order of 10 s, comparable to those achieved using macroalignment systems. Alignment tolerances are held below 1. 25 m over a 20 -by- 20 - m actuation area for the first time. The influences of <b>alignment</b> <b>target</b> location, actuation parameters, and alignment algorithm on total alignment time are also presented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{doctoral}} thesis {{was to compare}} two different styles of prostate image- guided radiotherapy: bony landmark (BL) setup vs. fiducial markers (FM) setup. Twenty-nine prostate patients were treated with daily BL setup and 30 patients with daily FM setup. Delivered dose distribution was reconstructed on cone-beam CT (CBCT) acquired once a week immediately after the <b>alignment.</b> <b>Target</b> dose coverage was evaluated by {{the proportion of the}} CTV encompassed by the 95 % isodose. Original plans employed 1 cm safety margin. Alternative plans assuming smaller 7 mm margin between CTV and PTV were evaluated in the same way. Rectal and bladder volumes were compared with initial ones. While the margin reduction in case of BL setup makes the prostate coverage significantly worse (p = 0. 0003, McNemar's test), in case of FM setup with the reduced 7 mm margin, the prostate coverage is even better compared to BL setup with 10 mm margin (p = 0. 049, Fisher's exact test). Moreover, partial volumes of organs at risk irradiated with a specific dose can be significantly lowered (p < 0. 0001, unpaired t-test). Reducing of safety margin is not acceptable in case of BL setup, while the margin can be lowered from 10 mm to 7 mm in case of FM setup...|$|E

40|$|The first Thomson {{scattering}} {{measurements of}} n{sub e} and T{sub e} in the divertor region of a tokamak are reported. These data {{are used as}} input to boundary physics codes such as UEDGE and DEGAS and to benchmark the predictive capabilities of these codes. These measurements have {{also contributed to the}} characterization of tokamak disruptions. A Nd:YAG laser (20 Hz, 1 J, 15 ns, 1064 nm) is directed vertically through the lower divertor region of the DIII-D tokamak. A custom, aspherical collection lens (f / 6. 8) images the laser beam from 1 - 21 cm above the target plates into eight spatial channels with 1. 5 cm vertical and 0. 3 cm radial resolution. 2 D mapping of the divertor region is achieved by sweeping the divertor X-point location radially through the fixed laser beam location. Fiber optics carry the light to polychromators whose interference filters have been optimized for low T{sub e} measurements. Silicon avalanche photo diodes measure both the scattered and plasma background light. Temperatures and densities are typically in the range of 5 - 200 eV and 1 - 10 x 10 {sup 19 } m{sup - 3 } respectively. Low temperatures, T{sub e} 8 x 10 {sup 20 } m{sup - 3 } have been observed in detached plasmas. Background light levels have not been a significant problem. Reduction of the laser stray light permits Rayleigh calibration. Because of access difficulties, no in-vessel vacuum <b>alignment</b> <b>target</b> could be used.

While the programme was originally intended to compensate poor households for the hardships imposed by structural adjustment, it has evolved into a programme focused on human capital development. In this respect, it is similar to other conditional cash transfer programmes. However, its history and the dual nature of the programme (one part based on an external loan and the other domestically driven) have hindered institutional transformation. Although there have been attempts to make the domestic programme more closely resemble the externally financed version of PRAF, this process has been hindered on several occasions. In fact, domestic programme co-responsibilities have been neither emphasized nor enforced in the past. While the current alignment of political and economic forces, {{both inside and outside the}} country, has given the programme the opportunity to positively transform itself, other factors run counter to this goal.
