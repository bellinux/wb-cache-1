5000|$|The {{founders of}} the high school had the goal of {{creating}} the [...] "ideal high school". The founders embraced an educational concept called [...] "functional education," [...] which meant educating young people to <b>assume</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> in the democracy as intelligent, educated, civically involved, ethical people. The curriculum was based on life skills; for example, gaining a lifetime liking for reading, a lifetime passion for learning. From the school's beginning it attracted subject specialists who gained nationwide fame, notably Wendell Shay in science, Esther Goff in English, Elizabeth Schneider in modern dance, Helen Dunbar in square dancing, and Mary Still in journalism. Classroom teaching was largely modeled on John Dewey's beliefs in learning by doing and relating the school to the community outside the school and, furthermore, making the school the center of the community. Lectures and tests based on student feeding the lectures back to the teacher were bypassed for hands-on projects, panel discussions, research projects and experiences outside the school. During many periods in the school's history, homework time was provided within class periods. Early in the history, the school established a longer school day to provide meeting time for school organizations. Normandy High was a so-called [...] "lighthouse" [...] school, with its programs the subject of numerous articles in The School Review and other educators' publications and of panels at high-profile places such as the University of Chicago.|$|E

Exercise testing (ET) early after MI has been shown to result in earlier return to work than the non-performance of ET.

However, the content of cardiac rehabilitation programmes varies considerably. The only randomised trial of CR as usually performed in the ‘real world’ showed that CR had no impact on cardiac death rates or any other outcome. Only 20 – 50 % of eligible patients attend CR programmes and attendance at CR has not improved in the last 20 years despite major attempts to increase participation in CR. Alternative methods for provision of CR have been sought. These include home-based CR, case management approaches, and nurse coordinated prevention programmes. Telephone based programmes, such as The COACH Program, have been introduced to coach patients and improve behavioural and biomedical risk factors. These have been shown to improve risk factors better than usual patient care and to reduce recurrences of cardiac events after discharge from hospital due to MI.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} and collate search results and analysis of research with a focus on (meta) theoretical gateways in assessment and documentation in Scandinavian preschools between 2006 and 2014, supplemented by delimited international research mainly from 2013 - 2014. The intention is also to highlight what the research indicates about assessment competence in relation to the (meta) theoretical gateways.  The final search results include 153 national and international studies from sources including the Nordic Base of Early Childhood Education and Care (NB-ECEC, 2006 - 2012). The results indicate that research into assessment in preschool is still a relatively young and undeveloped field, while the field of documentation, and pedagogical documentation in particular, has a significantly higher standing. As more and more different forms of assessment and documentation <b>assume</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> in preschools, it becomes increasingly important to gain knowledge and awareness of the potential benefits, limitations and consequences of various forms and practices for assessment and documentation. Theoretical gateways vary, as do the forms of assessment and documentation used. The analysis indicates that assessment competence can include professional assessment based on a variety of scientific grounds. Regarding the expanded documentation and evaluation task and the preschool’s complex assessment and documentation practices, there is a need for both expanded research and expanded competence, which can focus on a multi-voiced assessment competence.  </p...|$|E
40|$|É recorrente o pensamento de que a escola é, por excelência, o locus de formação docente, e que esta se dá em um processo de reflexão sobre a prática. É neste contexto que vai se constituindo a identidade profissional, sendo o {{professor}} o sujeito de sua formação. Pautado nesta ideia, este trabalho busca voltar o olhar para dentro da formação, para perceber como se dá na prática o processo reflexivo. A investigação se deu com profissionais da Rede Municipal de Armação dos Búzios, através de observações das práticas desenvolvidas em duas salas de aula, e dos encontros destinados à formação continuada, oferecidos pela Secretaria Municipal de Educação. Foram entrevistados nove profissionais, sendo seis professoras, um professor formador e duas supervisoras escolares. As observações nas salas de aula se deram em duas diferentes escolas: uma das mais antigas da rede e a outra uma das mais novas. Sem a pretensão de estabelecer a justaposição entre teoria e prática, o trabalho destina-se a perceber em que medida ocorre o diálogo entre a sala de aula e os encontros de formação, identificando o lugar da prática reflexiva no processo de formação docente. O diálogo entre as observações e escutas teve como referencial teórico a interlocução com António Nóvoa, Maurice Tardif, Rui Canário, João Formosinho e Philippe Perrenoud, e com demais autores que se inserem neste campo de atuação. O trabalho aponta para a necessidade de superação da marcante presença da forma escolar nos encontros de formação e nas relações que se processam no interior da escola, onde vem se naturalizando a impossibilidade do professor assumir seu lugar de sujeito e de refletir sobre as práticas que, significativamente, deveriam contribuir para a formação da sua identidade docente. It is recurrent {{the thinking}} that the school is by excellence the locus of teacher formation, and that it occurs within a process of reflection on the practice. It is {{in this context that}} the professional identity has been constituted, being the teacher the subject of their own formation. Based upon this idea, this work aims at looking into the formation in order to perceive how the reflective process takes place into practice. The investigation took place with professionals from the Municipal Education System of Armação dos Búzios through observations of the practices carried out in two classrooms, and meetings devoted to the continuous formation offered by the Secretariat of Municipal Education. Nine professionals were interviewed, being six of them teachers, a teacher in charge of formation and two school supervisors. The observations in the classrooms occurred at two different schools: a school considered {{to be one of the}} oldest within the Municipal System and the other one regarded as being one of the newest ones. Without the intention of establishing a juxtaposition of theory and practice, the work intends to perceive in which way occurs the dialogue between the classroom time and the meetings of formation, identifying the place of the reflective practice within the teacher formation. The dialogue between the observations and listening had as theoretical basis the interlocution with António Nóvoa, Maurice Tardif, Rui Canário, João Formosinho and Philippe Perrenoud, among other authors whose works are within this scope. The work points to the necessity of the overcoming of the outstanding presence of the school shape in the meetings of formation and in the relations which take place inside the school, where there has been naturalizing the impossibility of the teacher to <b>assume</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> as a subject and reflect on the practices that, significantly, should contribute towards the formation of their teacher identity...|$|E

She belongs to the prestigious kyūdō (Japanese archery) club, and frequently uses a bow in confrontations with the Orochi (using an Orochi sign for target practice). She is also skilled with a tantō. Chikane's combat skills resemble those taught to samurai wives while her modern talents include tennis and the piano. She enjoys playing for Himeko who appreciates her music. Many at school think, incorrectly, that Chikane is in a relationship with Sōma. She has loved Himeko since they met, although (despite her jealousy of Himeko and Sōma's friendship) she does not admit it until much later. Chikane's feelings for Himeko border on obsession, and she wants to complete the Ame no Murakumo summoning ritual quickly so she alone can protect Himeko. She seems to turn evil upon joining the Orochi as the Eighth Head, vanquishing all but two of the Orochi heads (and <b>assuming</b> <b>their</b> <b>place)</b> after sexually assaulting Himeko and tormenting her during their final battle.

40|$|Abstract We review {{recent trends}} in phylogeography and phylogenetics {{and argue that}} these two fields stand to be reunited by the common {{yardstick}} provided by sequence and SNP data and by new multilocus methods for phylogenetic analysis. Whereas the modern incarnation of both fields was spawned by PCR approaches applied to mitochondrial DNA in the late 1980 s, the two fields diverged during the 1990 s {{largely due to the}} adoption by phylogeographers of microsatellites, in contrast to the adoption of nuclear sequence data by phylogeneticists. Sequence-based markers possess a number of advantages over microsatellites, even on the recent time scales that are the purview of phylogeography. Using examples primarily from vertebrates, we trace the maturation of nuclear gene phylogeography and phylogenetics and suggest that the abundant instances of gene tree heterogeneity beckon a new generation of phylogenetic methods that focus on estimating species trees as distinct from gene trees. Whole genomes provide a powerful common yardstick on which both phylogeography and phylogenetics can <b>assume</b> <b>their</b> proper <b>place</b> as ends of a continuum...|$|R

Although content analysis is difficult because the speeches cross seven decades, three components stood out: The women presidents primarily used their expertise as power, used partisan leadership techniques with a conservative slant, and avoided discussing women or women’s issues. The authors argue that these three stylistic components reflect the common desire of the women presidents to advance the professional status of social work, under conditions of subdominant professional and gendered status, despite the span of years.
