The results indicated that markers on chromosomes 6 and 7 were imbalanced, consistent with trisomy in both benign and malignant skin tumors. A proportion of carcinomas also showed loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 11, where the p 53 gene is located, and more rarely, on chromosomes 4, 6, and 15.

40|$|International audienceThe genomic {{aberration}} {{profile of}} chromosome 20 q in distal CIN colon carcinomas was analysed using <b>allelotyping</b> and CGH arrays. <b>Allelotyping</b> revealed carcinomas with allelic imbalance along the full long arm, and carcinomas with fully non-aberrant 20 q. Oligonucleotide-based CGH showed {{that among the}} carcinomas without allelic imbalance, 47 % had in fact a gain. In this subgroup, quantitative PCR for the TOPI gene (20 q 12) confirmed this gain, and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} showed that the chromosome 20 q gain resulted from tetra/polysomy instead of aneusomy. The 20 q gain correlated with a high frequency of aberrations, with allelic imbalance at TP 53 locus but not at APC locus, and carcinomas with a disomic 20 q showed low frequency of genomic aberrations and were significantly associated to mucinous phenotype. The prognostic value of 20 q amplification was not demonstrated in this study. These results indicate that on the basis of aberration frequency, chromosome 20 q and TP 53 /APC locus status, distal CIN carcinomas harbor a high degree of genetic heterogeneity suggesting several pathways for carcinogenesis.

Searching for deletions in cancer genomes therefore provides an attractive option to identify new tumour suppressor genes. Here, we have performed a genome-wide survey for regions exhibiting allelic loss in 24 commercially available breast cancer cell lines and four breast cancer xenografts, using microsatellite analysis. The assembled <b>allelotype</b> revealed an average fractional allelic loss of 0. 34.

Three of these frequently lost chromosomal arms had not been identified as such by comparative genome hybridisation, illustrating the higher sensitivity of microsatellite analysis for the detection of allelic losses.

40|$|Background: Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) using array-based genotyping {{technology are}} widely used to identify genetic loci associated with complex diseases or other phenotypes. The costs of GWAS projects based on individual genotyping are still comparatively high and increase {{with the size of}} study populations. Genotyping using pooled DNA samples, as also being referred as to <b>allelotyping</b> approach, offers an alternative at affordable costs. In the present study, data from 100 DNA samples individually genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6. 0 were used to estimate the error of the pooling approach by comparing the results with those obtained using the same array type but DNA pools each composed of 50 of the same samples. Newly developed and established methods for signal intensity correction were applied. Furthermore, the relative allele intensity signals (RAS) obtained by <b>allelotyping</b> were compared to the corresponding values derived from individual genotyping. Similarly, differences in RAS values between pools were determined and compared. Results: Regardless of the intensity correction method applied, the pooling-specific error of the pool intensity values was larger for single pools than for the comparison of the intensity values of two pools, which reflects the scenario of a case-control study. Using 50 pooled samples and analyzing 10, 000 SNPs with a minor allele frequency of > 1 % and applying the best correction method for the corresponding type of comparison, the 90 % quantile (median) of the pooling-specific absolute error of the RAS values for single sub-pools and the SNP-specific difference in allele frequency comparing two pools was 0. 064 (0. 026) and 0. 056 (0. 021), respectively. Conclusions: Correction of the RAS values reduced the error of the RAS values when analyzing single pool intensities. We developed a new correction method with high accuracy but low computational costs. Correction of RAS, however, only marginally reduced the error of true differences between two sample groups and those obtained by <b>allelotyping.</b> Exclusion of SNPs with a minor allele frequency of ≤ 1 % notably reduced the pooling-specific error. Our findings allow for improving the estimation of the pooling-specific error and may help in designing <b>allelotyping</b> studies using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6. 0...|$|R
40|$|The most {{frequent}} chromosomal aberrations in B-cell {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (B-CLL) are deletions on 13 q, 11 q, and 17 p, and trisomy 12, {{all of which are}} of prognostic significance. Conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are used for their detection, but cytogenetic analysis is hampered by the low mitotic index of B-CLL cells, and FISH depends on accurate information about candidate regions. We used a set of 400 highly informative microsatellite markers covering all chromosomal arms (<b>allelotyping)</b> and automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols to screen 46 patients with typical B-CLL for chromosomal aberrations. For validation, we compared data with our conventional karyotype results and fine mapping with conventional single-site PCR. All clonal cytogenetic abnormalities potentially detectable by our microsatellite PCR (eg, del 13 q 14 and trisomy 12) were picked up. <b>Allelotyping</b> revealed additional complex aberrations in patients with both normal and abnormal B-CLL karyotypes. Aberrations detectable in the samples with our microsatellite panel were found on almost all chromosomal arms. We detected new aberrant loci in typical B-CLL, such as allelic losses on 1 q, 9 q, and 22 q in up to 25 % of our patients, and allelic imbalances mirroring chromosomal duplications, amplifications, or aneuploidies on 2 q, 10 p, and 22 q in up to 27 % of our patients.

Subjects and Methods: The genotypes of four tagSNPs (RRM 1 - 316 C > A, RRM 1 - 269 C > A, RRM 1 - 702 G > A and RRM 1 - 585 T > G) were determined by SNaPshot detection technology and sequencing approaches in 184 advanced NSCLC patients by using peripheral blood. Results: The overall response rate for 178 patients was 40. 2 % and the disease control rate was 90. 2 %. In patients who had ever smoked, a significant correlation was observed between the genotype of RRM 1 - 269 C > A and response (P = 0. 046). There was a significant difference in response according to the genotype of RRM 1 - 702 G > A (P = 0. 043).

Osteosarcoma of all sites accounts for approximately 20 % of all malignant tumors of bone and approximately 7, 500 new cases annually in the United States. Although a majority of osteosarcomas occur in the long bones of the skeleton, 6 - 13 % of all osteosarcomas occur in the head and neck. Evidence from the differences in the degree of cellular atypia, the frequency of local versus distant metastases, the time until metastases, and the median age of onset, suggests that primary osteosarcoma of the long bones and primary osteosarcoma {{of the head and neck}} represent biologically discrete diseases. To test this hypothesis, genome-wide <b>allelotype</b> analysis was conducted to identify regions of tumor-specific Constitutional Loss of Heterozygosity (LoH) as well as the evaluation of the expression patterns of genes implicated in appendicular osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. For the <b>allelotype</b> analysis, 18 head and neck osteosarcoma tumors were used to study the allelic patterns of 66 microsatellite markers distributed throughout the genome. The overall frequency of LoH in the head and neck osteosarcoma was 53 % with 30 chromosomal arms undergoing consistent LoH. Of these 11 chromosomal regions showed significant differences in frequency of LoH from those seen in long bone osteosarcomas (pavg = 0. 02). Deletions of genomic regions involving tumor suppressor genes are thought to be important for the initiation and progression of malignancy. Therefore, the difference in the frequency and distribution pattern of LoH for head and neck osteosarcoma from that of long bone osteosarcoma suggests that the tumor pathogenesis is also distinct. Expression patterns of candidate genes previously implicated in appendicular osteosarcoma tumorigenesis revealed that the expression patterns of some of these genes differed in head and neck osteosarcomas from those observed in the appendicular osteosarcomas.

Microsatellite instability in microdissected tissue [MSI(md-tissue) ] was detected in tumor tissues of all CTCL patients. One hundred and fifty-seven of 469 analyzed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications contained mutated microsatellite alleles (34 %). In lichen planus, MSI(md-tissue) was seen in only four of 76 PCR products (5 %) (P < 0. 0001). The distribution of <b>allelotypes</b> in tumor cells from different disease stages was consistent with multilineage progression in five MF cases, {{as well as in}} the LyP/ALCL patient. Our results suggest that CTCL may evolve by multilineage progression and that tumor subclones in MF can be detected in early disease stages by mutation {{analysis of}} microsatellite DNA obtained from multiple microdissected areas...|$|R
40|$|Diffusely infiltrative astrocytic tumours are {{the most}} common {{neoplasms}} in the human brain. To localise putative tumour suppressor loci that are involved in low-grade astrocytomas, we performed high-resolution genome-wide <b>allelotype</b> analysis on 17 fibrillary astrocytomas. Non-random allelic losses were identified on chromosomal arms 10 p (29 %), 10 q (29 %), 14 q (35 %), 17 p (53 %), and 19 q (29 %), with their respective common regions of deletions delineated at 10 p 14 - 15. 1, 10 q 25. 1 -qter, 14 q 212. 2 -qer, 17 p 11. 2 -pter and 19 q 12 - 13. 4. These results suggest that alterations of these chromosomal regions play important roles in the development of astrocytoma. We also allelotyped 21 de novo glioblastoma multiforme with an aim to unveil genetic changes that are common to both types of astrocytic tumours. Non-random allelic losses were identified on 9 p (67 %), 10 p (62 %), 10 q (76 %), 13 q (60 %), 14 q (50 %), and 17 p (65 %). Allelic losses of 10 p, 10 q, 14 q and 17 p were common genetic alterations detectable in both fibrillary astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme. In addition, two common regions of deletions on chromosome 14 were mapped to 14 q 22. 3 - 32. 1 and 14 q 32. 1 -qter, suggesting the presence of two putative tumour suppressor genes. In conclusion, our comprehensive <b>allelotype</b> analysis has unveiled several critical tumour suppressor loci that are involved in the development of fibrillary astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme. Although these two types of brain tumours are believed to evolve from different genetic pathways, they do share some common genetic changes. Our results indicate that deletions of chromosome 14 q is a recurrent genetic event in the development of astrocytoma and highlight the subchromosomal regions on this chromosome that are likely to contain putative tumour suppressor genes involved in the oncogenesis of astrocytic tumours...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{basal cell}} carcinomas and odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws are {{a feature of}} the {{inherited}} naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), although both occur more commonly as single, sporadic cases. The NBCCS gene has been mapped to chromosome 9 q 22. 3 -q 31 and loss of heterozygosity for DNA markers from this region has been observed in familial and sporadic basal cell carcinomas. Based on these observations, we undertook a pilot study to determine if a similar pattern of chromosome loss occurs in odontogenic keratocysts. DNA extracted from microdissected odontogenic keratocyst epithelium was examined for loss of heterozygosity for six polymorphic DNA markers mapping to human chromosome 9 q 22. 3 -q 31. <b>Allelotype</b> loss was detected in epithelium from three, single, sporadic odontogenic keratocysts. These results implicate homozygous inactivation of the NBCCS gene in the initiation and progression of the odontogenic keratocyst...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-seven endometrial cancers were {{subjected}} to an <b>allelotype</b> anal ysis {{in an attempt to}} identify chromosomal regions that are lost in a significant portion of tumors and to identify tumors characterized by replication errors. Thirty-nine highly polymorphic microsatellite markers representing all chromosomal arms, excluding the X and the short arms of the acrocentrics, were examined. An average of 20 informative cases were evaluated for each marker. Genetic alterations were detected in 30 of the 37 tumors. Replication errors were identified in 8 tumor specimens. Loss of heterozygosity was observed for loci on all chromosomes examined with the exception of chromosomes 4 and 20. The two most frequent sites of loss were at the marker loci examined on lOq (40 %) and 17 p (29 %). Six additional simple sequence repeat markers from lOq were genotyped in an effort to refine the region of lOq loss. The chromosome 10 markers use...|$|E

The {{extension}} of PLS regression to generalized linear models, and for instance to logistic regression models, {{and the need to}} provide tools to PLS users to deal with incomplete datasets using cross-validation. These models were successfully applied to datasets of various kinds: to multiple regression problems linked to the famous mixture dataset of Cornell, to generalized linear regression and especially to a study of Bordeaux wine quality thanks to an ordinal logistic regression model. More recently, the authors carried out the analysis of <b>allelotyping</b> data thanks to PLS binary logistic regression models in order to enhance the understanding of mechanisms involved in the evolution of cancers...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{molecular}} cytogenetic {{studies by}} comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on primary tumours of human malignant mesothelioma {{have revealed that}} loss of genetic material at chromosome 14 q {{is one of the}} most frequently occurring aberrations. Here we further verify the frequency and pattern of deletions at 14 q in mesothelioma. A high-resolution deletion mapping analysis of 23 microsatellite markers was performed on 18 primary mesothelioma tumours. Eight of these had previously been analysed by CGH. Loss of heterozygosity or allelic imbalance with at least one marker was detected in ten of 18 tumours (56 %). Partial deletions of varying lengths were more common than loss of all informative markers, which occurred in only one tumour. The highest number of tumours with deletions at a specific marker was detected at 14 q 11. 1 –q 12 with markers D 14 S 283 (five tumours), D 14 S 972 (seven tumours) and D 14 S 64 (five tumours) and at 14 q 23 –q 24 with markers D 14 S 258 (five tumours), D 14 S 77 (five tumours) and D 14 S 284 (six tumours). We conclude from these data that genomic deletions at 14 q are more common than previously reported in mesothelioma. Furthermore, confirmation of previous CGH results was obtained in all tumours but one. This tumour showed deletions by <b>allelotyping,</b> but did not show any DNA copy number change at 14 q by CGH. Although the number of tumours <b>allelotyped</b> was small and the deletion pattern was complex, 14 q 11. 1 –q 12 and 14 q 23 –q 24 were found to be the most involved regions in deletions. These regions provide a good basis for further molecular analyses and may highlight chromosomal locations of tumour suppressor genes that could be important in the tumorigenesis of malignant mesothelioma. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
