The Timbaland track, titled [...] "It's a Fight", and a Dr. Dre-produced song titled [...] "Wicked Day" [...] {{were excluded from}} the album because their hip hop sounds did not work well on the album. The band then worked with producer and former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek in late June. Stefani commented that No Doubt worked with so many people for the record because none were available for the time needed to make an LP, but that she would have liked to work with Ocasek longer. The band <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>A</b> manager Mark Williams chose collaborators based on how well they thought the person would fit the personality of the song that No Doubt had written.

Eventually, despite Lopes' disagreement, {{the decision was made}} to name the track CrazySexyCool first single on October 31, 1994. Many producers had since contributed their own remixes to the song's release, including: Austin himself creating the [...] "DARP Mix"; recording artist Jermaine Dupri—who was working closely with the group and had expressed his admiration for the song and Austin's talent—collaborating with producer Shannon Houchins to create [...] "Jermaine's Jeep Mix" [...] <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> cappella version; finally, producer duo Untouchables, consist of DJ Eddie F and Kenny [...] "Love" [...] Tonge creating the [...] "Untouchables Mix" [...] and the [...] "Super Smooth Mix". Austin's and Untouchables' mixes featured a newly-written rap verse from Lopes, with a noteworthy lyric line warns: [...] "Prenatal HIV is often sleeping in a creeping cradle." [...] Reporter Nate Jones from People said Lopez's addition on the remixes was another reminder of the trio's commitment to addressing social issues [...] "seamlessly" [...] in their music.|$|E
500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks so like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. Everything seems to be on the decline, as, indeed, is the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E

2500|$|After {{moving to}} New York City, Jones signed to Blue Note Records, a label owned by EMI Group. The signing came as an {{indirect}} result of Jones performing as lead singer for the JC Hopkins Biggish Band. Shell White, then {{the wife of}} JC Hopkins, worked in Blue Note's royalties department and passed Jones's three-track demo on to the label's president Bruce Lundvall <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>A</b> Brian Bacchus. The demo featured two jazz standards and a song by Jesse Harris. Lundvall and Bacchus immediately agreed Jones had great potential. Although initially unsure about what direction her music would follow, particularly since Blue Note was a jazz label, they decided to sign Jones. Bacchus told HitQuarters: [...] "We let her find her own direction.... We knew that if she could develop her songwriting and we could find great songs, it would work." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{original}} impulse out {{of which}} the classical tradition developed was the naïve faith of the Greek philosophers in the omnipotence of reasoning. The discovery of geometry had intoxicated them, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> priori deductive method appeared capable of universal application. They would prove, for instance, that all reality is one, {{that there is no}} such thing as change, that the world of sense is a world of mere illusion; and the strangeness of their results gave them no qualms because they believed in the correctness of their reasoning. Thus it came to be thought that by mere thinking the most surprising and important truths concerning the whole of reality could be established with a certainty which no contrary observations could shake. As the vital impulse of the early philosophers died away, its place was taken by authority and tradition, reinforced, in the Middle Ages and almost to our own day, by systematic theology. Modern philosophy, from Descartes onwards, though not bound by authority like that of the Middle Ages, still accepted more or less uncritically the Aristotelian logic. Moreover, it still believed, except in Great Britain, that a priori reasoning could reveal otherwise undiscoverable secrets about the universe, and could prove reality to be quite different from what, to direct observation, it appears to be. It is this belief, rather than any particular tenets resulting from it, that I regard as the distinguishing characteristic of the classical tradition, and as hitherto the main obstacle to a scientific attitude in philosophy.|$|E
6000|$|Sancho {{calls for}} benediction [...] "on {{the man who}} invented sleep." [...] It {{would have been more}} just to have asked this boon in behalf of him who invented eating and turtle-soup. The wearied fall into sleep, as it might be unwittingly; {{sometimes}} against their will, and often against their interests; while many a man is hungry without possessing the means of appeasing his appetite. Still more daily feel hunger without possessing turtle-soup. Certain persons impute this delicious compound to the genius of some London alderman, but we rather think unjustly. Aldermanic genius is easily excited and rendered active, no doubt, by strong appeals on such a theme, but our own experience inclines us to believe that the tropics usually send their inventions to the less fruitful regions of the earth along with their products. We have little doubt, could the fact be now ascertained, that it would be found turtle-soup was originally invented by just some such worthy as Jack Tier, who in filling his coppers to tickle the captain's appetite, had used all the condiments within his reach; ventured on a sort of Regent's punch; and, as the consequence, had brought forth the dish so often eulogized, and so well beloved. It is a little extraordinary that in Paris, the seat of gastronomy, one rarely, if ever, hears of or sees this dish; while in London it is to be met in almost as great abundance as in one of our larger commercial towns. But so it is, and we cannot say we much envy a cuisine its patés, and soufflets, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>à</b> la this and à la thats, but which was never redolent with the odours of turtle-soup.|$|E
