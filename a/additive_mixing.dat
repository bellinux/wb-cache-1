Pleasonton. The title of this book, proposing that blue is the essential life force, was adapted for the album because of the parallels between Pleasonton's faith in the color blue and Kulash's faith in the music that arises from him organically without rational thought. Elements of the booklet compare the lyrics with the passage, with data gathered from {{the characteristics of the}} texts presented by different graphical means. The image on the album cover was constructed with a list of twenty-five themes (for example [...] "Unfounded or Wildly Broad Claims", [...] "Wonderment", and [...] "Light/Optics/Color"), each representing a specific color, assigned to each sentence in both the passage and the lyrics. If more than one theme is assigned to the same sentence, the colors are combined with <b>additive</b> <b>mixing.</b> With each sentence being represented by a colored line, the lines are arranged radially giving the impression of beams of multicolored light emanating from the center. Other data collected for presentation inside the booklet includes sentence length, parts of speech occurrences, syllable stress, and words common to both texts. Kulash, as the primary songwriter for the album, developed the concept and collected the data with Stefanie Posavec and Greg McInerny, who were credited with visualization and layout of the booklet.|$|E

For instance, one can additively mix yellow and blue by shining yellow light together with blue light, which will result in not green but a white light. As in this example, one should always have the mixture of light in mind when considering additive color mixing {{as it is the}} only situation where it occurs.

50|$|By convention, {{the three}} primary colors in {{subtractive}} mixing are yellow, magenta and cyan; however, {{for a long}} time painters have used yellow, red and blue in place of these. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors is black. The secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from <b>additive</b> <b>mixing,</b> and vice versa. This is not an accident. By mixing additive secondary colors subtractively one can reachieve the primary additive colors. Subtractive mixing is used to create a variety of colors when printing on paper by combining a small number of ink colors, and also when painting. Green is a part of mixing yellow and blue. Orange is a part of mixing red and yellow. Purple is a part of mixing blue and red.|$|E
5000|$|The exact colors {{chosen for}} the {{primaries}} are a technological compromise between the available phosphors (including considerations such as cost and power usage) {{and the need for}} large color triangle to allow a large gamut of colors.

50|$|Initially, the Monochord and Melochord {{were used}} in the Cologne Studio {{together}} with other equipment. A noise generator provided a rushing-noise signal, like what is heard for example in short-wave radio on frequencies between radio stations. Filters were important for transforming sounds. An octave filter attenuates an input signal (like white noise, for example) into several octave-wide frequency bands. Two band-pass filters allow only a single band of frequencies to pass through from an input signal. By using the band-pass filters instead of the octave filter, this band could be adjusted in width and centre frequency. In addition there was as so-called ring modulator, which mixed two input signals multiplictively, in contrast to the <b>additive</b> <b>mixing</b> done with a mixing console. The ring modulator was used for intense sound transformations. An oscilloscope made sounds visible. A four-track tape recorder allowed the synchronisation of several separately produced successions of sounds. Two single-track tape recorders were used to copy one tape to another. By using the mixer, new sounds could be recorded along with those from the first audio tape while copying to the second tape recorder (one of Meyer-Eppler’s key ideas). The mixer consisted of two groups of eight channels each. It had remote controls for the four-track tape recorder and the octave filter. In addition, the inputs and outputs of all sound sources, filters, and modulators converged here, in a cross-plug-in busbar panel, so that the connections of the individual devices with one another could easily be established and modified as needed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating a high-dimensional <b>additive</b> <b>mixed</b> model for longitudinal data using sparse methods. In this problem, multiple measurements are made on the same subject across time, and then the different sources of variability (intra- and inter-subject variability) and correlation within subjects have to be considered. Also, the relationships between explanatory variables and the outcome arepossibly non linear. In addition, the number of explanatory variables could be larger than the sample size but only a small set of explanatory variables contribute to the response. Several computational approaches for high-dimensional additive modelling for independent data have been developed in the literature. Recently, Amato and colleagues (Stat Methods Appl 2016; s 10260 - 016 - 0357 - 8) conducted {{a comprehensive review of}} these methods. Efficient regularized estimation procedures for variable selection in nonparametric additive models use basis function approximations. The authors also proposed a reformulation of the estimation problem in terms of group Lasso that allows deducing convergence and asymptotic optimality properties. Only a few works have developed suggestions to analyse high-dimensional longitudinal data using Lasso-type methods in <b>additive</b> <b>mixed</b> model.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a {{public key encryption}} scheme {{that is based on}} <b>additive</b> <b>mixing</b> of a message with chaotic nonlinear dynamics. A high-dimensional dissipative nonlinear dynamical system is distributed between transmitter and receiver. The transmitter dynamics is public (known to all) and the receiver dynamics is private (known only to the authorized receiver). Bidirectional signals that couple transmitter and receiver are transmitted over a public channel. Once the chaotic dynamics which is initialized with a random state converges to the attractor, a message is mixed with the chaotic dynamics at the transmitter. The authorized receiver who knows the entire dynamics can use a simple algorithm to decode the message. An unauthorized receiver does not know the receiver dynamics and needs to use computationally unfeasible algorithms in order to decode the message. Security is maintained by altering the private receiver dynamics during transmission. We show that using <b>additive</b> <b>mixing</b> modulation is more efficient than the attractor position modulation distributed dynamics encryption scheme. We demonstrate the concept of this new scheme by simulating a simple coupled map lattice. Index Terms—Chaos, nonlinear dynamics, public key encryption. I...|$|E

Covariates analyzed were: population, age, data of report of influenza, and health region during 2010 - 2014 using data obtained from the SISAP program (Institut Catala de la Salut, Generalitat of Catalonia). Reported cases were related with the study of covariates using a descriptive analysis. Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models and Generalized <b>Additive</b> <b>Mixed</b> Models were used to estimate {{the evolution of the}} transmission of influenza. Additive models can estimate non-linear effects of the covariates by smooth functions; and mixed models can estimate data dependence and variability in factor variables using correlations structures and random effects, respectively.
