40|$|Understanding and {{quantifying}} outdoor and indoor {{sources of}} human exposure are essential but often not adequately addressed in health-effects studies for air pollution. Air pollution epidemiology, risk assessment, health tracking and accountability assessments {{are examples of}} health-effects studies that require but often lack adequate exposure information. Recent advances in exposure modeling along with better information on time-activity and exposure factors data provide us with unique opportunities to improve the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> for both future and ongoing studies linking air pollution to health impacts. In September 2006, scientists from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with scientists from the academic community and state health departments convened a symposium on air pollution exposure and health in order to identify, evaluate, and improve current approaches for linking air pollution exposures to disease. This manuscript presents the key issues, challenges and recommendations identified by the exposure working group, who used cases studies of particulate matter, ozone, and toxic air pollutant exposure to evaluate health-effects for air pollution. One of the over-arching lessons of this workshop is that obtaining better exposure information for these different health-effects studies requires both goal-setting for what is needed and mapping out the transition pathway from current capabilities to meeting these goals. Meeting our long-term goals requires definition of incremental steps that provide useful information for the interim and move us toward our long-term goals. Another over-arching theme among the three different pollutants and the different health study approaches {{is the need for}} integration among alternate exposure assessment approaches. For example, different groups may advocate exposure indicators, biomonitoring, mapping methods (GIS), modeling, environmental media monitoring, and/or personal exposure modeling. However, emerging research reveals that the greatest progress comes from integration among two or more of these efforts...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} was to {{describe}} the structure and content of a job-exposure matrix (JEM) for historical asbestos exposure in The Netherlands. The JEM contained 309 occupational job title groups in 70 branches of industry during 10 periods of 5 years during 1945 – 1994, resulting in 3090 evaluations. Dutch sources on asbestos exposure measurements provided quantitative guidance for 69 evaluations (2. 2 %) in 25 occupational title groups. In addition, three databases from the UK Health and Safety Executive contributed to 222 evaluations (7. 2 %) and several other sources aided in another 133 evaluations (4. 3 %). These evaluations resulted in seven categories <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> levels for all 3090 combinations of occupational title groups and periods. A verification process with five experts was used to adjust the <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> categories.

Semi-ecological design studies are widely used to assess effects of air pollution in humans. In this type of analysis, health outcomes and covariates are measured in individuals and exposure assignments are usually based on air quality monitor stations. Therefore, estimating individual <b>exposures</b> are one <b>of</b> the major challenges when investigating these relationships with a semi-ecologic design. Methods/Design Semi-ecologic study consisting of a retrospective cohort study with ecologic <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> is applied. Health outcomes and covariates are collected at Primary Health Care Center. Data from pregnant registry, clinical record and specific questionnaire administered orally to the mothers of children born in period 2007 - 2010 in Portuguese Alentejo Litoral region, are collected by the research team. Outdoor air pollution data are collected with a lichen diversity biomonitoring program, and individual pregnancy exposures are assessed with spatial geostatistical simulation, which provides the basis for uncertainty analysis <b>of</b> individual <b>exposures.</b> Awareness <b>of</b> outdoor air pollution uncertainty will improve validity <b>of</b> individual <b>exposures</b> <b>assignments</b> for further statistical analysis with multivariate regression models. Discussion Exposure misclassification {{is an issue of}} concern in semi-ecological design. In this study, personal exposures are assigned to each pregnant using geocoded addresses data. A stochastic simulation method is applied to lichen diversity values index measured at biomonitoring survey locations, in order to assess spatial uncertainty of lichen diversity value index at each geocoded address. These methods assume a model for spatial autocorrelation <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and provide a distribution <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> in each study location.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of {{long-term effects of}} air pollution in humans relies on epidemiologic studies. A widely used design consists of cross-sectional or cohort studies in which ecologic <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> based on a fixed-site ambient monitor, is employed. Although health outcome and usually {{a large number of}} covariates are measured in individuals, these studies are often called ecological. We will introduce the term semi-individual design for these studies. We review the major properties and limitations with regard to causal inference of truly ecologic studies, in which outcome, exposure, and covariates are available on an aggregate level only. Misclassification problems and issues related to confounding and model specification in truly ecologic studies limit etiologic inference to individuals. In contrast, the semi-individual study shares its methodological and inferential properties with typical individual-level study designs. The major caveat relates to the case where too few study areas, e. g., two or three, are used, which render control of aggregate level confounding impossible. The issue <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> misclassification is <b>of</b> general concern in epidemiology and not an exclusive problem of the semi-individual design. In a multicenter setting, the semi-individual study is a valuable tool to approach long-term effects of air pollution. Knowledge about the error structure of the ecologically assigned <b>exposure</b> allows consideration <b>of</b> the impact <b>of</b> ecologically assigned <b>exposure</b> on effect estimation. Semi-individual studies, i. e., individual level air pollution studies with ecologic exposure assignment, more readily permit valid inference to individuals and should not be labeled as ecologic studies...|$|R

Although 181 black smoke (BS) monitoring sites operated in this region at some point during 1970 - 79, a substantial amount <b>of</b> BS <b>exposure</b> data was missing at many sites. The three exposure estimation methods were: (i) area-based regression models to impute missing data followed by <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> by inverse distance weighting of observed BS at nearby monitoring sites (IDWBS); (ii) area-based regression models to impute missing data followed by a spatial regression additive model using four local air quality predictors (LAQP) : altitude; distance to the nearest major road; household density within a 250 m buffer zone; and distance to the edge of urban boundary (AMBS); (iii) a multilevel spatio-temporal model using LAQP (MultiBS). The three methods were evaluated using maps of predicted BS, and cross validation using monitored and imputed BS at sites with ≥ 80 % data. The use of LAQP in the AMBS and MultiBS exposure models provided spatial patterns in BS consistent with known sources of BS associated with major roads and the centre of urban areas. Cross-validation analyses demonstrated that the MultiBS model provided more precise predictions (R 2 = 60 %) of decadal geometric mean BS concentrations at monitoring sites compared with the IDWBS and AMBS models (R 2 of 19 % and 20 %, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Relationships between {{exacerbations}} {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) {{and environmental factors}} such as temperature, humidity and air pollution are not well characterised, due, in part, to oversimplification in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates to individuals and populations. New developments in miniature environmental sensors mean that patients can now carry a personal air quality monitor {{for long periods of time}} as they go about their daily lives. This creates the potential for capturing a direct link between individual activities, environmental exposures and the health of COPD patients. Direct associations then have the potential to be scaled up to population levels and tested using advanced human exposure models linked to electronic health records (EHRs). Methods and analysis: This study has five stages: 1) development and deployment of personal air monitors (PAM); 2) recruitment and monitoring of a cohort of 160 COPD patients for up to six months with recruitment of participants through the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); 3) statistical associations between personal exposure with COPD related health outcomes; 4) validation <b>of</b> a time-activity <b>exposure</b> model; and 5) development of a COPD prediction model for London.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Traffic-related {{pollution}} {{is associated with}} asthma onset in children. Its effect on adult-onset asthma is poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: We used the SAPALDIA cohort study to investigate associations between the 11 -year change (1991 - 2002) in home outdoor traffic-related particulate matter up to 10 micrometers in diameter (TPM 10) and asthma incidence. METHODS: Never-smokers without asthma at baseline (ages: 18 - 60 years in 1991) were eligible. Subjects reporting doctor's diagnosed asthma at follow-up were considered incident cases. TPM 10 at baseline and follow-up was predicted and interpolated to subject's residences by dispersion models using emission and meteorological data. Cox proportional hazard models for time to asthma onset were adjusted (age, gender, baseline atopy, BMI, bronchial reactivity, maternal allergies). RESULTS: Among 2725 never-smokers, 41 reported asthma onset in 2002. Home outdoor TPM 10 concentrations improved during the interval (mean: - 0. 6; range - 9 to + 7. 2; IQR 0. 6 microg/m 3). Asthma incidence was associated with change in TPM 10. The hazard ratio (1. 30; 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 1. 61) per 1 microg/m 3 change in TPM 10 (IQR) was not sensitive to further adjustments (education, workplace exposure, passive smoking, parental asthma or allergies, random area effects, lung function, or co-pollutants such as regional, secondary, total PM 10, or proximity to busy roads). CONCLUSION: The data suggest a role for traffic-related pollution in adult-onset asthma. Space, time, and source-specific individual <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to traffic-related {{pollution is}} a key strength of SAPALDIA. It may explain why findings were statistically significant despite {{the limited number of}} new cases.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is {{evidence}} that exposure to air pollution affects asthma, but the effect of air pollution on asthma severity has not been addressed. The aim {{was to assess the}} relation between asthma severity during the past 12 months and home outdoor concentrations of air pollution. METHODS: Asthma severity over the past 12 months was assessed in two complementary ways among 328 adult asthmatics from the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) examined between 1991 and 1995. The four-class severity score integrated clinical events and type of treatment. The five-level asthma score is based only on the occurrence of symptoms. Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) concentrations were assigned to each residence using two different methods. The first was based on the closest monitor data from 1991 to 1995. The second consisted of spatial models that used geostatistical interpolations and then assigned air pollutants to the geo-coded residences (1998). RESULTS: Higher asthma severity score was significantly related to the 8 -hour average of ozone during April-September (O(3) - 8 h) and the number of days (O(3) -days) with 8 -hour ozone averages above 110 microg. m(- 3) (for a 36 -day increase, equivalent to the interquartile range, in O(3) -days, odds ratio 2. 22 (95 % confidence interval 1. 61 to 3. 07) for one class difference in score). Adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, occupational exposure, and educational level did not alter results. Asthma severity was unrelated to NO(2). Both exposure assessment methods and severity scores resulted in very similar findings. SO(2) correlated with severity but reached statistical significance only for the model-based <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations between asthma severity and air pollution, in particular O(3), support the hypothesis that air pollution at levels far below current standards increases asthma severit...|$|R
40|$|In some cases, {{epidemiological}} studies require the air pollutant concentrations at the exposure points. In these cases air dispersion models represent {{a very important}} tool. When additional points <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> are inserted or when some exposure points must be relocated, spatial interpolators {{can be used in}} place of new runs of the air dispersion model. In this work the uncertainties and the problematic related to spatial interpolation methods are inspected. The case studied is based on an epidemiological study aimed to study the risk of childhood leukemia associated with benzene exposure due to traffic emissions. The concentration values of benzene computed by the atmospheric dispersion model ADMS are taken as reference and compared with the concentration values computed using several interpolation methods and additional data sets of concentrations computed by ADMS in the same area. The comparison is done following two approaches: the summary statistics of the differences and the correctness <b>of</b> the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> points to the concentration categories used in the epidemiological study.

40|$|Abstract In the European {{construction}} industry in 2009, {{the use of}} engineered nanoparticles appears to be confined to {{a limited number of}} products, predomi-nantly coatings, cement and concrete. A survey among representatives of workers and employers from 14 EU countries suggests a high level of ignorance about the availability and use of nanomaterials for the construc-tion industry and the safety aspects thereof.

40|$|Background: The toxic {{effects of}} {{ultrafine}} particles (UFP) are {{a public health}} concern. However, epidemiological studies on the long term effects of UFP are limited due to lacking exposure models. Given the high spatial variation <b>of</b> UFP, the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> levels in epidemiological studies requires a fine spatial scale. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the performance of a short-term measurement protocol used at a large number of locations to derive a land use regression (LUR) model of the spatial variation of UFP in Girona, Spain. Methods: We measured UFP for 15 min on the sidewalk of 644 participants' homes in 12 towns of Girona province (Spain). The measurements were done during non-rush traffic hours 9 : 15 - 12 : 45 and 15 : 15 - 16 : 45 during 32 days between June 15 and July 31, 2009. In parallel, we counted the number of vehicles driving in both directions. Measurements were repeated on a different day for a subset of 25 sites in Girona city. Potential predictor variables such as building density, distance to bus lines and land cover were derived using geographic information systems. We adjusted for temporal variation using daily mean NOx concentrations at a central monitor. Land use regression models for the entire area (Core model) and for individual towns were derived using a supervised forward selection algorithm. Results: The best predictors of UFP were traffic intensity, distance to nearest major crossroad, area of high density residential land and household density. The LUR Core model explained 36 % of UFP total variation. Adding sampling date and hour of the day to the Core model increased the R- 2 to 51 % without changing the regression slopes. Local models included predictor variables similar to those in the Core model, but performed better with an R- 2 of 50 % in Girona city. Independent LUR models for the first and second measurements at the subset of sites with repetitions had R- 2 's of about 47 %. When the mean of the two measurements was used R- 2 improved to 72 %. Conclusions: LUR models for UFP were developed, based on a highly cost-effective short-term monitoring campaign at a large number of sites, with fair performance. Complementing the approach with further strategies to address sources of temporal variation of UFP is likely to result in improved models as indicated by the good performance of the model based on the subset of sites with one repeated measurement. Our approach is promising for UFP and possibly for other PM components requiring active sampling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

We also have: The availability on a T 3 -space of a basic sequence of tufted and symmetric <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods is (necessary and) sufficient for metrizability. Hausdorff spaces are paracompact {{if and only if}} open covers have refinements in the form of tufted and symmetric <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods. Moore spaces X are metrizable if (and only if) given any open cover W, there is such a sequence 〈{Un(x) :x∈X}〉 of tufted and symmetric <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods that, for every x∈X, Un(x) ⊂St(x,W) for some n. T 3 -spaces are strongly metrizable if and only if on them there are basic sequences <b>of</b> symmetric, point-finite <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods...|$|R

The UNCITRAL Convention on the <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Receivables in International Trade (“the UNCITRAL Convention”) was adopted in 2001 by the General Assembly. The UNCITRAL Convention was prepared to establish a sophisticated, comprehensive and potentially far-reaching model for the modernisation <b>of</b> domestic <b>assignment</b> laws <b>of</b> countries and a substantive step for harmonisation of the law <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables in international trade. The UNCITRAL Convention not only affects assignment transactions but also securitisation and project financing. The key objective of the UNCITRAL Convention is to facilitate the cross-border flow of credit and to {{lower the cost of}} credit through harmonisation of rules that govern assignments which will lead to greater predictability and certainty in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables contracts. This article deals only with the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> future receivables. In this connection, formal validity <b>of</b> <b>assignments</b> and the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> future receivables under Turkish law and the UNCITRAL Convention is discussed. In that context certain observations and suggestions are made as to the feasibility and usefulness of ratification of the UNCITRAL Convention...|$|R

40|$|Integrated Safety Management (ISM) is {{structured}} {{to manage and}} control work at the activity level. Fundamental to ISM is that all work will be performed safely while meeting the applicable institutional-, facility-, and activity-level expectations. High and medium initial risk activities require certain levels of independent peer and/or Environmental, Health & Safety subject matter expert reviews prior to authorization. A key responsibility of line management and chemical workers is to assign initial risk adequately, so that the proper reviews are obtained. Thus, the effectiveness of an ISM system is largely dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of this initial risk determination. In the following presentation, a Risk Determination Model (RDM) is presented for physical, health and ecological hazards associated with materials. Magnitude <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> (Le., dose or concentration), frequency, duration, and quantity are the four factors most difficult to capture in a research and development setting. They are factored into the determination, {{as a function of}} the quantity of material. Quantity and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> components are simplified by using boundary criteria. This RDM will promote conformity and consistency in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> risk to hazardous material activities. In conclusion, the risk assessors (line manager and chemical worker) should be capable of more accurately assessing the risk <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to a specific chemical with regard to the employee, public, and the environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{general-purpose}} Monte Carlo assignment {{program has}} been developed {{to aid in the}} <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> NMR resonances from proteins. By virtue of its flexible data requirements the program is capable <b>of</b> obtaining <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> both heavily deuterated and fully protonated proteins. A wide variety of source data, such as inter-residue scalar connectivity, inter-residue dipolar (NOE) connectivity, and residue specific information, can be utilized in the assignment process. The program can also use known assignments from one form of a protein to facilitate the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> another form of the protein. This attribute is useful for assigning protein-ligand complexes when the <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> the unliganded protein are known. The program can be also be used as an interactive research tool to assist in the choice of additional experimental data to facilitate completion <b>of</b> <b>assignments.</b> The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a deuterated 45 kDa homodimeric Glutathione-S-transferase illustrates the principal features of the program...|$|R
