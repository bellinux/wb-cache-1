5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding of these events was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to <b>A</b> <b>Vision</b> of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of <b>A</b> <b>Vision</b> of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To {{substantiate}} {{the claim}} that low vision aids reduce the degree of disability associated with visual impairment.  METHODS—An observational study of vision, ocular pathology, age, sex, and reading ability in new referrals to <b>a</b> low <b>vision</b> clinic. Reading ability was assessed both with the patients' own spectacles and with <b>an</b> appropriate low <b>vision</b> aid.  RESULTS—The reading performance and biographical characteristics of new referrals to <b>a</b> low <b>vision</b> clinic were recorded. Data were collected for 168  people over a 6  month period. Upon arrival at the clinic the mean functional visual acuity equated to 6 / 36 and 77 % of patients were unable to read newsprint (N 8). After <b>a</b> low <b>vision</b> assessment and provision of <b>a</b> suitable low <b>vision</b> aid 88 % of new patients were able to read N 8 or smaller text.  CONCLUSIONS—The degree of visual impairment observed in new referrals to <b>a</b> low <b>vision</b> clinic is sufficient to prevent the majority from performing many daily tasks. Low <b>vision</b> aids are <b>an</b> effective means of providing visual rehabilitation, helping almost nine out of 10  patients with impaired vision to read. ...|$|R
