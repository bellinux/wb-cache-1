5|$|The medieval {{church of}} St John was {{demolished}} in 1824 and rebuilt {{on the same}} site, though <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> of the medieval preaching cross survives by the exterior south wall. The former rectory is a 17th-century structure with later additions. Though it remains adjacent to the church, {{it has not been}} a parsonage house {{since the end of the}} 19th century. Today it is known as Glebe House and is divided into flats.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the battle}} {{is one of only}} five battlefields in Norfolk that are {{recognised}} by Norfolk County Council. The battle was commemorated by three mediaeval stone crosses: one is on private land; another (now <b>a</b> <b>stump)</b> was relocated by North Walsham Urban District Council in 1932 and can be found near the roadside by the town's water towers; the third cross was moved and used as a parish boundary marker. It is situated on Toff’s Loke, off Norwich Road.|$|E
5|$|Spencer begins {{experiencing}} visions, again {{seeing the}} Man in the Planet, {{as well as}} the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps upon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.|$|E

5|$|The central item of Oracle of Seasons is the Rod of Seasons. By {{standing}} on <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> and swinging the rod, Link {{can change the}} season and affect his surroundings. For example, to cross a body of water, Link can change the season to winter and walk on the ice. Changing the season to summer causes vines to flourish, which Link can use to scale cliffs. When Link obtains the rod, he initially cannot use it. In {{the course of the}} game, Link visits four towers that house the four spirits of the seasons; each tower Link visits allows him to switch to an additional season.|$|E
5|$|In Lancashire's first innings, King bowled 27 overs {{and took}} 5 wickets for 46 runs. The Philadelphians passed Lancashire's first innings score, but their lead was quickly {{overtaken}} in Lancashire's second innings. With the wind strong over King's left shoulder, {{the scene was}} set for him to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break on day two of the match, he yorked one of Lancashire's opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. He clean bowled two more batsmen in his second over, and bowled <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> {{out of the ground}} in the third. In 3 overs, he had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested in the field. One batsman was run out before King returned to take 4 more wickets, ending the innings with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets.|$|E
5|$|Upon Bradman's dismissal, {{dark clouds}} began {{to close in}} on the ground, and rain {{appeared}} to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the square cut. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.|$|E

500|$|A wicketkeeper {{can assist}} in the {{dismissal}} of a batsman by taking <b>a</b> catch or <b>stumping.</b> <b>A</b> catch taken by the wicketkeeper means the batsman will be ruled out caught, {{although it may be}} referred to as [...] "caught behind". <b>A</b> <b>stumping</b> occurs when the wicketkeeper catches a ball delivered by the bowler (provided it is a legal delivery) and putting down the batsman's wicket while he is out of his ground.|$|R
25|$|Prior to 1980, if the wicket keeper {{took the}} ball {{in front of the}} stumps the umpire would turn down any appeal for <b>a</b> <b>stumping,</b> but would not have called No ball.|$|R
5|$|The large incisor is {{inclined}} forward, and its rootthe {{only part of}} the tooth that is preservedforms an angle of about 55° with the horizontal. At the tip of the alveolus, where the tooth projects out of the bone, it is 3.0mm (0.12 in) high and 2.1mm broad. The root extends through the dentary to a position below the third cheektooth. Only the roots of the first and second cheekteeth are preserved. Both are about 1.5mm in diameter, but the first tooth may have been slightly smaller than the second. The third tooth, the largest of the cheekteeth, has the root slightly curved backward. This root is deeply anchored in the dentary, extending down through about three-fourths of the bone. The crown is preserved in the form of <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> of dentine, 2.3mm (0.091 in) long and 1.9mm (0.075 in) broad, that extends high above the dentary, indicating that the tooth was hypsodont (high-crowned). High dentine stumps also remain of the fourth and fifth cheekteeth. The fourth is about as large as the first and second and the fifth is smaller, with a diameter of about 1.0mm (0.039 in). The fourth cheektooth also has a long, curved root, which extends more than halfway through the dentary, and that of the fifth tooth is even smaller and shorter. The orientation of the roots and teeth indicates that all the teeth were single-rooted.|$|E

25|$|Olson last made {{a public}} {{appearance}} on June 29, 1936, giving <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> speech in Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis. The next day, {{he returned to}} the Mayo Clinic for treatment, but it was too late. He died there on August 22. He was 44 years old.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the striker}} steps {{in front of}} the crease to play the ball, leaving no part of his anatomy or the bat on the ground behind the crease, and the wicket-keeper is able to remove the bails from the wicket with the ball, then the striker is out. <b>A</b> <b>stumping</b> is most likely to be {{effected}} off slow bowling, or (less frequently) medium-paced bowling when the wicketkeeper is standing directly behind the <b>stumps.</b> <b>A</b> <b>stumping</b> is the only method of dismissal, from a wide delivery that the bowler gets credit for on the scoreboard. As wicket-keepers stand several yards back from the stumps to fast bowlers, stumpings are hardly ever effected off fast bowlers. [...] But a keeper may throw down the stumps and the batsman is still out stumped if he is out of his ground, but not attempting a run. [...] Similarly, the ball can bounce off a keeper (but not external non-usual wicketkeeping protective equipment, like a helmet) and break the stumps and still be considered <b>a</b> <b>stumping.</b>|$|R
50|$|Davies' {{second and}} final {{first-class}} appearance came against Oxford University the following season. Davies scored 2 not {{out in the}} only innings in which he batted in the match, and took a catch and <b>a</b> <b>stumping.</b>|$|R

25|$|Or if {{in running}} a notch, the wicket is struck {{down by a}} throw, or with the ball in hand, before his foot, hand, or bat is {{grounded}} over the popping-crease; but if the bail is off, <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> must be struck {{out of the ground}} by the ball.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who saw it}} {{will never}} forget the sight of {{thousands}} of small boys invading the ground when yet another two runs were needed. One youngster managed to get away with <b>a</b> <b>stump,</b> but when he realized the position he restored it, while Simpson waved frantically at the pavilion to have another produced.|$|E
25|$|For a batsman to be {{dismissed}} by being bowled, run out, stumped or hit wicket, his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} the stumps, or <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance. The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> out of the ground in the same manner.|$|E
50|$|Hamidul Islam is a List A cricketer from Bangladesh {{who made}} his debut for Rajshahi Division in the 2006/07 season. A wicket keeper by trade, he took a catch and <b>a</b> <b>stumping</b> against Sylhet Division and contributed 36 with the bat.|$|R

25|$|If a bail {{falls off}} the stumps {{for any other}} reason while the ball is still in play, and a later {{incident}} such as a run out attempt requires the wicket to be broken, then the other bail can be removed (if {{it has not yet}} fallen off), or <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> can be struck out of the cricket ground or pulled up, as described above.|$|E
25|$|Stump {{pyometra}} is {{a serious}} health condition that may occur in female dogs that underwent ovariohysterectomy (spaying), particularly if there is residual functional ovarian tissue. In this condition, the remaining stump of the resected uterus becomes infected and filled with a purulent fluid. The symptoms {{are similar to those}} of true pyometra. The risk of this condition is significantly reduced if no ovarian tissue remains from the original ovariohysterectomy. Diagnosis of <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> pyometra may be challenging as pyometra is often discounted as a possibility if the dog has been previously spayed.|$|E
25|$|Joe Biden's {{campaign}} also {{ended in}} controversy after the Delaware Senator {{was accused of}} plagiarizing a speech by Neil Kinnock, then-leader of the British Labour Party. The Dukakis campaign secretly released a video in which Biden was filmed repeating <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> speech by Kinnock, with only minor modifications. This ultimately led him {{to drop out of}} the race. Dukakis later revealed that his campaign was responsible for leaking the tape, and two members of his staff resigned. The Delaware Supreme Court's Board on Professional Responsibility would later clear Biden of the law school plagiarism charges.|$|E
25|$|While in Auckland, Lowry played club cricket and was {{selected}} to play for Auckland against Wellington in January 1918 as a wicket-keeper. Auckland lost, but Lowry scored 28 and 10 (only one Auckland player scored more) and made two catches and <b>a</b> <b>stumping.</b>|$|R

25|$|From {{the very}} beginning, the park kept and {{exhibited}} animals {{after the first}} park ranger, Henry Avison, captured an orphaned black bear cub and chained it to <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> for safety in 1888. By 1905 several animals had been donated: a monkey, a large seal, four grass parakeets, a raccoon, a canary, and a black bear. Avison was subsequently named city pound keeper, and his collection of animals {{formed the basis for}} the original zoo, which eventually housed over 50 animals, including snakes, wolves, emus, bison, kangaroos, monkeys, and Humboldt penguins.|$|E
25|$|Traveller was a {{horse of}} great stamina and was usually a good horse for {{an officer in}} battle because he was {{difficult}} to frighten. He could sometimes become nervous and spirited, however. At the Second Battle of Bull Run, while General Lee was at the front reconnoitering, dismounted and holding Traveller by the bridle, the horse became frightened at some movement of the enemy and, plunging, pulled Lee down on <b>a</b> <b>stump,</b> breaking both of his hands. Lee went through the remainder of that campaign chiefly in an ambulance. When he rode on horseback, a courier rode in front leading his horse.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test, Cronje scored 70 as South Africa saved the match; {{in the second}} Test, he lasted 335 minutes for his 88. Despite this, they lost by an innings. In the third Test, they scored 517 and {{although}} Mark Taylor carried his bat for 169, Australia needed to bat 109 overs to save the match. Mark Waugh batted 404 minutes, and, despite controversy when Waugh hit one of his bails off (under Law 35 he was adjudged to have finished his stroke and therefore given not out), South Africa fell three wickets short. Cronje put <b>a</b> <b>stump</b> through the umpires` dressing room door after the match and was lucky to avoid a ban.|$|E
