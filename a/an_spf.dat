25|$|In 1962, {{sunscreen}} commenced to be SPF rated, although SPF labeling in the US was not standardised by the FDA until 1978. In 1971, Mattel introduced Malibu Barbie, {{which had}} tanned skin, sunglasses, and her very own bottle of sun tanning lotion. In 1978, both sunscreen with <b>an</b> <b>SPF</b> 15 rating {{as well as}} tanning beds first appeared. In 2007, there were an estimated 50,000 outlets for indoor tanning; it was a five-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and had spawned an auxiliary industry for indoor tanning lotions including bronzers, intensifiers, and accelerators. Since then, the indoor tanning industry has become more constrained by health regulations. In China, darker skin is still {{considered by many to}} be the mark of the lower classes. As recently as 2012, in some parts of China, ski masks were becoming popular items to wear at the beach in order to protect the wearer's face from the effects of the sun.|$|E

" We begin by reviewing the use of variance components in the estimation of reliability from a ran-domized block (RB) design. Then we extend this rationale to the es-timation of reliability (or generalizability) coefficients in <b>a</b> split-plot factorial (<b>SPF)</b> design with persons nested within schools. Through the use of variance components from the SPF design, we derive estimates of reliability for schools and for persons within schools. Then we compare the reliability for persons within schools from <b>a</b> <b>SPF</b> design with the reliability for persons from a RB design. Finally, we compare the reliability for schools from <b>a</b> <b>SPF</b> design with the reliability for school means from a RB design...|$|R

Methods: This was a cross sectional study carried out in specialized epilepsy weekly outdoor clinic of Neurology and Medicine outpatient department (OPD) of Dhaka Medical College Hospital from January 2008 to July 2011. Epilepsy syndromes were broadly classified into four categories using the classification system of International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) namely, generalized epilepsy (GE), localization related epilepsy (LRE), symptomatic and unclassified.

50|$|Owing to {{consumer}} confusion over the real degree {{and duration of}} protection offered, labeling restrictions are enforced in several countries.

In its 2007 and 2011 draft rules, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a maximum SPF label of 50, to limit unrealistic claims. (As of February 2017, the FDA has not adopted the SPF 50 limit.)

5000|$|Bellovin's strongest {{concerns}} {{involve the}} underlying assumptions of SPF (its [...] "semantic model"). When using SPF, the SPF DNS records determine how a sender {{is allowed to}} send, meaning that {{the owner of the}} domain will control how senders are allowed to send.

Organizations providing these [...] "portable" [...] addresses could, however, create their own mail submission agents (MSAs) (RFC 6409) or offer VPNs or simply not publish <b>an</b> <b>SPF</b> record.

5000|$|The IP {{address of}} the sending MTA is {{guaranteed}} to be valid by the Transmission Control Protocol, as it establishes the connection by checking that the remote host is reachable.

The SPF verifier queries the Domain Name System (DNS) for <b>an</b> <b>SPF</b> record labelled with that name. An SPF-compliant ADMD should publish that record beforehand, declaring which IP addresses are, or are not, authorized to use the domain name on the label. The verifier then finds the record's directive that matches the IP {{address of the}} sending MTA, and returns the associated result.

5000|$|The sun {{protection}} factor (SPF rating, introduced in 1974) {{is a measure}} of the fraction of sunburn-producing UV rays that reach the skin. For example, [...] "SPF 15" [...] means that 1/15th of the burning radiation will reach the skin, assuming sunscreen is applied evenly at a thick dosage of 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm2). A user can determine the effectiveness of a sunscreen [...] "by multiplying the SPF factor by the length of time it takes for him or her to suffer a burn without sunscreen." [...] Thus, if a person develops a sunburn in 10 minutes when not wearing a sunscreen, the same person in the same intensity of sunlight will avoid sunburn for 150 minutes if wearing a sunscreen with <b>an</b> <b>SPF</b> of 15. It is important to note that sunscreens with higher SPF do not last or remain effective on the skin any longer than lower SPF and must be continually reapplied as directed, usually every two hours.|$|E
40|$|Observations {{since the}} 1950 s show a multi-decadal cycle of a meridional {{displacement}} of the Subpolar Front (SPF) in the Newfoundland Basin (NFB) in the North Atlantic. The SPF displacement is associated with corresponding variations {{in the path of}} the North Atlantic Current. We use the ocean general circulation model MPIOM with enhanced horizontal and vertical resolutions and forced with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data to study the relation of the SPF displacement to atmospheric forcing, intensities of the subpolar gyre (SPG) and Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), and Labrador Sea Water (LSW) volume. The simulations indicate that the SPF displacement is associated with a circulation anomaly between the SPG and the subtropical gyre (STG), an inter-gyre gyre with a multi-decadal time scale. A sensitivity experiment indicates that both wind stress curl (WSC) and heat fluxes (which match LSW changes) contribute to the circulation anomalies in the frontal region and to the SPF displacement. An anticyclonic inter-gyre gyre is related to negative WSC and LSW anomalies and to <b>a</b> <b>SPF</b> north of its climatological position, indicating an expanding STG. A cyclonic inter-gyre gyre is related to positive WSC and LSW anomalies and <b>a</b> <b>SPF</b> south of its climatological position, indicating an expanding SPG. Therefore, the mean latitudinal position of the SPF in the NFB (a "SPF index") could be an indicator of the amount of LSW in the inter-gyre region. Spreading of LSW anomalies intensifies the MOC, suggesting our SPF index as predictor of the MOC intensity at multi-decadal time scales.
