The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared {{just as soon as}} they came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as the wife of a prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E
5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as a bastion of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of discipline in the blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E

25|$|Popular belief {{asserts that}} {{individuals}} of either sex {{who are not}} in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship.

He says, furthermore, that the original name of the city was Pirisvalle, so-called by its early pagan inhabitants. He also writes there that he found written in the ancient annals of Spanish history collected by the kings of Spain that the 50,000 Jewish households then residing in the cities throughout Spain were the descendants of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> sent to Spain by the Roman Emperor and who had formerly been subjected to him and whom Titus had originally exiled from places in or around Jerusalem.

25|$|Jefferson {{conducted}} annual {{visits to}} Poplar Forest beginning in 1810 and ending in 1823; he designed Poplar Forest as his retreat from his larger estate at Monticello. The retreat house {{was completed in}} 1816 and his visits ranged from {{a few days to}} weeklong stays. He frequently brought his granddaughters Ellen and Cornelia Randolph to the house after it was completed in 1816, and always traveled to Poplar Forest with a small cadre of enslaved men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> based at Monticello. Jefferson maintained sole ownership of the property and the slaves until 1790, when he gave 1,000 acres and six slave families to his daughter Martha and her husband Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. Randolph would later divide and sell the rest of Jefferson’s landholdings; he also sold many of Jefferson’s slaves to repay debts.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso {{created a}} Web-based Social Security {{benefits}} calculator. The calculator {{does not include}} the value or cost of the Social Security disability program. Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations about Social Security benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.|$|E
25|$|Jersey Shore's {{location}} on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream {{from the mouth of}} Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the western most portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to the men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel, no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal.|$|E
