5|$|At the 1963 World Championships in Stockholm, the Soviet Union won {{the gold}} medal, {{beginning}} a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds. The 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria {{marked the first time}} that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks. The procedure had been changed to count all games <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> the Canadians finished fourth. However, the Olympics also counted as the World Championships, and under IIHF rules, Canada should have won a bronze. In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal. However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, {{it would be a}} repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Al-Talaba {{finished}} in sixth place with 31 points, having won eight matches, drawn seven and lost seven. They reached {{the final of}} the 1995 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, coming up against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya for the fourth time in a row in this competition, and Al-Talaba won with a single goal scored by Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail, achieving their third Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup success. After Al-Zawra'a achieved a double in the 1993–94 season, the Iraq FA chose the FA Cup runners-up, Al-Talaba, as Iraq's representative in the 1995 Asian Cup Winners' Cup. Under the management of Ayoub Odisho, they defeated Al-Gharafa in the first leg in Doha 5–3 and lost in the second leg 1–0 at the Al-Shaab Stadium. In the second round, they came up against Yangiyer and lost 2–1 in Tashkent before they turned it around to win 2–0 in Baghdad with goals from Muhannad Mohammed and Qahtan Chathir. In the quarter-finals, Al-Talaba won their first leg against Bahman in Tehran 1–0 with a goal by Sabah Jeayer. At the Al-Shaab Stadium, Bahman won 1–0 for a 1–1 draw on aggregate. The match went to a golden goal decider which was scored by Chathir. Al-Talaba had now qualified for the semi-finals where they were drawn to meet Kazma SC of Kuwait but Kazma withdrew from the tournament, refusing to play against Al-Talaba because of political tensions between Iraq and other Persian Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, {{in the aftermath of the}} 1991 Gulf War. The AFC directed Al-Talaba to play against Al-Riyadh of Saudi-Arabia but they too withdrew for the same reason, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> Al-Talaba had a walkover through the semi-finals. In the final, Al-Talaba faced Bellmare Hiratsuka in Kanagawa where they were beaten 2–1 after the winning goal was scored in the 81st minute by Hidetoshi Nakata.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of August 1 the London Irish moved to a lying-up area in the wadis below the foothills of Centuripe. No {{transport}} {{was able to get}} forward <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> that all ammunition, food, and other supplies had to be man-handled causing a delay.|$|E
25|$|The ATA trained its pilots only {{to ferry}} planes, {{rather than to}} achieve {{perfection}} on every type. For example, aerobatics and blind flying were not taught, and pilots were explicitly forbidden to do either, {{even if they were}} capable of doing so. The objective of the ATA was to deliver aircraft safely <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> taking no unnecessary risks.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the R came {{expansion}} into the hills of Pennsylvania, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> heavier and more powerful engines. In 1881, five Consolidation 2-8-0s were added to the roster, with another fifteen early in 1882. In 1883, another fifteen were acquired, along with four more 4-4-0s. The next type procured was the 0-6-0 switcher, as well as more Consolidations. By 1884, the R was operating 60 engines, and this represented the extent of the R's locomotive inventory.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E
25|$|Following the Twenty20 Cup, Kent {{still had}} not shook their losing habit, {{although}} losing the toss against Sussex probably {{had something to do}} with their 66-run loss - they were forced to bat in poorer conditions. A loss in the C Trophy quarter-finals followed, not all that surprising given Kent's one-day form, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> Kent's only realistic chances of winning anything this season were in the County Championship, and after giving up 457 runs in the first innings against Surrey that looked difficult. However, they chased 232 in 35 evening overs to take 21 points and retain the lead in the Championship. In a National League match shortened to 16 overs due to rain, Kent lost to Somerset by eight wickets, and they also lost to Warwickshire in a midweek match in the National League, but beat Yorkshire in their last match of July, also a one-day game.|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Chris Hunt, {{in the weeks}} after writing the song, McCartney [...] "test his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> everyone." [...] On 30 June, after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band's rendition of his instrumental [...] "Thingumybob", in Yorkshire, McCartney stopped at a village in Bedfordshire and performed [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at a local pub. He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single [...] "I'm the Urban Spaceman", in London, and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same. Ron Griffith of the group the Iveys – soon to be known as Badfinger and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band, an early signing to the Beatles' new record label Apple Records – later recalled that on their first day in the studio, McCartney [...] "gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey Jude'".|$|E

500|$|The Manchester United club shop has had six {{different}} locations {{since it was}} first opened. Originally, the shop was a small hut near to the railway line that runs alongside the ground. The shop was then moved {{along the length of}} the South Stand, stopping first opposite where away fans enter the ground, and then residing in the building that would later become the club's merchandising office. A surge in the club's popularity in the early 1990s led to another move, this time to the forecourt of the West Stand. With this move came a great expansion and the conversion from a small shop to a [...] "megastore". Alex Ferguson opened the new megastore on 3 December 1994. The most recent moves came in the late 1990s, as the West Stand required room to expand to a second tier, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> the demolition of the megastore. The store was moved to a temporary site opposite the East Stand, before taking up a [...] permanent residence in the ground floor of the expanded East Stand in 2000. The floor space of the megastore was owned by United's kit sponsors, Nike, who operated the store until the expiry of their sponsorship deal at the end of July 2015, when ownership reverted to the club.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was {{directed}} by the American photographer Herb Ritts, and shot at Key Biscayne in Miami, Florida {{in the last week}} of January 2001. Spears revealed she was inspired by Janet Jackson's video for [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)"(1990) to select Ritts as the video's director. According to Ritts, the singer [...] "wanted to do something fresh. There was one outfit, no dancing, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> that it boiled down to her. She really had to act the song, and she was very impressive." [...] He also revealed that the video was set at [...] "a funky beach shack" [...] similar to the videos for Madonna's [...] "Cherish" [...] (1989) and Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game" [...] (1989). [...] "The story is, pretty much, Britney longing for him to tell her the words", said Ritts, who was impressed with the chemistry between the singer and her fictional boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. Spears' real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, [...] "was said to be miffed at Spears' kissing scenes with French model," [...] according to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV. Spears mother, Lynne, also criticized considered the original music video for being too racy at the time, because it contained sexually explicit material. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 1621, {{the only}} oath taken {{was that of}} {{obedience}} {{to the rules of}} the conclave in force at that time, when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked, and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote. Gregory XV added the additional oath, taken when each cardinal casts his ballot, to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting [...] "courtesy votes" [...] and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three. Speed in electing a pope was important, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the serious business of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates. The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step-by-step procedure used in choosing a pope; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis. The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed voting procedure of scrutiny making use of anonymous oaths. This was perhaps the most significant change in the modern era. It was a significant change to the step-by-step voting procedure, since that detailed voting procedure was first created in 1621. It was Pius XII who made this change in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|Reception to the remix {{album was}} {{generally}} mixed. On Metacritic, the album holds an aggregate score of 59/100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Heather Phares of AllMusic believed that Tron: Legacy Reconfigured {{was made in}} response to the perceived lack of [...] "dancefloor movers" [...] in the original score <b>and</b> noted <b>that,</b> [...] "While the acts involved don't offer many surprises, they do what they do well". A Consequence of Sound review also felt that the record was a more accessible version of the film soundtrack: [...] "Listening to the album straight through feels more like an eclectic concert than a compilation, <b>and</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>meant</b> as a compliment." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Lynngård took up this position, it {{was noted}} that the head of the Church City Mission {{traditionally}} remains in the job for 17 years, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> this <b>meant</b> Lynngård might hold it until he reached retirement age.|$|R

500|$|The Rhodesians {{were then}} summoned {{back out into}} the main lounge, where Kissinger insisted that their prime {{minister}} sit next to him. [...] "Ian Smith made accepting the deal worse by acting like a gentleman," [...] the American later said. Vorster opened the discussion by announcing that he had applied no pressure to the Rhodesian delegates, which caused further consternation amongst the Rhodesians which they had difficulty suppressing. It was agreed that the Rhodesians should return to Salisbury and consult their cabinet, then announce their answer. Despite expressing [...] "incredulity" [...] at what had happened in Pretoria, and showing deep reluctance, the politicians in Salisbury resolved that despite what they perceived as [...] "South African treachery" [...] the responsible course of action could only be to go on with the peace process, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> accepting Kissinger's terms, which they agreed were better than any they could get in the future should they refuse. Smith announced his government's answer on the evening of 24 September 1976: [...] "Yes." [...] South Africa's wavering financial and military assistance suddenly became available again, but the Frontline States then abruptly changed tact and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any interim period before majority rule was unacceptable. A new constitutional conference in Geneva, Switzerland was hastily organised by Britain to try to salvage something from the wreckage, with 20 October 1976 set as the start date.|$|E
2500|$|By {{middle of}} June, {{with the last}} German stronghold near the beaches taken, the Allied stronghold in turn was secure in every way.

Allied air forces, {{particularly}} the Typhoons dominating the sky could also break German troop concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1738 there was the great plague. The Count Mersy wanted to turn marshes into fertile soil {{and he began to}} {{regulate}} the Begej River. In the middle and down course of the river a long canal was built, to make the river traffic possible between Bečkerek and Timișoara. On the first of November 1745 Sebastian Krazeisen began to make beer in the first brewery <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> the first start of the industrialization. In the same year the first Serb’s school was mentioned.|$|E
500|$|Systems of {{morality}} in Feri revolved largely around {{the idea of}} kala; Cora stated that this term was borrowed from the Hawaiian language <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it <b>meant</b> [...] "keep oneself clean and bright and free from complexes within and without".|$|R

2500|$|Following {{the failed}} effort {{to record a}} new studio album, the Police {{effectively}} disbanded. In the liner notes to the Police's box set Message in a Box, Summers explains: [...] "The attempt to record a new album was doomed from the outset. The night before {{we went into the}} studio Stewart broke his collarbone falling off a horse <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> we lost our last chance of recovering some rapport just by jamming together. Anyway, it was clear Sting had no real intention of writing any new songs for the Police. It was an empty exercise." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{asked why}} the Tannaim felt that the {{allocation}} of the Land of Israel [...] "according to {{the names of the}} tribes of their fathers" [...] in [...] meant that the allocation was with reference to those who left Egypt; perhaps, the Gemara supposed, it might have meant the 12 tribes and that the Land was to be divided into 12 equal portions? The Gemara noted that in [...] God told Moses to tell the Israelites who were about to leave Egypt, [...] "And I will give it you for a heritage; I am the Lord," [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> that the Land was the inheritance from the fathers of those who left Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|Slave {{labor was}} applied in {{industry}} {{in a limited}} way in the Upper South {{and in a few}} port cities. One reason for the regional lag in industrial development was top-heavy income distribution. Mass production requires mass markets, and slaves living in small cabins, using self-made tools and outfitted with one suit of work clothes each year of inferior fabric, did not generate consumer demand to sustain local manufactures of any description in the same way a mechanized family farm of free labor did in the North. The Southern economy was [...] "pre-capitalist" [...] in that slaves were put to work in the largest revenue-producing enterprises, not free labor market. That labor system as practiced in the American South encompassed paternalism, whether abusive or indulgent, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> labor management considerations apart from productivity.|$|E

5000|$|The three founders {{believed}} that a local symphony orchestra {{would have to be}} truly professional to prosper <b>and</b> grow. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> members would have to attend every rehearsal as well as concerts and to be paid for their services.
