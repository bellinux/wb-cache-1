5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive.

The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region <b>and</b> <b>season</b> to season, which can further confuse the issue.
