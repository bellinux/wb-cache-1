40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> and <b>Acoustic</b> Silence are {{determinants}} of tranquility in a worship space. The results presented here {{are part of}} a study that investigates the behaviour of acoustically constituted worship parameters in six Catholic churches (Goa, India). <b>Acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> is quantified through an <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> which measures the net comfort induced through the optimization of the desired subjective acoustic impressions for different types of music and different music sources. Silence Factor is constituted through the normalization of equivalent noise level (LAeq) and the subjective acoustic impressions of background noise and echoes. Regression analyses of the derived acoustic parameters generate significant results. Acoustically, the Silence Factor quadratically decays with LAeq and the <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> is predicted as a multiregression on the subjective acoustic impressions of balance and clarity. Architecturally, the Silence Factor linearly grows with the width of the nave (of the church) whereas, the <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> does not significantly relate with any of the tested architectural parameters. Silence Factor was found to linearly grow with <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> in a church. The predictability of <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> and <b>acoustic</b> silence from acoustic and architectural measures can be developed into a design tool for the prediction of a tranquility factor in worship spaces. ...|$|R

40|$|The human whistle is a {{representation}} of the human vocal singing. Singing (solo and congregational) is an essential component of sacred music for collective worship in a Catholic church. The acoustic characterization of sacred music is defined in this paper through a derived <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> (ACII) and several Acoustic Worship Indices (AWI), namely, Subjective Sacred Factor (SSaF), Subjective Intelligibility Factor (SInF) and Subjective Si-lence Factor (SSiF). In this study, live sacred music rendered by the human whistle is compared with that by the cello, clarinet, violins and the ensemble, in the Catholic church of the Divine Providence (Goa, India). Among the signifi-cant results, ACII for the human whistle was found to be better than ACII for the musical instruments (F = 2. 38, p = 0. 08); this difference was more significant at the nave of the church (music source) (F = 2. 94, p = 0. 04) and lower at the choir loft (music source) (p = 0. 21). SInF for the ensemble music was found better than SInF for human whistle (F = 3. 07, p = 0. 03). At the nave of the church, the SInF was found better than SSaF and SSiF (F = 4. 17, p = 0. 02).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that human evaluation of subjective loudness and <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> depends on a series of factors in a particular situation rather than only on sound pressure levels.

On-site measurements were performed at a case study site in Harbin, China, and an <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> survey was simultaneously conducted. In terms of effect of sound activities on human behaviours, music-related activities caused 5. 1 – 21. 5 % of persons who pass by the area to stand and watch the activity, while there was a little effect on the number of persons who performed excises during the activity. Human activities generally have little effect on the behaviour of pedestrians when only 1 to 3 persons are involved in the activities, while a deep effect on the behaviour of pedestrians is noted when > 6 persons are involved in the activities.

However, good soundscape quality in parks cannot be provided without a thorough understanding of the complex relationships among sound, environment, and individuals. As <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> is considered to be an important outcome of soundscape quality, this study investigates the relative impacts of the factors influencing <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> evaluation by formulating a multivariate ordered logit model. This study also explores the inter-relationships among <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> evaluation, acceptability of the environment, and preference to stay in a park using a path model. A total of 595 valid responses were obtained from interview surveys administered in four parks in Hong Kong while objective sound measurements were carried out at the survey spots concurrently. The findings unveil that <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> evaluation, besides visual comfort evaluation of landscape, also plays an important role on users’ acceptability of the urban park environment. Compared with all the studied acoustic related factors, <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> evaluation serves as a better proxy for park users’ preference to stay in urban parks.

Based on objective and subjective measurements of a typical temporary open-air market in Harbin city, China, the effects of the temporary open-air market on the sound {{environment and}} acoustic perception were studied, considering different crowd densities. It was observed that a temporary open-air market without zoning increases the sound pressure level and subjective loudness by 2. 4 dBA and 0. 21 dBA, respectively, compared to the absence of a temporary market. Different from the sound pressure level and subjective loudness, the relationship between crowd density and the perceived <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> is parabolic. Regarding the effect of a temporary open-air market with different zones on the sound environment and acoustic perception, when the crowd densities were the same, subjective loudness in the fruit and vegetable sales area was always higher than in the food sales area and the clothing sales area. In terms of <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort,</b> with an increase in crowd density, <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> in the fruit and vegetable sales area decreased, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> in the food sales area and the clothing sales area exhibited a parabolic change trend of increase followed by decrease.

Meanwhile, evaluation of <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> evaluation is influenced by income, education level, and occupation, with correlation coefficients or contingency coefficients of 0. 10 to 0. 60 (p< 0. 05 or p< 0. 01). The effect of gender and age on evaluation of subjective loudness and <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> is statistically insignificant. The effects of occupation are mainly caused by the differences in income and education level, in which the effects of income are greater than that of education level. In terms of behavioural characteristics, evaluation of subjective loudness is influenced by the reason for visit, frequency of visit, and length of stay, with correlation coefficients or contingency coefficients of 0. 10 to 0. 40 (p< 0. 05 or p< 0. 01).

Applying the concept of route-based tourism to guide tourists rambling along cultural and heritage routes can relieve overcrowded condition at hot scenic spots and increase the overall carrying capacity of the city.

Active control systems can offer an effective solution {{in order to maintain}} a high <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> level and are compliant with lightweight aircraft design, as they could complement or even partially replace the weighty and bulky passive damping concepts currently used. Active control systems however traditionally aim at the reduction of the vibration level of a structure or the minimization of the sound pressure level in a given space.
