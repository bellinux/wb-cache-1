25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{may cause}} visual {{hallucinations}} is prolonged visual deprivation. In a study where 13 healthy people were blindfolded for 5 days, 10 {{out of the}} 13 subjects reported visual hallucinations. This finding lends strong support {{to the idea that}} the simple loss of normal visual input is sufficient to cause visual hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|One of the fair's major crowd-attracting and {{financial}} shortcomings was {{the absence of}} a midway. The fair's organizers were opposed, on principle, to the honky-tonk atmosphere engendered by midways, and this was <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> irked the BIE, which insisted that all officially sanctioned fairs have a midway. What amusements the fair actually had ended up being largely dull. The Meadow Lake Amusement Area was not easily accessible, and officials objected to shows being advertised.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} recently showed a value {{in social and}} political movements. In the Egyptian revolution, Facebook and Twitter both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt. Egyptian activists have credited social networking sites with providing a platform for planning protest and sharing news from Tahrir Square in real time. By presenting a platform for thousands of people to instantaneously share videos of mainly events featuring brutality, social networking can be a vital tool in revolutions. On the flip side, social networks enable government authorities to easily identify, and repress, protestors and dissidents. <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> social media helps with in political applications is getting the younger generations involved in politics and ongoing political issues.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> breathtaking {{about this}} book {{is the amount of}} new stories and new information. Scott {{describes}} in detail and with named sources, basically, a two or three-year run of the American government undercutting the inspection process. In your view, during those years, '91 to'98, particularly the last three years, was the United States interested in disarming Iraq? ...|$|R

25|$|The main {{consideration}} with SIMS is {{ensuring that}} the sample is stable under ultra-high vacuum, or pressures less than 10−8 torr. The nature of the ultra-high vacuum is that it ensures the sample remains constant during analysis as well as ensuring the high energy ion beam strikes the sample. Ultra-high vacuum solves {{many of the problems}} that need to be considered during sample preparation. When preparing the sample for analysis, <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> should be considered is the thickness of the film. Typically, if a thin monolayer can be deposited onto the surface of a noble metal, analysis should be successful. If the film thickness is too large, which is common in real world analysis, the problem can be solved by methods such as depositing a perforated silver foil over a nickel grid onto the film surface. This yields similar results to thin films deposited directly onto a noble metal.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
500|$|My God, that gravy is horrible! They buy {{tap water}} for 15-20 cents a {{thousand}} gallons {{and then they}} mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste ...

50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> was <b>that</b> after a {{long period}} like 15 years later RAVAN DAHAN has been started with {{cooperation}} of villagers although whole village not interested for that but it was new initiative for village.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> proper credit {{should be}} given where credit is due; {{if any of the}} {{conclusions}} derived by the forensic entomologist were seconded by another professional, that person’s name and qualifications should be presented as well.|$|R
5000|$|Why do {{the forms}} and {{patterns}} of these real substances change? Because they are in motion. Change and motion are not semblance and are truly real. Does the movement come from within each <b>thing?</b> Is there <b>another</b> external <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> moves each object? ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{makes it}} {{resemble}} our earlier records, especially our first record, is that it's really personal. A couple {{of us have}} gone through some pretty serious life changes. We had {{a good friend of}} ours pass away since the last record. There's a song on the record, [...] "Dorothy", that was really influenced by the film Blue Velvet but it's a metaphor for someone and something else. Everything on the record is stuff that definitely hits close to home for us and we tried to communicate that in the songs.|$|E
2500|$|The U-Bahn network {{comprises}} three lines, covering about [...] {{of network}} route of which [...] is operational route. The network serves 46 stations which {{can all be}} reached by lift, something that makes the system unique in Germany. <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes this system special {{is the use of}} [...] "firm track" [...] (i.e. with rails fastened to a solid trackbed, rather than to sleepers on ballast) in almost all tunnels, although not at Langwasser Mitte (U1) and the adjoining tunnel up to just before Gemeinschaftshaus. Also, ballast is still found, but only on the inbound track, at the entrance to Schoppershof station (U2).|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E

2500|$|William York of AllMusic wrote, [...] "the tracks {{here could}} best be {{described}} as miniature audio movies." [...] Christian Renner of Metal Crypt praised the album as being [...] "overall another excellent album worthy of extremely high praise and what would be a masterpiece for most bands turns out to be just another great album from the genius that is Opeth." [...] Jim Raggi of Lamentations of the Flame Princess said that [...] "this is still the most perfect album ever recorded." [...] He also stated [...] "the more personal nature of the lyrics on Morningrise are <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> make it a much more intense listen than the stories that would follow. It's incredible how everything changed after this album. The lineup, the style, the lyrics... Opeth has never released less than an excellent album. But they have only released one perfect album." [...] Drew Schinzel of Chronicles of Chaos said that the songs are [...] "melodic and well played, with great vocals and the occasional guitar solo". However, he also commented, [...] "maybe I'm just not in touch with my inner-acoustic-child, but the acoustic sections are too numerous, and get old fast." ...|$|E

It's how the stuff we like was recorded". Series writer Jay Lender said, [...] "The recording sessions were always fun ..." [...] For the first three seasons, Hillenburg and Drymon sat in on the record studio, and they directed the actors. Andrea Romano became the voice director in the fourth season, and Tom Kenny took over the role during the ninth. Wednesday is recording day, the same schedule followed by the crew since 1999. Casting supervisor Jennie Monica Hammond said, [...] "I loved Wednesdays".|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{seemed to}} me that I had {{happened}} upon humanity upon the wane. The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more and more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature had followed <b>another.</b> <b>Things</b> <b>that</b> are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward.

50|$|<b>Another</b> major <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{influenced}} Oceanian {{society was}} its intricate oral tradition. For a long time, most Oceanian literature was not written down.
