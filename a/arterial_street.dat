5|$|Marysville {{is located}} {{along the east}} side of Interstate 5 (I-5), which connects the city to Vancouver, British Columbia to the north and Seattle to the south. The freeway has four exits serving Marysville, located at 4th Street in Downtown, 88th Street NE near Quil Ceda Village, 116th Street NE near Kruse Junction, and 172nd Street NE near Smokey Point. Several state {{highways}} also run within Marysville city limits, including State Route 9, State Route 528 (4th Street and 64th Street), State Route 529 (State Avenue), and State Route 531 (172nd Street NE). The city's primary north–south <b>arterial</b> <b>street,</b> State Avenue, was formerly part of U.S. Route 99 and has been widened and improved in segments since 2000. Other major streets include 51st Avenue NE, 67th Avenue NE, Grove Street, and Sunnyside Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|SR522, named Lake City Way within Seattle city limits, {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, {{and includes a}} connection to the freeway's reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane <b>arterial</b> <b>street</b> before turning north on its approach to Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR522 intersects SR523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.|$|E

2500|$|The {{city has}} an {{extensive}} <b>street</b> grid. [...] <b>Arterial</b> <b>streets</b> (referred to as surface streets by locals, {{in contrast with}} freeways which are usually grade-separated roadways) connect freeways with smaller neighborhood streets, and are often used to bypass congested freeway routes. [...] Consequently, most of the surface <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> in Los Angeles have various forms of congestion control.|$|R

Berkeley maintains a separate grid of <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> for bicycles, called Bicycle Boulevards, with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel.|$|R
25|$|In Niagara Falls, NY384 {{originally}} {{broke from}} Buffalo Avenue at 10th Street to follow Erie Avenue and Falls, Main, and Niagara Streets to the Niagara River, where it {{connected to the}} Honeymoon Bridge (replaced by the Rainbow Bridge in 1941) leading to Niagara Falls, Ontario. NY384 was truncated by 1938 to the junction of Main and Niagara Streets following the assignment of U.S. Route104, which followed Niagara Street to the bridge instead. In the 1970s, construction of the Niagara Falls Convention Center—which was built at the junction of Falls Street and Erie Avenue—severed NY384's routing through the city. As a result, NY384 was rerouted west of Quay Street (an <b>arterial</b> <b>street</b> connecting to the Robert Moses State Parkway) to follow Rainbow Boulevard through the southwestern portion {{of the city to}} NY104 (Main Street).|$|E

30|$|The {{road network}} in PARAMICS was coded {{according}} to the road geometrics, including the junctions, roundabouts, and flyovers. The type of links for expressways and <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> were specifically designed and provided in the “category” file, where details about number of lanes and speed limits were defined. The speed limit for expressways was standardised at 85 km/h and for <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> at 55 km/h, given that PARAMICS models simulate the average travelling speed at 10 km/h higher than the defined values.|$|R
40|$|Micro-simulation {{models are}} widely and {{successfully}} {{used to estimate}} travel time on <b>arterial</b> <b>streets.</b> But micro-simulation of a large-scale traffic network is difficult to conduct because of the following three reasons: 1) limited computer power, 2) complicated network input data and 3) long model building, debugging, and validating time. In contrast, link performance functions such as the BPR function needs less detail input data. Input data of BPR functions like volume and link capacity are easy to obtain. Therefore, BPR functions are still widely used to estimate travel time on <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> for planning purposes. However, it is also well known that BPR functions generate erroneous estimation of travel times on <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> especially under congested traffic conditions. This paper introduces a new algorithm for travel time estimation on <b>arterial</b> <b>streets.</b> Vehicles are grouped into packets/vehicle observed group in the algorithm. Link travel time and intersection control delay of each packet / vehicle observed group are estimated by the developed algorithm. The developed algorithm is a modified HCM 2000 method which requires less network input data and computer power compared with micro-simulation. It provides better travel time estimation during short time interval updates on signalized <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> compared with BPR functions. This algorithm has been developed and has been validated by using actual data collected in the field {{as well as the}} developed algorithms in HCM 2000. In other words, this algorithm can overcome the weaknesses of Micro-simulation and BPR functions. It can be an alternative for large-scale traffic network application...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Traffic volumes and {{congestion}} {{across the}} state of Utah and the throughout the nation continue to increase as cities feel {{the effects of a}} growing population. A large portion of the growth that is occurring has a direct impact on <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> placing greater emphasis on implementing access management principles and techniques to help alleviate safety concerns associated with access to these streets. As traffic volumes grow there comes the need to identify ways in which safety on the <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> can be improved. One such methodology is the installation of raised medians. To evaluate the impacts of the installation of raised medians on <b>arterial</b> <b>streets,</b> the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) in conjunction with a research team at Brigham Young University (BYU) performed a safety evaluation on <b>arterial</b> <b>streets</b> in which raised medians had been installed. This evaluation utilized a geographic information system (GIS) enabled web delivered data almanac that allowed researchers the opportunity to establish filters to sort crash data, identify high crash locations, and evaluate crash trends. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize the safety impacts of raised median installation by investigating crash data at one of several corridors {{across the state}} of Utah where raised medians have been implemented. The results of this paper are expected to provide direction and guidance to engineers and planners on the safety benefits of access management techniques specific to the state of Utah...|$|R
