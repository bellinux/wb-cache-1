50|$|The young entrepreneursâ€™ {{talent was}} proven with the {{founding}} of the <b>audio</b> download <b>portal</b> Akuma in 2006. Instead of DRM protection, audio watermarks for each downloaded song were used. With more than a million page views it advanced {{to one of the most}} frequently clicked music offerings on the net. In 2010 Akuma was sold to a Berlin based web agency, focussing on Netzwelt as the core platform for the company behind it. 2012, Akuma is still at the same level as in 2010, which means it has since effectively ended its service.|$|R

This paper reports on an active role played by students in the Digital Communication degree of Unimi, to develop e-learning supports both in their university curriculum and in the High-Schools. Creating and maintaining portal websites, forums, LO to be exchanged, and more recently an interactive <b>audio</b> and video <b>portal</b> accessible on mobile and on PC, become learning by doing vehicles to teach new digital technologies and to supplement traditional time & location bounded teaching in classroom. Explanations become available through videos uploaded to our UnimiTube server in the LCAD Research Laboratory, teaching support is implemented by a community effort involving teachers as well...|$|R
40|$|Tremendous {{research}} {{effort was}} invested in audio browsers and machine learning techniques to decode {{the structure of}} Web pages {{in order to put}} them into an audio format. In this paper, we address a simpler and efficient solution for the creation of an audio browser of VOICEXML generated from RSS/Atom stream feeds. We developed a multimodal (<b>audio</b> and graphical) <b>portal</b> application that offers RSS/Atom feeds. By utilizing sing our system, the user can interact using voice or graphic commands, listen and watch digital content, such as news, blogs feeds, podcasts, and even access email and personal schedules. The portal system permits the use of security credentials (user/password authentication) to collect secure RSS/Atom stream in the multimodal browser to connect the user to specific personal services. A series experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RSS reader and navigator. Our system is extremely beneficial {{for a wide range of}} applications, from interfaces for the visual impaired users to browsers for mobile telephonic interfaces...|$|R
