40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of the work of}} adhesion is of significant technical interest in a variety of applications, ranging from a basic understanding of material behavior to the practical aspects associated with making strong, durable adhesive bonds. The objective of this thesis is to investigate a novel technique using an elastica loop to measure the work of adhesion between solid materials. Considering the range and resolution of the measured parameters, a specially designed apparatus with a precise displacement control system, an analytical balance, an optical system, and a computer control and data acquisition interface is constructed. An elastica loop made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) [PDMS] is attached directly to a stepper motor in the apparatus. To perform the measurement, the loop is brought into contact with various substrates as controlled by the computer interface, and information including the contact patterns, contact lengths, and contact forces is obtained. Experimental results indicate that due to <b>anticlastic</b> bending, the contact first occurs {{at the edges of the}} loop, and then spreads across the width as the displacement continues to increase. The patterns observed show that the loop is eventually flattened in the contact region and the effect of <b>anticlastic</b> bending of the loop is reduced. Compared to the contact diameters observed in the classical JKR tests, the contact length obtained using this elastica loop technique is, in general, larger, which provides potential for applications of this technique in measuring interfacial energies between solid materials with high moduli. The contact procedure is also simulated to investigate the <b>anticlastic</b> bending effect using finite element analysis with ABAQUS.

To model the anisotropic yielding of 6022 -T 4 sheet, Barlat’ 91, ’ 96 and 2000 yield functions were implemented into Abaqus/Standard through user material subroutines. A nonlinear kinematic hardening model with multiple back stresses was constructed to closely reproduce the reversed strain hardening behavior of sheet metals. The new material constitutive models are as accurate as the previous work based on two-surface plastic-ity, but they have simpler mathematical forms and require fewer model parameters. The mechanics of the persistent <b>anticlastic</b> curvature were studied by draw-bend experiments, finite element analysis and an elastic plate-bending theory. The trans-verse cross-section shape was dictated by a dimensionless parameter, β, which de-pends on the specimen geometry, tool radius and sheet tension.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{equilibrium}} problem in nonlinear elasticity of hyperelastic solids under <b>anticlastic</b> bending. A three-dimensional kinematic model, where the longitudinal bending is accompanied by the transversal deformation of cross sections, is formulated. Following a semi-inverse approach, the displacement field prescribed by the above kinematic model contains three unknown parameters. A Lagrangian analysis is performed and the compressible Mooney-Rivlin law is assumed for the stored energy function. Once evaluated the Piola-Kirchhoff stresses, the free parameters of the kinematic model are determined by using the equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions. An Eulerian analysis is then accomplished to evaluating stretches and stresses in the deformed configuration. Cauchy stress distributions are investigated and it is shown how, for wide ranges of constitutive parameters, the obtained solution is quite accurate. The whole formulation proposed for the finite <b>anticlastic</b> bending of hyperelastic solids is linearized by introducing the hypothesis of smallness of the displacement and strain fields.

The main contributions of this thesis to structural geology are novel methods for investigating links between fault shape and wall rock structure. Curvature plots of sixteen faults show that thrust faults in deepwater Niger Delta exhibit corrugations on a range of wavelength and amplitude. The corrugations are characterized by large-scale <b>anticlastic</b> and synclastic geometries parallel to fault transport direction. The structure of the volumes in the immediate vicinity of the faults was investigated using slices of seismic attribute data sampled parallel and adjacent to thirteen faults. In half of the faults the hanging wall is more disrupted than the footwall, while in the other half the footwall is more disrupted than the hanging wall, implying that thrust zones exhibit complex geometries that existing models have yet to address. In addition, disruptions near fault surfaces may be related to discrete zones of intense fault surface maximum curvature, anomalous surface gradient and change in pattern of <b>anticlastic</b> and synclastic fault Gaussian surface curvature in the fault transport direction. No significant wall rock disruption was observed where fault surface curvature is planar. ...|$|E

It is also predicted that GIIc may be substantially higher for multidirectional specimens than for the most common [0 º]n unidirectionals.

It is possible to combine inflatable’s with pre-stressed membranes to make “free-formed ” surfaces that are sinclastic and <b>anticlastic.</b> To elaborate the possibilities, columns, cables, and beams can be added. Columnspushing the membrane will introduce high points, cables pulling the membrane will introduce low points.

40|$|Abstract Draw beads {{are used}} in sheet metal forming {{processes}} to regulate material flow and achieve higher quality in the parts. The draw beads impose draw restraining force on the blank which eliminates defects such as wrinkling, tearing and reduces springback.

This study evaluates the influence of back force on the springback behavior in advanced high strength steel (AHSS). Three grades of dual-phase steel, namely DP 600, DP 800, DP 980, are used with normalized back forces ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 1.
