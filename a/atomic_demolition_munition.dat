25|$|In February 1968 the Marine Corps Development and Education Command {{obtained}} several CH-46s {{to perform}} herbicide dissemination tests using HIDAL (Helicopter, Insecticide Dispersal Apparatus, Liquid) systems; testing indicated {{the need for}} redesign and further study. Tandem-rotor helicopters were often used to transport nuclear warheads; the CH-46A was evaluated to deploy Naval Special Forces with the Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition</b> (SADM). Nuclear Weapon Accident Exercise 1983 (NUWAX-83), simulating the crash of a Navy CH-46E carrying 3 nuclear warheads, was conducted at the Nevada Test Site on behalf of several federal agencies; the exercise, which used real radiological agents, was depicted in a Defense Nuclear Agency-produced documentary.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{elaborate}} computerized {{early warning}} {{systems such as}} Defense Support Program were developed to detect incoming Soviet attacks and to coordinate response strategies. During this same period, intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems were developed that could deliver a nuclear payload across vast distances, allowing the U.S. to house nuclear forces capable of hitting the Soviet Union in the American Midwest. Shorter-range weapons, including small tactical weapons, were fielded in Europe as well, including nuclear artillery and man-portable Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition.</b> The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile systems allowed for hidden nuclear submarines to covertly launch missiles at distant targets as well, making it virtually impossible for the Soviet Union to successfully launch a first strike attack against the United States without receiving a deadly response.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{underground}} test was Teapot Ess, on 23 March 1955. The 1 kiloton explosion was an operational test of an <b>atomic</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>munition</b> (ADM). It was detonated 20.4m (67ft) underground, in a shaft lined with corrugated steel, {{which was then}} back-filled with sandbags and dirt. Because the ADM was buried underground, the explosion blew tons of earth upwards, creating a crater 91m (300ft) wide and 39m (128ft) deep. The resulting mushroom cloud rose to a height of [...] and subsequent radioactive fallout drifted in an easterly direction, travelling as far as [...] from ground zero.|$|E
50|$|The T4 was {{produced}} in 1957 from recycled W9 fissile components and was in service until 1963, when it was replaced with W30 Tactical <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> and W45 Medium <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Green Light Team {{missions}} {{were not}} publicly disclosed until 1984 when military documents and papers from the Natural Resources Defense Council were outlined to the public. [...] Many people, along with Congress, were {{skeptical of the}} concept of tactical nuclear devices being employed by a group of soldiers. At the time of the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> program’s inception in the 1950’s, the idea and practicality of this new smaller, tactical warfare was rational. [...] In the Cold War’s final few years of conflict and as concepts such as “limited nuclear war” were adapted, the practicality of the weapons were “obsolete”, according to President George H.W. Bush. [...] This further led to an increasing number of nuclear devices being relinquished or destroyed by all sides of the war. When NBC Nightly News ran two stories in the 1980’s depicting the plan by the United States to operate Special Forces-led missions involving <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions,</b> West Germany’s Defense Minister Manfred Worner lead the plea for the United States to remove its <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> cache in the area. [...] By 1988, the last approximately 300 Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> owned by the United States were surrendered from the NATO arsenal. [...] In 1989, the Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> weapon and the Green Light Teams were officially retired. [...] By the end of the war, not a single Green Light Team conducted a real mission involving Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of this agreement, the 62nd Engineers and an {{artillery}} company were moved to Caserma Passalacqua. Both companies had nuclear weapons.

5000|$|Another {{key reason}} the Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> and Green Light Teams {{operations}} were kept highly secretive was also {{due to the}} targets and locations of the tactical nuclear weapons. As a counter to the Warsaw Pact forces perceivably outgunning and outmanning the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) during the standstill of the Cold War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his generals intended for the Green Light Teams to conduct missions not only in NATO occupied countries, {{but also in the}} Warsaw Pact nations. [...] This new form of attack was {{to be used as a}} weapon to stop an enemy attack in its tracks or eliminate enemy nuclear devices. [...] In order for such an operation to be successful, especially in the midst of a total nuclear war, this form of retaliation needed to be swift and efficient. That meant that these <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> needed to be quickly accessed and deployed. Hundreds of these tactical nuclear devices were stashed throughout Europe and in NATO’s arsenal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Atomic</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>munitions</b> (ADMs), colloquially {{known as}} nuclear land mines, are small nuclear {{explosive}} devices. ADMs were developed for both {{military and civilian}} purposes. As weapons, {{they were designed to}} be exploded in the forward battle area, in order to block or channel enemy forces. Non-militarily, they were designed for demolition, mining or earthmoving. However, apart from testing, they have never been used for either purpose.|$|R
25|$|The lack of {{compression}} {{makes such}} designs inefficient, but the simplicity and small diameter make it {{suitable for use}} in artillery shells and <b>atomic</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>munitions</b> – ADMs – also known as backpack or suitcase nukes; {{an example is the}} W48 artillery shell, the smallest nuclear weapon ever built or deployed. All such low-yield battlefield weapons, whether gun-type U-235 designs or linear implosion Pu-239 designs, pay a high price in fissile material in order to achieve diameters between six and ten inches (15 and 25cm).|$|R
50|$|The W30 was an American {{nuclear warhead}} {{used on the}} RIM-8 Talos surface-to-air missile and the Tactical <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition</b> (TADM).|$|E
50|$|Nuclear mines {{have also}} been developed, both land and naval varieties. An example is the British Blue Peacock project, while another was the U.S. Medium <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Small, two-man {{portable}} tactical weapons (erroneously {{referred to}} as suitcase bombs), such as the Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition,</b> have been developed, although the difficulty to combine sufficient yield with portability limits their military utility.|$|E
50|$|During the Cold War, the Fulda Gap {{was one of}} two obvious routes for a {{hypothetical}} Soviet tank attack on West Germany from Eastern Europe, especially East Germany; the other route was the North German Plain. (A third, less likely, route was up through the Danube River valley in Austria.) The concept of a major tank battle along the Fulda Gap was a predominant element of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) war planning during the Cold War, and weapons such as nuclear tube and missile artillery, the nuclear recoilless gun/tactical launcher Davy Crockett, Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions,</b> the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, and A-10 ground attack aircraft were developed with such an eventuality in mind.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between first- and second-generation nuclear weapons, i.e. atomic and hydrogen bombs. However, virtually all second generation bombs use a few grams of deuterium-tritium gas to ensure the reliability and safety of the nuclear fission-explosives. They can then be used on their own as boosted fission bombs, or as primaries of two-stage thermonuclear (hydrogen) weapons. Weapons which in contemporary arsenals do not use tritium boosting have a generally lower kiloton yield and are mostly weapons used for specific purposes such as <b>atomic</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>munitions.</b> Tritium boosting is relatively easy to implement and has advantages in yield, weight, size, safety (zero or negligible yield when the tritium is not in the weapon), resistance to spontaneous fission caused by other warheads and high transparency to X-rays.|$|R
5000|$|The United States of America’s {{military}} leaders and President Dwight D. Eisenhower immensely feared the enormous nuclear weapons cache and manpower of the Soviet Union. [...] They embraced a “New Look” idea of limited nuclear war. [...] This new idea of limited nuclear warfare included {{the use of}} tactical nuclear weapons. Deployment of these tactical nuclear weapons required specially trained soldiers [...] This {{led to the creation}} of the Green Light Teams. These troops were recruited with backgrounds in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Marines, and went to an Officer Candidate School to be trained and tested on their leadership, engineering, and psychology as well as their mental stability. [...] The recruits also underwent a thorough background check by DoD before being confirmed into the Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munitions</b> program.|$|R
50|$|Other {{delivery}} methods included artillery shells, mines {{such as the}} Medium <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition</b> and {{the novel}} Blue Peacock, nuclear depth charges, and nuclear torpedoes. An 'Atomic Bazooka' was also fielded, designed to be used against large formations of tanks.|$|E
50|$|Medium <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition</b> (MADM) was a {{tactical}} nuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War. They were designed {{to be used as}} nuclear land mines and for other tactical purposes, with a relatively low explosive yield from a W45 warhead, between 1 and 15 kilotons. Each MADM weighed less than 400 lb (181 kg) total. They were deployed between 1965 and 1986.|$|E
50|$|Little Feller II and Little Feller I were code {{names for}} a set of nuclear tests {{undertaken}} by the United States at the Nevada Test Site on July 7 and July 17, 1962 as part of Operation Sunbeam. They were both tests of stockpiled W54 warheads, the smallest nuclear warheads ever produced by the United States, used in both the Davy Crockett warhead and the Special <b>Atomic</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Munition.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] This 1950 {{atomic bomb}} {{information}} card, meant for U.S. military personnel, describes how {{in a number}} of respects an [...] "Atomic bomb("A-bomb") is similar to the effects of a large High explosive("HE" [...] bomb). While easily misinterpreted as dismissing the post-explosion radiation hazard, the pamphlets mentioning of the radiation hazard being over after the [...] "debris has stopped falling" [...] is in reference to the fact that, when structural debris has stopped falling, the prompt radiation hazard has largely passed. Furthermore, as it was penned before the era of the Hydrogen bomb(1951) and <b>atomic</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>munitions,</b> the pamphlet does not discuss nuclear fallout as the pamphlet was created {{at a time when the}} only conceivable means by which soldiers would encounter nuclear explosions, was when they were fuzed to explode as air bursts, which does not produce militarily significant fallout.|$|R
25|$|Paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement {{mandated}} that neither side introduce new weapons into Korea, other than piece-for-piece replacement of equipment. In September 1956 the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford {{indicated that the}} U.S. military intention was to introduce atomic weapons into Korea, which was agreed to by the U.S. National Security Council and President Eisenhower. However paragraph 13(d) prevented the introduction {{of nuclear weapons and}} missiles. The U.S. unilaterally abrogated paragraph 13(d), breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies. At a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on June 21, 1957, the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the United Nations Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13(d) of the armistice. In January 1958 nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea, followed within a year by <b>atomic</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>munitions</b> and nuclear armed Matador cruise missiles with the range to reach China and the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|Following the September 11 {{terrorist}} attacks on the United States, fresh attention was focused on al-Qaeda’s desire {{for weapons of mass destruction}} but with more urgency than in the past. A serious concern was that al-Qaeda terrorists might attempt to obtain Russian warheads or weapon-usable nuclear materials. Former GRU Colonel Stanislav Lunev’s 1998 statements were resurrected following the attacks. During an appearance on CBS, Lunev reasserted his claim that suitcase bombs existed, even going so far as to claim that bin Laden had obtained several of the devices from the former Soviet Union. In the same segment, Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution discounted Lunev’s claims: “Our view is that this is not a major worry. If those devices ever existed, they were under the control of the Soviet state, and not available to terrorists.” On December 20, 2001 UPI reported that the FBI had stepped up its investigation into terrorist access to Russian nuclear stockpiles. Representative Weldon, once again at the forefront of the debate, stated “Do I think he Laden has a [...] small <b>atomic</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>munitions,</b> which were built by the Soviets in the Cold War? Probably doubtful.” ...|$|R
