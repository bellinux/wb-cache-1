Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy <b>and</b> <b>empathy</b> for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, and his love for her (<b>and</b> <b>empathy</b> for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion <b>and</b> <b>empathy</b> for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers.

She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was threefold: to examine (1) the {{relation}} between both cognitive <b>and</b> affective <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> prosocial behavior; (2) the relation between both cognitive <b>and</b> affective <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> offending; and (3) the role of cognitive distortions in the relation between cognitive <b>empathy,</b> affective <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> offending in a sample of adolescent girls with lower SES and education (N = 264). Results showed that both cognitive <b>and</b> affective <b>empathy</b> were positively related to prosocial behavior. Furthermore, cognitive empathy was positively related to offending, whereas affective empathy was not related to offending. Finally, no support was found for our hypothesis that cognitive distortions play a moderating role in the relation between <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> offending...|$|R

5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially <b>and</b> <b>empathy</b> for those with family problems.|$|E
5|$|The medieval setting {{has been}} the {{traditional}} background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense <b>and</b> <b>empathy</b> for the readers. Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's Iliad, where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, {{as an example of}} what he wants to achieve with his books.|$|E
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into <b>and</b> <b>empathy</b> for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} research {{focuses on}} the relation between <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> antisocial behavior <b>and</b> whether <b>empathy</b> at age 16 predicts antisocial behavior at age 17. It also investigated whether this association differs in boys and girls. Participants were a total of 437 boys and girls from 16 - 17 years old from a non-clinical sample. These were selected from different schools from the middle and west of the Netherlands. To determine how the different components of empathy affect antisocial behavior, a distinction was made between cognitive- <b>and</b> affective <b>empathy,</b> <b>and</b> aggressive- and delinquent behavior. Data was collected through self-report questionnaires. Results showed that empathy at age 16 significantly predicts antisocial behavior a year later and that girls in general have higher scores on both components of empathy. The relationship between cognitive <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> aggression, <b>and</b> cognitive <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> delinquency, {{did not differ in}} strength between boys and girls. This was also found for the relationship between affective <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> aggression.

25|$|These {{findings}} can {{be explained}} in terms of self-categorization <b>and</b> <b>empathy.</b> From the perspective of self-categorization theory, a person’s own social identity, well-being is tied to their group membership so that when a group based identity is salient, the suffering of one group member can be considered to directly affect the group. Because of this shared identity, referred to as self-other merging, bystanders are able to empathize, which has been found to predict helping behaviour. For example, in a study relating to helping after eviction both social identification <b>and</b> <b>empathy</b> were found to predict helping. However, when social identification was controlled for, empathy no longer predicted helping behaviour.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the effects of state <b>and</b> trait <b>empathy</b> in legal judgments and tested the relationship between trait and state emotion in {{one hundred and fifty}} eight students aged 18 - 59. Assessments were taken of participants’ trait <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> then state <b>empathy</b> was induced in half the sample. Following this all participants read a trial transcript and made judgments regarding: the verdict decision; the defendant’s responsibility for the offense; what would be an appropriate punishment; the likelihood that the offender would offend in the future; and whether the defendant felt remorse for committing the offense. Findings showed that both trait <b>and</b> state <b>empathy</b> predicted attributions of offender remorse. State empathy also predicted judgments of offender responsibility and agreement with verdict decisions in a lenient direction. Findings also showed that state <b>and</b> trait <b>empathy</b> did not interact. The results indicate that trait <b>and</b> state <b>empathy</b> work independently to influence legal judgments <b>and</b> that inducing <b>empathy</b> in decision-makers can impact on trial outcomes above and beyond the facts of the case...|$|R

40|$|In this {{cross-sectional}} study {{the relationship between}} components of <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> proactive/reactive aggression in adolescents is examined. In this research a distinction is made between dispositional <b>and</b> situational <b>empathy.</b> These concepts are both constituted by a cognitive and affective component. In this study questionnaires <b>and</b> an <b>empathy</b> task were taken with 338 adolescents when they were 17 years old on average. Stepwise multiple regression analyses have shown that dispositional empathy, both the affective and cognitive component, is related to proactive as well as reactive aggression. In this study situational empathy is not significantly related to aggression. Girls had higher scores on all components of empathy, when boys had higher scores on aggression. However, two-way analyses of covariance showed no significant sex differences in {{the strength of the}} relation between dispositional <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> aggression. In earlier research the relation between situational <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> aggression has rarely been examined in a non-clinical sample.
