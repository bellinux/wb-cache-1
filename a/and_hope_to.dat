5|$|The film brings {{together}} the video diaries recorded by four friends and {{students at the}} Tariq bin Ziad High School for Boys in Zayouna, a mixed-race, middle-class area in the Karrada suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. Entering their final year in 2006, each has high expectations for the year ahead <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> graduate so {{they can have a}} chance to attend university. At the same time, the boys must also deal with the increasing sectarian violence that is starting to extend into Karrada. They face the threats of roadside bombings, the hassles of security checkpoints on their way to school, frequent curfews, the constant presence of American Apache helicopters overhead, and the deterioration of their neighbourhood which becomes rife with assassinations, muggings and kidnappings. Many of their fellow students, unmotivated and academically underperforming, are absent from school.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus was {{converted}} to the prototype fighter catapult ship in November 1940, carrying three Fairey Fulmar fighters from 807 Squadron between 1 December and 10 February 1941, which {{were replaced by}} aircraft from 804 Squadron between 10 February and 23 July. These fighters were supposed to defend convoys against attacks from Focke-Wulf Fw 200 maritime patrol bombers and {{to prevent them from}} radioing location reports to U-boats. If out of range of land, the fighters would have to ditch at sea <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> be recovered by a ship from their convoy. The ship escorted nine convoys between December 1940 and July 1941. At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was supplemented with a pair of Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns mounted in the bow, the ship's bridge was enlarged and the mast was replaced with a tripod mast bearing a Type 291 air warning radar. The ship then became a seaplane training ship again, hosting 763 Squadron aboard from 20 April 1942 to 13 February 1944. Pegasus then became a barracks ship until May 1946 and was then listed for disposal in June.|$|E

The Kama Sutra acknowledges that the senses can be dangerous: 'Just as a horse in full gallop, blinded by the energy of his own speed, pays no attention to any post or hole or ditch on the path, so two lovers, blinded by passion, in the friction of sexual battle, are caught up in their fierce energy and pay no attention to danger' (2.7.33).|$|E
25|$|Reactions to PubMed Central {{among the}} {{scholarly}} publishing community range between a genuine enthusiasm by some, to cautious concern by others.

Libraries, universities, open access supporters, consumer health advocacy groups, and patient rights organizations have applauded PubMed Central, <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> see similar public access repositories developed by other federal funding agencies so to freely share any research publications that were the result of taxpayer support.|$|E
25|$|BSWW representatives, in {{partnership}} with FIFA, have liaised with the International Olympic Committee a number of times, with Olympic-affiliated {{events such as the}} Asian Beach Games integrating beach soccer from 2008 onward, the South American Beach Games from 2009 and the European Games starting from 2015. The ultimate aim is to have beach soccer a sport in the summer Olympics. But despite a campaign for inclusion in the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympics., the sport was ultimately not included and so lobbying in cooperation with FIFA continues, to ultimately fulfil the goal of making beach soccer an Olympic sport. In 2017, BSWW secured beach soccer as a sport at the inaugural Olympic-affiliated World Beach Games in 2019 <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> use it's inclusion as a springboard for future absorption into the Summer Olympics.|$|E

500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... We go to the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. [...] "On the whole it was voted good" [...] wrote Mawson of the meat, [...] "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed".|$|E

500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Blair {{expressed}} {{frustration that}} Carmella {{had become a}} [...] "very tortured, depressive character {{and there was no}} {{light at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a place where people have no idea what I have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E
500|$|At 08:00 on 14 February 1804, {{with the}} island of Pulo Aura within sight to the {{south-west}} near the eastern entrance to the Straits of Malacca, the Indiaman Royal George raised a signal describing three sail approaching the convoy {{from the direction of}} the island. This was Linois's squadron, which had been cruising in the area for the previous month in anticipation of the convoy's arrival. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the Indiamen Alfred, Royal George, Bombay Castle <b>and</b> <b>Hope</b> <b>to</b> approach the strange vessels and investigate, rapidly discovering that they were enemy warships. By 13:00, Dance had readied his guns and reformed his convoy, with the large Indiamen formed up in line of battle to receive the French attack as if they were warships. During the late afternoon, Linois's squadron fell in behind the slow line of merchant ships and Dance expected an immediate attack, but Linois was cautious and merely observed the convoy, preferring to wait until the following morning before engaging the enemy. Dance made use of the delay to gather the smaller country ships on the opposite side of his line from the French, the brig Ganges shepherding them into position and collecting volunteers from their crews to augment the sailors on board the Indiamen. Linois later excused his delay in attacking the merchant convoy by citing the need for caution: ...|$|E
