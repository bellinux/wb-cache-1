5|$|Dubnium {{with its}} <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> 105 is a superheavy element; like all {{elements}} of such high <b>atomic</b> <b>number,</b> it is highly unstable. The most stable known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. Thus, {{even if it had}} once existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E
5|$|The Bohr model {{exhibits}} {{difficulty for}} atoms with <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> greater than 137, as any element with an <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be travelling faster than c, {{the speed of}} light. Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and accuracy of}} a model for tissue characterization with dual source computed tomography (DSCT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A model for tissue characterization in CT was used with a parameterization of linear attenuation coefficients. Sixteen chemical substances with effective <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> between 5. 21 and 13. 08 and electron densities between 2. 20 and 4. 12 x 10 (23) electrons/cm(3) were scanned at energies of 80 and 140 kV on a DSCT. From the reconstructed dual energy data sets, effective <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> and electron densities of the substances were calculated. RESULTS: Our presented model using DSCT approximated the effective <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> and effective electron densities of 16 substances very well. The measured effective <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> deviated 3. 4 ± 6. 8 % (R(2) = 0. 994) from theoretical effective <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers.</b> In addition, measured effective electron densities deviated - 0. 6 ± 2. 2 % (R(2) = 0. 999) from theoretical effective electron densities. CONCLUSION: Effective <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> and effective electron densities can be determined with a high accuracy with DSCT. Therefore the model can be of potential benefit for clinical applications of quantitative tissue characterization with DSCT...|$|R
5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the same}} year Henry Moseley {{provided}} additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (<b>atomic)</b> <b>number</b> in the periodic table. Until these experiments, <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{chemical}} element that is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> 82. It {{is a heavy}} metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E
50|$|Bremsstrahlung is {{of concern}} when {{shielding}} beta emitters, as the interaction of beta particles with the shielding material produces Bremsstrahlung radiation. This effect is greater with material of high <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers,</b> so material with low <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> is used for beta source shielding.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 it {{was shown}} {{to be able to}} remove {{radioactive}} nuclides from water, including radioactive isotopes of actinides (elements with <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> 89 to 103, including thorium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and americium) and lanthanides (the ‘rare earths’ with <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> 57 to 71, including europium).|$|R
50|$|All chalcogens {{have six}} valence electrons. All of the solid, stable chalcogens {{are soft and}} do not conduct heat well. Electronegativity {{decreases}} towards the chalcogens with higher <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers.</b> Density, melting and boiling points, and atomic and ionic radii tend to increase towards the chalcogens with higher <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Technetium, with <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> (denoted Z) 43, is the lowest-numbered {{element in}} the {{periodic}} table of which all isotopes are radioactive. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, promethium, has an <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> of 61. Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers, even when {{the total number of}} nucleons (protons + neutrons) is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes.|$|E

5|$|The X-ray {{spectroscopy}} done by Henry Moseley in 1914 {{showed a}} direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge. This {{led to the}} nuclear charge, or <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.|$|E
50|$|A further {{observed}} peculiarity is {{the jagged}} alternation between relative abundance and scarcity of adjacent <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> in the elemental abundance curve, {{and a similar}} pattern of energy levels in the nuclear binding energy curve. This alternation {{is caused by the}} higher relative binding energy (corresponding to relative stability) of even <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> compared to odd <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers,</b> and is explained by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.The semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF), also called Weizsäcker's formula or the Bethe-Weizsäcker mass formula, gives a theoretical explanation of the overall shape of the curve of nuclear binding energy.|$|R

5|$|With {{its high}} <b>atomic</b> <b>number,</b> lead is the {{heaviest}} element whose natural isotopes {{are regarded as}} stable; lead-208 is the heaviest stable nucleus. This title was formerly held by bismuth, with an <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> of 83, until its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, was found in 2003 to decay very slowly. The four stable isotopes of lead could theoretically undergo alpha decay to isotopes of mercury with a release of energy, but {{this has not been}} observed for any of them; their predicted half-lives range from 1035 to 10189 years.|$|E
5|$|All group 3 {{elements}} have an odd <b>atomic</b> <b>number,</b> {{and therefore}} few stable isotopes. Scandium has one stable isotope, and yttrium itself {{has only one}} stable isotope, 89Y, is also the only isotope that occurs naturally. However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 {{is thought to be}} more abundant than it otherwise would be, {{due in part to the}} s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Alpha decay: {{this process}} is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus {{consisting}} of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower <b>atomic</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature. Elements with <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors.
