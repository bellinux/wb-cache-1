Previous {{studies have shown}} that non-activated aryl halides are aminated by alkali amides in liquid ammonia by the way of a benzyne intermediate. Nucleophilic substitution products are formed with some strong bases and aryl halides in liquid ammonia, provided alkali amides are present. A study of the mechanism and the scope of such reactions has been made. It has been shown that the first step is the formation of benzyne through reaction of <b>alkali</b> <b>amide</b> and aryl halide. The intermediate is then attacked competitively by the various nucleophilic species (including amide ion) present in solution. Thus, when o- and p-bromotoluene were treated with sodium phenylacetylide in liquid ammonia, the product contained, in addition to aromatic amines, approximately equimolar amounts of 2 - and 3 -methyldiphenylacetylene and 3 - and 4 -methyldiphenylacetylene respectively. Benzyne {{has been found to be}} attacked by good nucleophiles. The ease of attack of nucleophilic species cannot be directly correlated either with base strength or nucleophilicity as measured in simple [ [...] . ] reactions. Part II. Cyclohexanone- 2 -[ [...] . ] has been converted to l-phenylcyclohexene by way of 1, 1 -dichlorocyclohexane and 1 -chlorocyclohexene. Oxidation of a benzenesulfenyl chloride derivative of 1 -phenylcyclohexene gave benzoic acid which contained 23 % of the radiocarbon present in 1 -phenylcyclohexene. This is consistent with an elimination-addition mechanism, in which 1 -chlorocyclohexene loses a molecule of hydrogen chloride to give cyclohexyne as a reaction intermediate. Part III. The reaction of p-chloro, p-bromo and p-iodotoluene with potassium anilide in refluxing aniline gave approximately equimolar mixtures of m- and p-tolylphenylamine. These product compositions are consistent with a benzyne (elimination-addition) mechanism. Part IV. l,l-Difiuoro- 2 -piperidino- 3 -phenyl- 2 -cyclobutene (I) has been obtained by treating 1, 1, 2 -trifluoro- 2 -chloro- 3 -phenylcyclobutane with piperidine.

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the <b>alkali</b> metal <b>amide</b> (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the <b>alkali</b> metal <b>amide</b> salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−).

40|$|Abstract- The {{development}} of effective methods for promoting {{the addition of}} ammonia and amines to olefins to yield alkylamines {{has long been a}} challenge in catalysis. We have found that <b>alkali</b> metal <b>amides</b> (rather than transition metal complexes) can be surprisingly active homogeneous catalysts for the amination of olefins. The reaction of diethylamine with ethylene to yield triethylamine in the presence of lithium diethylamide and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamjne was studied {{as a model for the}} reaction of ammonia with ethylene. It proceeds at 70 — 90 °C and 6 - 10 atm, with the rate limiting step being the addition of the diethylamide Et 2 N, nucleophile to the olefin. Sodium and potassium diethylamides are initially even more active catalysts but degrade as the reaction proceeds. Solutions of cesium and rubidium amides are remarkably active catalysts for the reaction of ethylene with ammonia at ca. 100 °C, and 110 atm pressure to yield a mixture of ethylamines with monoethylamine being the predominant product. Low melting mixtures of <b>alkali</b> metal <b>amide</b> salts also catalyze the amination of ethylene and propylene.

In each case the metal atom's coordination sphere is completed by coordination to the synthetically important co-ligand N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine (tmeda). Complexes 1 and 2 [{(tmeda) - M(NPh 2) } 2] (M = Li for 1, Na for 2) can be prepared by treating 1 mol. -equiv. of the parent amine with an equimolar quantity of nBuM and tmeda in hexane solution. In the solid state, 1 and 2 are essentially isostructural, being dimeric with a four-atom M-N-M-N framework. The coordination sphere of each M atom is completed by a bidentate tmeda molecule. Complex 3 [{(tmeda) 3 / 2 K(NPh 2) } 2] has been prepared {{in a similar way}} to 1 and 2 except that benzylpotassium has been <b>Alkali</b> metal <b>amides</b> and their solvates are continuing to attract a great deal of interest due to their use in alkali metal/hydrogen exchange reactions. [1 - 5] In particular, the metal salts of diisopropylamine [da(H) ], 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -hexamethyldisilazane [hmds(H) ] and 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine [tmp(H) ] are widely utilised across synthetic laboratories primarily because of the desirable combination of high Brønsted basicity and low nucleophilicity. Of particular interest in this study, another amido reagent, the thermally highly stable lithium diphenylamide (LiNPh 2), has shown promise in a range of synthetic transformations. As well as regioselective deprotonation reactions,[6 - 10] it has also been used in catalytic aldol reactions involving silyl enol ethers and aldehydes;[11, 12] in elimination applications;[13, 14] in metathetical reactions;[15 - 27] during the preparation of amino-containing carbenes,[28] and as an initiator in the polymerisation of methyl methacrylate.

40|$|We report here {{a series}} of heavier {{alkaline}} earth metal complexes with a phosphinoselenoic amide ligand using two synthetic routes. In the first route, the heavier alkaline earth metal bis(trimethylsilyl) amides [M{N(SiMe 3) 2 } 2 (THF) n] (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) were treated with phosphinoselenoic amine [Ph 2 P(Se) NH(CHPh 2) ] (3), prepared by the treatment of bulky phosphinamines [Ph 2 PNH(CHPh 2) ] (1) with elemental selenium in THF, and afforded homoleptic alkaline earth metal complexes of composition [M(THF) 2 {Ph 2 P(Se) N(CHPh 2) } 2] (M = Ca (7), Sr (8), Ba (9)). The metal complexes 7 - 9 can also be obtained via salt metathesis route where the <b>alkali</b> metal phosphinoselenoic <b>amides</b> of composition [{(THF) 2 M'Ph 2 P(Se) N(CHPh 2) } 2] (M' = Na (5) and K (6)) were reacted with respective metal diiodides in THF at ambient temperature. The solid state structures of the alkali metal complexes 5 - 6 and alkaline earth metal complexes 7 - 9 were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In the solid state, alkali metal complexes 5 and 6 are dimeric and form a poly-metallacyclic structural motif. In contrast, complexes 7 - 9 are monomeric and a direct metal-selenium bond is observed in each cas...|$|R
40|$|In this Quarter, the {{research}} was focused continually on the two general tasks: Task 1, molecular organometallic catalysts for hydrogenation and Task 2, organic base catalysts for arene hydrogenation and the hydrotreating of the coal liquids. With regards to Task 1, the [1, 5 -HDRhCl]{sub 2 }/buffer catalyst system was investigated to improve its performance, especially catalyst`s stability. Although {{the addition of a}} phase transfer agent will usually reduce the catalyst`s activity as described in the last report, a small amount of some surfactant molecules can improve the catalyst`s stability without apparently affecting the catalytic activity. Task 2 was continually focused on the hydrotreating of coal liquid (VSOH) catalyzed by Catalyst 2 and Catalyst 5. The dependence of temperature and hydrogenation pressure on the hydrotreating of VSOH was investigated systematically. The coal liquid hydrotreated at 300 {degrees}C has an H/C ratio of 1. 53 while that treated at 100 {degrees}C has an H/C ratio of only 1. 43. We found that 1000 psig of hydrogen pressure was needed for the reaction to proceed completely. Other catalytic <b>alkali</b> metal bis(trimethylsilyl) <b>amides</b> were also investigated to hydrotreat the same coal liquid. Potassium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide was more active than lithium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide and sodium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide...|$|R
40|$|This PhD project {{investigates the}} use of (Lewis or Brønsted) bases in catalysis. While the first chapter explores {{the use of}} main group metal amides in C–H bond {{activation}} reactions, the second chapter focusses on metal-free organocatalysis using so-called carbones. In the first chapter, formal allylic C(sp 3) –H bond activations of unfuctionalised alkenes for C–C bond formations with imines were investigated. <b>Alkali</b> metal <b>amides</b> were used as catalysts for these transformations, giving homoallylic amine products. The investigations showed the unique reactivity of the Na-amide catalyst compared to other metal base complexes. The reaction scope and robustness was explored and initial insights into the reaction mechanism were obtained. A related K-amide catalyst was then developed for the isomerisation of allyl benzenes, as well as functionalised olefins such as allylic silanes, boronic esters, phosphines, amines, ethers, and thioethers. This part explored the use of ligands to increase the catalyst’s selectivity. Finally, the metal- or functional group-substituted classes of reagents {{were used in the}} functionalised allylation of imines, giving highly complex molecules with a diverse range of applications. Here, unprecedented reactivities were observed for the use of allyl–M reagents, as the allylation involved the activation of C–H bonds rather than C–X bonds. Furthermore, new catalytic formations of heteroatom-substituted homoallylic amines were described. The following chapter focussed on the use of carbodiphosphoranes (CDPs) in catalysis. These C(0) bases, or carbones, represent a class of heteroallene compounds that exhibit a high electron density on a P(V) -flanked carbon centre. Their potential as either a Lewis or Brønsted base was examined. Different CDPs were synthesised and reacted stoichiometrically with CO 2, boron Lewis acids and metal salts. The generated intermediates were then studied in their reaction behaviour, taking advantage of a potentially available second pair of electrons. The results of these reactions were compared to other carbon bases, such as carbenes or other carbones. Finally, the Brønsted basicity of the CDP was examined in reactions with acidic pro-nucleophiles. The conjugate addition of alkylnitriles to α,β- unsaturated amides was developed using a catalytic amount of CDP. To the best of our knowledge, the first catalytic use of a CDP, as well as the first C–H bond activation of acetonitrile in Michael additions was reported...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and characterisation of several layered pnictides, chalcogenides, and oxychalcogenides, {{with an emphasis}} on materials that exhibit high temperature superconductivity. High and low temperature techniques have been used to synthesise new materials and modify their properties. The majority of this work has been focused on the synthesis of superconducting materials with the general formula A x (NH 3) y (NH 2) z FeSe, where A is an alkali metal. These materials are formed from a co-intercalation of alkali metals, ammonia, and <b>alkali</b> metal <b>amides</b> into the interlamellar space of pre-formed tetragonal FeSe. There is a remarkable increase in T c associated with this intercalation, from 8 K in FeSe to a maximum of 46 K in the products. A range of characterisation techniques including neutron and X-ray diffraction, EXAFS, and SQUID magnetometry have been used to identify a variety of crystal structures, compositions, and properties adopted by these materials. The synthesis procedure of these materials where, A = Na and K, has been studied in-situ via powder X-ray diffraction at world-class central facilities, revealing new phases, intermediates, and activation energies. The K x (NH 3) y (NH 2) z FeSe phases are found to undergo a topotactic decomposition step to become K x' Fe 2 -y' Se 2 phases on annealing, which has also been studied by in-situ powder X-ray diffraction. Additional studies on Na 1 -x Fe 2 -y As 2 and CaFeSeO have been performed. Na 1 -x Fe 2 -y As 2 {{is the product of a}} room temperature deintercalation of sodium and iron from NaFeAs, which changes the superconducting properties of the material. XAFS measurements have been used to characterise the local structure of the materials, which supports the conclusion that iron is deintercalated from the parent material and gives new insight into the effect of the iron vacancies on the local structure. CaFeSeO is a newly discovered material that adopts a never-before-seen crystal structure, which has been solved from powder X-ray diffraction data. Intricate vacancy ordering exists in the material, which contributes to a peculiar mixture of magnetic behaviours including signatures of a spin glass, ordered antiferromagnet, and an ordered ferromagnetic component. All of these behaviours however, can be rationalised by the nuclear and magnetic structure of the material that have been refined using powder neutron diffraction. </p...|$|R
