40|$|Dissenting opinions, {{separate}} {{opinions and}} declarations are a familiar {{aspect of the}} international jurisprudential landscape. Despite this, in comparison to domestic judicial systems, there has been comparatively little by way of attempts to rationalise the institutional and systemic implications of this practice. While there is widespread agreement {{that the impact of}} <b>additional</b> <b>opinions</b> lies in their effect upon the authority of the court or tribunal and its decisions (‘institutional judicial authority’), the nature of that impact is open to greater contestation. How should <b>additional</b> <b>opinions</b> be viewed? An unnecessary and counterproductive distraction or an important mechanism of accountability for the exercise of judicial power? By conceiving <b>additional</b> <b>opinions</b> as the expression of individual judicial authority, this thesis examines the interplay between individual judicial authority and institutional judicial authority within two paradigms of international justice. The first – comprising the ICJ and PCIJ – represents the traditional paradigm of international justice wherein the culture of expressing individual judicial authority in international law was born. The second paradigm is international criminal justice as pursued by two institutions in particular, the ICTY and the ICC. By comparing these two paradigms, and the nature and purposes of judicial authority therein, this thesis considers how individual judges through their <b>additional</b> <b>opinions</b> have contributed to the evolving international judicial culture, and how that practice affects {{the manner in which the}} institutions in question advance the project of international justice. Drawing upon Mirjan Damaška’s work demonstrating how procedural choices and practices have implications upon authority, and the relationship between procedure and the purposes for which authority is claimed, this thesis demonstrates that not only is the expression of individual judicial authority consistent with institutional authority but it is constitutive of it. The final section of the thesis turns to consider a form of judicial expression – defined as judicial dissent – that places institutional and individual authority in conflict with one another. Despite the negative implications of judicial dissent upon judicial authority (both institutional and individual) and judicial collegiality, the final section considers whether such practice can play a legitimate systemic function...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the early}} polls {{conducted}} during the 10 days after the election at 6 May—where the political leaders unsuccessfully attempted {{to form a new}} government—showed SYRIZA taking the lead in popular support ahead of ND. This led to accusations from the political leaders at ND, PASOK and DIMAR, that SYRIZA deliberately had derailed all attempts to form a new government, with the sole purpose of pursuing their own interest of possibly growing in size after a new election. After the new June election was officially called at 16 May, there was an apparent change in political momentum, with most of the subsequent opinion polls now indicating that ND had taken the lead in popular support ahead of SYRIZA. According to Greek law, the polling companies were not allowed to publish <b>additional</b> <b>opinion</b> polls after the last working day two weeks ahead of the election, meaning that the last opinion polls were published at 1 June. Among all of the last published opinion polls, 9 out of 12 polling companies measured a lead of popular support for ND, while only the two polling companies, VPRC and Public Issue (who both adjust their vote results by performing a weighted prediction of the likely votes of undecided voters based on Time Series Analysis) believed the current lead of popular support belonged to SYRIZA, and the last polling company Pulse RC predicted it would end up with a draw.|$|E

This <b>additional</b> <b>opinion,</b> also authored by Justice Danforth, {{was joined by}} Chief Justice Ruger and Justice Miller; Justice Earl concurred in the result; Justice Finch dissented; Justices Rapallo and Andrews did not vote. First, {{the court held that}} the Canadian Cayugas were not a party to the treaty:The commissioners may deal with a part or portion or party of a nation of Indians in respect to certain matters, but the relators are in error in supposing that they are such part or portion within the meaning or intent of the statute ... There are parts or portions of the Cayuga nation so recognized, but the relators are not. The treaties of 1789, 1790, and 1795 were with the nation of Indians called the Cayugas. So was the treaty of 1829, although the Cayugas were described as residing at Sandusky, in the state of Ohio. The treaty of 1831 described one portion of the Cayuga nation as residing at Sandusky, and another portion as residing on the Seneca reservation, near Buffalo, and the annuities agreed upon in 1789 and 1795 were then to be in the future divided between them in certain proportions. The treaties of May and July, 1846, are described as being between ‘that portion of the tribe or nation of Indians called the Cayuga Indians residing {{in the western part of}} the state of New York, of one part, and the state of New York, of the other ... The relators seem unknown to the state, and I do not find that they have in any manner or at any time been recognized as a [...] "part" [...] or [...] "portion" [...] of the Cayuga nation of Indians.

40|$|Student {{progression}} {{and retention}} {{has always been}} a focus of attention at Glamorgan for many reasons. Not the least of these is the University’s mission towards widening access to disadvantaged groups. The School of Electronics suffered a particularly difficult year for retention in 1999 - 2000, with the result that a programme of intensive action was initiated in the 2000 - 2001 session. This appears to have been successful. The programme involved close monitoring and counseling of students. In addition adjustments to the initial curriculum were implemented. As a result withdrawal has been halved and information on reasons for withdrawal has been enhanced. In addition to this tactical response a longer-term strategic programme has been started with the intention of addressing those factors which the School perceives to be the underlying causes of withdrawal. In this paper we look at some research carried out by others, regarding the underlying causes of withdrawal, offer some <b>additional</b> <b>opinions</b> on further causes, examine the 2000 - 2001 session tactical response and its outcome and offer, for discussion, the philosophy underlying the future strategic attack on the problem...|$|R
40|$|Additional {{opinions}} — dissenting opinions, separate opinions, declarations, and permutations thereof — are a familiar, if sometimes controversial, {{aspect of}} the international jurisprudential landscape.

Yet, particularly in the context of international criminal justice, additional opinions have often been overlooked as a subject of critical engagement in their own right. Therefore, the purpose of this article is bring into focus the practice of judicial dissent, that is, the expression of strongly held and fundamental disagreement by judges through the vehicle of the <b>additional</b> <b>opinion,</b> and to stimulate a wider critical engagement with dissentient judicial practice.

40|$|Patient-specific (endogenous) and population-specific (exogenous) {{risk factor}} {{analysis}} is identifying novel {{physical and chemical}} exposures which might be time-linked {{to the development of}} amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron diseases. Electric injury in a number of case-control studies as well as prolonged exposure at work and home to agricultural chemicals in pesticides and herbicides have been identified as significant risk factors. Heavy exercise, trauma with or without bone fractures and heavy metal exposure at work have not been confirmed as risk factors. Surprisingly, occupation as a pilot or navigator has recently been identified as a potential risk factor, which will need to be confirmed. The introduction of international patient registries in North America (ALS CARE) and in Europe (ALS HPS) will facilitate future studies on the prognosis of ALS, adherence to standards of practice, quality of life and patient outcome studies. An initial survey of the ALS Patient Care Database in January 1999, when nearly 1800 patients had been entered across North America, indicated the median time from ALS onset to diagnosis is 14 months when no second opinion is requested, 12 months if the patient requests a second opinion and 10 months when the neurologist requests an <b>additional</b> <b>opinion.</b> No significant difference was found in the median time to diagnose sporadic ALS patients compared with familial ALS patients...|$|E
40|$|GenBank, {{the public}} {{repository}} for nucleotide and protein sequences, {{is a critical}} resource for molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. While some attention has been drawn to sequence errors (1), common annotation errors also reduce {{the value of this}} database. In fact, for organisms such as fungi, which are notoriously difficult to identify, up to 20 % of DNA sequence records may have erroneous lineage designations in GenBank (2). Gene function annotation in protein sequence databases is similarly error-prone (3, 4). Because identity and function of new sequences are often determined by bioinformatic analyses, both types of errors are propagated into new accessions, leading to long-term degradation {{of the quality of the}} database. Currently, primary sequence data are annotated by the authors of those data, and can only be reannotated by the same authors. This is inefficient and unsustainable over the long term as authors eventually leave the field. Although it is possible to link third-party databases to GenBank records, this is a short-term solution that has little guarantee of permanence. Similarly, the current third-party annotation option in GenBank (TPA) complicates rather than solves the problem by creating an identical record with a new annotation, while leaving the original record unflagged and unlinked to the new record. Since the origin of public zoological and botanical specimen collections, an open system of cumulative annotation has evolved, whereby the original name is retained, but <b>additional</b> <b>opinion</b> is directly appended and used for filing and retrieval. This was needed as new specimens and analyses allowed for reevaluation of older specimens and the original depositors became unavailable. The time has come for the public sequence database to incorporate a community-curated, cumulative annotation process that allows third parties to improve the annotations of sequences when warranted by published peer-reviewed analyses (5) ...|$|E
