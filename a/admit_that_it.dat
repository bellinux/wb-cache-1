He inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the Chinese, recaptured Seoul in March 1951, and pushed {{on to the}} 38th Parallel. With the improved military situation, Truman now saw the opportunity to offer a negotiated peace but, on 24 March, MacArthur called upon China to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both the Chinese and his own superiors. Truman's proposed announcement was shelved.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} single {{victory of}} the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September (the Battle of Jijiga), in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were {{no match for the}} assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the Marda Pass, halfway between Jijiga and Harar. By September Ethiopia was forced to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of Harerge, Bale, and Sidamo. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new Warsaw Pact bloc weaponry took place.|$|E

The reliance on the NS-10 by top independent producers became a viral phenomenon; thousands of studios equipped themselves with NS-10s to attract big named producers, making the speakers an industry standard.|$|E

It went through four editions in his lifetime, and more after his death, and generations of readers have found it an amusing and engaging read, projecting an author always [...] "happy in his own good opinion, {{the best of all}} others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity of age." ...|$|E

What I loved most was that the new blood didn't try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished: a seamless, realistic transition. The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been Glee strong points, {{which is not to say}} they couldn't be. But the question is: Is Glee looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of Friday Night Lights... or Saved By the Bell: The New Class?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Stars William Burrill {{called it}} [...] "the best fantasy ... {{role-playing}} game in this (or any parallel) world." [...] He praised its automap and noted its increased graphical fidelity. However, {{he found that}} the control system took time to learn, and he stated, [...] "This is not a game you can master quickly or play in a night. It has its frustrations and its flaws, despite its brilliance of design". He summarized that [...] "those who are patient will be richly rewarded with a game like no other." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Doug Sencat enjoyed the game's graphics and praised the plot, conversations and 3D world for giving a sense of [...] "being there". However, he noted that the game's movement controls were [...] "a pain" [...] and that navigating the environment was initially [...] "frustrating". Sencat was unfavorable toward the linearity of the plot and dialogue trees, and toward NPCs' inability to take actions independent of the player. He described the game as [...] "a long and grueling quest" [...] that often [...] "seems more frustrating than enjoyable". Although Semcat called it [...] "a relatively high-quality game", he finished, [...] "By the time I finally saw daylight again, emerging from the Labyrinth, I must <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn't exultation I felt, but sheer relief." [...] The magazine's Scorpia was more positive, calling the game [...] "a good follow-up to the previous entry".|$|E

2500|$|Dorothea Kehler has {{attempted}} to trace the criticism of the work through the centuries. The earliest such piece of criticism was a 1662 entry in the diary of Samuel Pepys. He found the play to be [...] "the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life." [...] He did, however, <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had [...] "some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure." [...] The next critic to write on the play was John Dryden, writing in 1677. He was preoccupied {{with the question of}} whether fairies should be depicted in theatrical plays, since they did not exist. He concluded that poets should be allowed to depict things which do not exist but derive from popular belief. And fairies are of this sort, as are pigmies and the extraordinary effects of magick. Based on this reasoning, Dryden defended the merits of three fantasy plays: A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Tempest, and Ben Jonson's Masque of Witches.|$|E
2500|$|Ranetti {{carried on}} the satirical {{tradition}} of Moftul Românesc, being in particular influenced by Ion Luca Caragiale and Anton Bacalbașa—but also, to some degree, by D. Teleor and Joséphin Soulary. As introduced by his entry in the University of Florence Romanian literature project, he was [...] "a minor poet, prose writer, and playwright"; [...] "prolific, gifted with an accessible verve, he wrote facile prose." [...] This relies on earlier critical verdicts by critics and cultural historians. As noted in 1941 by George Călinescu: [...] "These days, just about nobody would dare confer upon G. Ranetti a literati's status." [...] Nonetheless, in their time, Ranetti's satires were celebrated by the literary establishment, including Caragiale, the columnists at Viața Romînească, and the philosopher-critic Titu Maiorescu. Overall, Călinescu suggests, [...] "one cannot ask of his journalism that it endure, but we must <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> reached a level {{that has never been}} touched since." [...] According to Peltz: [...] "Gheorghe Ranetti squandered his talent in the pages of a humorous magazine—albeit one of importance: Furnica—and in bohemia." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 3, 1948, in {{testimony}} to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Whittaker Chambers named Witt {{as a member of}} the [...] "Ware Group." [...] When called before a one-man subcommittee of HUAC (whose sole member was Representative Richard Nixon) on August 20, Witt denied knowing [...] "J. Peters" [...] (ostensibly the head of the Soviet Union's political operations in the United States), Chambers, or Alger Hiss. [...] Along with Abt and Pressman, Witt invoked First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights when refusing to answer HUAC questions. Lee Pressman, also testifying that day, forced the subcommittee to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not accusing the men of espionage but rather being communists seeking to infiltrate the government (which was not a crime). A few weeks later, former Daily Worker editor turned anti-communist Louis F. Budenz testified that the CPUSA considered Witt a member. Federal law enforcement officials debated prosecuting Witt in late 1948—not for being a communist, a spy, or for committing espionage, but under a contempt of Congress charge for asserting his Fifth Amendment rights before the committee and refusing to answer its questions. No prosecution was ever made. Witt later testified in February 1949 before a federal grand jury investigating illegal CPUSA activities in the United States.|$|E
