50|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>system</b> {{design is}} {{the design of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>systems.</b> This {{can be as simple}} as a {{flashlight}} cell connected through two wires to a light bulb or as involved as the space shuttle. <b>Electrical</b> <b>systems</b> are groups of electrical components connected to carry out some operation. Often the systems are combined with other systems. They might be subsystems of larger systems and have subsystems of their own. For example, a subway rapid transit <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> is composed of the wayside electrical power supply, wayside control <b>system,</b> and the <b>electrical</b> <b>systems</b> of each transit car. Each transit car’s <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> is a subsystem of the subway system. Inside of each transit car there are also subsystems, such as the car climate control system.|$|R

40|$|Vives College University and Kulab (KU Leuven University campus Ostend) in Belgium are {{undertaking}} an aeronautical {{research program}} {{about the development}} of a new Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Since the UAV is completely electrically powered, the analysis of the energy management of the integrated <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> was critical to the development of the UAV. LMS, A Siemens Business, i s involved in the project to support the development of a multi-physics simulation model for electro-thermal analysis of the aircraft. This paper reports on the subsequent investigation of integrating the detailed <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> model for a Pilot-in-the-Loop simulation. In order to perform this simulation, the model of the <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> was converted into a real-time simulation model. The aim was to perform more realistic flight simulations to evaluate the performance of the aircraft before its first flight by taking into account the <b>electrical</b> <b>system's</b> behavior. Furthermore, the behavior of the <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> can be directly assessed during and after the Pilot-in-the-Loop tests. Additional research outcomes include the suitable level of detail of the <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> that should be taken into account for Pilot-in-the-Loop simulations. The research outcome was evaluated with a number of simulations that assessed the effect of the <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> model. It was concluded that the proposed simulation architecture is suitable to take into account the effect of the <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> on the aircraft flight dynamics. status: publishe...|$|R
