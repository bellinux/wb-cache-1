Not only the end support strength is enhanced, which improves the safety and reliability <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>support</b> and generates methods to solve problems related to reserving triangle coal on the face that enhances the support efficiency and reduces support costs, but also more recovered coal resources become available since the height of roadway increases, spawning a certain amount of economic benefits...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular emergency and non-emergency services, there are Mobile Intensive Care Units MICU [...] stationed {{in most of}} the major cities. These units correspond to the Critical Care Transport function found in other places. [...] They are brought into action whenever a patient with a serious and complex medical condition, requiring <b>advanced</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>support</b> during transit needs to be transferred between hospitals. This service usually applies to intensive-care unit patients, hence the German name Intensivtransport.|$|R

2500|$|Some debate had {{occurred}} among the Reserve Army staffs on attack tactics. The II Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob, advocated attacks by one line, to avoid supporting lines {{being caught in}} German counter-bombardments on the British front-line and no man's land, which usually fell [...] after the beginning of British attacks. Jacob considered that the supporting lines played little part {{in the success of}} the attack and merely added to casualties. Jacob also advocated afternoon attacks, since the six made by his corps had succeeded and the two dawn attacks had failed. The Reserve Army commander, Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough, was less certain but did lay stress on the supports crossing the danger zone swiftly. Gough also used the evidence of a film of an attack on 18 September, to decide against infantry advancing in groups, because of their vulnerability to artillery and because German defences in the gaps between groups were unsuppressed, allowing them to cut off the forward infantry and stop the <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> groups and troops on the flanks.|$|R

25|$|Major-General Oliver Nugent, the {{commander}} of the 36th Division, had used information from captured German orders and noted that German artillery could not bombard advancing British troops since German positions were distributed in depth and the forward zone was easily penetrated. The <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> troops was much easier to obstruct but it was more important to help the foremost infantry. If counter-battery fire was insufficient, the covering fire in front <b>of</b> the <b>advance</b> was more important and counter-battery groups should change target. Nugent recommended that fewer field guns be used for the creeping barrage and that surplus guns should be grouped to fire sweeping barrages (from side-to-side) and that Shrapnel shells should be fuzed to burst higher up, to hit the inside of shell holes. Creeping barrages should be slower with more frequent and longer pauses, during which the barrages from field artillery and 60-pounder guns should sweep and search (move side-to-side and back-and-forth). Nugent suggested that infantry formations should change from skirmish lines to mobile company columns on narrow fronts, equipped with a machine-gun and Stokes mortar and move within a zone, since lines broke up under machine-gun fire in crater-fields and became disorganised.|$|R

40|$|In Italy, advance {{health care}} {{directives}} are {{a subject of}} considerable debate in both legal theory and practice.

Additionally, advances in forensic medicine may assist the court to determine that an act was a cause of death even though it was carried out fairly far in the past.|$|R
