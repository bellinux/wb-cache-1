5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> which runs lengthwise through the body. The <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} volume, the {{specimens}} {{of the cabinet}} were divided into fifteen sections: healthy bones, diseased bones, soft parts about the bones, heart and blood vessels, organs of sense, vocal and respiratory organs, <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> organs accessory to the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> urinary organs, female organs of generation, male organs of generation, utero-gestation, monstrosities, and parasites.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> is the foregut (element 27 in {{numbered}} diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E

5|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of cecum, and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{microorganisms}} have been {{isolated from the}} <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals</b> and frass of M. rotundata. Bacteria include Bacillus firmus, B. licheniformis, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and Streptomyces and fungus includes Trichosporonoides megachiliensis. With respect {{to the development of}} chalkbrood, {{it has been suggested that}} the bacteria and fungi promote the inhabitation of A. aggregata. This is supported by observations in chalkbrood diseased larvae, which contain higher amounts of bacteria and fungi in their gut than in healthy larvae.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{sequencing}} of 16S rRNA, O. valericigenes {{is a member}} of the clostridial cluster IV, a subgroup of clostridial bacteria typically found in the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals</b> of animals, including humans. Its closest cultured relatives at the time of its original description in 2007 were Clostridium orbiscindens (found in human feces) and Clostridium viride. It also exhibits a close relationship to Oscillospira guillermondii, a large bacterial species found in the guts of ruminant animals, which has yet to be grown in culture despite having been first observed in 1913.|$|R
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E
25|$|The insect's {{digestive}} {{system is a}} closed system, with one long enclosed coiled tube called the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> which runs lengthwise through the body. The <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> only allows food to enter the mouth, and then gets processed as it travels toward the anus. The <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> has specific sections for grinding and food storage, enzyme production, and nutrient absorption. Sphincters control the food and fluid movement between three regions. The three regions include the foregut (stomatodeum)(27,) the midgut (mesenteron)(13), and the hindgut (proctodeum)(16).|$|E
25|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats, and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion. The main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> which runs lengthwise through the body. The <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> directs food in one direction: from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
50|$|Generally, sparrows are small, plump, {{brown and}} grey birds with short tails and stubby, {{powerful}} beaks. The differences between sparrow species can be subtle. Members {{of this family}} {{range in size from}} the chestnut sparrow (Passer eminibey), at 11.4 cm and 13.4 g, to the parrot-billed sparrow (Passer gongonensis), at 18 cm and 42 g. Sparrows are physically similar to other seed-eating birds, such as finches, but have a vestigial dorsal outer primary feather and an extra bone in the tongue. This bone, the preglossale, helps stiffen the tongue when holding seeds. Other adaptations towards eating seeds are specialised bills and elongated and specialised <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{food sources}} of the leptocephali of the teleostean {{superorder}} Elopomorpha have been controversial, yet observations on the leptocephali of the worm eels, Myrophis spp. (family Ophichthidae) collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico indicate active, not passive, feeding. Leptocephali had protists in their <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals.</b> Estimates of the physiological energetics of worm eels indicate that large aloricate protozoa including ciliates could provide substantial energy to these leptocephali {{toward the end of}} the premetamorphic and metamorphic stages, given the low energy requirements of metamorphosing leptocephali. Global ocean warming will likely force a shift in oceanic food webs; a shift away from large protozoa toward smaller protists is possible. Such a disruption of the oceanic food webs could further compromise the survival of leptocephali...|$|R
40|$|Neutron {{activation}} {{study of}} elementary composition {{was performed on}} edible sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus from the National Park of Port-Cros. The analysis allows the identification and quantification of 22 elements: antimony, arsenic, baryum, bromine, cerium, chromium, cesium, cobalt, gold, iron, lanthane, potassium, sodium, rubidium, samarium, scandium, selenium, silver, strontium, thorium, uranium and zinc. The concentration levels {{were higher in the}} soft organic parts (<b>alimentary</b> <b>canals</b> and gonads) for all the elements, except far strontium, which developped a strong affinity with calcareous hard parts (tests, spines, masticating apparatus). We also found high rates of baryum, arsenic, zinc, bromine and iron. The hypothesis on the origin of these elements is discussed.

25|$|All bilaterians have a {{gastrointestinal}} tract, {{also called}} a gut or an <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal.</b> This is a tube that transfers {{food to the}} organs of digestion. In large bilaterians, the gastrointestinal tract generally also has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of feces (solid wastes). Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth).|$|E
2500|$|Certain ceratioids rely on parabiotic reproduction. Free-living {{males and}} unparasitized females in these species never have fully {{developed}} gonads. Thus, males never mature without attaching to a female, and die if they cannot find one. [...] At birth, male ceratioids are already equipped with extremely well-developed olfactory organs that detect scents in the water. Males of some species also develop large, highly specialized eyes that may aid in identifying mates in dark environments. The male ceratioid lives solely {{to find and}} mate with a female. They are significantly smaller than a female anglerfish, and may have trouble finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, growth of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals</b> of some males becomes stunted, preventing them from feeding. Some taxa have jaws that are never suitable or effective for prey capture. These features mean the male must quickly find a female anglerfish to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male to detect the pheromones that signal the proximity of a female anglerfish.|$|R
60|$|The {{combination}} of any acid with a base is much facilitated by agitation, as fresh surfaces are thus continually brought into contact. This will be thoroughly effected with the particles {{of stone and}} earth in the intestines of worms, during the digestive process; {{and it should be}} remembered that the entire mass of the mould over every field, passes, {{in the course of a}} few years, through their <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals.</b> Moreover as the old burrows slowly collapse, and as fresh castings are continually brought to the surface, the whole superficial layer of mould slowly revolves or circulates; and the friction of the particles one with another will rub off the finest films of disintegrated matter as soon as they are formed. Through these several means, minute fragments of rocks of many kinds and mere particles in the soil will be continually exposed to chemical decomposition; and thus the amount of soil will tend to increase.|$|R
40|$|Background: Rodents are an {{important}} source of zoonotic diseases for human. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the infectivity of rodents with intestinal helminths in North Khorasan Province, Iran. Methods: One hundred and thirteen rodents were collected using different collection methods such as kill and live traps, digging of their burrow, filling of their hiding places with water and hand net during 2011 - 2013. Their <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals</b> were removed in the laboratory and helminths were determined in the department of parasitology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Results: Thirteen species of helminths parasites were found in 13 species of rodents, including Aspiculuris tetraptera, Hymenolepis diminuta, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Protospirura Seurat, Rictolaria ratti, Skrjabinitaenia lobata, Streptopharagus kuntzi, Syphacia obvelata, Taenia taeniaeformis, Trichuris muris, Cysticercus fasciolaris, Acanthocephal. spp and Trichuris spp. Some of them were reported for the first time in new host in Iran. S. obvelata and A. tetraptera were the most frequent parasites and P. Seurat, R. ratti and C. fasciolaris were found only in one rodent.

25|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract (digestive tract, digestional tract, GI tract, GIT, gut, or <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal)</b> is an organ system within humans {{and other animals}} which takes in food, digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces.

25|$|Experiments with P. h. humanus (body lice) {{emphasize}} the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with {{six or more}} males will die in a few days, having laid very few eggs. Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement. The female laid only one egg after mating, and her entire body was tinged with redâ€”a condition attributed to rupture of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal</b> during the sexual act. Old females frequently die following, if not during, intercourse.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>alimentary</b> <b>canal,</b> insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax (adjacent to the fore-gut). The salivary glands (30) produce saliva; the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium behind the hypopharynx; which movements of the mouthparts help mix saliva with food in the buccal cavity. Saliva mixes with food, which travels through salivary tubes into the mouth, beginning the process of breaking it down.|$|E

Concentration levels were higher in soft organic parts (<b>alimentary</b> <b>canals</b> and gonads) for all the elements except for Sr which showed a strong affinity for calcareous parts (tests, spines and masticating apparatus). Certain elements present in the soft organic parts are rarefy found in the hard parts. More than half the elements studied show higher concentrations in Marseille samples than in the referential region of Port-Cros National Park (France).

This hypothesis is confirmed with regard to elements the values of which decrease significantly with the distance from the sewage emission point, e. g. Cr, Fe and Zn, and a little less for Ag, Pa, Ce, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm and Th.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} made of the {{relationship}} between body weight and the amino acid (AA) excretion of fasted adult Single Comb White Leghorn cockerels. Thirty birds, maintained on a balanced corn-soy diet and individually housed, were weighed and fasted for 30 hr to rid their <b>alimentary</b> <b>canals</b> of feed residues. They were then carried through another 30 hr fast during which metabolic plus endogenous (M+E) excreta were collected and analyzed for the different AA. There was a significant (P<. 05) correlation between body weight of the birds and the excretion levels of most M+E AA. However, the highest correlation coefficient was of the order of about. 45. This meant that the maximum variation in the M+E AA excretion associated with changes in body weight was of the order of only 20 %. It is concluded from these results that the use of birds of similar body weight as the basis for determining the correction for M+E AA losses in deriving true AA availability (TAAA) values could generate erroneous data. The implications of basing the correction for M+E AA losses upon a small group of randomly selected birds or upon birds of similar body weight to derive TAAA values are discussed.
