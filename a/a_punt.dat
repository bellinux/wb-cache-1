5|$|In {{his first}} {{thirteen}} weeks {{as a professional}} football player, Hester recorded six return touchdowns, including <b>a</b> <b>punt</b> return in his NFL debut, and a then-record tying 108-yard touchdown from a missed field goal against the New York Giants. He also returned <b>a</b> <b>punt</b> for a clutch 83-yard game-winning touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals to give the Bears the lead in a comeback win, and two kickoff returns in one game against the St. Louis Rams. Following his record-breaking game during Week 14, opposing teams exercised additional caution when allowing Hester to return kicks. During the postseason Hester ran back <b>a</b> <b>punt</b> at a critical moment against the Seattle Seahawks, but it was called back on a blocking penalty. Regardless, the Bears won both NFC playoffs rounds, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI to play the Indianapolis Colts. He started the game on a high note for the Bears by returning the game’s opening kick for a touchdown. The feat was the first touchdown return of an opening kickoff in Super Bowl history. It also marked the quickest touchdown scored in Super Bowl history {{as well as the}} quickest lead ever taken by any team, though the latter record has since been surpassed by the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII. Following the kick, the Colts did not kick the ball directly to Hester, significantly limiting the Bears’ return efforts.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech wide receiver Bryan Still was named the game's most valuable player. He caught six passes for 119 yards and one touchdown. He also returned <b>a</b> <b>punt</b> for 60 yards and a touchdown, and his 27-yard reception {{in the third quarter}} set up Tech's third touchdown two plays later. Still's punt return was the longest in Virginia Tech bowl-game history to that point and was surpassed in the 2008 Orange Bowl when Justin Harper returned <b>a</b> <b>punt</b> 84 yards for a touchdown. Tech tight end Bryan Jennings was the Hokies' second-leading receiver; he finished the game with six catches for 77 yards. Four other players had two or fewer receptions.|$|E

Johnson's running abilities made him a standout pro football prospect as a black athlete at a primarily white college.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, <b>a</b> muffed <b>punt</b> is <b>a</b> turnover. In the NFL, <b>a</b> muffed <b>punt</b> {{recovered}} by the kicking team {{cannot be}} challenged by a coach for review, {{due to the}} fact that all turnovers are automatically reviewed.|$|R
5000|$|The AFC's Billy [...] "White Shoes" [...] Johnson {{was named}} the game's MVP on the {{strength}} of <b>a</b> 90-yard <b>punt</b> return touchdown and <b>a</b> second <b>punt</b> return of 55 yards that set up a field goal. The referee was Fred Silva.|$|R

Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession that resulted in <b>a</b> <b>punt.</b> On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, {{thanks in part to}} an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E

5|$|Elective safeties {{are more}} common in Canadian football, where they can result in better field {{position}} than <b>a</b> <b>punt.</b> The 2010 Edmonton Eskimos surrendered a Canadian Football League (CFL)-record 14 safeties, a factor that led CFL reporter Jim Mullin to suggest increasing {{the value of the}} safety touch from two to three points as a deterrent.|$|E
