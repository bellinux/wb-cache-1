50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as each lake {{developed}} its own steady summer tourism, recreational fishermen {{who sought to}} increase their catches began to introduce new fish species, and these eventually overwhelmed the native silver trout. Yellow perch, which eat trout eggs, and lake trout, which hold the same ecological niche, as well as eat and hybridize with other char species, were particularly devastating.

5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of <b>Atlantic</b> tomcod and <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|R
40|$|Nonnative {{species and}} changes in the abiotic {{environment}} are current drivers of ecological change around the world. Understanding and forecasting the response of fish populations and communities to these types of changes is the focus of the following research conducted in Lake Champlain. Three general themes run throughout this work: adaptation to change, fish early life history, and spatial ecology. In the first section of this work, we compared hatch timing, abundance, growth rates, and subsequent survival of age 0 <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> Osmerus mordax and alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> hatched almost a month earlier than alewife. Later hatching individuals of both species grew faster than those hatching earlier. Because cannibalism by <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> is likely the mortality source for age- 0 <b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> early hatching may not be advantageous as the overlap between adult and age- 0 <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> is highest early in the season. However, alewife, first found in Lake Champlain in 2003, may increase age 0 <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> summer mortality. Increased summer mortality in <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> should, in turn, favor selection for early hatching. Using stable isotopes of C and N, we found that alewife are now a large component of predator diets, and in particular of the diets of Atlantic salmon and walleye. Walleye and <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> [delta] 15 N values changed significantly from prealewife [delta] 15 N values of the late 1990 's. These changes represent a preferential switch to feeding on alewife by Atlantic salmon which was likely caused by the distribution patterns of these species. Distribution patterns of adults and age 0 fish were simulated on a daily basis, and subsequent age 0 mortality rates calculated. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> age 0 mortality rates are highest when <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> adults are abundant and alewife age 0 mortality rates are highest when alewife adults are abundant, allowing the two species to co-exist. Mortality rates were higher under normal temperature regimes, but late-summer mortality rates were higher in our climate change scenario because of increased overlap of adult and age 0 distributions. Our simulation suggests spatial distribution patterns should be accounted for when forecasting the interacting effects of climate change aquatic nonnative species. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{decline of}} the species has been largely caused by {{overfishing}} and predation from the invading sea lamprey. The introduced alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax) are also aggressive predators of juveniles. Blackfin ciscoes were commercially fished until the early 1900s when declining stocks made the fishery uneconomic. Current threats to the only remaining population include commercial fishing, predation by <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and interbreeding with lake herring (Coregonus artedi).|$|R
40|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax) {{are small}} {{anadromous}} fish {{that live in}} nearshore coastal waters {{during much of the}} year and migrate to tidal rivers to spawn during the spring. They are a key prey species in marine food webs, as they are consumed by larger organisms such as striped bass, bluefish, and seabirds. In addition, smelt are valued culturally and economically, as they support important recreational and commercial fisheries. The Atlantic Coast range of <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> has been contracting in recent decades. Historically, populations extended from the Delaware River to eastern Labrador and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Buckley 1989). More recent observations indicate that <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> spawning populations have been extirpated south of Long Island Sound, and evidence of spawning activity is extremely limited between Long Island and Cape Cod, MA. In the Gulf of Maine region, spawning runs are still observed, but monitoring surveys as well as commercial and recreational catches indicate that these populations have also declined (e. g., Chase and Childs 2001). Many diverse factors could drive the recently noted declines in <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> populations, including spawning habitat conditions, fish health, marine environmental conditions, and fishing pressure. Few studies have assessed any of these potential threats or their joint implications. In 2004, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) listed <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> as a species of concern. Subsequently, the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts were awarded a grant through NMFS’s Proactive Conservation Program to gather new information on the status of <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> identify factors that affect spawning populations, and develop a multi-state conservation program.

50|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> are anadromous, {{ascending}} from saltwater to freshwater to spawn. Smelt {{are also}} capable of completing their life history exclusively in freshwater. Landlocked adult <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> spawn shortly after ice-off {{at night in}} the lower reaches of streams. Shaw found in his research that no shoreline spawning had ever occurred. McKenzie states that the number of eggs extruded by a female is positively related to its size and Nellbring stated in his 1989 research that the eggs are adhesive and attach to substrates such as gravel, sand, mud, or submerged vegetation. Eggs are left unattended and hatch in 1-4 weeks, depending on water temperature. The time to sexual maturity is dependent on food supply and water temperature and abundant food and warmer temperatures encourage faster growth.

50|$|The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax) is {{a species}} of fish of the family Osmeridae. Its {{distribution}} is circumpolar, {{and it has been}} introduced to the Great Lakes, and from there has made its way to various other places. Walleye, trout, and other larger fish prey on these <b>smelt.</b> The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> prefer juvenile ciscoes, zooplankton such as calanoid copepods (Leptodiaptomus ashlandi, L. minutus, L. sicilis), and other small organisms, but are aggressive and will eat almost any fish they find. They are anadromous spring spawners and prefer clean streams with light flow and light siltation. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> face several barriers. They are weak swimmers and cannot overcome most fish ladders. This prevents them from making it past the dams to the headwater streams where they spawn. The rise in erosion and dams helped to decimate the smelt population in the 1980s. There are currently plans to try to reduce damming and to help control erosion. With current efforts to reduce the human impact on this and many other affected species the population is back on the rise.|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} stable isotopes {{of carbon}} (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) and fatty acid profiles in Lake Ontario alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) collected from 1982 to 2008 to investigate how temporal variability in these ecological tracers {{can relate to}} ecosystem-level changes associated {{with the establishment of}} highly invasive dreissenid mussels. Prey fish δ 15 N values remained relatively constant, with only slimy sculpin exhibiting a temporal increase in δ 15 N. In contrast, δ 13 C values for alewife, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and, especially, slimy sculpin became less negative over time and were consistent with the benthification of the Lake Ontario food web associated with dreissenids. Principal components analysis revealed higher contributions of 14 : 0 and 16 : 1 n- 7 fatty acids and increasingly negative δ 13 C values in older samples in agreement with the greater historical importance of pelagic production for alewife, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and slimy sculpin. Temporal declines in fatty acid unsaturation indices and Σn- 3 /Σn- 6 ratios, and also increased 24 : 0 / 14 : 0 ratios for alewife, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and slimy sculpin, indicated the increasing importance of nearshore production pathways for more recently collected fish and resulted in values more similar to those for round goby. These results indicate a temporal convergence of the food niche, whereas food partitioning has historically supported the coexistence of prey fish species in Lake Ontario. This convergence is consistent with changes in food-web processes associated with the invasion of dreissenid mussels...|$|R

5000|$|In 1883 Stedman and Argyle {{found that}} the <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> {{consumed}} bloaters (Coregonus hoyi) and alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus). However, they also stated that this predator had not affected the population of bloaters but that impact could be a possibility. A 2003 study by Horppila et al. shows that smelt densities can exceed 40,000 individuals per hectare and may create a large predation pressure on the lake. Horppila et al. also states that a single smelt can consume between [...]12 grams and [...]14 grams. Another study showed that in Lake Ontario the primary food sources for <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> were slimy sculpins (Cottus cognatus) and opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta), but nothing was said on whether this predation had {{significant impact on the}} populations. In 1973 Havey reported that there was increased growth in landlocked Atlantic salmon populations after the introduction of the smelt. It was also shown by Brandt and Madon in 1986 that adult lake trout (Salvalinus namaycush) could be a keystone predator species for the smelt. Hrabik et al. (1998) found evidence of competition for food between introduced <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and native yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Wisconsin lake habitats, and smelt may be partially responsible for the decline of Great Lakes whitefish (Coregonus spp.). The U.S. EPA stated in 2008 that they believe the smelt contributed to the extinction of the blue pike (Stizostedion vitreum glaucum) by outcompeting for food.

Ovarian eggs from females were examined histologically. Oocytes from the chromatin-nucleolus stage to the ripe stage were found in the ovaries. From May to August, females had immature oocytes in the yolkless stage and yolk vesicle stage. Postovulatory follicles were also found in the ovaries of females collected from the bay in May. After November, a bimodal distribution of egg diameter was observed. More advanced oocytes developed from the primary-yolk stage in November to the migratory-nucleus stage in April. These observations indicate that group-synchronous oocyte development occurred. All oocytes in the migratory-nucleus stage from females collected by set nets in the coastal area off Mori were found in late April. From late April to mid-May, oocytes of females collected from the two rivers were in the ripe stage. These results suggest that <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> inhabiting Funka Bay spawn from late April to mid-May in the rivers flowing into the western coast of the bay.

Our objective was to compare the expected {{effects of climate change}} and invasion of non-indigenous <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax) on cisco (Coregonus artedii) population extirpations at a regional level. We assembled a database of over 13, 000 lakes in Wisconsin, USA, summarising fish occurrence, lake morphology, water chemistry, and climate. We used A 1, A 2, and B 1 scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of future temperature conditions for 15 general circulation models in 2046 – 2065 and 2081 – 2100 totalling 78 projections. Logistic regression indicated that cisco tended to occur in cooler, larger, and deeper lakes. Depending upon the amount of warming, 25 – 70 % of cisco populations are predicted to be extirpated by 2100.
