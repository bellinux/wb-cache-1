5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was a Republican in <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E

Gaza had <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> young population {{with more than half}} being between the ages of infancy to 19 (60.8%).

5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E

The census also revealed that refugees made up 6.1% of the total residents.|$|E
5|$|In the battle, {{which took}} place {{primarily}} on a rise about three-quarters of a mile (onekm) from the fort itself, a French army of about 3,600 men under General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and the Chevalier de Levis decisively defeated <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> numerically superior force of British troops under General James Abercrombie, which frontally assaulted an entrenched French position without using field artillery, a lack that left the British and their allies vulnerable and allowed the French to win a decisive victory. The battle was the bloodiest of the American theater of the war, with over 3,000 casualties suffered. French losses were about 400, while more than 2,000 were British.|$|E

The decision came after <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> positive text message poll from the club's supporters to use the Bradford End of the ground. Visiting team fans have been accommodated in the end blocks of the East Stand {{since the start of the}} 2008–09 season. Since the 2013–14 Season away fans have moved back to the TL Dallas stand.|$|E

5|$|With the Principality's full {{independence}} in 1878, and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key {{city in the}} Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia as a whole remained those of <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> agrarian country, even {{with the opening of}} a railway to Niš, Serbia's second city, and in 1900 the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Yet by 1905 the population had grown to more than 80,000, and by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, not counting Zemun which then belonged to Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, George {{maintained}} {{a strong relationship}} with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete, <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> Greek island that remained under Ottoman Turk control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port Piraeus to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War. During the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869), the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, {{who was in charge of}} Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and signed off on the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the nature}} of {{self-evaluation}} motives? The relativist perspective suggests that self-evaluation motives vary culturally, with self-enhancement developing in Western culture and self-effacement and self-improvement developing in East Asian culture. The universalist perspective suggests that self-enhancement and self-improvement are basic human motives that coexist in the self-system and are prevalent across cultures. We tested the competing perspectives in a cross-cultural study. Chinese and American students rated {{the degree to which they}} want to receive four types of feedback (self-enhancing, self-effacing, self-improving, and no-feedback) from four sources (parents, teachers, friends, and classmates). Chinese and Americans (<b>a)</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> wanted self-enhancing and self-improving feedback more than self-effacing feedback and no-feedback and (b) were uninterested in self-effacing feedback. These findings attest to the universal nature of self-enhancement and self-improvement motive...|$|R

5|$|Switzerland has <b>an</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> {{private sector}} economy and low tax rates by Western World standards; overall {{taxation}} {{is one of}} the smallest of developed countries. Switzerland is a relatively easy place to do business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union. According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.|$|E

40|$|Two large kindreds with HLA-linked, {{autosomal}} dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA 1) were examined with markers from chromosome 6 p {{to determine the}} location of the SCA 1 locus. Results of the three-point analysis between the markers HLA-A, SCA 1, and F 13 <b>A</b> <b>overwhelmingly</b> favor the conclusion that SCA 1 is located distal of HLA and proximal of F 13 A. In addition, our data strongly support the conclusion that SCA 1 lies centromeric and genetically very close to the highly informative D 6 S 89 marker within the 8 -cM chromosomal segment flanked by the D 6 S 88 and D 6 S 89 markers. In the two kindreds, one recombinant was observed between D 6 S 89 and SCA 1, resulting in a recombination fraction of. 014 between the two loci...|$|R
