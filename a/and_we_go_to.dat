500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Lil X on the weekend of July 4, 2010 in Los Angeles. [...] Minaj took to her Twitter, asking fans who {{they would like to}} see portray her love interest in the video. Minaj was interviewed on the set of [...] "Your Love" [...] by MTV News while wearing a pink and purple kimono as a geisha for the video. In the interview, Minaj said, [...] "We wanted to have geisha themes, samurai themes, stuff like that. I wanted to tell a love story. It's just kinda liking a guy, where he's not really for you to like — the forbidden fruit — and me and this other girl happen to like him <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war." [...] The video premiered July 21, 2010 on MTV.com. Actor Michael Jai White portrays Minaj's love interest in the video.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with USA Today, Azalea talked about {{the concept of the}} music video, mentioning Spears's signature dance scenes, [...] "I think Britney's identity is really embedded in being a dancer, and that's something she really wanted to do as well. So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed she looked to actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really kind of funny, because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a club. The best part about it was just us coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We were all about being characters, so it was kind of funny for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E
6000|$|... "Never even {{suggested}} it," [...] Cecil declared eagerly. [...] "Fact is, we're out shooting all day, duck shooting, or fishing, or motoring, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed soon after dinner." ...|$|E
60|$|I obeyed, {{not without}} difficulty, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> find Retief.|$|R
60|$|I nodded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{that corner}} of the plateau where Shadrach stood apart, {{watching}} and listening.|$|R
60|$|We {{wound up}} our affairs at Saint Domingo, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> England to take {{possession}} of our new wealth.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are Foy van Goorl, Red Martin, Elsa Brant, {{a wounded}} {{man and a}} prisoner, escaped from Haarlem, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the house of Lysbeth van Goorl in the Bree Straat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall," [...] {{said her}} small companion. [...] "I {{am going to}} play marnels afore supper, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> supper at six o'clock, because father comes home. Does your father come home at six too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The boat's full to the hatches <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea to-morrow," [...] Wyndham said. [...] "If {{the wind}} keeps fair, I expect {{to put you}} on board the Spanish liner for the Canaries in three or four days. You'll {{transfer}} to a homeward Cape boat when you arrive." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} we were both ready, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Checco. <b>We</b> found him {{seated at a table}} {{polishing}} a dagger.|$|R
6000|$|At this moment, {{however, the}} gong for {{dressing}} sounded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> our several apartments, after this emotional specimen of [...] "Evenings at Home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, make it lunch,' said I. 'I am hungry, and I do {{not want}} to wait to get up a dinner.' Anita agreed <b>to</b> this, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> work to take the lid off a hamper which she told me had been packed by Mrs. Parker <b>and</b> {{contained}} everything <b>we</b> should want for several days.|$|R
6000|$|For {{our white}} and our {{excellent}} nights---for the nights of [...] swift running. [...] Fair ranging, far seeing, good hunting, sure cunning! [...] For {{the smells of}} the dawning, untainted, ere dew has departed! [...] For the rush through the mist, and the quarry blind-started! [...] For the cry of our mates when the sambhur has wheeled and is [...] standing at bay, [...] For the risk and the riot of night! [...] For the sleep at the lair-mouth by day, [...] It is met, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the fight. [...] Bay! O Bay! ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'We {{all want}} a little {{patching}} and repairing {{from time to time}},' he chirped. 'Like a ship, my dear sir,--exactly like a ship. Sometimes the hull is out of order, and we consult the surgeon; sometimes the rigging, and then I advise; sometimes the engines, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the brain-specialist; sometimes the look-out on the bridge is tired, and then we see an oculist. I should recommend you to see an oculist. A little patching and repairing from time to time is all we want. An oculist, by all means.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty days {{towards the}} setting sun," [...] I said. As he {{remained}} silent I added: [...] "I heard that I could find {{gold in the}} mountains there. An old man told me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> look for gold." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was by {{this time}} close on morning, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed. (Mem., this diary seems horribly like the {{beginning}} of the [...] "Arabian Nights," [...] for everything has to break off at cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{said she}} ’ad {{been in love}} with me all along," [...] ses Sam, filling their glasses agin to cheer ’em up. [...] "We went out arter tea and bought the engagement-ring, and then she got {{somebody}} to mind the shop <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Pagoda music-’all." ...|$|R
60|$|My Edward and I, then, are happy: and {{the more}} so, because those we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.|$|E

6000|$|... “It is simple,” {{said one}} of the peons. “Comes this señor the American, into the wine‐shop of Cananos where we are sitting. There he takes a glass of Vermouth and goes away. Then comes a man {{slipping}} by where it is darkest, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> warn the señor taking the caña bottle. It appears there is another man waiting in this doorway, there is a struggle, and Vincente strikes down one of the prowlers with the bottle. He gets to his feet again, and they go in haste when they hear you coming. Then we find the señor faint and short of breath.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{had a good}} time... I was in {{the studio}} with Scott Storch <b>and</b> <b>we</b> wanted to have a party record, a record that'd make you get up <b>and</b> dance. So <b>we</b> {{literally}} <b>went</b> out <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a club <b>and</b> partied <b>and</b> <b>we</b> got a little inspiration."

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that will}} be best," [...] said Milray. [...] "But I shall give you a letter to my sister. She and I used to be famous cronies, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a great many parties {{together}} {{when we were young}} people. We thought the world was a fine thing, then. But it changes." ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{night it}} blew what Pomona called a [...] "whirlicane," [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed very early to keep warm. We heard our boarder on deck {{in the garden}} after we were in bed, and Euphemia said she could not imagine what he was about, unless he was {{anchoring}} his turnips {{to keep them from}} blowing away.|$|R
6000|$|I {{thank the}} generous gondolier, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Hall--a dismal, bleak place, ghastly with the {{memories}} of last year's opulence and plenty, and here Giuseppe's fare is swelled by the stranger's mite. But here Giuseppe tells me of the [...] "Relief Boat" [...] which leaves for the flooded district in the interior, and here, profiting by the lesson he has taught me, I make the resolve to turn my curiosity to the account of others, and am accepted of those who go forth to succor and help the afflicted. Giuseppe takes charge of my carpetbag, and does not part from me until I stand on the slippery deck of [...] "Relief Boat No. 3." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jone, [...] "if we're {{going to}} busy our minds with these people's {{shortcomings}} and long-goings, and don't try to reform them, we're just worrying ourselves and doing them no good, and I don't {{think it will}} pay. Now, for instance, there's that rosy-cheeked Hannah. She's satisfied with her way of speaking English, and Miss Pondar understands it and is satisfied with it, {{and all the people}} around here are satisfied with it. As for us, we know, when she comes and stands in the doorway and dimples up her cheeks, and then makes those sounds that are more like drops of molasses falling on a gong than anything else I know of, we know that she is telling us in her own way that the next meal, whatever it is, is ready, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|Dined at the Royal Society Club, where, as usual, was a {{pleasant}} meeting of from twenty to twenty-five. It {{is a very good}} institution; we pay two guineas only for six dinners in the year, present or absent. Dine at five, or rather half-past five, at the Royal Hotel, where we have an excellent dinner, with soups, fish, etc., and all in good order; port and sherry till half-past seven, then coffee, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Society. This has great influence in keeping up the attendance, it being found that this preface of a good dinner, to be paid for whether you partake or not, brings out many a philosopher who might not otherwise have attended the Society. Harry Mackenzie, now in his eighty-second or third year, read part of an Essay on Dreams. Supped at Dr. Russell's usual party,[56] which shall serve for one while.|$|E
60|$|Our boy {{was greatly}} {{surprised}} when {{we told him}} sitting out in the balcony in the starlight, and he ran over some of those stories of former Lodgers, of the Major's putting down, and asked wasn't it possible {{that it might be}} this lodger or that lodger. It was not possible, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|R
5000|$|Wassman {{was born}} in Kailua-Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii. [...] In 1996, he started working with fellow bandmembers and bassist Brett Bollinger and Yesod Williams. The three {{of them have been}} friends since high school and started the band shortly after graduating. Kaleo said in an interview, [...] "Everyone <b>went</b> <b>to</b> college <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the bars...{laughing}." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At a {{shop where}} they sold souvenirs," [...] Lister replied. [...] "I didn't expect to meet her; I <b>went</b> in <b>to</b> buy some {{enameled}} things. It {{was a pretty}} good shop and the hotel clerk declared the people were all right. She knew me <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a tea-room. She left me at the door, and I think that's all." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS KNOX. No, Jo: {{you know}} I'm not. What better were my people than yours, {{for all their}} pride? But Ive noticed it all my life: we're ignorant. We dont really know whats right and whats wrong. We're all right as long as things go on the way they always did. We bring our {{children}} up {{just as we were}} brought up; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church or chapel just as our parents did; and we say what everybody says; and it goes on all right until something out of the way happens: theres a family quarrel, or one of the children goes wrong, or a father takes to drink, or an aunt goes mad, or one of us finds ourselves doing something we never thought we'd want to do. And then you know what happens: complaints and quarrels and huff and offence and bad language and bad temper and regular bewilderment as if Satan possessed us all. We find out then that with all our respectability and piety, weve no real religion and no way of telling right from wrong. Weve nothing but our habits; and when theyre upset, where are we? Just like Peter in the storm trying to walk on the water and finding he couldnt.|$|E
6000|$|Thumb {{opened his}} mouth at this. [...] "We are three, and you are many, Old Man of the Mountains," [...] he barked, [...] "but keep a civil tongue with us, for all that. We are neither thieves nor gluttons. We fight, oh yes, when it pleases us. But having no tails, we do not swing by them. We are Mulla-mulgars, my {{brothers}} and I, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the kingdom of our father's brother, Assasimmon, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar. He is a Prince, O Mulla-moona, who has more slaves in his palace and more Ukka-trees in the least of his seventy-seven gardens than your royal whiskers have hairs! On, then, we go! But be not afraid, Mulla-moona-mulgar. We will leave a few small stones of Arakkaboa behind us. But whether you will or whether you won't, on we go until the Harp sounds. Then our Meermuts will Tishnar welcome, and bid wander over these her mountains, never hungry, never thirsty, never footsore, with sweet-smelling lanterns to light us, and striped Zevveras to carry us, and gongs to make music. But if we live, Chief Mulgar of Kush, we will remember your words, I and my brother Ummanodda Nizza-neela, for he shall breathe them into a little book in the Zbaffle Oomgar's tongue for Prince Assasimmon to mock at in his Ummuz-fields." ...|$|E
60|$|Dinner having {{reached its}} end, we stroll {{in the garden}} {{when the weather is}} fine. When it rains, we make flannel {{petticoats}} for poor old women. What a horrid thing old age is to look at! To be ugly, to be helpless, to be miserably unfit for all the pleasures of life--I hope I shall not live to be an old woman. What would my father say if he saw this? For his sake, to say nothing of my own feelings, I shall do well if I make it a custom to use the lock of my journal. Our next occupation is to join the Scripture class for girls, and to help the teacher. This is a good discipline for Eunice's temper, and--oh, I don't deny it!--for my temper, too. I may long to box the ears of the whole class, but it is my duty to keep a smiling face and to be a model of patience. From the Scripture class we sometimes go to my father's lecture. At other times, we may amuse ourselves as well as we can till the tea is ready. After tea, we read books which instruct us, poetry and novels being forbidden. When we are tired of the books we talk. When supper is over, we have prayers again, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed. There is our day. Oh, dear me! there is our day.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> in <b>to</b> breakfast. On the table, {{beside my}} plate, was lying {{a letter from}} Cynthia.|$|R
60|$|So we loafed along home {{down the}} back lanes, feeling pretty glum and not talking. When we was passing {{the far corner of}} our tobacker field we heard the dog set up a long howl in there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the place <b>and</b> he was {{scratching}} the ground with all his might, {{and every now and then}} canting up his head sideways and fetching another howl.|$|R
60|$|We reached Paris at dusk {{three days}} later, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{straight}} <b>to</b> my old lodging in the Rue St. Antoine.|$|R
