5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui.

5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an anti-aircraft gun was a difficult proposition. As <b>a</b> <b>shell</b> had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by <b>a</b> <b>shell</b> detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>shelling</b> {{sequence}} of <b>a</b> finite set U of {{points in the}} Euclidean plane or a higher-dimensional Euclidean space is an ordering on the points such that, for each point p, there is a line (in the Euclidean plane, or a hyperplane in a Euclidean space) that separates p from all later points in the sequence. Equivalently, p must be a vertex of the convex hull of it and all later points. The partial <b>shelling</b> sequences of <b>a</b> point set form an antimatroid, called <b>a</b> <b>shelling</b> antimatroid. The feasible sets of the shelling antimatroid are the intersections of U with the complement of a convex set. Every antimatroid is isomorphic to <b>a</b> <b>shelling</b> antimatroid of points in a sufficiently high-dimensional space.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{ejection}} of planetary nebulae, the present work considers a star evolving up the red giant branch a second time.

It is concluded that the pulsation of long-period variables and the ejection of planetary nebulae are due to the same physical process: namely, radiation momentum and energy transfer to the gas. Furthermore, planetary nebulae ejection appears to be preceded by long-period variability...|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>shell</b> {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E

Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and—by his own account—upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.|$|E
