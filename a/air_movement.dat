5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and <b>air</b> <b>movement.</b> Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E

25|$|The lack, on {{both sides}} of the border, of roads and tracks {{suitable}} for vehicles meant that movement was limited to foot tracks mostly unmarked on any map, as well as water and <b>air</b> <b>movement.</b> There were many large rivers {{on both sides}} of the border, and these were the main means of movement, including hovercraft by the UK. There were also quite a few small grass airstrips suitable for light aircraft, as dropping zones for parachuted supplies, and for helicopters.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{is among}} the most {{powerful}} oxidizing agents known, far stronger than O2. It is also unstable at high concentrations, decaying to ordinary diatomic oxygen. It has a varying half-life length, depending upon atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity, and <b>air</b> <b>movement).</b> In a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas, ozone has a half-life of approximately a day at room temperature. Some unverified claims imply that ozone can have a half life as short as a half an hour under atmospheric conditions.|$|E
25|$|Sublimation: If the <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> in {{the tunnel}} is {{sufficiently}} non-turbulent, a particle stream released into the airflow will not break up as the air moves along, but stay together as a sharp thin line. Multiple particle streams released from a grid of many nozzles can provide a dynamic three-dimensional shape of the airflow around a body. As with the force balance, these injection pipes and nozzles need to be shaped {{in a manner that}} minimizes the introduction of turbulent airflow into the airstream.|$|E
40|$|A 4 -stroke-cycle test {{engine was}} {{equipped}} with a glass cylinder and the <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> within it were studied while the engine was being motored. Different types of air flow were produced by using shrouded intake valves in various arrangements and by altering {{the shape of the}} intake-air passage in the cylinder head. The <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> were made visible by mixing feathers with the entering air, and high-speed motion pictures were taken of them so that the air currents might be studied in detail and their velocities measured. Motion pictures were also taken of gasoline sprays injected into the cylinder on the intake stroke. The photographs showed that: a wide variety of induced <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> could be created in the cylinder; the movements always persisted throughout the compression stroke; and the only type of movement that persisted {{until the end of the}} cycle was rotation about the cylinder axis...|$|R

The role of 2 MCU was the logistic control and movement of defence personal and freight throughout New Zealand and abroad, utilising both civilian and military modes of transport.|$|R

25|$|Air drying is {{the drying}} of timber by exposing {{it to the}} air. The {{technique}} of air drying consists mainly of making a stack of sawn timber (with the layers of boards separated by stickers) on raised foundations, in a clean, cool, dry and shady place. Rate of drying largely depends on climatic conditions, and on the <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> (exposure to the wind). For successful air drying, a continuous and uniform flow of air throughout the pile of the timber needs to be arranged (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996).|$|E
25|$|Air {{is blown}} or sucked through a duct {{equipped}} with a viewing port and instrumentation where models or geometrical shapes are mounted for study. Typically the air is moved through the tunnel using a series of fans. For very large wind tunnels several meters in diameter, a single large fan is not practical, and so instead an array of multiple fans are used in parallel to provide sufficient airflow. Due to the sheer volume and speed of <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> required, the fans may be powered by stationary turbofan engines rather than electric motors.|$|E
25|$|O. revolutus’ namesake {{revolute}} leaf {{margins are}} very likely an adaption to the harsh growing conditions of its range, presumably adding structural integrity to leaves often exposed to frost, sleet and driving wind, {{as well as}} very high UV levels. The margins would also reduce <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> across the stomata, presumably protecting the plant from desiccation. This is supported by observations that plants growing in shady subalpine pockets—where the need for sunlight may offset {{the need for a}} tough exterior—tend to have flatter or broader leaves with recurved rather than revolute margins.|$|E

25|$|One scenario, {{in which}} there is {{absolutely}} no wind (<b>air</b> <b>movement),</b> corresponds to a field of zero-vectors. This scenario is uninteresting {{from the point of view}} of this theorem, and physically unrealistic (there will always be wind). In the case where there is at least some wind, the Hairy Ball Theorem dictates that at all times there must be at least one point on a planet with no wind at all and therefore a tuft. This corresponds to the above statement that there will always be p such that f(p) = 0.|$|E
25|$|Swami Rama, a yogi {{skilled in}} {{controlling}} his heart functions, was {{studied at the}} Menninger Foundation {{in the spring and}} fall of 1970 and was alleged by some observers at the foundation to have telekinetically moved a knitting needle twice from a distance of five feet. Although Swami Rama wore a face-mask and gown to prevent allegations that he moved the needle with his breath or body movements, and air vents in the room had been covered, at least one physician observer who was present at the time was not convinced and expressed the opinion that <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> was somehow the cause.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the {{charging}} process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement {{on some of the}} basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in {{the central part of the}} storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from −15 to −25 Celsius, see figure to the right. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and graupel (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.|$|E
