5|$|Alecto– The former Queen of the Furies, who {{aligned with}} Ares and bore their son Orkos. The {{leader of the}} sisters, she {{captured}} Kratos. Alecto tried deceiving Kratos into staying in imprisonment by becoming <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> his wife, Lysandra, but Kratos saw through the lie. Despite morphing into a giant sea monster, she was ultimately killed by Kratos. The character was voiced by Jennifer Hale.|$|E
5|$|The fourth movement, in sonata form {{but with}} {{characteristics}} of a rondo, is replete with Haydnesque false recapitulations and conclusions. In one example, the music lands in the tonic {{at the end of}} the recapitulation and apparent coda, and is followed by two measures of complete silence, creating <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> finality. However, the main theme is then reprised, and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later.|$|E

5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an illusionary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to dampen the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> Indrajit. Another {{surrogate}} Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E

5|$|Tidus makes few {{appearances}} in {{the plot of the}} 2003 sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, Yuna sees a sphere with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the hope of finding more clues that Tidus is alive. The individual in the sphere is later revealed as Shuyin. Depending on the player's development during the game, the fayth will appear to Yuna at the end and tell her that they can make Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an unlockable character as Star Player, a blitzball player. In Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play-through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. <b>An</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> Tidus also appears as a boss character.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{miniature}} {{is an art}} form, {{which can}} be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes. The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was {{different from that of the}} nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.|$|E

The beginning's attempt to hide what is before it is the true beginning, precisely like the attempt of 'the end' to hide what is after it, in order to seal that same beginning, is the true 'ending'. i.e the beginning is in need, right from the start, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> it being 'the beginning'; The beginning's <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> itself {{is the start of}} the beginning, and this <b>illusion</b> takes <b>a</b> spacial form.

25|$|Mirrors, {{typically}} {{large and}} unframed, are frequently used in interior decoration to create <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> space and amplify the apparent {{size of a}} room. They come also framed {{in a variety of}} forms, such as the pier glass and the overmantel mirror.|$|E
50|$|The megalethoscope was and {{is often}} {{confused}} with the stereoscope which was of a different design and effect. However, the megalethoscope and the alethoscope are capable <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> relief, that uses chromostereopsis.|$|R

25|$|When {{dealing with}} stone work, for example, Kuma {{displays}} a different character from the preexisting buildings of solid, heavy, traditional masonry construction. Instead his work surprises the eye by slimming down and dissolving {{the walls in}} an effort to express a certain “lightness” and immateriality, suggesting <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity and weakness not common to the solidity of stone construction.|$|E
25|$|The East European Plain {{encompasses}} most of European Russia. The West Siberian Plain, {{which is}} the world's largest, extends east from the Urals to the Yenisei River. Because the terrain and vegetation are relatively uniform {{in each of the}} natural zones, Russia presents <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> uniformity. Nevertheless, Russian territory contains all the major vegetation zones of the world except a tropical rain forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} built on a steep {{hillside}} in the Hollywood Hills {{at a time when}} the hills did not have the rich foliage present today. At the time of its construction, Storer House is said to have resembled a Pompeiian villa. Frank Lloyd Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, was both the on-site construction manager and the landscape architect, providing <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> a ruin barely visible within its jungle environment.|$|E

25|$|Craig {{believes}} that recent discoveries about {{the expansion of}} the universe and relativity theory support his view that thermodynamic properties of the universe show it is not eternal. Craig says that postulating a multiverse of worlds in varying thermodynamic states encounters the problem of Boltzmann brains—that it becomes highly probable for any observer that the universe is only <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> his own brain, a solipsistic conclusion Craig says no rational person would embrace.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the tower}} block in Birmingham, Plokta captures many people within its rooms {{by giving them}} <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> their hearts desire. Using the {{collected}} magical energy of these people, Plokta creates an army of Mindless Ones. When challenged by Captain Britain, Plokta reveals he has something Brian may want; Meggan. Captain Midlands betrayed his remaining comrades, allowing them to be captured by Plokta briefly. When the team eventually defeated Plokta, Midlands was taken into custody.|$|E
25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

5000|$|Rex Reed in {{his review}} for New York Observer concluded: [...] " [...] The characters' intense desires are framed within a sedate, workaday context, so {{that even though the}} characters' passions drive the action, {{director}} Andre Téchiné lends the film <b>an</b> appealing <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> calm." ...|$|R
