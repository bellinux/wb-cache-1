500|$|Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: [...] "There's {{probably}} a lot more stuff that has to happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, I think she has incredible discipline and she does, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Doch ist er nicht ein Konig. Beesmarck, {{he was not}} a king, Winifred, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said.</b> He was only-il n'etait que chancelier.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{give you}} leave {{to become a}} kehla--a wearer of the head-ring--although, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> are still but a boy, and with it a place upon my Council." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You must remember, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yourself, {{you have}} had so few advantages.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have got}} it all your way,' said Curlydown, without lifting his head. 'And then, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now,--I don't understand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it is <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> Herbert. Mrs. Raymond {{had left}} her in ignorance! The impudent baggage! That's what the world is coming to!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{shall be}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> wish,' <b>said</b> the parents; 'but if by-and-by trouble should come of it, {{it will be}} your fault and not ours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would, indeed, if I could, sir,--but it's {{just because}} I love her so, that I can't! Besides, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} <b>said,</b> he's a perfect stranger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{not going}} to quarrel with me, Will, because--because--because--. If you had really been my brother, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> once <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would be, you could not but have {{approved}} of what I have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|Helen pondered, {{and then}} remarked: [...] "Stephen {{is not your}} kind, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> You wanted to leave the prairie and live in a town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{you really}} want, I think,' he went on, as Miss McCabe resumed her seat, 'is {{to have your}} choice, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> among the competitors?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but we pay too much. That's what I can't bear. And <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yesterday, I don't think Mr. Ferris's manners {{are quite}} respectful to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{all this}} be true,' said I, 'and if your mission is indeed <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> why did <b>you</b> even now propose {{to make for}} France?' ...|$|R
6000|$|THE WOMAN. I {{am afraid}} I am {{as much in}} the dark <b>as</b> before. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> also that blood is thicker than water. No doubt it is; but what of it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've kept myself <b>as</b> {{straight}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have,' <b>said</b> Sophia. 'It's {{easy enough}} to be straight, when a person never cares for anybody, and nobody cares for a person.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then here's {{another way}} of looking at it. You'll need, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> at least fifty boys. Not {{counting}} premiums, their wages are thirty dollars a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{they are}} only equal in duties and in rights. But, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now, {{that is a very}} long story. Are they equal in nothing here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was thinking, sir, that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{there were}} {{a good many of}} that class in the army, the man might have the option of enlisting given him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>you</b> can do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please,' <b>said</b> he roughly; 'I'm going no nearer, so you {{can take}} your choice of getting into the dingey or of {{swimming}} for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You may do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please,” <b>said</b> Mrs. Westgate. “Only—if {{you desire}} the information—it {{is not the}} custom here for young ladies to knock about London with wild young men.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never thought}} {{so much of}} John Caldigate <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did,' <b>said</b> Mrs. Posttlethwaite. 'He {{seems to have been}} able to love a good many young women all at the same time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sublime if it's {{done with}} spontaneity, with passion; ridiculous if it's done 'after further reflexion.' <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> perfectly, a while ago, it isn't {{a thing to}} reason about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if two was {{no better}} than one, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> so {{yourself}} and as Grimshaw will bear witness, then three {{was no better}} than two except for an expense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't forgive you," [...] {{interrupted}} Bella pettishly. [...] "You are a false man. Nothing {{should have}} prevented you from walking round by Simpson's, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you would do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Oh, I will do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> wish,' <b>said</b> the delighted young German. 'Mr. Winslow and Mr. Vassall, they trusted me, and I {{have been}} such a fool. I hope {{it is not too}} late.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He cares {{only for}} his son and {{daughter}};--for the son and daughter of his first wife; for those two ignoble young persons who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> so often, are altogether unworthy of their name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I feel <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> in your letter, Frank. There IS {{something}} tragic in it. It {{will be with}} me for ever. All {{the future}} will arrange itself round that little ring.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{paid for}} the risk, guv'nor, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now," [...] the sailor remarked. [...] "But don't it seem kind o' hard on them as isn't--on the mates an' the hands?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} {{somewhat}} flushed. ‘I have some claim to both distinctions, sir, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> suppose,’ <b>said</b> he; ‘there is my card. I am the licentiate Roederer, {{author of several}} works on the {{theory and practice of}} politics.’ ...|$|R
