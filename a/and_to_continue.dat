5|$|Before {{the tunnel}} had been completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach its destination {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the news that the tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.|$|E

5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> for more or less time.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the march, the loyalist forces faced {{problems}} such as desertions, lack of discipline, illness, food shortages, and poor navigation. The march included several river crossings, which were made difficult {{by the lack of}} bridges, swollen rivers due to rain, as well as bogged down wagons and cannons. It was particularly difficult for the VOC forces, who were unfamiliar with the terrain of the Javanese interior. Hurdt wanted to stay in the Solo River valley, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the campaign in the following year. Amangkurat preferred to keep marching, and his opinion prevailed. As the loyalist forces marched eastwards, the rebel forces avoided major battle, but fought in skirmishes, and continued to endanger the loyalists' foragers and stragglers. The loyalists scoured the countryside to collect food, causing panic among its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{completed}} its preparations for full-scale offensive action by expanding its bridgehead at Gyékényes. The cavalry units continued {{to fight the}} Germans around Peteranec, but the left sector of the divisional front line began to disintegrate. The commander of the right sector, Pukovnik Mihailo Georgijević ordered his troops to hold their positions and went to divisional headquarters to ask approval to discharge the Croats in his units. Marić would not inform 4th Army headquarters of this idea, so Georgijević went to Zagreb to speak to Petrović, and to further urge him to withdraw all troops that still wanted to fight to a line south of the Sava. According to Georgijević, Petrović ordered him to tell Marić to consider disarming his Croat troops, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to hold positions on {{the line of the}} Bilogora, but to conduct a fighting withdrawal towards Zagreb and Sisak if the German pressure was too great. The intent of these orders was not implemented, as fifth column elements changed the wording so that orders were issued to discharge Croat troops and to retreat towards Zagreb without fighting.|$|E

5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The Parrett Navigation Act {{allowed the}} proprietors, of whom 25 were named, to raise £10,500 in shares and £3,300 by mortgage, {{with which to}} make {{improvements}} to the river from Burrow Bridge to Langport, to reconstruct the restrictive bridge at Langport, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the improvements as far as Thorney. The River Isle, which joined the Parrett at Muchelney, was to be improved for its first mile, and then the Westport Canal was to be constructed from there to Westport. Locks were planned at Stanmoor, Langport, and Muchelney, with a half-lock at Thorney. An extra lock was added at Oath, when tests revealed that the depth of water would not meet that specified in the Act without it. Costs were considerably higher than expected, and a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1839, to allow an extra £20,000 to be raised. The lock at Oath has since {{been replaced by a}} sluice gate to control flooding.|$|E

5|$|The new Ottoman army {{arrived on}} the island {{during the winter of}} 1666/1667, and in May, the final phase of the siege, overseen by the Grand Vizier himself, began. It would last for 28 months and cost the lives of 70,000 Ottoman soldiers, 38,000 conscripted Cretans and slaves who labored in the Ottoman siege works and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders. Faced with the renewed Ottoman assault and a {{struggling}} economy, despite the prospect of considerable reinforcements from Western Europe, in 1668 the Signoria hoped to end the war by striking a peace settlement with the Ottomans. Indeed, the Venetians hoped to use the imminent arrival of reinforcements to secure concessions from the Ottomans. Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin. Molin and his embassy traveled to Larissa, where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions. The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, emboldened by further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer. Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic.|$|E

The meeting was held in the village tavern of Wola. Paskevich demanded that Warsaw and Praga be surrendered unconditionally and that the Polish Army be evacuated and disarmed in Płock, where it was to await the decision of the tsar either to pardon the Polish soldiers or imprison them as rebels. Krukowiecki declined and insisted that the uprising was not a rebellion but a war waged by two independent states. He wanted Paskevich and Grand Duke Michael to promise the return of Poland's independence and a general amnesty in exchange for revoking the act of deposition of Nicholas from the Polish throne. The negotiations were stormy and around noon the Polish commander departed for Warsaw to consult the Sejm about further actions. Paskevich agreed to extend the cease-fire to 13:00, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> negotiations even if warfare was resumed.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The working {{population}} is aging and {{a shortage of}} workers is expected in the construction industry. As a consequence, it is considered necessary that construction workers extend their working life. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore factors associated with construction workers' ability <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working until the age of 65. Methods: In total, 5, 610 construction workers that participated in the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey Wlled out questionnaires on demographics, work-related and health-related factors, and on the ability <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working until the age of 65. Logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Older workers were more often able, but less willing, <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working until the age of 65. Frequently using force, lower supervisor support, lower skill discretion, and the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints were associated with both a lower ability <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working. In addition, dangerous work, occasionally using force, working in awkward postures, lack of job autonomy, and reporting emotional exhaustion were associated with a lower ability <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working, whereas working overtime was associated with a higher ability. Furthermore, low social support from colleagues was associated with a higher willingness. Conclusion: In addition to physical job demands, psychosocial job characteristics play a significant role in both the ability <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working until the age of 65 in construction workers. Moreover, preventing musculoskeletal complaints may support the ability <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working, whereas preventing emotional exhaustion is relevant for the ability <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working. © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|R
