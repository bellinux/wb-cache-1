25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} her picture, {{as well as a}} Christmas cake {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put him to bed and fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E

500|$|Hannah {{eventually}} {{began dating}} Simon, whom she {{met at a}} glazier where they both work. Despite their rules, Hannah sleeps with Simon and becomes pregnant, which upsets Eve, who makes {{an effort to get}} pregnant but is unable to do so; Hannah miscarries in the eighth month, much to Eve's relief. Years later, Simon meets Eve in a bar. The two begin an affair, and Eve becomes pregnant; by this time, Hannah is infertile. On their birthday, Simon gives a handmade mirror to Hannah, but they have an argument, and Hannah reveals that she has a sister who is pregnant; Simon realises he is the father. The following day, Hannah has an argument with Eve over the matter and the latter flees to Glasgow. Hannah, wearing Eve's wig, confronts Simon. Unaware that she is Hannah, Simon gifts her another mirror, stating his desire to be with Eve instead of Hannah. Hannah becomes furious, shattering the mirror and slicing Simon's throat with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> killing him, though this is said to be accidental. When Eve returns, the two agree to hide Simon's body, and use Eve's trip to Glasgow as an alibi. At the end of the interview, Eve says that Hannah is [...] "gone", asks to speak to a lawyer, and cryptically says that [...] "...all these stories we’ve been telling each other… just that… stories." [...] It is not entirely clear if Eve's story of being an identical twin is true, an intentional fabrication meant to confuse the police, or a case of split personality.|$|E
