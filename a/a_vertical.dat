50|$|Rocks {{are rarely}} if ever placed in {{straight}} lines or in symmetrical patterns. The most common arrangement is {{one or more}} groups of three rocks. One common triad arrangement has <b>a</b> tall <b>vertical</b> rock flanked by two smaller rocks, representing Buddha and his two attendants. Other basic combinations are <b>a</b> tall <b>vertical</b> rock with <b>a</b> reclining rock; <b>a</b> short <b>vertical</b> rock and <b>a</b> flat rock; and a triad of <b>a</b> tall <b>vertical</b> rock, <b>a</b> reclining rock and a flat rock. Other important principles are to choose rocks which vary in color, shape and size, to avoid rocks with bright colors which might distract the viewer, and make certain that the grains of rocks run in the same direction.|$|R

5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system composed of <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> shaft connecting {{the interior and}} exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> axis, {{usually in the}} same {{direction}} as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} {{researchers}} have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> position with their heads just below or at the surface. A 2008 study published in Current Biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with {{both sides of the}} brain. It appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.|$|E

5|$|Gaming {{peripheral}} company Hori produced PlayStation 2 controllers {{modeled after}} the Tiny Bee guns Yuna uses in Final Fantasy X-2. These controllers were released only in Japan. They were re-released in a new silver box {{to coincide with the}} release of Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission. They also released <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> stand for the console with a Final Fantasy X-2 logo that lights up in blue color when plugged into a powered console.|$|E
5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> orientation, {{even if the}} object {{depicted}} (e.g. fish, Orion’s belt) is usually seen horizontally. This serves the purposes of economy and aesthetic effect. The 'vertical rule' is important for interpreting the glyphs correctly, so it may have assisted in secrecy as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion {{patented}} {{a process}} to extract zinc from calamine in <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> retort style smelter. His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.|$|E
5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> position {{in order to}} allow riders to board. Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E
5|$|Monument 11 {{is located}} in the southwestern area of Terrace3, to the east of Structure8. It is a natural boulder carved with <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> series of five hieroglyphs. Further left is a single hieroglyph and the glyphs for the number11. This {{sculpture}} is considered to be in an especially early Maya style and dates to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. It is one of a row of 5 monuments running east-west along the southern edge of Terrace3.|$|E

However, {{on a hot day}} where temperatures are 70°F (21°C), its vertical rate of climb is reduced to 1,595 fpm (486 m/min), and service ceiling is reduced to 19,400 feet (5,900 m) due to less dense air.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in <b>a</b> <b>vertical</b> array focuses the low {{frequencies}} {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The Cispadane Republic and the Transpadane Republic, {{which had}} itself been using <b>a</b> <b>{{vertical}}</b> Italian tricolour from 1796, merged into the Cisalpine Republic and adopted the vertical square tricolour without badge in 1798.
