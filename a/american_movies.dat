25|$|Several {{countries}} charged Italian studios with {{exceeding the}} boundaries of acceptability with their late-1970s Nazi exploitation films, inspired by <b>American</b> <b>movies</b> such as Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS. The Italian works included the notorious but comparatively tame SS Experiment Camp and the far more graphic Last Orgy of the Third Reich (Italian: L'ultima orgia del III Reich). These films showed, in great detail, sexual crimes against prisoners at concentration camps. These films may still be banned in the United Kingdom and other countries.|$|E

500|$|The Hustler is {{fundamentally}} {{a story of}} what it means to be a human being, couched within the context of winning and losing. Describing the film, Robert Rossen said: [...] "My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused— and then he wins his pool game." [...] Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing The Hustler as [...] "one of the few <b>American</b> <b>movies</b> in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams." ...|$|E

[...] Critic Hal Erickson of AllRovi wrote that the film [...] "is a perfect balance of song and story from beginning to end". Mark Deming, also a critic for AllRovi, wrote that Jailhouse Rock it was [...] "one of [...] few vehicles which really caught his raw, sexy energy and sneering charisma on film." ...|$|E
