5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Audioslave was an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, {{but by the}} band's second album, Out of Exile, {{it was noted that}} they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.|$|E

This paper gives a general combinatorial formula expressing each xλ <b>as</b> <b>a</b> linear <b>combination</b> of the yα’s, where each coefficient in this linear combination is + 1, − 1, or 0.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E
5|$|Late on November8, Ida {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) and a barometric pressure of 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear and forward speed caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm. Only {{a small area}} of convection remained near the center by the morning of November9. Despite the strong shear, the storm quickly re-organized, attaining hurricane status {{for a third time}} during the afternoon. Based on readings from a nearby oil platform and reconnaissance data, it was determined that Ida attained its secondary peak intensity near the southeast coast of Louisiana with winds of 85mph (140km/h). However, this intensification was short-lived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of increasing wind shear and decreasing sea-surface temperatures induced weakening to a tropical storm within three hours.|$|E
