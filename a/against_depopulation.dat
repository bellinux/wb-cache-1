40|$|Mid−and near−mountain forested and {{agricultural}} areas have problems of continuous depopulation and aging of residents. Fukui Prefecture includes {{many areas of}} this type. The continuous depopulation may result from the current nationalwide motion of people to urban areas. In addition to the problems, natural disasters may give great impacts to living conditions in the areas and lead to deep depopulation. Our interview survey in Miyama Area and Kawada Area {{made it clear that}} the 2004 Fukui Heavy−Rainfall disaster did not cause considerable decrease in population. However, in the past, some small communities were wholly abandoned after natural disasters giving great damage. Whether community functions can be sustained after disasters, it depends on traffic convenience of the areas, scale of communities(size and populataion), active affection of land use, partnership between residents and the governments, and voluntary work of district resi-dents. Future plans <b>against</b> <b>depopulation</b> in mid−and near−mountain regions are inevitable to sustain the areas. The plans should be based on the geographic situations and residential opinions and visions. After field work and in-terview survey, we attempted to propose a future plan to sustain Ashimi District which belongs to Miyama Area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHoney bees play an {{important}} role in food production (honey, pollen etc.), and their pollinating activity is not only essential to maintain world agriculture production but also to ensure biodiversity in different ecosystems. Nosema ceranae is a highly prevalent worldwide pathogen for honey bees that has been related to colony losses. A commercial formulation that contains fumagillin dicyclohexylamine, Fumidil B®, can control N. ceranae infection. However, the effectiveness of Fumidil B® is affected by several factors, such as storage, treatment preparation, the quantity consumed by bees etc. Indeed, UV exposure (e. g. sunlight) drastically reduces the initial concentration of fumagillin within a few hours, while temperature affects its degradation. Although laboratory tests suggest that a semisolid mixture of honey and powdered sugar is the best option to apply fumagillin, its application in syrup (250  mL per dosage) is more effective for the treatment of infected colonies. The total amount of syrup containing fumagillin ingested by honey bees is a key factor in its efficacy, and it has been found that medicated patties were not fully consumed in field trials. In honey bee colonies, the dose of 120  mg/honey bee colony at the recommended posology is effective <b>against</b> <b>depopulation</b> and colony death due to N. ceranae after 1  year, without residues being detected in honey, although reinfection could be detected 4  months after treatment ended...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 This is a {{study of}} the {{representations}} of prostitutes and prostitution produced within a particular historical framework-regulationism. Drawing support from public health movements, campaigns <b>against</b> <b>depopulation</b> and degeneration and protest from feminists and socialists, the "French system" of regulation of prostitution occupied center stage in social debates from the mid-nineteenth century to 1975. Within this context, images of prostitutes and their work proliferated. Prostitutes came to symbolize the key tensions of modern, industrial, urban life. Like women generally, prostitutes represented the social body. Their bodies, as female bodies, were caught in a network of attempts to "properly" channel sexual activity. Through their "promiscuous" lifestyles, class origins, and social mobility, they violated key tenets of familialism, and models of proper womanhood, and they eluded the determined gaze of regulationists. Additionally, prostitution became associated with the "dangerous" working classes so that discourses about the control and regulation of prostitutes' bodies were inseparable from similar discourses about the control of the working classes. The bourgeois fears and anxieties about the threats of working-class revolt within the tight quarters of Paris brought to the surface underlying themes of the inherent danger of the city, the assumed irrationality of the "masses," and the threat posed by dangerous and sexually "loose" women. My method has been to examine these constructions and how they were produced in discourses. This makes my study a "discursive" one and situates my work in a particular genre of historical study usually referred to a "postmodern. " However, I would like to emphasize that part of my method has included an attempt to find a balance between the material conditions of a French society in transition by referring to the themes of industrialization and women's condition with the more linguistic aspects of the production of subjects through language. This approach necessarily makes my project limited; but, as I discuss in the conclusion, there are no historical records of desire and pleasure that can merely be taken up and reproduced for our contemporary eyes. I refer to this as an empirical problem in the history of sexuality in the Conclusion. I have found {{that it is impossible to}} "discover "what women (and men) thought and felt, which necessitates dealing with discursive production...|$|E
