5|$|Changes in Earth's {{magnetic}} field on a time scale of <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> {{are referred to}} as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees. A movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{geomagnetic}} field changes on time scales from milliseconds {{to millions of}} years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes {{can be traced to}} geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E
5|$|Stocks surged {{worldwide}} {{after the}} EU announced the EFSF's creation. The facility eased {{fears that the}} Greek debt crisis would spread, and this led to some stocks rising {{to the highest level}} in <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> The euro made its biggest gain in 18 months, before falling to a new four-year low a week later. Shortly after the euro rose again as hedge funds and other short-term traders unwound short positions and carry trades in the currency.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The first semi-permanent {{inhabitants}} of regions near Antarctica (areas situated {{south of the}} Antarctic Convergence) were British and American sealers who used to spend <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> on South Georgia, from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included Grytviken, Leith Harbour, King Edward Point, Stromness, Husvik, Prince Olav Harbour, Ocean Harbour and Godthul. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain Carl Anton Larsen, a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, {{only a few}} {{benthic species}} of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in {{aquarium}} conditions for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> This {{gave rise to the}} belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation. For a long time, the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long, but in September 2004, the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.|$|E
5|$|Breeding occurs {{from late}} August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. The nest is {{built by the}} female; it is a round or domed {{structure}} made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side {{close to the ground}} and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea. One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season. A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 × 16mm (½×⅝in), are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks. The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10–13days, by which time they are fledged. Young birds remain in the family group as helpers for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> before moving to another group, usually an adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{division}} {{was used to}} provide a pool of reinforcements for {{the division}}s which {{had been sent to}} the Korean War theater, and in January 1951 it provided 650 enlisted fillers for overseas service. Later that month, it was given 4,006 new recruits for its three infantry regiments and artillery assets, and each unit created a 14-week training program to prepare these new soldiers for combat. Because of heavy casualties and slow reinforcement rates, the Army looked to the National Guard to provide additional units to relieve the beleaguered Eighth Army. At the time, the 45th Infantry Division was comprised overwhelmingly of high school students or recent graduates and only about 60 percent of its divisional troops had conducted training and drills with the division for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Additionally, only about 20 percent of its personnel had prior experience of military service from World War II. Nevertheless, the division was one of four National Guard divisions identified as being among the most prepared for combat based on the effectiveness of its equipment, training, and leadership. As a result, in February 1951, the 45th Infantry Division was alerted that it would sail for Japan.|$|E

25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{can emerge}} despite slow reduction {{but can be}} reduced by a slower rate of withdrawal.
