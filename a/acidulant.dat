Journal of Animal Science, 94, 114 - 114. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 242 In the {{pet food}} industry, Salmonella is getting greater scrutiny {{because it is}} considered a “reasonably foreseeable hazard” {{with the implementation of}} the Food Safety Modernization Act. Specifically, there is zero tolerance for any serotype of Salmonella in pet foods. Salmonella contamination was responsible for 78 % of the Class I recalls in pet food {{according to the most recent}} Reportable Food Registry Report (FDA, 2015). One potential method of Salmonella mitigation shown to be effective was through coating the exterior of the kibble with a powdered dry <b>acidulant,</b> such as sodium bisulfate (SBS; Jones-Hamilton, Co.). Sodium bisulfate coating on both dog and cat kibbles was shown to provide complete mitigation of Salmonella within 14 -d storage (Jeffrey et al., 2014). However, it is thought that the use of dry <b>acidulant</b> with a palatant for coating kibble may negatively impact palatability of a dry dog food. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine if the use of a dry <b>acidulant,</b> SBS, would influence the palatability of a dry dog food. A single dry extruded all life stages dog food was collected from a commercial pet food manufacturer before the coating step. The kibble was coated with either 2. 2 % spray dried chicken liver + 0. 2 % SBS or 2. 2 % spray dried chicken liver + 0. 2 % powdered silica (control). A total of 20 beagles were used in a standard 2 -bowl forced choice palatability test method for 2 d. Dogs were fed 400 g of both diets once per day, with bowls rotated daily to address side bias. Results were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (Cary, NC). The inclusion of SBS did not affect daily preference of diet (P = 0. 23). Furthermore, there was no effect of day (P = 0. 18) or the interaction of treatment × day (P = 0. 98). These results demonstrate that palatability is not affected by the inclusion of SBS with a palatant in the coating of dog food kibble. Considering that the inclusion of SBS has been shown to be effective at mitigating Salmonella in pet food and no negative effects on palatability were observed, the use of a dry <b>acidulant</b> in a dog food coating gives the industry a promising method to control Salmonella contamination of finished dog foods...|$|E

The effects of these factors were determined on the shouldering region (parameter A), maximum death rate (parameter B), and tailing region (parameter C) of microbial inactivation curves. Increased temperature or sodium diacetate concentrations increased the death rate, whereas increased sodium lactate concentrations decreased heat resistance. Complex two-way interactive effects were also observed. As both temperature and sodium lactate increased, the death rate decreased; however, as temperature and sodium diacetate increased, the death rate increased. The effect {{of the interaction between}} sodium lactate and sodium diacetate on the maximum death rate varied with temperature.

40|$|Background: Intake of carbonated {{beverages}} has been associ-ated with increased fracture risk in observational studies. The usual explanation given {{is that one}} or more of the beverage con-stituents increase urinary calcium. Objective: We assessed the short-term effects on urinary cal-cium excretion of {{carbonated beverages}} of various compositions. Design: An incomplete random block design was used to study 20 – 40 -y-old women who customarily consumed ≥ 680 mL car-bonated beverages daily. Four carbonated beverages were tested: 2 with caffeine and 2 without. Two contained phosphoric acid as the <b>acidulant</b> and 2 contained citric acid. The study included one neutral control (water) and one positive control (skim or chocolate milk). Serving size was 567 mL for the car-bonated beverages and water and 340 mL for the milks. Bever-ages were consumed with a light breakfast after an overnight fast; no other foods were ingested until urine collection was complete. pH, titratable and total acidity, sodium, creatinine, and calcium were measured in 2 -h (morning) fasting and 5 -h postbeverage urine specimens. Results: Relative to water, urinary calcium rose significantly only with the milks and the 2 caffeine-containing beverages. The excess calciuria was 0. 25 mmol, about the same as previously reported for caffeine alone. Phosphoric acid without caffeine produced no excess calciuria; nor did it augment the calciuria of caffeine. Conclusions: The excess calciuria associated with consumption of carbonated beverages is confined to caffeinated beverages. <b>Acidulant</b> type has no acute effect. Because the caffeine effect is known to be compensated for by reduced calciuria later in the day, we conclude that the net effect of carbonated beverage con-stituents on calcium economy is negligible.

Activation at pH 3. 5 was also induced by acetic acid and it was maximal at 50 mM concentration. To investigate the role of plasma membrane ATPase activation in pH homeostasis, the internal pH (cytosolic and vacuolar) of yeast cells incubated in media at pH 6. 5 or at pH 3. 5, acidified either with HCl or acetic acid, were compared by using in vivo 31 P-NMR. Despite plasma membrane ATPase activation by acetic acid, the decrease in cytosolic pH caused by external acidification was much more important when the permeant acetic acid was used instead of HCl as the <b>acidulant.</b> The supplementation of the incubation medium at pH 3. 5 with glucose led to higher cytosolic pH values, consistent with the observed in vivo {{activation of}} plasma membrane ATPase by glucose. At the external pH value of 6. 5 the vacuole was maintained at a mildly acidic pH (around 6) while the cytosol was at about neutral pH; however, when cytoplasmic pH decreased due to external acidification, vacuolar pH accompanied that decrease.

The bioavailability of minerals is very low from plant foods and organic acids are known to enhance their bioavailability. Organic acids are used in Indian culinary in different forms of preparations to enhance the flavor and taste. The present investigation was undertaken in Dharwad during 2009 - 10 to know the influence of commonly used <b>acidulants</b> viz., lime juice, tomato puree, tamarind and raw mango powder in two green leafy vegetable based food preparations viz., fenugreek bhaji and shepu dhalvada on the bioaccessibility of zinc. Bioaccessibility was studied by simulating gastro intestinal digestion and equilibrium dialysis in- vitro method. The study reveals that moisture (71. 26 %) and ash content(7. 40 %) of fenugreek bhaji with tomato was highest. Lower acidic pH was recorded in tamarind added bhaji (5. 51) and significantly highest pH (6. 29) in tomato puree added bhaji. Shepu dhalvada with tomato puree had significantly higher moisture content (40. 77 %) and least was found in tamarind added dhalvada (36. 01 %). Ash content of dhalvada ranged from 4. 06 to 4. 61 per cent. Shepu dhalvada with the addition of lime juice recorded significantly lower pH of 5. 03.
