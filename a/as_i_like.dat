500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} budget problems created strong character development potential for Leslie and comedic opportunities for Ron. Fowler also enjoyed that the normally-dissolute Tom formed an authentic romantic connection, and said Chris Pratt brought [...] "a certain naturalness" [...] to {{a role that}} could otherwise have been overly idiotic. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club strongly praised the episode, praising Rob Lowe and the entire regular cast. He declared Parks and Recreation the best television show since Arrested Development, and said, [...] "As much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the '50 jokes a minute' style of comedies ... I'm a sucker for a show where the characters are as well-wrought and as purely funny as they are on this show." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall praised {{the implementation of the}} new characters, particularly the fact that the script did not rely too heavily on them. Sepinwall also said the episode balanced well the workplace humor with the romantic subplots between Leslie and Ben, April and Andy, and Ann and Chris.|$|E
2500|$|James Taylor {{was born}} in Burrough on the Hill, a small village in Leicestershire. His father, Steve, was a National Hunt jockey until injury forced him to retire {{and he is now}} a race starter. Standing 5 feet 1 inches tall, Taylor is known for his {{diminutive}} height {{and is one of the}} shortest cricketers to have [...] played English county cricket., though he is one inch taller than Sachin Tendulkar. [...] He believes that his batting is not weakened by his height and has said [...] "It's good for hooking, and less can go wrong with my feet movement. I use it to my advantage <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to cut and pull." [...] Taylor attended Maidwell Hall and then Shrewsbury School where he studied his A-levels and played for their cricket team.|$|E
2500|$|Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is aged {{for about}} 25 months {{exclusively}} in American oak barrels. Silver Oak’s Alexander Valley wines are aged in both new and once-used American oak barrels and spend an additional 14 months in bottle before release. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon spends about 20 months in bottle after barrel. In {{answer to the}} question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> tough steak." [...] The company formed a partnership with Missouri-based barrel producer A Cooperage in 2000 to have a steady supply of American oak barrels made to Silver Oak’s specifications. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, produced at the Oakville Winery, is considered to be a wine of deep garnet color with a [...] "complex nose of black cherry, boysenberry, cassis, licorice, coffee and spice." ...|$|E

2500|$|The pair bottled {{their first}} vintage Cabernet Sauvignon in 1972, aging the {{wine in the}} old Keig Dairy barn on the {{original}} plot of land Duncan purchased. They {{made the decision to}} produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world, to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels. Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, [...] "it was kind of a reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it was hard to do them all right, {{and it was kind of}} in keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention to that. This is a pretty common concept in France." [...] According to noted wine critic Robert Parker, Meyer always believed in harvesting ripe, physiologically mature fruit. In answer to the question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak.

2500|$|In a July 2012 {{edition of}} Sports Illustrated, Jackson talked about several issues, and also was {{critical}} of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as he believes they have lowered their standards when voting for prospects in the Hall of Fame. He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating [...] "I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was." [...] Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as {{special assistant to the}} Yankees, Jackson remarked, [...] "Al's a very good friend. But I think there are real questions about his numbers. As much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers." [...] On July 12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, [...] "In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players." [...] It had been reported [...] he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. After the SI article became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, Jackson confirmed in his statement [...] "I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team." ...|$|E
