50|$|The {{important}} arterial road, running {{between the}} river and the Janiculum, that started from Porta Settimiana and led to Porta Santo Spirito and then to St. Peter's Basilica (now Via della Lungara), was formerly called Via Santa ("Holy Street"), due to its important role for the access of pilgrims. The street and the gate are mentioned in some documents dating back {{to the end of the}} 14th century, disposing to keep both of them clean and free of debrises from the flood of {{the river and}} to throw no garbage, so that the road were adequate to its name and function. After a restoration by Pope Nicholas V in 1451, in 1498 - due to the remarkable importance that the street had acquired - Pope Alexander VI rebuilt the gate and enlarged it, probably raising it from its former level and giving it the present aspect. On that occasion an inscription, referring to Septimius Severus according to some contemporaries, was lost; it probably was an important clue for the reconstruction of the history of the gate. In 1643, during the building of the Janiculum walls by Pope Urban VIII, almost the entire stretch of Aurelian walls on the right bank of the River was torn down and the gate was included within the new walls, thus losing any military and <b>access</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

It {{is based on a}} so-called channel <b>access</b> <b>function,</b> which governs the access permission probability depending on the momentary user traffic load. In this paper, the proposed MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol is analyzed for WWW data transmission with a given maximum packet loss rate. To maximize the performance, an iterative simulation method was developed to optimize the channel <b>access</b> <b>function.</b> The results show very high efficiency for substantial traffic load variations, provided that the <b>access</b> <b>function</b> is adapted to the total number of users.

40|$|Abstract. The IEEE 802. 11 e {{standard}} guarantees QoS in the MAC layer {{by using}} new HCF (Hybrid Coordination Function) protocol. The HCF {{is composed of}} two access functions: A distributed contention-based channel <b>access</b> <b>function</b> (EDCA) providing prioritized QoS and a centralized polling-based channel <b>access</b> <b>function</b> (HCCA) providing parameterized QoS. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling algorithm for HCCA to support QoS. The proposed scheduler guarantees QoS by using adaptive service intervals, transmission opportunities, and polling order. The service schedule is based {{not only on the}} traffic’s TSPEC parameters but also on the instance buffered traffic conditions and transmission delay of other traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm is superior to the existing TGe Reference scheduler, SETT-EDD, and ARROW algorithms in terms of throughput, transmission delay and jitter. ...|$|E

The reliability performance of various coding schemes employing these decoding techniques are {{carried out in the}} presence of AWGN conditions.

40|$|Abstract — In {{recently}} introduced “multi-cell access” schemes, cells (rather than users) {{compete for the}} spectral resource. In a previous paper [1], a framework for such a scheme was proposed, using only local channel information. In the framework each cell competes for access through a credit that {{is a function of}} the signal to noise ratio of its scheduled user. Access is then given to a cell with a probability dependent on the <b>access</b> <b>function.</b> In [1] an ad-hoc choice of function was formulated. In this work we investigate which <b>access</b> <b>function</b> actually optimizes the system capacity, utilizing a numerical optimization procedure. We obtain a surprsingly simple solution which also corroborates previous results. For a realistic path loss model we find that our multicell distributed access scheme gives a 19 % gain compared to having all cells on, and more than a 50 % increase in system capacity compared to keeping a traditional static spectral reuse scheme.
