40|$|In {{this last}} part of our attempt to present briefly the history of Croatian {{chemistry}} in the 20 th century, the development of chemistry in the Republic of Croatia, established as an independent state on June 25 th, 1991 is outlined. The last 10 years of the 20 th century are characterized first by defense of the country by arms until 1995, and then {{until the end of}} century, and after the constructive building of the foundations of Croatia. In these turbulent times, scientists could not be just bystanders. Thus, some went to defend the country by arms and others (perhaps older) kept informing colleagues all around the globe about our defense of the homeland. This was the reason why scientific research in Croatia showed very limited results. This article briefly describes research in chemistry at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, the Rugjer Bošković Institute, Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agronomy and Faculty of Forestry. This article logically follows our previous two <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> the history of Croatian chemistry in 20 th century: N. Trinajstić, S. Paušek-Baždar, Croatian Chemistry in the 20 th Century. I. From the turn of the Century to May 8 th, 1945 (Kem. Ind. 56 (2007) 403 – 416) and N. Trinajstić, M. Kaštelan-Macan, S. Paušek-Baždar, H. Vančik, Croatian Chemistry in the 20 th Century. II.
