5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E
25|$|At 15:00 on Christmas Eve, Sveriges Television airs Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul (From <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>to</b> All of You), {{commonly}} referred to as Kalle Anka - Donald Duck.

This one-hour show mostly contains clips from classical Disney films, such as Robin Hood and The Jungle Book (with the song The Bear Necessities), as well as promotional clips for recent Disney films, concluded with the song When You Wish Upon A Star. The show is one of the highest-rated Swedish television programs, only rivalled by international sports events and the Eurovision Song Contest, and most Swedish people can recite much of the show.|$|E

It was unveiled by King Carl XVI Gustaf, at a ceremony attended by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his wife Nane Maria Annan, Wallenberg's niece. At the unveiling, King Carl XVI Gustaf said Wallenberg is [...] "a great example {{to those of us}} who want to live as fellow humans". Kofi Annan praised him as [...] "an inspiration for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> act when we can and to have the courage to help those who are suffering and in need of help". The memorial's design (see photo) has been considered inappropriate by some critics.|$|E

500|$|Before Selena signed her {{contract}} with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested Selena for an English-language debut album. She {{was asked to}} make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing Selena should first strengthen her fan base. In a 2007 interview, Behar spoke about the difficulty of recording Selena's English-language debut. He said EMI [...] "had let <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> believe that she would record in English, and it just wasn't materializing for whatever reason". Behar said the record company [...] "didn't believe, they didn't think it could happen", and continuously told Selena and her father [...] "it wasn't the right time" [...] for an English-language debut.|$|E
500|$|From 2005 to 2011, the Club {{was under}} the {{direction}} of Paul Rardin. Notable achievements during this time include international tours to Spain in 2008 and Cuba in 2011. The Cuban tour was considered especially significant, given that Americans have not easily been able to travel to the country legally, but the University gave financial assistance and an offer of a cultural exchange to make the tour happen. In 2010, the club celebrated its 150th anniversary, and as part of the celebrations performed a set of joint concerts with the Harvard University and University of Virginia Glee Clubs, taking a variety of music including contemporary American songs, folk and Renaissance music. Rardin said [...] "It's a wonderful opportunity for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see, hear and learn from three different ensembles." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} {{discussing}} the religious themes in Harrison's songwriting, Allison qualifies the literal message of [...] "Be Here Now" [...] by stating, [...] "this song {{must be understood}} as an endorsement [...] ", yet it is [...] "hardly the typical George". Allison cites a number of compositions from throughout Harrison's career, all covering issues of karma and reincarnation, as evidence that Harrison [...] "encourages <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> ponder our inescapable end and so imagine the future", rather than focusing only on the here and now. Harrison {{would return to the}} specific theme of [...] "Be Here Now" [...] in later songs such as [...] "Flying Hour" [...] and [...] "Just for Today", the last of which adopts the here-and-now message as an inspirational statement for members of Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{pre-recorded}} {{a message}} to the astronauts of the final mission of the US Space Shuttle Atlantis on July 16, 2011. With [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] playing in the background, Beyoncé said: [...] "Good morning Atlantis. This is Beyoncé. Sandy, Chris, Doug, and Rex, you inspire <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> dare to live our dreams—to know that we are smart enough and strong enough to achieve this. This song is especially for my girl Sandy and all the women who have taken us to space with them, and the girls who are our future explorers." [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was used in a commercial for Beyoncé's fragrance, Pulse (2011). Released on August 18, 2011, the 15-second advertisement, directed by Jake Nava, shows Beyoncé wearing a metallic gown and walking through lights an instrumental version of the song plays in the background.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Beyoncé said: [...] "We all see the {{headlines}} and we think what can I really do to help?... World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

In 2000, while on the Late Show with David Letterman he read Letterman's Top 10 List (which for this show was called, [...] "Top Ten Rejected Gore – Lieberman Campaign Slogans") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: [...] "Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!" [...] In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award [...] "for three decades of {{contributions}} to the Internet" [...] at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): [...] "Please don't recount this vote." [...] He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: [...] "We all invented the Internet." [...] Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: [...] "It is time to reinvent the Internet for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make it more robust and much more accessible {{and use it to}} reinvigorate our democracy." ...|$|E

500|$|The Independent {{said that}} Insurrection [...] "never stops being familiarly jolly and antiquated", {{and called the}} entire Star Trek film {{franchise}} [...] "old-fashioned". The Washington Post also called the film old fashioned, but [...] "in the best sense of the word", {{and said that the}} film did what the [...] "doctor – make that Dr. 'Bones' McCoy – ordered". British journalist Simon Rose, writing for The Daily Mirror was more critical of the film, saying that it failed to break the odd-numbered Star Trek film curse, and that it was [...] "feeble", [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "tedious". However, Josh Spiegel writing for The Buffalo News said that Insurrection broke the odd-numbered film rule. Further criticism came from the Birmingham Evening Mail, which said that it was [...] "an adult form of entertainment equivalent to Teletubbies for babies", and that there were [...] "lots of repetition, rubbery faces, gibberish dialogue, characters leaping up and down in funny suits and some very basic effects". The reviewer gave the film two stars for fans, and none for non-fans. In Folklore/Cinema: Popular Film as Vernacular Culture, the actions of Data and the Ba'ku child Artim in Insurrection are seen as [...] "a metamorphosis motif where a child becomes computerlike and a computer/android becomes more childlike". Data specifically [...] "is a metaphor for a child who seeks to understand what being human means and then, like the velveteen rabbit, wishes to become. From confronting his father and evil brother to finding his mother, Data also represents the potential within <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> quest for a fuller humanity".|$|E
500|$|After collaborating on {{her great}} successes The Woman in Me (1995) and Come on Over (1997), Twain and her then-husband Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange {{decided to take}} a musical hiatus. The two {{relocated}} to Switzerland, settled down, and had a child, Eja, in August 2001. Twain felt content and was in a very positive state of mind, which inspired Up! (2002). She and Lange conceptualized the album to be very positive, optimistic, and uplifting; they desired to evade dark subject matters, yet still be profound through optimism. In doing so, they co-wrote every track on Up!, in which few tracks were ballads, something Twain considered a small ratio compared to the nineteen songs on the album. She explained it was not done deliberately, but influenced by her and Lange's state of mind at the time, adding, [...] "There just didn't seem to be enough room for [...] ". One of the ballads was [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing", which Twain deemed necessary to come down in tempo. She said the song was very powerful and, as with each track on Up!, was significant to her. Twain said of the track, [...] "This is the only heartbreak song on the new CD. [...] a chance for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> catch our breath here." [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing" [...] was later selected as the eighth and final single from Up!, fifth to impact the North American music market. It was released to country radio on February 9, 2004 and to adult contemporary radio on March 22, 2004. A live CD single and digital download were taken from Up! Live in Chicago, and released on March 9, 2004 with the same cover as the video album. CD singles and 7" [...] singles were later issued by Mercury Nashville Records on March 30, 2004.|$|E
