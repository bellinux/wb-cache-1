5|$|In March 1975 Massino {{was arrested}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrest {{of one of}} his hijackers, Raymond Wean, and charged with {{conspiracy}} to receive stolen goods. He was scheduled to go on trial in 1977, but the charges were dropped after he successfully argued that he had not been properly mirandized, disqualifying statements Massino gave to police from being used in trial.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shooting, Scully {{reasons that}} at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, {{it would have been}} {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Many {{accounts}} {{claim that}} Cascioferro personally killed Petrosino. Legend {{has it that}} Cascioferro excused himself from a dinner party among the high society {{at the home of}} his political patron De Michele Ferrantelli, took a carriage (that of his host according to some), and drove to Piazza Marina in Palermo's city centre. He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascioferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again. Historical reconstructions have dismissed this version and cannot locate Cascioferro <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime.|$|E

5|$|The dagger {{taken from}} Beauchamp at his arrest {{did not match}} the wound on Sharp's body. (In his Confession, Beauchamp claimed to have buried the murder weapon by {{the bank of the}} river near where the murder took place. That knife was never found). Beauchamp's shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder. The posse lost a {{handkerchief}} found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime and believed to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after the posse had gone to sleep one night).|$|E
5|$|When a Catholic {{priest is}} burnt {{at the stake}} in Lander, Wyoming, private investigative {{organisation}} the Millennium Group despatch offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Ardis Cohen (Lindsay Crouse) who had previously worked together on a case involving the murders of three clerics several years earlier. Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition. This is confirmed when a Protestant minister is drowned in imitation of another ritual torture. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drowning, two wedding rings are found—a man's in the stomach of the victim and woman's nearby.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp {{rode with}} a sheriff's posse and tracked the Bisbee stage robbers. Virgil had been {{appointed}} Tombstone's town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. However, Virgil {{at the same time}} continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell.|$|E

5|$|Chaos;Head follows Takumi Nishijou, a {{high school}} student living in a cargo crate atop a {{building}} in Shibuya, Tokyo. One day, he is sent pictures over the internet, depicting a murder in an alley; he later witnesses a murder resembling the one in the pictures, and believes the killer to be a pink-haired girl he sees at the crime scene. Because of his presence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime, he is suspected of being the murderer, and starts suffering from paranoia and experiencing delusions. More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who have an interest in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. One of them is the pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims to be friends with him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the victims there have been erected {{numerous}} memorial sites, funded by private initiatives and public bodies on the orders of the Berlin boroughs, the Berlin House of Representatives or the federal government, which are placed over various places in Berlin. The oldest {{date back to the}} days when the Wall was still standing. They include monuments, crucifixes and memorial stones, and were visited by foreign politicians during state visits. Together with the border installations, there were also some memorial sites that were removed when the Wall fell. Sites for fallen border guards were especially affected by this. Until the tenth anniversary of the building of the Wall, for every victim the private Berliner Bürger-Verein ("Berlin Citizen Association") placed a white wooden cross <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. They were aided in their effort by the senate of West-Berlin. On 13 August 1971, the memorial site Weiße Keuze ("White Crosses") was inaugurated {{on the east side of}} the Reichstag building.|$|E

When {{the body of the}} original Brown is discovered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPC crash, it dawns on White that the President {{is in the hands of}} an impostor, and that the person whom he believed to be Scarlet is not human.

5|$|Set in the author's present day, the interwar period, {{the novel}} centers on two strangers who arrive at {{different}} times in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a fictional county based on Faulkner's home, Lafayette County, Mississippi. The plot first focuses on Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Alabama looking for {{the father of her}} unborn child, and then shifts to explore the life of Joe Christmas, a man who has settled in Jefferson and passes as white, but who secretly believes he has some black ancestry. After a series of flashbacks narrating Christmas's early life, the plot resumes with his living and working with Lucas Burch, the father of Lena's child, who fled to Jefferson and changed his name when he found out that Lena was pregnant. The woman on whose property Christmas and Burch have been living, Joanna Burden, a descendant of Yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of Jefferson, is murdered. Burch is caught <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime and reveals that Christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black, thus implying that he is guilty of her murder. While Burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in Christmas, Lena is assisted by Byron Bunch, a shy, mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her. Bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town, the disgraced former minister Gail Hightower, to help Lena give birth and protect Christmas from being lynched. Though Hightower refuses the latter, Christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman. Burch leaves town without his reward, and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he picked up on the road to Tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child, both looking for the woman's husband.|$|E
