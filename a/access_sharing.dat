40|$|The {{data rates}} {{provisioned}} by broadband Internet access connections continue to {{fall short of}} the requirements posed by emerging applications. However, the potential of statistical multiplexing of the last mile broadband connections remains unexploited even as the average utilisation of these connections remains low. Despite recent work in this area, two key questions remain unanswered: (a) what is the attainable benefit of broadband <b>access</b> <b>sharing?</b> and (b) {{how much of this}} benefit is realisable given real-world constraints? In this work we quantify the attainable benefit of a multihomed broadband access environment by proposing and evaluating several flow-based <b>access</b> <b>sharing</b> policies using a custom flow-based simulator. We then analyse how much of the performance benefit is lost due to real-world constraints by migrating from simulations to a test-lab environment employing a wireless network. Our results show that in today’s broadband Internet access scenarios, a significant reduction in download times (up to a factor of 3) is achievable. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 1...|$|E

40|$|Spatial data {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many social, environmental, economic and political decisions and is increasingly acknowledged as a national resource essential for sustainable development. One of the potential areas where spatial data can make a positive impact is for improved decision making to support catchment management. Reliable spatial data infrastructure (SDI) is needed to record the environmental, social and economic dimensions of catchment management. By building an appropriate SDI, disparate spatial data can be accessed and utilised to facilitate the exchange and sharing of spatial data between stakeholders across catchment communities. The aim of this paper is to identify the factors/variables contributing to spatial information <b>access,</b> <b>sharing</b> and use across catchment management areas and evaluate the current status of spatial information <b>access,</b> <b>sharing</b> and use among Australian states from a catchment management authority perspective. A survey method was used to collect primary data from 56 regional natural resource management (NRM) bodies responsible for catchment management in Australia. Descriptive statistics method was used to show the similarities and differences among Australian states. The key factors which influence sharing and access to spatial information are also explored. We found there is significant for spatial information access, use and sharing to contribute to SDI development. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a call admission control (CAC) algorithm that {{aids in the}} Quality of Service (QoS) support in a wireless network base station. The Threshold <b>Access</b> <b>Sharing</b> (TAS) scheme provides improved performance over generalized methods of current CAC algorithms. The TAS algorithm relies on a prioritization of admitted traffic through bandwidth thresholds. This is particularly vital for high priority real-time calls and preapproved QoS handover calls. In addition, the CAC algorithm must rely on some advanced levels of channel estimation to most effectively use the limited channel resources. I...|$|E

Our analysis and simulation have shown that the new scheme has met the expectation and its complexity is comparable to TAS. I...|$|E
