5|$|Stanton {{refused to}} leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for {{intentionally}} violating the Tenure of Office Act, {{by a vote of}} 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.|$|E
5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E
50|$|On June 12, Sherman began {{circulating}} an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> {{among his}} colleagues.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> {{regarding}} Nixon's personal {{finances and}} failure to pay taxes was also not passed.|$|R

5|$|Other {{business}} in the session included creating a special fund that would allow Jefferson to recover the USS Philadelphia, which had been captured {{off the coast of}} northern Africa, and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures. He feared that passage of an act making permanent the pay raises for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections, especially in the House, but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls. Robert Wright's measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore, Maryland, in protest of legislators' poor accommodations in Washington, D.C., was defeated by a vote of 9–19, but Breckinridge considered the issue of moving the U.S. capital worthy of further study. Breckinridge supported the successful impeachment of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The latter impeachment was widely seen as politically motivated, and some Democratic-Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal. Majorities were obtained on only three of the eight <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Breckinridge and three other Democratic-Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth, on which every senator sided with Chase.|$|E
5|$|The Brindle Tails {{desperately wanted}} Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so the natural course of action {{was to try to}} get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The scrutiny of the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E

25|$|The {{release of}} the “smoking gun” tape {{destroyed}} Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who had voted against all three <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would all support the impeachment article accusing Nixon of obstructing justice when the articles came up before the full House.|$|E
50|$|On July 12, 2017, Representative Brad Sherman (D-Cal) {{formally}} {{introduced an}} <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> H. Res. 438.

50|$|Prosecution: The First <b>Article</b> <b>of</b> <b>Impeachment</b> {{alleges that}} Corona betrayed public trust by his “track record marked by {{partiality}} and subservience {{in cases involving}} the Arroyo Administration,” which is traced to his history as President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s chief of staff, spokesman, and acting Executive Secretary.|$|R
2500|$|After a recess, the Senate {{debated the}} vote on the <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment.</b> Under the Illinois Constitution, a two-thirds majority, or 41 votes out of 59, was {{required}} to convict him on the <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment.</b> After several hours of deliberations, Rod Blagojevich was convicted and removed from office by a unanimous vote of 59–0. [...] State Senator Mike Frerichs then moved that Blagojevich be banned from ever holding office in Illinois again. [...] This motion carried, also by a unanimous vote of 59–0. Shortly after the vote, the lieutenant governor, Pat Quinn {{was sworn in as}} the new Governor. Although Blagojevich is disqualified from running for any Government of Illinois office, he is eligible to run for federal office such as his old congressional seat.|$|R
25|$|After a {{marathon}} session that lasted {{into the next}} day, the House of Representatives on March 22 voted to impeach Gutierrez of betrayal of public trust, with 212 in favor, 46 against and 4 abstentions. Tupas headed the House of Representatives delegation that passed the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Impeachment</b> to the Senate on March 23.|$|E
25|$|Byrd {{initially}} {{said that}} the impeachment proceedings against Clinton should be taken seriously. Although he harshly criticized any attempt {{to make light of}} the allegations, he made the motion to dismiss the charges and effectively end the matter. Even though he voted against both <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> he was the sole Democrat to vote to censure Clinton.|$|E
25|$|On March 23, Tupas and company, {{including}} the two leading complainants, personally {{submitted to the}} Senate the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Impeachment.</b> Later that day, the Senate adopted its rules for impeachment, adopting the rules used in the 2000 impeachment of Joseph Estrada with amendments such as maintaining {{the silence of the}} visitors and neutrality among the senators.|$|E
50|$|On July 27, 1974, the Committee voted 27-11 to {{recommend}} the first <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> against the president: obstruction of justice. The Committee then recommended the second <b>article,</b> abuse <b>of</b> power, on July 29, 1974. The next day, on July 30, 1974, the Committee recommended the third article: contempt of Congress.|$|R
50|$|BPI {{submitted}} {{evidence to}} the Senate pertaining to Corona's bank records worth 12 million pesos as of 2010. The Senate prohibited BPI assistant manager Mara Arcilla since the Senate only requested for the records.

2500|$|The <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> alleged {{a pattern}} of conduct constituting abuse of power, {{including}} the events described in the criminal complaint and several instances of ignoring Illinois law in his use of executive power. In particular it accused Blagojevich of engaging in a conduct constituting {{a pattern of}} abuse of power. Among the misdeeds were the following: ...|$|R
25|$|The scandal {{led to the}} {{discovery}} of multiple abuses of power by members of the Nixon administration, an impeachment process against the president that led to <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> and the resignation of Nixon.

25|$|The first Chief Justice to {{be impeached}} is Renato Corona. On Dec 12, 2011, 188 of the 285 members of House of Representatives voted to {{transmit}} to the Senate the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Impeachment</b> filed against him.

50|$|The tapes' {{existence}} came {{to light}} during the Watergate scandal of 1973 and 1974, when the system was mentioned during the televised testimony of White House aide Alexander Butterfield before the Senate Watergate Committee. Nixon's refusal of a congressional subpoena to release the tapes constituted an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> against Nixon, and led to his subsequent resignation on August 9, 1974.|$|R
60|$|Answer.--The Lord Chief-Baron of the Court of Exchequer {{delivered}} the unanimous {{opinion of the}} Judges upon the said question,--"That it is not competent for the Managers {{on the part of}} the Commons to give any evidence on the seventh <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> to prove that the letter of the 5th of May, 1781, is false in any other particular than that wherein it is expressly charged to be false,"--and gave his reasons.|$|R
25|$|Leach did {{not think}} that the crimes {{surrounding}} the failure of the Whitewater-tied S should have been considered in an impeachment framework. Like many in Congress, he was surprised that the Justice Department chose to refer certain sex-related charges to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close judgment call, Leach voted for the <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> that related to felonious lying under oath.|$|R
25|$|On March 22, 2011, the House of Representatives {{voted to}} impeach Gutierrez, sending the {{committee}} report as the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Impeachment</b> to the Senate which {{will act as}} an impeachment court. A vote of at least two-thirds (16) of all senators (24) is required to convict Gutierrez and remove her from office. However, Gutierrez resigned on April 29, 2011, thereby canceling the impeachment trial of the Senate.|$|E
25|$|While {{almost all}} of them were for the most part {{frivolous}} and were buried {{as soon as they were}} introduced, several did have their intended effect. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon and Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas both resigned in response to the threat of impeachment hearings, and, most famously, President Richard Nixon resigned from office after the House Judiciary Committee had already reported <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> to the floor.|$|E
25|$|Also, the House {{will adopt}} a {{resolution}} {{in order to}} notify the Senate of its action. After receiving the notice, the Senate will adopt an order notifying the House that it is ready to receive the managers. The House managers then appear before the bar of the Senate and exhibit the <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment.</b> After {{the reading of the}} charges, the managers return and make a verbal report to the House.|$|E
50|$|The eighth congressional {{district}} has been represented by Democrat Nancy Pelosi since 1993, when {{the area was}} redistricted from the 5th {{congressional district}}. Pelosi, who is Speaker of the House, is considered safe for re-election, but Iraq War activist Cindy Sheehan announced that she would consider running against Pelosi if Pelosi did not put in an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> against President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. She qualified for the ballot as an independent candidate and was endorsed by the Peace and Freedom Party.|$|R
500|$|With the dealmaking, Johnson was {{confident}} of the result {{in advance of}} the verdict, and {{in the days leading up}} to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> accusing Johnson <b>of</b> firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. Thirty-five senators voted [...] "guilty" [...] and 19 [...] "not guilty", thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution.|$|R
