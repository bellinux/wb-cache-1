50|$|The Law of Three Stages is the {{evolution}} of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there <b>are</b> <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> stages after a certain time period is that the system “has lost its power” and is preventing the progression of civilization, causing complicated situations in society. 10. The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an “organic” new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment on society. Kings {{feel the need to}} reorganize their kingdom, but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform, not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new, more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress, there needs to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a “series of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters”. The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage, metaphysical stage, and positive stage.|$|E
5000|$|The main new {{developments}} {{compared to the}} KTX-I are in the traction equipment and the carbody. The motors <b>are</b> <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> three-phase asynchronous induction motors, rather than synchronous motors as in the KTX-I. [...] The motors are supplied by traction converters with integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) rather than silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) components as in the KTX-I. [...] IGCT was the most advanced version of the Gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) used for control of high-power applications at the time, {{and the use of}} ABB-supplied IGCTs as the switching element in the rectifier and inverter modules of HSR-350x converters was a world's first in rail vehicles. [...] However, testing found limited improvements in efficiency and noise levels, and problems with reliability. [...] Each traction converter consists of two parallel-switched four-quadrant converters, which function as rectifier modules by converting single-phase alternating current (AC) from one main transformer winding each to direct current (DC), a 2,800 V DC intermediate circuit, one inverter module converting the DC supply to the three-phase AC supply for traction motors, an auxiliary inverter for the supply of motor and converter cooling fans, and resistors for rheostatic braking that are also connected to the DC circuit. [...] The variable voltage variable frequency (VVVF) inverters are voltage-sourced with pulse-width modulation (PWM) control, rather than current-sourced with phase fired control (PFC) as in the KTX-I. [...] Each converter supplies the motors on two axles of a bogie, providing for individual bogie control. [...] New main transformers with a 15% weight reduction and a 20% power increase were also developed. [...] The single-arm pantograph is a new development for the planned higher speed. [...] The redesigned bogies and suspensions were tested on the roller rig of Southwest Jiaotong University in China at simulated speeds of up to 402 km/h.|$|E
