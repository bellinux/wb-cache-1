500|$|Rangel {{suggested}} that Andrew Cuomo's primary {{run in the}} 2010 gubernatorial election against incumbent David Paterson, {{who was the first}} African-American governor of New York, would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising 2002 gubernatorial primary contest against Carl McCall, at the time the highest-ranking African-American and first major party candidate for governor in the state. Rangel had been a staunch supporter of McCall against Cuomo in 2002, even going as far as saying that he would not necessarily endorse Cuomo had he emerged as the Democratic nominee for governor. For the upcoming 2010 gubernatorial race, Rangel {{suggested that}} for the white Cuomo to challenge the African-American incumbent would not be [...] "the moral decision". [...] Rangel also said, [...] "There might be an inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. Since we have most African-Americans registered as Democrats, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>you</b> would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion." [...] Paterson fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election. [...] By this point, Rangel's continuing difficulties, together with the death a few months prior of Percy Sutton and the failure of Paterson (Basil Paterson's son), marked the end of the era of Harlem's [...] "Gang of Four".|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Navy's best {{test pilot}}, Captain Eric Brown, chief naval test pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Royal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 noted: [...] "This was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>you</b> had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E
