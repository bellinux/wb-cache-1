40|$|We {{present a}} new flow-based method for {{modeling}} brain structural connectivity. The method uses a modified maximum-flow algorithm that is robust to {{noise in the}} diffusion data and guided by biolog-ically viable pathways {{and structure of the}} brain. A flow network is first created using a lattice graph by connecting all lattice points (voxel centers) to all their neighbors by edges. Edge weights are based on the orientation distribution function (ODF) value in the di-rection of the edge. The maximum-flow is computed based on this flow graph using the flow or the capacity between each region of in-terest (ROI) pair by following the connected tractography fibers pro-jected onto the flow graph edges. Network measures such as global efficiency, transitivity, path length, mean degree, density, modular-ity, small world, and assortativity are computed from the flow con-nectivity matrix.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} 1. 0 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to measure the ventricular size in experimental hydrocephalus in pup rats. METHODS: Wistar rats were subjected to hydrocephalus by intracisternal injection of 20 % kaolin (n= 13). Ten rats remained uninjected {{to be used as}} controls. At the endpoint of experiment animals were submitted to MRI of brain and killed. The ventricular size was assessed using three measures: ventricular ratio (VR), the cortical thickness (Cx) and the ventricles area (VA), performed on photographs of <b>anatomical</b> sections and <b>MRI.</b> RESULTS: The images obtained through MR present enough quality to show the lateral ventricular cavities but not to demonstrate the difference between the cortex and the white matter, as well as the details of the deep structures of the brain.

40|$|Purpose: To {{introduce}} {{a framework that}} automatically identifies regions of anatomical abnormality within ana-tomical MR images and uses those regions in hypothesis-driven selection of seed points for fiber tracking with diffu-sion tensor (DT) imaging (DTI). Materials and Methods: Regions of interest (ROIs) are first extracted from MR images using an automated algorithm for volume-preserved warping (VPW) that identifies local-ized volumetric differences across groups. ROIs then serve as seed points for fiber tracking in coregistered DT images. Another algorithm automatically clusters and compares morphologies of detected fiber bundles. We tested our framework using datasets {{from a group of}} patients with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) and normal controls. Results: Our framework automatically identified regions of localized volumetric differences across groups and then used those regions as seed points for fiber tracking. In our applied example, a comparison of fiber tracts in the two diagnostic groups showed that most fiber tracts failed to correspond across groups, suggesting that anatomical con-nectivity was severely disrupted in fiber bundles leading from regions of known anatomical abnormality. Conclusion: Our framework automatically detects volu-metric abnormalities in <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRIs</b> to aid in generat-ing a priori hypotheses concerning anatomical connectivity that then can be tested using DTI. Additionally, automation enhances the reliability of ROIs, fiber tracking, and fiber clustering.

Reconstructed resolution was < 2.0 -mm full width half maximum for all three dimensions {{at the center of the}} field of view. PET image counts were calibrated to a dose calibrator to convert measured PET uptake to MBq of F- 18. For some organs (whole brain, heart, lungs, urinary bladder), regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn to entirely encompass the target organ using ASIPro VM™ MicroPET analysis software (Siemens PreClinical Solutions, Knoxville, TN). For others (liver, spleen, small intestines, kidney, and gallbladder), we could not delineate a region large enough without including neighboring organs. Hence, we chose several small ROIs with the highest radioactivity within the target organ. The appropriateness of these ROIs was confirmed by comparison with the <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRIs.</b> The average radioactivity concentrations of these ROIs were multiplied by the entire organ weight to give an estimate of the radioactivity within the total organ.

40|$|The {{study of}} the brain and its {{connection}} to human activities has been of interest to scientists for centuries. However, it is only in recent years that medical imaging methods have been developed to allow a visualization of the brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is such a technique that provides a noninvasive way to view the structure of the brain. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a special type of MRI, measuring the neural activity in human brain. The aim of this dissertation is to apply machine learning methods to functional and <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRI</b> data to study the connection between brain regions and their functions. The dissertation is divided into two parts. The first part is devoted to the analysis of fMRI. A standard fMRI study produces massive amount of noisy data with strong spatio-temporal correlation. Existing methods include a model-based approach which assumes spatio-temporal independence and a data-driven method which fails to exploit the experimental design. In this work we propose a Gaussian process model to incorporate the temporal correlation through a model-based approach. We validate the method on simulated data and compare the results to other methods through real data analysis. The second part covers the analysis of <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRI.</b> <b>Anatomical</b> <b>MRI</b> provides a detailed map of brain structure, especially useful for detecting small anatomical changes as a result of disease process. The goal of <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRI</b> analysis is to train an automated classifier that can identify the patients from healthy controls. We propose a multiple kernel learning classifier which will build classifiers in small regions in the segregating step and then group them in the integrating step. We study the performance of the new method using simulated data and demonstrate the power of our classifier on disease-related data...|$|E

Eight subjects underwent an MRI and OTS exams at Miami Children’s Hospital, during which an <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRI</b> images and optical topographic maps were acquired. In order to map the motor functional areas in the brain, a functional experiment is performed by using OTS and is based on a repeated finger tapping task alternated with relaxed states. The developed interface displays a sequence of 2 D topographic maps depicting the finger tapping experiment in a form of a movie. Moreover, it displays the <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRI</b> slices in different views (2 D- 3 D) : transaxial, sagittal, coronal; and 3 D head model constructed from the <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRI</b> slices.

Eight subjects performed tasks requiring comparison of each stimulus to a preceding one on verbal or spatial attributes. A frontal midline theta rhythm increased in magnitude with increased memory load. Dipole models localized this signal to {{the region of the}} anterior cingulate cortex. A slow (low-frequency), parietocentral, alpha signal decreased with increased working memory load. These signals were insensitive to the type of stimulus attribute being processed. A faster (higherfrequency), occipitoparietal, alpha signal was relatively attenuated in the spatial version of the task, especially over the posterior right hemisphere. Theta and alpha signals increased, and overt performance improved, after practice on the tasks. Increases in theta with both increased task difficulty and with practice suggests that focusing attention required more effort after an extended test session. Decreased alpha in the difficult tasks indicates that this signal is inversely related to the amount of cortical resources allocated to task performance. Practice-related increases in alpha suggest that fewer cortical resources are required after skill development. These results serve: (i) to dissociate the effects of task difficulty and practice; (ii) to differentiate the involvement of posterior cortex in spatial versus verbal tasks; (iii) to localize frontal midline theta to the anteromedial cortex; and (iv) to demonstrate the feasibility of using <b>anatomical</b> <b>MRIs</b> to remove the blurring effect of the skull and scalp from the ongoing EEG.
