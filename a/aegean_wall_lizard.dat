40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) {{plays a key role}} in disease resistance and is the most polymorphic gene region in vertebrates. Although habitat fragmentation is predicted to lead to a loss in MHC variation through drift, the impact of other evolutionary forces may counter this effect. Here we assess the impact of selection, drift, migration, and recombination on MHC class II and microsatellite variability in 14 island populations of the <b>Aegean</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> Podarcis erhardii. Lizards were sampled from islands within the Cyclades (Greece) formed by rising sea levels as the last glacial maximum approximately 20, 000 before present. Bathymetric data were used to determine the area and age of each island, allowing us to infer the corresponding magnitude and timing of genetic bottlenecks associated with island formation. Both MHC and microsatellite variation were positively associated with island area, supporting the hypothesis that drift governs neutral and adaptive variation in this system. However, MHC but not microsatellite variability declined significantly with island age. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that microsatellites attain mutation-drift equilibrium more rapidly than MHC. Although we detected signals of balancing selection, recombination and migration, the effects of these evolutionary processes appeared negligible relative to drift. This study demonstrates how land bridge islands can provide novel insights into the impact of historical fragmentation on genetic diversity as well as help disentangle the effects of different evolutionary forces on neutral and adaptive diversity...|$|E
50|$|Lizards exploit {{a variety}} of {{different}} camouflage methods. Many lizards are disruptively patterned. In some species, such as <b>Aegean</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> individuals vary in colour, and select rocks which best match their own colour to minimise the risk of being detected by predators. The Moorish gecko is able to change colour for camouflage: when a light-coloured gecko is placed on a dark surface, it darkens within an hour to match the environment. The chameleons in general use their ability to change their coloration for signalling rather than camouflage, but some species such as Smith's dwarf chameleon do use active colour change for camouflage purposes.The flat-tail horned lizard's body is coloured like its desert background, and is flattened and fringed with white scales to minimise its shadow.|$|R
40|$|PublishedArticleCamouflage {{can often}} be {{enhanced}} by genetic adaptation to different local environments. However, it is less clear how individual behaviour improves camouflage effectiveness. We investigated whether individual <b>Aegean</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis erhardii) inhabiting different islands rest on backgrounds that improve camouflage against avian predators. In free-ranging lizards, we found that dorsal regions were better matched against chosen backgrounds than against other backgrounds on the same island. This suggests that P. erhardii make background choices that heighten individual-specific concealment. In achromatic camouflage, this effect was more evident in females and was less distinct in an island population with lower predation risk. This suggests that behavioural enhancement of camouflage {{may be more important}} in females than in sexually competing males and related to predation risk. However, in an arena experiment, lizards did not choose the background that improved camouflage, most likely due to the artificial conditions. Overall, our results provide evidence that behavioural preferences for substrates can enhance individual camouflage of lizards in natural microhabitats, and that such adaptations may be sexually dimorphic and dependent on local environments. This research emphasizes the importance of considering links between ecology, behaviour, and appearance in studies of intraspecific colour variation and local adaptation.

40|$|Within-species colour {{variation}} is widespread among animals. Understanding how this arises can elucidate evolutionary mechanisms, {{such as those}} underlying reproductive isolation and speciation. Here, we investigated whether five island populations of <b>Aegean</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis erhardii) have more effective camouflage against their own (local) island substrates than against other (non-local) island substrates to avian predators, and whether this was linked to island differences in substrate appearance. We also investigated whether degree of local substrate matching varied among island populations and between sexes. In most populations, both sexes were better matched against local backgrounds than against non-local backgrounds, particularly in terms of luminance (perceived lightness), which usually occurred when local and non-local backgrounds were different in appearance. This was found even between island populations that historically had a land connection and in populations that have been isolated relatively recently, suggesting that isolation in these distinct island environments has been sufficient to cause enhanced local background matching, sometimes on a rapid evolutionary time-scale. However, heightened local matching was poorer in populations inhabiting more variable and unstable environments with a prolonged history of volcanic activity. Overall, these results show that lizard coloration is tuned to provide camouflage in local environments, either due to genetic adaptation or changes during development. Yet, the occurrence and extent of selection for local matching may depend on specific conditions associated with local ecology and biogeographic history. These results emphasize how anti-predator adaptations to different environments can drive divergence within a species, which may contribute to reproductive isolation among populations and lead to ecological speciation...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{altering}} the ecology of organisms across all major biomes {{and is likely to}} contribute to a rapidly increasing number of species extinctions. The effects of climate change are further exacerbated in fragmented landscapes, where isolated populations are known to be losing genetic diversity. This loss of genetic diversity is thought to impact the physiological flexibility (termed 'plasticity') that a species needs to survive the warmer, more fluctuating temperatures that are associated with global climate change. In this study we examined the thermal plasticity of adult male <b>Aegean</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis erhardii, Lacertidae) occurring on Cycladic land bridge islands (Aegean Sea, Greece). Populations were sampled from three different size islands ranging from 0. 01 km 2 to 448 km 2. Previous studies have shown that P. erhardii exhibits a predictable gradient in genetic diversity correlating with island area and time since isolation. After collection, lizards were acclimated under identical thermal lab conditions for three weeks after which lizards were divided into control and treatment groups. Treatment groups were subjected to an elevated temperature regime for three weeks corresponding to local conditions under a warming climate while control groups were left under the initial cooler lab conditions. Thermal preference (Tp) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) were quantified after the initial three week lab acclimation period and then again after a three week experimental manipulation period. Changes in these parameters were then used as measures of thermal plasticity. Overall conclusions from this study indicate that (i.) P. erhardii has surprisingly rigid thermal preferences, and (ii.) level of genetic impoverishment is not related to the extent of thermal plasticity in the species. Understanding how global warming might impact reptile populations isolated in fragmented landscapes will be critically important for evaluating a population’s extinction risk and aid in guiding appropriate management decisions...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} {{published}} version. It's also available from Oxford Journals at [URL] signals are often under conflicting selection to be hidden from predators while being conspicuous to mates and rivals. Here, we investigated whether <b>Aegean</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis erhardii), varying in color among three different island populations with diverse habitats, exhibit simultaneous camouflage and sexual signals. We examined whether signals appear better tuned to conspecific vision as opposed to that of avian predators, and whether background matching camouflage and sexual signals are partitioned to specific body regions. This could facilitate both covert sexual signaling and camouflage in males according to the viewing perspectives of predators and conspecifics. We found that lizards typically appeared twice as conspicuous to conspecifics than to avian predators against the same visual background, largely due to lizards’ enhanced sensitivity to UV, suggesting that P. erhardii signals are tuned to conspecific vision to reduce detection by predators. Males were more conspicuous than females to both predators and conspecifics. In two populations, male backs were relatively more camouflaged to predators compared to signaling flanks, whereas in females, exposed and concealed surfaces were camouflaged to predators and {{did not differ in}} background matching. These findings indicate that lizard coloration evolves under the competing demands of natural and sexual selection to promote signals that are visible to conspecifics while being less perceptible to avian predators. They also elucidate how interactions between natural and sexual selection influence signal detectability and partitioning to different body regions, highlighting the importance of considering receiver vision, viewing perspectives and signaling environments in studies of signal evolutionThis work was supported by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council studentship and Magdalene College, Cambridge (K.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from Wiley via [URL] coloration is strikingly diverse in nature. Within-species colour variation can arise through local adaptation for camouflage, sexual dimorphism, and conspicuous sexual signals, which often have conflicting effects on survival. Here, we tested whether colour variation between two island populations of <b>Aegean</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis erhardii) is due to sexual dimorphism and differential survival of individuals varying in appearance. On both islands, we measured attack rates by wild avian predators on clay models matching the coloration of real male and female P. erhardii from each island population, modelled to avian predator vision. Avian predator attack rates differed among model treatments, although only on one island. Male-coloured models, which were more conspicuous against their experimental backgrounds to avian predators, were accordingly detected and attacked more frequently by birds than less conspicuous female-coloured models. This suggests that female coloration has evolved primarily under selection for camouflage, whereas sexually competing males exhibit costly conspicuous coloration. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in avian attack frequency between local and non-local model types. This may have arisen if our models did not resemble lizard coloration sufficiently precisely, or if real lizards behaviourally choose backgrounds that improve camouflage. Overall, these results show that sexually dimorphic coloration can affect the risk of predator attacks, indicating that colour variation within a species can be caused by interactions between natural and sexual selection. However, more work is needed to determine how these findings depend on the island environment that each population inhabits.

40|$|Exotic predators such as feral cats (Felis catus), {{have been}} {{the driving force behind}} the {{extinction}} of many endemic species of island mammals, birds and reptiles. Island endemics appear to be exceptionally susceptible to invasive predators because of small population size and frequent lack of anti-predator defenses. The goal of this study was to determine the impacts of feral cats on the island populations of <b>Aegean</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis erhardii, Lacertidae) in relationship to the expression of anti-predator behaviors. I estimated lizard population densities in areas with low cat density sites (LCD) versus high cat density (HCD) sites by conducting 100 -m transect along dry-stone walls, on the island of Naxos, as well as on surrounding islets (Cyclades, Greece). Degree of expression of antipredator behaviors was determined by measuring flight initiation distance (FID) and rates of tail autotomy both in the field and in the lab for six populations in HCD, LCD sites and four satellite islets without cat presence. I also staged controlled encounters with mounted cats decoys and quantified escaping responses from lizards from these populations. I found that feral cats had a strong negative effect on lizard population densities. Lizards adapted their antipredator behaviors in response to cat predation by extending their FIDs, increasing their capacity for tail autotomy, and by staying closer to refugia. In laboratory predation simulations, lizards from cat-free islets had significantly shorter FIDs than LCD site lizards and in particular than HCD site lizards. Furthermore, some unique islet behaviors, presumably evolved in response to lack of predators and to ameliorate chronic conditions of food shortage, appear to render islet lizards strongly susceptible to cat predation. These behaviors include rarely utilizing available refugia, and moving towards anything new, including cat decoys. Nonetheless, I found that repeated exposures over three trials led to significant increases in FIDs for all populations, indicating at least some behavioral plasticity. My results suggest that although lizards may adapt their antipredator behaviors to cope with introduced predators, this offers at best only partial protection, so that there remains strong concern about their survival in the face of expanding feral cat populations...|$|R
