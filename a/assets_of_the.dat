5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E

The Houston Post was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby of Houston.

5|$|The Omaha Traction Company, which {{operated}} as the Street Railway Company, {{changed its}} name to the Omaha Transit Company when streetcar service ended in the city in 1952. After World War II Omahans preferred their automobiles and new highways. When the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 was passed, Omaha's private transit companies were not able to apply for federal subsidies available to public transit operators. The Omaha Transit Company ceased operations on June 30, 1972, when the City of Omaha assumed authority for public transportation in the city. City Transit Lines, another private company in Omaha, went out of business on that day as well. The Metro Area Transit Authority was created by the Nebraska Legislature, consisting of a five-member board appointed by the mayor and confirmed by Omaha's City Council and the Douglas County Commissioners. It acquired the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Omaha Transit Company and selected <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City Transit Lines of Council Bluffs, along with more than $3,000,000 in federal funding. The Authority operates today as Metro Area Transit, or MAT.|$|E

5|$|Groves {{hoped that}} a new, {{permanent}} agency {{would be created}} {{to take over the}} responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, the Enabling Act, an {{amendment}} to the Weimar Constitution, passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94. This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag. As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, as the Communists had already been banned. On 10 May, the government seized the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Social Democrats and they were banned in June. The remaining political parties were dissolved and on 14 July 1933 Germany became a de facto one-party state when the founding of new parties was made illegal. Further elections in November 1933, 1936 and 1938 were entirely Nazi-controlled and saw only the Nazis and a small number of independents elected. The regional state parliaments and the Reichsrat (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, German aircraft caught the air reconnaissance <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army {{on the ground at}} Velika Gorica, destroying most of them. The continuing mobilisation and concentration of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Ustaše. Some units stopped mobilising, or began returning to their mobilisation centres from their concentration areas. During the day, Yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over the Mura at Letenye, Mursko Središće and Kotoriba, and over the Drava at Gyékényes. These attempts were only partially successful, due to the influence of Ustaše propaganda and the countermanding of demolition orders by the {{chief of staff of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska. The Yugoslav radio network in the 4th Army area was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1974, the Army decided to {{implement}} one of {{the recommendations of the}} Howze Board and created an air cavalry combat brigade. The <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division were used to create the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat). The new brigade was assigned to the III Corps as a corps asset. 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, was transferred to the new brigade on 21 February 1975. The brigade served as a test bed for new concepts involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield. In 1985-85, the brigade consisted of 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry; 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (4-9 CAV); and 5th and 7th Squadrons, 17th Cavalry Regiment (5-17 CAV and 7-17 CAV), all flying attack helicopters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E

In 1967, {{the people of}} Nauru purchased the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970 control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation. Income from the mines gave Nauruans {{one of the highest}} standards of living in the Pacific. In 1989, Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's administration of the island, in particular Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining. Certain Phosphate Lands: Nauru v.Australia led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
5|$|Proposals to {{establish}} a joint British airline, combining the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) were first raised in 1953 {{as a result of}} difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary Cyprus Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.|$|E

Nichols' main responsibility was to help organize an orderly transfer of assets and responsibilities from the MED to the AEC. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). It was generally assumed that Nichols would become the AEC's Director of Military Application, but while Nichol's relationship with the AEC was cordial and the commissioners were impressed with his administrative skills, it also became clear that Nichols did not agree with the commissioners' concept of the Director of Military Application as a staff rather than a line function.|$|E
5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled {{even if it was}} not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E

By the end of the day, the divisional reserve was committed to the battle, and the JNA claimed that they had captured Zlosela, Olovo and Osmanlije, as well as reaching the outskirts of Kupres. The Bosnian Croat TO captured the centre of Kupres and brought the 1st Battalion of the 19th Partisan Brigade into a difficult position, only to begin withdrawing towards Tomislavgrad after the main JNA force reached the town in the night of 6/7 April.
