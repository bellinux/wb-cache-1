2500|$|Michael {{was arrested}} by {{undercover}} policeman Marcelo Rodríguez, in a sting operation using so-called [...] "pretty police". In an MTV interview, Michael stated: [...] "I got followed into the restroom and then this cop—I didn't {{know it was a}} cop, obviously—he started playing this game, which I think is called, 'I'll show you mine, you show me yours, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> show me yours, I'm going to nick [...] you!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I couldn’t {{hear what}} you were saying, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went outside and I asked you whether you were going home you said ’yes,’ didn’t you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Psha! That {{is simple}} cowardice. He meant {{you not to}} tell me; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had {{answered}} him without telling me, {{he would have had}} the whip-hand of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say nothing," [...] I replied, [...] "till {{you have}} heard the first story. Shut up the paper-case till that time, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> decide <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will open it again to write to your aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't, and be truthful, sir," [...] {{declared}} the girl. [...] "Why, this {{will last for}} ages, and I'll put it away safe and be liberal with your allowance. Let me see," [...] pushing the coins about with her slender fingers, [...] "you just keep the forty-two cents, Uncle John. It'll do for car-fare {{and a bit of}} lunch now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get broke you can come to me." ...|$|R
50|$|The Madison County Nature Trail/ 5000 Nature Trail Road/ Huntsville AL,35803. Travel {{south on}} Memorial Parkway (US-231/SR-53) to Weatherly Road East. Turn right on Bailey Cove Road <b>and</b> <b>then</b> left <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to Green Mountain Road. Turn {{right at the}} fork on South Shawdee Road, and the park will be on your right after a few miles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{could be}} better? <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{remember}} {{all that he}} is to give up for my sake!-- And what can I do for him in return? What have I got to give him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{just take}} it easy for awhile," [...] was Mr. Rover's advice, on leaving. [...] "Rest up all you can, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{go back to the}} school, you'll feel as bright as a dollar." ...|$|E
6000|$|Edna laughed. [...] "All {{you have}} to do," [...] she said, [...] "is to be patient and wait awhile, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go back like a queen to Plainton, you will have had your {{mountains}} and your palaces besides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no mystery, my dear madam," [...] said he, smiling. [...] "The {{left arm}} of your jacket is spattered with mud in {{no less than}} seven places. The marks are {{perfectly}} fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> sit on the left-hand side of the driver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get to {{know people}} really well while they are alive," [...] said Mr. Gingham; [...] "be friends with them, close friends <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> they die <b>you</b> don't need to worry. You'll get the order every time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, sir," [...] said Baldwin, {{returning}} the letter {{without looking at}} it; [...] "I'll take your word for it, sir, as it's not much in my line {{to make out the}} meanin' o' pot-hooks <b>and</b> hangers.--Now, <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> will <b>you</b> have your first lesson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And didn't it {{make you}} wild?" [...] enquired Veronica, [...] "when first of all they'd ask what you'd got to say and why you'd done it, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tried to explain things to them, wouldn't listen to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is Dick who answers. 'You're awfully pretty, Laura. You {{are even}} prettier than I thought. I {{remember}} I used to think, she can't {{be quite as}} pretty as I think her; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came you were just a little prettier.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't call it that, if you'd {{ever tried}} to collect it. You stand out of your money until harvest's in, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> drive round the homestead's empty, and somebody's written on the door, 'Sorry I couldn't pack the house off.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Let us, Sir, embrace some {{system or}} other before we end this session. Do {{you mean to}} tax America, and to draw a {{productive}} revenue from thence? If you do, speak out: name, fix, ascertain this revenue; settle its quantity; define its objects; provide for its collection; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fight, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have something to fight for. If you murder, rob; if you kill, take possession; and do {{not appear in the}} character of madmen as well as assassins, violent, vindictive, bloody, and tyrannical, without an object. But may better counsels guide you! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never heard tell {{of such a}} {{thing in}} my life,' he was saying. 'In {{training}} for a month with all the weight of it on my shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> I get <b>you</b> as fit as a trout, and within two days of fighting the likeliest man on the list, you let yourself into a by-battle with a foreigner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down! If I vexed you, I'm sorry; but {{you really}} shouldn't be so quick in temper. Besides, you shouldn't have flung the news at me in that startling fashion. After all, I've no doubt he has {{something}} to recommend him. Most {{of them have a}} few good qualities which now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> become evident <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't expect them." ...|$|R
60|$|BLANCO. He's a sly one. He's a mean one. He lies low for you. He plays cat {{and mouse}} with you. He lets you run loose until you think youre shut of him; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> least expect it, he's got you.|$|E
6000|$|Then she smoked in gloomy silence, while Mr. Wrenn remarked, {{after some}} mental labor, [...] "I guess they're like cattlemen--the cattle-ier they are, the more romantic they look, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{get to know}} them the chief trouble with them is that they're cattlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you can be}} {{constant}} in your love you may win her yet. Remember how young she is; and how young you both are. Come again in two years' time, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have won her, you shall tell me that I {{have been a good}} old woman to you both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do. It isn't much, {{but it will}} do. Now {{when the}} man comes I {{will be out of}} the way. You speak to him. Give him some money; only a little, mind! <b>And</b> promise more. <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get there you will be guided by your husband, of course. And don't forget to tell him that Captain Lingard is {{at the mouth of the}} river--the {{northern}} entrance. You will remember. Won't you? The northern branch. Lingard is--death." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{shall not}} love {{me for what}} daily spends; You shall not know me in the noisy street, Where I, as others, follow petty ends; Nor when in fair saloons we chance to meet; Nor when I'm jaded, sick, anxious or mean. But love me <b>then</b> <b>and</b> only, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know Me for the channel of the rivers of God From deep ideal fontal heavens that flow.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is prejudiced," [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. McLean warmly, prejudice being {{a failing}} which all women marvel at. [...] "Just {{listen to what}} the boy said to Elspeth to-day. He said to her, 'When I am away, try for a whole day to be better than you ever were before, and think of nothing else, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> prayer-time comes <b>you</b> will see that you have been happy without knowing it.' Fancy his finding out that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You showed {{your wish}} to make play of your work, that day when you were getting in your chips, by insisting on having just such a basket as you {{happened}} to fancy; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> got a little tired of that, going for the wheelbarrow; and then leaving the chips altogether, and going to piling the wood.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{that is not}} so," [...] Mrs. Makely interrupted. [...] "There {{are plenty}} of rich people one wouldn't wish to know at all, and who really can't get into society--who are ignorant and vulgar. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to money, I don't see but what country people are as glad to get it as anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dickens and {{her sister}} beg to present their remembrances to your Grace, and their {{congratulations}} on your recovery. I saw Paxton now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were ill, and always received from him most encouraging accounts. I don't know how heavy {{he is going to}} be (I mean in the scale), but I begin to think Daniel Lambert must have been in his family.|$|E
5000|$|Italians were masons, Romanians were {{building}} terraces, the Gypsies were coolies. Albanians and Greeks worked in stone, Germans and Hungarians were carpenters. Turks were burning brick. Engineers were Polish {{and the stone}} carvers were Czech. The Frenchmen were drawing, the Englishmen were measuring, <b>and</b> so was <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> could see hundreds of national costumes and fourteen languages in which they spoke, sang, cursed and quarreled in all dialects and tones, a joyful mix of men, horses, cart oxen and domestic buffaloes.|$|R
6000|$|... "But this," [...] Ned went on, [...] "is {{the last}} resource, {{and will not}} be taken until nought else can be done to save you. It is for you, first, to show the Spaniards how the men of Holland can fight for their freedom, their religion, their families, <b>and</b> their homes. <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have done all that men can do, the prince will prove to the Spaniards that the men of Holland will lay their country under water rather than surrender." ...|$|R
500|$|Weiner {{said that}} the episode is [...] "about the {{children}}. It's about {{who is going to}} take care of the children. Youth is a big part of our lives in general. Now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think of the sixties and the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you." [...] Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was [...] "of the next wave" [...] as a youthful employee who is [...] "unfamiliar with social rules", with Weiner also declaring that [...] "there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people".|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course! One of the first. I {{think it}} was Ball's Bluff. Well, she's married. But she married his cousin, and as Dick Burton says, that isn't so bad. Isn't it awful, Mrs. Clapp's losing all her boys,--all five of them? It does seem to bear too hard on some families. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see {{every one of those}} six Armstrongs going through without a scratch!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “For {{years and}} years. One gets so little encouragement. First you bolt {{away from my}} tears, then you send an impertinent message, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come at last you pretend to behave respectfully, though you don’t {{know how to do}} it. You should sit much nearer the edge of the chair and hold {{yourself}} very stiff, and make it quite clear that you don’t {{know what to do with}} your hands.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m sure I hope so; I hope so,” {{said the}} Major moodily. “I must break this {{sequence}} of blank days. One hears {{so often that}} a fox has settled down as a tenant for life in certain covers, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go to turn him out there isn’t a trace of him. I’m certain a fox was shot or trapped in Lady Widden’s woods the very day before we drew them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{never have}} been quite able to decide, myself, which is the more irritating to run two miles {{at the top of}} your speed, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to find, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> reach the station, that you are three-quarters of an hour too early; or to stroll along leisurely the whole way, and dawdle about outside the booking-office, talking to some local idiot, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to swagger {{carelessly}} on to the platform, just in time to see the train go out! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, {{thank you}} a {{thousand}} times! You {{have taken a}} weight off my mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan's. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that happened. I dare not say anything of it. You will read for yourself <b>and</b> judge. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> I see <b>you,</b> perhaps, you will be very kind {{and tell me what}} you think." ...|$|R
5000|$|Janet Maslin in The New York Times commented: 'The tone of {{the novel}} might be mild and nattering if Ms. Atkinson were not so handy with the chill-worthy frisson. Jackson keeps {{summoning}} the phrase “For want of a nail ...” to convey the kinds of fateful repercussions that each bit of the story has...And Ms. Atkinson writes passages that simply have to be read twice, once <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first travel through the book <b>and</b> <b>then</b> later, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want {{to see just how}} she tricked you.' and she concludes 'Ms. Atkinson remains a wonderful stylist and Grade A schemer, even with a book that’s overcluttered. But she was never confined to the crime genre, has written in assorted other modes and excels at them all. Whatever she goes on to write, she leaves Jackson Brodie at a suspenseful and pivotal moment. Future installments are well worth waiting for." ...|$|R
