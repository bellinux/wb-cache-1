5|$|Considerable {{work was}} also {{involved}} in building the roadway up the three-percent grade at {{the east end of}} Allegheny Mountain, the steepest grade the turnpike traversed. The base of Evitts Mountain was blasted to carry the turnpike across Bedford Narrows along with US30, the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River and <b>a</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Railroad branch line. In New Baltimore, the turnpike commission had to purchase land from St. John's Church (which contained a cemetery); as part of the agreement, stairways were built {{on either side of the}} turnpike to provide access to the church.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when <b>a</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E

5|$|The {{first white}} {{settlers}} in Lackawanna County settled near Keyser Creek. Timothy Keys, Solomon Hocksey, and Andrew Hickman constructed homes at this location in 1769.

5|$|Losses had {{remained}} stable since the 1990s at 17–20% per year attributable {{to a variety}} of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by <b>a</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might {{no longer be able to}} pollinate or produce honey.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the delegates}} at the {{convention}} continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined. On the second ballot of the day, <b>a</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> delegate named W. A.

The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F.

5|$|Past US 1, I-476 {{continues}} through wooded suburban areas and interchanges with Pennsylvania Route 3 in Broomall, where it widens to six lanes. The route continues to Radnor Township, on the Main Line, where it interchanges with U.S. Route 30. Stone monuments, including a large stone cairn atop {{a hill and}} a large crushed-stone image of a mythological griffin on a hillside, were constructed at the Route 30 interchange to commemorate Radnor's history {{as part of the}} Welsh Tract. Proceeding northward, the route enters Montgomery County and comes to an interchange with Interstate 76 (Schuylkill Expressway) at West Conshohocken. After crossing the Schuylkill River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, the freeway heads into Plymouth Township, where it interchanges with Ridge Pike and Germantown Pike before coming to the Mid-County Interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. The entire length of the Blue Route is designated the Blue Route Scenic Byway, <b>a</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Scenic Byway.|$|E

The park is near the borough of Benton on Pennsylvania Route 118 and Pennsylvania Route 487, and is in five townships: Sugarloaf in Columbia County, Fairmount and Ross in Luzerne County, and Colley and Davidson in Sullivan County.|$|E
5|$|The Ninth Amendment {{declares}} {{that there are}} additional fundamental rights that exist outside the Constitution. The rights enumerated in the Constitution are not an explicit and exhaustive list of individual rights. It was rarely mentioned in Supreme Court decisions before {{the second half of}} the 20th century, when it was cited by several of the justices in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The Court in that case voided a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives as an infringement of the right of marital privacy. This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built decisions in several landmark cases, including, Roe v. Wade (1973), which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get an abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated <b>a</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining an abortion.|$|E

The {{state forest}} originated as <b>a</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Railroad hunting preserve {{in the early}} 20thcentury, and the hunting lodge, forester's house, and stable is preserved and today used as the Redden Forest Education Center east of the hamlet of Redden. The U.S. Highway also passes near McColley's Chapel and crosses Gravelly Branch, one of {{the headwaters of the}} Nanticoke River, north of Redden. US 113 curves north and passes by the Ellendale State Forest Picnic Facility, a picnic area accessible from the northbound direction that the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed in the late 1930s for tourists and long-distance travelers. West of Ellendale, which flourished in the late 19th century as a railroad town at the junction of perpendicular rail lines, the highway intersects DE16 (Beach Highway) and passes Teddy's Tavern, which was built in 1923 as the Blue Hen Garage to serve travelers on the DuPont Highway.|$|E
5|$|Boyce was {{recognized}} with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926, {{the first year}} it was awarded, for his efforts in starting the BSA. He was the third recipient, after Baden-Powell and the Unknown Scout. During the BSA's 50th anniversary in 1960, 15,000 Scouts and several of Boyce's descendants gathered in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend. Illinois governor William Stratton delivered the key address and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive. In 1985, about 2,500 Scouts attended a 75th anniversary pilgrimage in Ottawa, attended by his last surviving child, Virginia, and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame member. Boyce {{had been a member}} from 1891 until he died. On December 6, 1997, a Scouting museum opened in Ottawa. The W. D. Boyce Council of the BSA is named in his honor. <b>A</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> State Historical Marker located on Boyce Campus of Community College of Allegheny County in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, recognizes his achievements to Scouting. Not far from the marker is a county park, Boyce Park, that was named for him. A medallion of Boyce is near the White House as part of The Extra Mile– Points of Light Volunteer Pathway. In 2005, the BSA introduced the William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award, presented to the organizer of any new Scouting unit.|$|E
