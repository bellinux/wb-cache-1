60|$|Between Macedon and the {{southern}} states of Greece was a range of lofty and almost impassable mountains. These mountains extended through the whole interior of the country, and the main route leading into southern Greece passed around to the eastward of them, where they terminated in cliffs, leaving a narrow passage between the cliffs and the sea. This pass was called the Pass of Thermopylæ, and it was considered the key to Greece. There was a town named <b>Anthela</b> near the pass, on the outward side.|$|E
60|$|There was {{in those}} days a sort of general {{congress}} or assembly of the states of Greece, which was held from time to time, to decide questions and disputes in which the different states were continually getting involved with each other. This assembly was called the Amphictyonic Council, on account, as is said, of its having been established by a certain king named Amphictyon. A meeting of this council was appointed to receive Alexander. It was {{to be held at}} Thermopylæ, or, rather, at <b>Anthela,</b> which was just without the pass, and was the usual place at which the council assembled. This was because the pass was in an intermediate position between the northern and southern portions of Greece, and thus equally accessible from either.|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} cymose corymb {{is similar}} to a racemose corymb but has a panicle-like structure. Another type of panicle is the <b>anthela.</b> An <b>anthela</b> is a cymose corymb with the lateral flowers higher than the central ones.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{far from}} <b>Anthela,</b> which {{lay on the}} coast of Malis south of Thessaly in the {{locality}} of Thermopylae, Boeotia was an early member of the oldest religious Amphictyonic League (Anthelian) [...] because her people had originally lived in Thessaly.|$|E
50|$|Amphictyonis in Greek mythology is {{a goddess}} {{of wine and}} {{friendship}} between nations, a local form of Demeter. Demeter was worshiped under this name at <b>Anthela,</b> {{because it was a}} meeting place for the amphictyons of Thermopylae, who offered sacrifices to her at the start of every meeting.|$|E
50|$|In {{ancient times}} it was called Malis which was named after the Malians (Μαλιεῖς), a Greek tribe that lived near present-day Lamia at the delta of the river, Spercheios in Greece. The Malian Gulf is also named after them. In the western valley of the Spercheios their land was {{adjacent}} to the Aenianes. Their main town was named Trachis. In the town of <b>Anthela,</b> the Malians had an important temple of Demeter, an early center of the Anthelan Amphictiony.|$|E
5000|$|Thermopylae {{translated}} to English means [...] "hot gates" [...] {{and the name}} is related with its hot sulphur springs. This is also, in Greek mythology, {{the place of the}} cavernous entrance to Hades. The first mentioned Amphictyony was centered on the cult of Demeter which was located at the city of <b>Anthela</b> near Thermopylae. The delegates to the Amphictiony were dubbed the Pylagorai (or gate-assemblers in Greek), since Demeter was a local goddess in many of her older local cults, and perhaps a reference to the gates of Hades ...|$|E
5000|$|The oldest {{religious}} Amphictyonic League {{was known}} as Anthelian, because it was centered on {{the cult of the}} chthonic goddess Demeter at <b>Anthela.</b> The twelve delegates were entitled Pylagorai (gate-assemblers), perhaps a reference to the local Gates of Hades, since Demeter was a chthonic goddess in her older local cults. The immediate dwellers-round were some small states and also Achaea-Phthiotis that probably {{paved the way for the}} entry of the body of the rest Boeotian tribes which were living around Thessaly (perioikoi). Boeotia and Phocis the remotest may have joined only during or after the [...] "First Sacred War", which led to the defeat of the old priesthood and to a new control of the prosperity of the oracle at Delphi.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinct}} Thessalian tribal {{identity and}} culture {{first began to}} form from the 9th century BC on as a mixture of the local population and immigrants from Epirus, first {{in the region of}} the Pelasgiotis, with Pherae as its main centre. From there they quickly expanded inland to the plain of the Pineios and towards the Malian Gulf. The Thessalians spoke a distinct form of Aeolic Greek. In the late 7th century BC, the Thessalians conquered the so-called perioikoi. In this process the Thessalians captured <b>Anthela</b> and came to control the local amphictyony. By assuming the former share of the perioikoi in the Delphic Amphictyony, the Thessalians also came to play {{a leading role in the}} latter, providing 14 of the 24 hieromnemones and presiding over the Pythian Games. As a result of the First Sacred War (595-585 BC), the Thessalians briefly extended their sway over Phocis as well, but the Boeotians drove them back after the battles of Hyampolis and Ceressus in the mid-6th century.|$|E
