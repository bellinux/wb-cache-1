5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E

Merchants could offer promotions {{in their own}} store, sell the soap, or use the soap themselves.

The first W Hotel to premiere a Bliss Spa was the W New York in New York City in November 2004. All W Hotels also feature Bliss in-room amenities, {{regardless of whether or not}} the hotel houses an actual Bliss Spa. The “Bliss Sinkside Six-Pack” includes a face wash, body wash, body butter, shampoo, conditioner and <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> soap.

Each of the rebels is given <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> gold {{and the rest is}} buried as they wait for the transport to arrive. The convoy goes to the Iranian border, where the three Americans intend to escort the rebels across to protect them from the Iraqi soldiers guarding the crossing. But the American officers arrive and stop the group, arresting the trio while the rebels are recaptured. Archie proffers the buried gold to the American officers in exchange for letting the refugees through. The commanding officer acquiesces to assisting the rebels get into Iran, but still states that charges (of being absent without leave and disobeying orders by contradicting American post-war policy) and courts-martial will be convened against Archie, Troy, and Chief Elgin.|$|E
25|$|A subplot {{involves}} John Bates, Lord Grantham's new valet, and Thomas Barrow, who resents Bates replacing him {{and causing}} Barrow to be demoted back to footman.

In the story line, Barrow, a gay man in late Edwardian England, aided by Miss O'Brien, Lady Grantham's maid, creates havoc {{for most of the}} staff. Barrow is caught stealing but hands in his notice as he has joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. Matthew eventually falls in love with Lady Mary, but she rejects his proposal. Cora becomes pregnant, but miscarries after O'Brien, mistakenly believing she was to be fired, retaliates by leaving <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> soap on the slippery bathroom floor.

25|$|Ellis is imprisoned {{with other}} accused collaborators, and humiliated and {{tortured}} by the violently anti-Nazi volunteer jailers, but is rescued by Akkermans, now a {{colonel in the}} Dutch Army. Akkermans brings her to his medical office, and tells her that he killed Franken when the Nazi tried to escape. He shows her the cash and jewels stolen from Franken's Jewish victims. When informed about Müntze's fate, Ellis goes into shock, and Akkermans administers a tranquilizer which is in fact an overdose of insulin. Ellis, feeling dizzy, sees the bottle of insulin and survives by quickly eating <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> chocolate. She realizes then that Akkermans was a traitor who had collaborated with Franken and had killed the Smaals. While Akkermans is distracted, waving to a crowd that cheers him, she jumps from his balcony into the crowd below and runs away. He tries to follow her, but is blocked by the very same people cheering him as a hero of the Resistance.|$|E
25|$|With {{her husband}} and her brother-in-law, Alexander Putyatin, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna left Tsarkoie Selo in late July. Without {{traveling}} documents and fearing to be arrested at any stop, Maria Pavlovna, {{her husband and}} brother-in-law, made their way by train during two nights and a day. On August 4, they reached Orsha, in today's Belarus, joining many other refuges in similar situation. From the train station, they went straight to the frontier with German occupied Ukraine. She had concealed, inside <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> soap, a Swedish document identifying her as a former royal princess of that country. This allowed her to enter Ukraine. From there, they continued south until reaching Kiev where new adventures followed. In November, the fugitives made their way to Odessa. After reaching Kishinev, Moldavia, they received an invitation from Queen Marie of Romania, Maria's first cousin, who had used Joseph W. Boyle to track them down and bring them to safety. Ill with influenza, the grand duchess arrived in Romania beginning her life in exile.|$|E
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E
