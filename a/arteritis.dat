5|$|Van Eyck {{does not}} shy from showing the {{physical}} {{effects of the}} canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal <b>arteritis.</b>|$|E

25|$|Other {{causes of}} the {{development}} of AAA include: infection, trauma, <b>arteritis,</b> and cystic medial necrosis.|$|E
25|$|Large vessel disease {{involves}} the common and internal carotid arteries, the vertebral artery, and the Circle of Willis. Diseases that may form thrombi {{in the large}} vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction (tightening of the artery), aortic, carotid or vertebral artery dissection, various inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall (Takayasu <b>arteritis,</b> giant cell <b>arteritis,</b> vasculitis), noninflammatory vasculopathy, Moyamoya disease and fibromuscular dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis <b>arteritis</b> is a {{very rare}} {{peripheral}} vascular disease similar to Buerger's disease. There were about 50 confirmed cases from 1960 to 2008, all of which occurred in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Arteriviruses are small, enveloped, animal viruses with an {{icosahedral}} core {{containing a}} positive-sense RNA genome. The family includes equine <b>arteritis</b> virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) of mice and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV).|$|E
25|$|Pulsatile {{tinnitus}} can be {{a symptom}} of intracranial vascular abnormalities and should be evaluated for irregular noises of blood flow (bruits). Some people experience a sound that beats in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus, or vascular tinnitus). Pulsatile tinnitus is usually objective in nature, resulting from altered blood flow, increased blood turbulence near the ear (such as from atherosclerosis, venous hum, {{but it can also}} arise as a subjective phenomenon from an increased awareness of blood flow in the ear. Rarely, pulsatile tinnitus may be a symptom of potentially life-threatening conditions such as carotid artery aneurysm or carotid artery dissection. Pulsatile tinnitus may also indicate vasculitis, or more specifically, giant cell <b>arteritis.</b> Pulsatile tinnitus may also be an indication of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.|$|E
25|$|One {{recommended}} diagnostic {{approach is}} as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging {{and possibly a}} lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test {{to look for a}} brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person, a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal <b>arteritis</b> should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{headaches}} {{are classified}} {{based on their}} cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or <b>arteritis</b> are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders {{in the category of}} secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.|$|E
500|$|Researchers have {{variously}} {{suggested that}} Hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, syphilis, giant-cell <b>arteritis,</b> and tinnitus. In a report {{prepared for the}} OSS in 1943, Walter C. Langer of Harvard University described Hitler as a [...] "neurotic psychopath". In his 1977 book , historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that he suffered from borderline personality disorder. Historians Henrik Eberle and Hans-Joachim Neumann consider that while he suffered {{from a number of}} illnesses including Parkinson's disease, Hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, his decisions. Theories about Hitler's medical condition are difficult to prove, and placing too much weight on them may have the effect of attributing many of the events and consequences of Nazi Germany to the possibly impaired physical health of one individual. Kershaw feels that it is better to take a broader view of German history by examining what social forces led to the Nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for the Holocaust and World WarII based on only one person.|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of other {{diseases}} may cause mouth ulcers. Hematological causes include anemia, hematinic deficiencies, neutropenia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, other white cell dyscrasias, and gammopathies. Gastrointestinal causes include celiac disease, Crohn's disease (orofacial granulomatosis), and ulcerative colitis. [...] Dermatological causes include chronic ulcerative stomatitis, erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), angina bullosa haemorrhagica and lichen planus. Other examples of systemic disease capable of causing mouth ulcers include lupus erythematosus, Sweet syndrome, reactive arthritis, Beh√ßet syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, periarteritis nodosa, giant cell <b>arteritis,</b> diabetes, glucagonoma, sarcoidosis and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis.|$|E
50|$|Giant-cell <b>arteritis</b> and Takayasu's <b>arteritis</b> {{have much}} in common, but usually affect {{patients}} of different ages, with Takayasu's <b>arteritis</b> affecting younger people, and giant-cell <b>arteritis</b> having a later age of onset.|$|E
50|$|Takayasu's <b>arteritis,</b> polyarteritis nodosa {{and giant}} cell <b>arteritis</b> mainly involve arteries {{and are thus}} {{sometimes}} classed specifically under <b>arteritis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Arteritis</b> is the {{inflammation}} of the walls of arteries, usually {{as a result of}} infection or autoimmune response. <b>Arteritis,</b> a complex disorder, is still not entirely understood. <b>Arteritis</b> may be distinguished by its different types, based on the organ systems affected by the disease. A complication of <b>arteritis</b> is thrombosis, which can be fatal. <b>Arteritis</b> and phlebitis are forms of vasculitis.|$|E
5000|$|Large vessel: Polymyalgia rheumatica, Takayasu's <b>arteritis,</b> Temporal <b>arteritis</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of giant cell {{formations}} is giant-cell <b>arteritis,</b> it is also known as temporal <b>arteritis</b> or cranial <b>arteritis.</b> This type of <b>arteritis</b> causes the arteries in the head, neck, and arm area to swell to abnormal sizes. Although this disease has no apparent causes it seems to be related to polymyalgia rheumatica.|$|E
50|$|The age at onset {{helps to}} {{differentiate}} Takayasu's <b>arteritis</b> from {{other types of}} large vessel vasculitis. For example, Takaysu's <b>arteritis</b> has an age of onset of <40 years, while giant cell <b>arteritis</b> has an age of onset >60 years.|$|E
5000|$|Temporal <b>arteritis,</b> {{the second}} type of giant cell <b>arteritis,</b> is also a chronic, {{inflammatory}} disease involving mid- to large-sized arteries. Temporal <b>arteritis</b> has a higher incidence in people of Scandinavian descent. [...] However, the incidence rate differs based on population, region and races. Temporal <b>arteritis</b> is not uncommon in North America. The incidence rate is around 0.017% for individuals over 50 years of age.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{secondary}} <b>arteritis</b> is <b>arteritis</b> caused by infection with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans.|$|E
5000|$|Giant cell <b>arteritis</b> {{contains}} {{two different types}} of arteritides that are almost indistinguishable from one another. [...] It includes two types,e temporal <b>arteritis</b> and Takayasu <b>arteritis.</b> Both types contain an occupancy of medium- and larger-sized arteries which are categorized based on the infiltration of the giant cells.|$|E
50|$|About 15% {{of people}} who are {{diagnosed}} with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal <b>arteritis,</b> and about 50% of people with temporal <b>arteritis</b> have polymyalgia rheumatica. Some symptoms of temporal <b>arteritis</b> include headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw or facial soreness, distorted vision, or aching in the limbs caused by decreased blood flow, and fatigue.|$|E
5000|$|This type of <b>arteritis</b> is {{most common}} in females, with a median age of 25 years. Takayasu <b>arteritis</b> {{is more common in}} women of Asian descent who are in their {{reproductive}} years. [...] However, over the past decades, its incidence in Africa, Europe, and North America has been increasing. Takayasu <b>arteritis</b> is an inflammatory disease that mainly affects the larger vessels such as the aorta and its surrounding branches. Research focused on Takayasu <b>arteritis</b> in the western parts of the world remains limited. An estimation suggests that, each year, the number of cases per million people is 2.6.|$|E
50|$|Arteritic {{anterior}} ischemic {{optic neuropathy}} (AAION or arteritic AION) {{is the cause}} of vision loss that occurs in temporal <b>arteritis</b> (aka giant cell <b>arteritis).</b> Temporal <b>arteritis</b> is an inflammatory disease of medium-sized blood vessels that happens especially with advancing age. AAION occurs in about 15-20 percent of patients with temporal <b>arteritis.</b> Damage to the blood vessels supplying the optic nerves leads to insufficient blood supply (ischemia) to the nerve and subsequent optic nerve fiber death. Most cases of AAION result in nearly complete vision loss first to one eye. If the temporal <b>arteritis</b> is left untreated, the fellow eye will likely suffer vision loss as well within 1-2 weeks. Arteritic AION falls under the general category of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which also includes non-arteritic AION. AION is considered an eye emergency, immediate treatment is essential to rescue remaining vision.|$|E
50|$|Takayasu's <b>arteritis,</b> {{disorder}} of the aorta.|$|E
50|$|Aortitis is most {{commonly}} seen {{in patients with}} syphilis, autoimmune vasculitis (giant cell <b>arteritis,</b> Takayasu's <b>arteritis),</b> polymyalgia rheumatica, and rheumatoid arthritis. IgG4-related disease has more recently {{been identified as a}} cause of aortitis, and also as a cause of periaortitis (inflammation surrounding the aorta).|$|E
5000|$|In radiology, {{the halo}} sign is {{a finding of}} a dark halo around the {{arterial}} lumen on ultrasound that suggests the diagnosis of temporal <b>arteritis.</b> [...] The standard diagnostic test for temporal <b>arteritis</b> is biopsy; however, ultrasound and MRI show promise for replacing it.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{with the}} disease often notice {{symptoms}} between 15 and 30 years of age. In the Western world, atherosclerosis is a more frequent cause of obstruction of the aortic arch vessels than Takayasu's <b>arteritis.</b> Takayasu's <b>arteritis</b> is similar {{to other forms of}} vasculitis, including giant cell <b>arteritis</b> which typically affects older individuals. Due to obstruction of the main branches of the aorta, including the left common carotid artery, the brachiocephalic artery, and the left subclavian artery, Takayasu's <b>arteritis</b> can present as pulseless upper extremities (arms, hands, and wrists with weak or absent pulses on the physical examination) which may be why it is also commonly referred to as the [...] "pulseless disease." [...] Involvement of renal arteries may lead to a presentation of renovascular hypertension.|$|E

50|$|Giant-cell <b>arteritis</b> (GCA), {{also called}} {{temporal}} <b>arteritis,</b> cranial <b>arteritis,</b> or Horton disease is an inflammatory disease {{of blood vessels}} most commonly involving large and medium arteries of the head, predominantly {{the branches of the}} external carotid artery. The most serious complication is occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, which is a branch of the internal carotid. It can create a medical emergency which can cause irreversible ischemia and blindness if not treated promptly. GCA is treated with glucocorticoids (steroids), which reduce the inflammation and prevent Vascular occlusion. No other drugs are effective or contribute to the effect of glucocorticoids.|$|E
50|$|Examples include giant cell <b>arteritis,</b> {{microscopic}} polyangiitis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.|$|E
