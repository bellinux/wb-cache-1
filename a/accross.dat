40|$|In {{an effort}} to achieve {{sustainable}} Natural Resource Management (NRM), the Commonwealth and State governments have moved to a regional focus for their major funding programs. This approach was driven by the belief that previous arrangements {{had been unable to}} achieve the required amount of change at the appropriate landscape scale and that state and national priorities were not being addressed. The authors, with a background in regional and national NRM and Landcare <b>accross</b> the three Eastern states, have used their experience and knowledge of recent literature in this area, to evaluate the regional approach to NRM. As part of our evaluation we review theassumptions behind the move to the regional model and explore its strengths and weakness. Some of the key strengths of the approach are that it facilitates landscape-scale management, enhances integration <b>accross</b> agencies and governments, and builds partnerships and enhances the capacity of participants. A key weakness is that there continues to be a focus on outputs rather than outcomes and this hinders our learning about how to improve NRM. Other weaknesses are poorly developed methologies to underpin integration at the regional sacle, the high transaction costs involved in operating <b>accross</b> the federal structure, insufficient autonomy for regional groups, and a lack of forward funding commitments...|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterial}} protein toxins {{endowed with}} the ability to translocate <b>accross</b> the plasmatic membrane are often crucial virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria invading eucaryotic organisms. These toxins translocate either their own protein domains carrying toxic activity or can form pores transfering other substances like small ions, DNA, RNA or proteins. By observing the translocation of these molecules together with others artificially prepared agens on synthetic membranes allows detailed understanding of mode of action of individual pore- forming toxins. Some of the toxins were actually described in such a detail, that can serve as investigation tools for characterization of new translocated molecules. One of such example is the transfer of nucleotides or whole nucleic acid molecules <b>accross</b> the membrane pore of α- hemolysine of S. aureus.

Group of biological factors, including serotonergic system, HPA axis and some genetic factors, are being studied as potential markers, able to differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal behaviour across {{the group of}} PTSD patients.

The hypothesis {{of this study is}} that periferal biochemical markers are different <b>accross</b> the groups of PTSD patients with and without attempted suicide and the group of healthy controls. Our results have shown significantly lower platelet serotonine concentration in PTSD patients with and without suicide behaviour, compared to healthy controls.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a modeJ which broadly fits some of the salient features of Inter-industry wage differentials. Several recent empirical papers have found wage differences <b>accross</b> industries to be large and persistent. They also show high concordance <b>accross</b> occupations and countries. High wages appear to be paid in industries that have high capital/labor ratios and are highly profitable. Our model explains these facts on the basis of firm-specific human capital accumulation by individual workers. We focus on the bargaining between experienced workers and the firm over the division of the surplus output an experienced worker produces over that produced by inexperienced workers. We show that this surplus, and therefore equilibrium wages of trained workers, depends on the the capital/labor ratio when the technology has putty-clay features. We also show that when there is multilateral bargaining between all firms and experienced workers, wages also depend on the profitability of the firm. oo">t 61987...|$|E
