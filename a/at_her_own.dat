However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund the project, as she was devoting her time and money to the Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery in Compton. Work to fill the three empty rows of the memorial was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Potter had {{maintained}} {{contact with her}} last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she sent illustrated story letters to the children. Mrs. Moore recognised the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish. Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it {{for family and friends}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> expense in December 1901.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 Giridhar {{enrolled}} at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi for higher studies in Vyakarana. He topped the final examination for the Shastri (Bachelor of Arts) degree in 1974, and then enrolled for the Acharya (Master of Arts) degree at the same institute. While pursuing his master's degree, he visited New Delhi to participate in various national competitions at the All-India Sanskrit Conference, where he won five out of the eight gold medals—in Vyakarana, Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta, and Sanskrit Antakshari. Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India, presented the five gold medals, along with the Chalvaijayanti trophy for Uttar Pradesh, to Giridhar. Impressed by his abilities, Gandhi offered to send him <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> expense to the United States for treatment for his eyes, but Giridhar turned down this offer, replying with an extemporaneous Sanskrit verse.|$|E

5|$|Clouzot's {{return to}} work {{reassured}} the doctors and insurers and {{he returned to the}} film studio to make his final film La Prisonnière. The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968. He began filming La Prisonnière again in August 1968. Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film L'enfer into La Prisonnière. La Prisonnière is about a woman who is introduced to a photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures of young women. The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> pleasure in the activity. After finishing La Prisonnière, Clouzot's health grew worse. In the 1970s, he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them, including a feature about Indochina. He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline, but the film was abandoned. Clouzot's health grew worse and he required open-heart surgery in November 1976. On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to The Damnation of Faust. Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Widow Elena Vinea {{inherited}} {{his collection}} of manuscripts, and helped to publish the lesser known Tzara pieces from the Gârceni era.

A reissue of his complete works was being put out by Elena Zaharia-Filipaș, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> expense, at the George Călinescu Institute and, later, the Museum of Romanian Literature. Writers Nicolae Tzone and Ion Lazu founded an eponymous publishing house and also took his works, putting up a memorial plaque on Braziliei Street; these projects earned endorsement from Voica Vinea, who inherited the Braziliei Street home.|$|E

25|$|Sir Robert {{eventually}} convinced Jane {{to marry}} him, {{and with the}} assistance of Jane's advisers, notaries Robert Scurfield and Joseph John Wright, the marriage settlement stipulated that half of her income should be <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> disposal, but Sir Robert secured £1,000 a year for his own private use. The couple were married on 6 November 1815 at St Michael's Church, Houghton-le-Spring; she aged about 64 and he about 43. Peat had tried to introduce his wife to fashionable society in London, but on finding she had slipped away from the guests and was found talking to the servants in the kitchen, he thought her seemingly unfit for it and returned her to Sunderland. He lived apart from her at his vicarage in New Brentford and visited her just twice a year.|$|E
25|$|She {{founded the}} National League of Women Freethinkers and its journal, La Nueva Mujer. She helped {{organize}} the first International Congress of Women in 1910, and later {{helped organize the}} first National Child Welfare Congress. Her application for a faculty position at her alma mater's Medical School was denied on grounds {{that she was a}} still a resident alien, prompting her to apply for Argentine citizenship. Single immigrant women, however, were not generally granted citizenship in Argentina. Lanteri married Dr. Alberto Renshaw in 1910, and following an eight-month-long lawsuit, she was granted citizenship in 1911. The marriage was in itself controversial, as he was 14 years younger than the bride. The same pretext was used to deny her enrollment in the Psychiatry course <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> alma mater's School of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|From around 1952, {{when she}} gave her Met farewell, until her death 10 years later, Flagstad's health {{steadily}} deteriorated. She {{was in and out}} of hospitals on an increasing basis both in the number and the length of her stays for a variety of ailments. She even joked with an interviewer in 1958 that Oslo hospital had become her home away from home. From 1958 to 1960, Flagstad was the first Director of the Norwegian National Opera. In her last years she gave many benefit concerts throughout Norway. She was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 1960 and died of the disease on 7 December 1962. <b>At</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> request she was buried in an unmarked grave in Vestre Gravlund Cemetery in the Frogner borough of Oslo.

25|$|Chadwick entered {{swimming}} competitions {{from a young}} age, scoring {{her first}} win the age of ten, but she realized she preferred ocean events rather than pool swims. At the age of 10 she became the youngest person to swim across the mouth of San Diego Bay. Starting at age eleven she competed in rough water swims, winning an annual 2.5-mile race in the ocean off La Jolla 10 times in 18 years. She swam in Southern California ocean races as an amateur for several decades, but had her heart set on swimming the English Channel. In 1950 she attempted to enter a 1950 Channel-swimming contest sponsored by the Daily Mail, but was refused {{for lack of a}} significant reputation. She determined to try <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> expense, failing in July after 14 hours in the water, but succeeding in August in her best-known contribution to swimming history.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{publication}} of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902, Potter planned a book of nursery rhymes called Appley Dapply, but Warne preferred her original (rather than her derivative work) and offered only modest encouragement. The project was dear to Potter's heart, and she continued to develop the concept while working on other productions for Warne. Potter planned Appley Dapply as a large format book with page borders and decorations in a style reminiscent of Walter Crane and Randolph Caldecott, and even considered publishing the book <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> expense if Warne lost what little interest {{he had in the}} project. In late 1904 she offered Warne a dummy book of ninety-four pages and thirty rhymes, twenty-one of which Warne approved for future publication. When Warne died suddenly and unexpectedly in August 1905, the book of rhymes was set aside, and Potter turned her attention to other projects.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of ten years Mother Mariana {{struggled}} {{with the issue of}} completing the statue. Many obstacles prevented its sculpting. One obstacle was a fear of idolatry {{on the part of the}} native people in Quito. Another was Mother Mariana’s personal fear of not being believed and thus putting the convent in jeopardy. In the year 1610, she asked the permission of the Bishop to create the statue. The sculpting of the statue of Our Lady of Good Success was given to Francisco del Castillo. Castillo was chosen as he was a talented sculptor and a devotee of the Blessed Mother. The statue of Our Lady of Good Success was blessed on February 2, 1611. On that day, she was placed above the seat of the Abbess chair <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> specific request as a sign to all that she was the one who governed and watched over the convent. Her official title being that of “Mary of Good Success of the Purification”.|$|E
