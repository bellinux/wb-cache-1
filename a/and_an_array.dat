5|$|Goldenheart is an {{eccentric}} R album that draws on dream pop, alternative, and dance genres. Its mostly midtempo songs have strong grooves and feature synthesizers, string settings, vintage keyboards, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of percussive sounds. A post-breakup concept album, Richard's songwriting poses relationships and personal subjects as epic tales through magical, medieval imagery and allusions to high fantasy and science fiction tropes.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society, which {{promotes}} the exploration, settlement, {{and development of}} the Moon, named a Moon crater after Jackson. In the same year, for Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. In 2010, two university librarians found that Jackson's influence extended to academia, with references to Jackson in reports concerning music, popular culture, chemistry <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of other topics.|$|E

5|$|The Presidential Inaugural Committee {{and members}} of the 111th U.S.Congress {{distributed}} invitations and color-coded tickets to both dignitaries and ordinary citizens for the reserved sections on or near the U.S.Capitol grounds to view the swearing-in ceremony. Invitations and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses, but not to other representatives of foreign countries, and invitations were distributed to U.S.politicians <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry. House and Senate congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first‑come, first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event.|$|E
5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Carey was {{discovered}} by Tommy Mottola, CEO of Columbia Records, and was promptly signed to the label. Carey's self-titled debut studio album, released the following year, focused on re-recording and mastering several songs she had already written in high school alongside classmate, Ben Margulies. Aside from the seven songs taken from Carey's demo tape, four other tracks were written and produced by the former <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of famed record producers. The album was complimented by critics, who called it a mature debut, full of various genre influences ranging from pop, R and soul. The album became a commercial success, selling fifteen million units globally. While making a strong impact on pop music, Carey became interested in altering her sound, and deviating from pop music for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Following the success of her debut, Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical departure, enabling her to change her genre infusions, melodies and production.|$|E

5|$|Kentrosaurus {{was a small}} stegosaur. It had {{the typical}} dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a small head, a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, {{horizontal}} and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of plates and spikes running along {{both sides of the}} top mid-line of the animal. Only a single complete tooth was known when Hennig published his monography in 1925. Later, a part of a dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the front lower jaw, was found, which bears a just emerging tooth, and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges.|$|E
5|$|Later {{research}} {{has managed to}} create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations). Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables {{to account for the}} observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of dots. More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to undertake a}} cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The coast of Normandy {{was chosen as the}} site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha, the British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno. To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead, special technology was developed, including two artificial ports called Mulberry harbours <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart's Funnies. In {{the months leading up to}} the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, Operation Bodyguard, using both electronic and visual misinformation. This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of developing fortifications all along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of this engagement, the trapped Pompée and Hannibal were under heavy fire from the {{anchored}} Formidable <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of Spanish batteries and gunboats, both ships taking severe damage {{without being able to}} effectively reply as their main broadsides now faced away from the enemy. On Hannibal the situation seemed hopeless: as casualties mounted, the main and mizen masts were shot away and the ship remained firmly and irretrievably grounded. Pompée was in a slightly better position: Sterling's rigging was in tatters, but his masts held and his ship was at least afloat, although totally becalmed. At one stage, Pompées colours were shot away, leading to French claims that the ship had surrendered, although they were quickly replaced. At 11:30, no longer able to contribute to the battle with rigging torn and more than 70 casualties, Saumarez ordered the remainder of the squadron to send their remaining boats to tow Pompée out of danger, the boats coming under heavy fire as they did so, with a number sunk.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
