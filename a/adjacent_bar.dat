40|$|A novel AIN {{monolithic}} microchannel cooled heatsink {{for high}} power laser diode array is introduced. The high power stack laser diode array with an AIN monolithic microchannel heatsink is fabricated and tested. The thermal impedance of a 10 stack laser diode array is 0. 121 ℃/W. The pitch between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>bars</b> is 1. 17 mm. The power level of 611 W is achieved under the 20 % duty factor condition at an emission wavelength around 808 nm...|$|R
60|$|We wasted {{a little}} time in vague discussion. Then I {{took one of the}} bars in both hands, and got my feet up against the rock until they were almost on a level with my head, and so thrust against the bar. It bent so {{suddenly}} that I almost slipped. I clambered about and bent the <b>adjacent</b> <b>bar</b> in the opposite direction, and then took the luminous fungus from my pocket and dropped it down the fissure.|$|E

5000|$|The okukoonera is {{what would}} be heard on these two plates if the amadinda was {{extended}} by additional octaves played by another pair of omunazi and omwawuzi. So, one could also think of the omukoonezi of [...] "simulating" [...] the actions of two additional musicians. When listening to the music, one can perceive the okukoonera as a separate pattern, but it might also combine with notes played on the <b>adjacent</b> <b>bars</b> to form other audible patterns.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} {{addition to the}} standard xylophone skill set is the McLellan Technique, developed at Indiana University in the early 21st century. This technique involves placing {{the head of a}} mallet in between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>bars,</b> and rapidly spinning the shaft of the mallet in between the index finger and thumb, thereby causing the head to rotate rapidly and scrape against both bars. This creates a cluster chord with ethereal timbre, and is most commonly used in percussion ensemble repertoire.|$|R

5000|$|Some top bar hives do stack vertically, {{much like}} the Langstroth, National, or other frame hives, {{although}} vertical designs use bars with gaps between them, unlike the <b>adjacent</b> <b>bars</b> of the horizontal design. Vertical top bar hives have been largely unknown in the United States until about 2010. This {{is largely due to}} the work by Dr David Heaf, who, along with wife Patricia, translated a book by Abbé Emile Warré (~1852) from French and implemented some hives in 2007. These are commonly referred to as Warré Hives, but the abbé named them, [...] "The People's Hive," [...] for their intended economy and simplicity of construction.|$|R

5000|$|The pub {{is known}} for its wall-to-wall Minton-Hollins tiles and its snob screens, which allowed middle class {{drinkers}} to see working class drinkers in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>bar,</b> but not to be seen by them. [...] The current public bar was originally divided into three. There are function rooms upstairs, originally for billiards and club use.|$|E
40|$|We derive the {{equivalent}} {{energy of a}} square lattice that either deforms into the threedimensional Euclidean space or remains planar. Interactions are not restricted to pairs of points and take into account changes of angles. Under some relationships between the local energies associated with the four vertices of an elementary square, we show that the limit energy {{can be obtained by}} mere quasiconvexification of the elementary cell energy and that the limit process does not involve any relaxation at the atomic scale. In this case, {{it can be said that}} the Cauchy-Born rule holds true. Our results apply to classical models of mechanical trusses that include torques between <b>adjacent</b> <b>bars</b> and to atomistic models...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of a new}} type of breakwater is explored through a combined program of theorteical analysis, lab-oratory experiments and a prototype field test. The breakwater consists of a series of low height, shore-parallel bars which are placed just outside the surf-zone. The incident wave field is strongly reflected when the incident wave length is equal to twice the dis-tance between <b>adjacent</b> <b>bars.</b> The breakwater acts to shelter the beach against storm wave attack and to build a tombolo sand deposit behind the breakwater. Theoreti-cal and laboratory studies indicated that the Bragg re-flection breakwater concept may have considerable merit, however, a small scale field test served to demonstrate the many practical difficulties in implementing the concept...|$|R
40|$|Interactions of wakes in a {{flow past}} {{a row of}} square bars, which is placed across a uniform flow, are {{investigated}} by numerical simulations and experiments on the tassumption that the flow is two-dimensional and incompressible. At small Reynolds numbers the flow is steady and symmetric with respect not only to streamwise lines {{through the center of}} each square bar but also to streamwise centerlines between <b>adjacent</b> square <b>bars.</b> However, the steady symmetric flow becomes unstable at larger Reynolds numbers and make a transition to a steady asymmetric flow with respect to the centerlines between <b>adjacent</b> square <b>bars</b> in some cases or to an oscillatory flow in other cases. It is found that vortices are shed synchronously from <b>adjacent</b> square <b>bars</b> in the same phase or in anti-phase depending upon the distance between the bars when the flow is oscillatory. The origin of the transition to the steady asymmetric flow is identified as a pitchfork bifurcation, while the oscillatory flows with synchronous shedding of vortices are clarified to originate from a Hopf bifurcation. The critical Reynolds numbers of the transitions are evaluated numerically and the bifurcation diagram of the flow is obtained...|$|R
50|$|A snob {{screen is}} a device {{found in some}} British public houses of the Victorian era. Usually {{installed}} in sets, they comprise an etched glass pane in a movable wooden frame and were intended to allow middle class drinkers to see working class drinkers in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>bar,</b> but {{not to be seen}} by them, and to be undisturbed by the bar staff.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the actual}} bond stress varies {{along the length}} of a bar {{anchored}} in a zone of tension, current international codes of specifications use the concept of development length rather than bond stress. The main requirement for safety against bond failure is to provide a sufficient extension of the length of the bar beyond the point where the steel is required to develop its yield stress and this length must be at least equal to its development length. However, if the actual available length is inadequate for full development, special anchorages must be provided, such as cogs or hooks or mechanical end plates. The same concept applies to lap splice length mentioned in the codes where splices (overlapping) provided between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>bars</b> {{in order to maintain the}} required continuity of stress in the splice zone.|$|R
50|$|The Smoking Room was the {{preferred}} spot of gamblers who crossed the Atlantic. Professional card sharps also travelled on board under aliases, and the purser {{could do nothing}} but warn passengers about these swindlers, since passengers played at their own risk. At least four professional players travelled on board the Titanic. Cigars and drinks could be made available upon request of the passengers, and were provided by the stewards of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>bar.</b> The bar stopped serving at 11:30 pm and the Smoking Room itself closed at midnight.|$|E

Woody's and Sailor are located at 465 - 467 Church St. Toronto, ON. Woody's hosts several [...] "best" [...] competitions, including [...] "best chest" [...] and [...] "best ass", on various nights. These competitions are judged on popularity, with the contestant receiving the most applause crowned the winner. The top positions receive cash prizes and passes to local gay establishments, including dance clubs and bathhouses.|$|E
50|$|Initially, a {{grandstand}} and bleachers {{were built}} on the site. When the Toronto Ferry Company acquired the Leafs, it moved the team from Sunlight Park {{near the mouth of}} the Don River on the mainland to the Hanlan's Point field on the islands. The Toronto Ferry Company built a new semi-circular grandstand, with the old grandstand converted to bleachers. The Maple Leafs played at the stadium until 1901, when they moved to Diamond Park on the mainland. The Hanlan's stadium and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>bar,</b> both managed by Lol Solman, were destroyed by a fire on September 10, 1903. The stadium was rebuilt.|$|E
