5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn born in <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> {{to a young}} doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E

25|$|Late one {{afternoon}} when returning from town we {{were met by}} a few {{women and children who}} told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> by the river.

25|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany {{attacked}} the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Cherokmanov led the 148th Rifle Division {{as part of}} the 21st Army at the end of June. On 1 July, the division was transferred to the 13th Army. The division fought in the Battle of Smolensk. In July, the division was fighting on the Oster near Shumyachi. The division suffered such heavy losses fighting German tanks that officers fought in the trenches. The division then retreated into the forest, where Cherokmanov attempted to capture a group of German soldiers. He was wounded but was able to crawl into <b>a</b> <b>thicket.</b> At night, he reached the Krasny Krym collective farm, where he was sheltered by an elderly farmer, Nikolai Filippovich Kozlov. For a month, Kozlov sheltered Cherokmanov. After recovering from his wounds in August, Cherokmanov crossed the front line.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his release}} from prison in December 1984, Chikatilo found new work at a {{locomotive}} factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985 when, {{on a business trip}} to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, at a railway platform near Domodedovo Airport. Pokhlistova was lured into <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> of woods where she was bound, stabbed 38 times, then strangled to death. Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the Rostov Oblast to Moscow via air, investigators checked all Aeroflot flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov Oblast between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, Chikatilo had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, Chikatilo killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Natalia Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.|$|E

25|$|While Khan {{was away}} from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his {{personal}} property. When Khan returned and confronted him, {{he said that he}} believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an elephant in the victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding his face with a scarf and a helmet. Amid the din of the victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory.|$|E
25|$|As {{the larger}} temple {{dedicated}} to the king, the hypostyle hall or pronaos is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars bear {{the face of the}} goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in this scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddess Hathor and Mut. The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> of papyri. On the west wall, RamessesII and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts — Satis, Anubis and Khnum.|$|E

500|$|The African crake {{is active}} during the day, {{especially}} at dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain.

A flushed crake will frequently land in a wet area or behind <b>a</b> <b>thicket,</b> and crouch on landing. In short grass, it can escape from a dog using its speed and manoeuvrability, running with the body held almost horizontal. It may roost in a depression near grass tussock and it will bathe in puddles.|$|E

500|$|In Egyptian accounts, the {{pregnant}} Isis hides from Set, {{to whom the}} unborn child is a threat, in <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> of papyrus in the Nile Delta. This place is called Akh-bity, meaning [...] "papyrus thicket of the king of Lower Egypt" [...] in Egyptian. Greek writers call this place Khemmis and indicate that it is {{near the city of}} Buto, but in the myth, the physical location is less important than its nature as an iconic place of seclusion and safety. The thicket's special status is indicated by its frequent depiction in Egyptian art; for most events in Egyptian mythology, the backdrop is minimally described or illustrated. In this thicket, Isis gives birth to Horus and raises him, and hence it is also called the [...] "nest of Horus". The image of Isis nursing her child is a very common motif in Egyptian art.|$|E
500|$|The average {{gestation}} period is around 110days, the female {{giving birth to}} a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be <b>a</b> <b>thicket,</b> a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away {{from the rest of}} the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept. The cubs themselves are born blind – their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh [...] at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.|$|E

Heather Cox Richardson praised the book in The Chicago Tribune, calling it [...] "one of those rare books that delivers a great deal more than it promises"; though critical of what she saw as some factual errors and [...] "unsubstantiated claims" [...] by Applegate, such as Lyman Beecher's role in creating mass media, Richardson concluded that these flaws [...] "do not cripple her story".|$|E

500|$|Mating {{can occur}} all year round, but {{is more common}} between November and April. A female is only {{receptive}} for three to six days. Mating is frequent and noisy during that time. Gestation can range from 93 to 112 days, the average being 105 days. The litter is usually two or three cubs, occasionally as few as one or as many as six. Cubs weigh from [...] each at birth, and are born blind and helpless. The females rear them alone, with the birth site and maternal den in a sheltered location such as <b>a</b> <b>thicket,</b> cave or rocky crevice. The father generally takes no part in rearing them. Unrelated wandering male tigers may kill cubs to make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within five months if the cubs of the previous litter are lost. The mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50% {{in the first two}} years. Few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence and ferocity of the mother tiger. Apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing, and accidents.|$|E
500|$|Beauregard, {{unaware that}} he was now outnumbered, planned to {{continue}} the attack and drive Grant into the river. To his surprise, Union forces started moving forward in a massive counterattack at dawn. Grant and Buell launched their attacks separately; coordination occurred only at the division level. Lew Wallace's division {{was the first to}} see action, about 5:30a.m., at the extreme right of the Union line. Wallace continued the advance, crossing Tilghman Branch around 7 a.m. and met little resistance. Changing direction and moving to the southwest, Wallace's men drove back the brigade of Col. Preston Pond. On Wallace's left were the survivors of Sherman's division, then McClernand's, and W. H. L. Wallace's (now under the command of Col. James M. Tuttle). Buell's army continued to the left with Bull Nelson's, Crittenden's, and McCook's divisions. The Confederate defenders were so badly commingled that little unit cohesion existed above the brigade level. It required more than two hours to locate Gen. Polk and bring up his division from its bivouac to the southwest. By 10 a.m., Beauregard had stabilized his front with his corps commanders from left to right: Bragg, Polk, Breckinridge, and Hardee. In <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> near the Hamburg-Purdy Road, the fighting was so intense that Sherman described in his report of the battle [...] "the severest musketry fire I ever heard." ...|$|E

An unknown American stepped forward from <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> and fired at a range of barely fifty yards. The musketball struck Brock {{in the chest and}} he fell. His last words have been reported as [...] "Push on, brave York Volunteers" [...] (in reference to a group of the militia Brock favoured) or [...] "Push on, don't mind me" [...] or Surgite! (Latin for [...] "rise" [...] or [...] "push on" [...] – now used as a motto by Brock University), and even [...] "a request that his fall might not be noticed or prevent the advance of his brave troops, adding a wish, which could not be distinctly understood, that some token of remembrance should be transmitted to his sister." [...] These accounts are considered unlikely, as it is also reported that Brock died almost immediately without speaking, and the hole in his uniform suggests that the bullet entered his heart.
