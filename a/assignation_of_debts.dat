The forward stepwise mode used only six parameters (K, Fe, HCO 3, NO 3, pH and F) giving 74 % correct assignation and the backward stepwise mode gave 72 % correct <b>assignation</b> <b>of</b> cases using only one parameter (pH). Thus temporal DA indicated that pH {{is the most important}} parameter, which discriminates between the water quality in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, followed by K, Fe, HCO 3, NO 3 and F.|$|R
