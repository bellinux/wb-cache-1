5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of human behavior as a result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil {{at the center of the}} narrative, <b>around</b> <b>which</b> all other elements revolve.|$|E

5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core <b>around</b> <b>which</b> DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E

5|$|Afrasia {{is known}} from four {{isolated}} teeth: a first upper molar (M1), with {{a length of}} 2.13mm and width of 3.06mm; a second upper molar (M2), the holotype, of 2.27mm by 3.35mm; a second lower molar (m2) of 2.09mm by 1.41mm; and a third lower molar (m3) of 2.05mm by 1.27mm. Like other eosimiiforms, {{it was a small}} primate that weighed <b>around</b> , <b>which</b> is estimated based on the measurements of its m2 and M1, respectively. It is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and Afrotarsius in particular; some distinguishing features are the well-developed small cusps (conules) on the upper molars, the variable development of the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) of the upper molars, and the unreduced talonid (posterior portion) on the m3. Its teeth are smaller than those of the eosimiids Phenacopithecus, Bahinia, and Phileosimias.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, {{an increase}} in wind shear caused the eye to disappear, and the convection decreased significantly. On December1, the IMD estimated Agni weakened to cyclonic storm status, <b>around</b> <b>which</b> time the center became exposed from the convection. The cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear, the presence of dry air, and cooler water temperatures, and by December2, the IMD downgraded Agni to depression status, which was its final warning on the system. As it approached the coast of Somalia, it turned westward due to {{the building of a}} ridge over Saudi Arabia. Despite unfavorable conditions, thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation, which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. By late on December3, Agni weakened to below tropical storm status, and the JTWC issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km (275mi) south-southeast of Cape Guardafui—the easternmost point of the Horn of Africa. The circulation became difficult to locate by early on December4, by which time the system had little remaining convection. It turned southwestward and later to the south, moving ashore on eastern Somalia before dissipating on December5 near Ceel Huur over water.|$|E
