It’s really beautiful, it’s why I love making movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Gradually the South Africans grew {{unwilling to}} help Rhodesia. The {{remaining}} 200 South African policemen transferred {{to help in}} the guerilla war were removed suddenly in August 1975, a move which appeared to precede even more disengagement. Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted that [...] "The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who invade our country with the willing help of other governments <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia. They are here to represent a force which sees Rhodesia as just one more stepping stone to victory over South Africa because they see South Africa as a vital key to the security of America, Europe {{and the rest of the}} western world." ...|$|E

A week prior {{to the end of}} OTAs Mike Tomlin said he was happy with the team's progress during the sessions. Also stating, “We are having a productive off-season {{and that is what we}} <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>for.</b> We are here to get better individually and collectively and I think we are doing that.” Limas Sweed experimented on special teams play for the first time ever, with a concentration in punt blocking. On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E

All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just. On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: [...] "Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we <b>are</b> <b>here,</b> <b>for</b> this life is not a place where justice resides." ...|$|E
