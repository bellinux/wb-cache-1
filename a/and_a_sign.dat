5|$|After {{operating}} {{for more}} than twenty years, and despite having advertised future events at the club, the business closed abruptly on February 20, 2014. Its website and social media pages were shut down immediately, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> was posted at the club noting that Concept Entertainment had decided to sell. The space that Gypsy had occupied was immediately available for long-term lease, with furniture included.|$|E
5|$|In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop; he was consecrated 24 April 767, {{the feast}} {{day of his}} {{predecessor}} Wilfrid. This may have been deliberate <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid's ambitions for the archiepiscopal see. Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773. Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop. Much of Alcuin's description of Æthelbert's time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric, as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops {{to use as a}} role model.|$|E
5|$|Marking the Apollo 11 Moon {{landings}} in 1969, Hergé {{produced an}} illustration in which NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong has just {{arrived on the}} moon, only to be greeted by Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus carrying roses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> welcoming him. That same year, the French magazine Paris Match commissioned him to produce a short comic documenting the Apollo 12 landings.|$|E

5|$|The {{service is}} also used {{as a form of}} civil disobedience: in 2010, users {{expressed}} outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, {{such as the}} shooting of ten well-known residents of Trøndelag and its environs in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E

5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E

25|$|Compared to the Avestan {{alphabet}} Old Persian notably lacks voiced fricatives, but {{includes the}} sign ç (of uncertain pronunciation) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> for the non-native l.

25|$|Specifically in {{relation}} to simultaneous orgasm and similar practices, many sexologists claim {{that the problem of}} premature ejaculation is closely related to the idea encouraged by a scientific approach in the early 20th century when mutual orgasm was overly emphasized as an objective <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of true sexual satisfaction in intimate relationships.|$|E
25|$|By September 12, {{local police}} had {{received}} so many false alarms (mostly from citizens believing that they smelled gas, {{or that they}} had seen a prowler) that they reduced the priority afforded to gasser reports and announced that the entire incident was likely the result of explainable occurrences exacerbated by public fears, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of the anxiety felt by women while local men were on war service.|$|E
25|$|Logarithmic number systems {{represent}} a real number by the logarithm of its absolute value <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> bit. The value distribution {{is similar to}} floating point, but the value-to-representation curve (i.e., the graph of the logarithm function) is smooth (except at 0). Conversely to floating-point arithmetic, in a logarithmic number system multiplication, division and exponentiation are simple to implement, but addition and subtraction are complex. The level index arithmetic of Clenshaw, Olver, and Turner is a scheme based on a generalized logarithm representation.|$|E

25|$|The {{cherries}} {{present on}} the tree outside the window may symbolize love. The oranges which lie on the window sill and chest may symbolize the purity and innocence that reigned in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of Man. They were uncommon <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of wealth in the Netherlands, but in Italy were a symbol of fecundity in marriage. The fruit could more simply {{be a sign of}} the couple's wealth since oranges were very expensive imports. It could be a sign of fertility as well.|$|E
25|$|In late 1909, Quebec {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) in 1909. The CHA, however, would only last one month before being absorbed into the much more powerful National Hockey Association (NHA). Rejected by the new league, the Bulldogs sat out the inaugural 1910 season. The following season, 1910–11, the Bulldogs took over the defunct Cobalt Silver Kings franchise, but had a rough initiation, finishing dead last with four wins and 12 losses in a 16-game season. On a positive note, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of things to come, Jack McDonald scored 14 goals and Tommy Dunderdale scored 13.|$|E
25|$|The news of {{the actions}} of the Balboa High School reached the {{students}} at the Instituto Nacional, Panama's top public high school. Led by 17-year-old Guillermo Guevara Paz, 150 to 200 demonstrating students from the institute, crossed the street into the Canal Zone and marched through the neighborhoods to Balboa High School, carrying their school's Panamanian flag <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> proclaiming their country's sovereignty over the U.S. Canal Zone. They had first informed their school principal and the Canal Zone authorities of their plans before setting out on their march. Their intention was to raise the Panamanian flag on the Balboa High School flagpole and remove the U.S. flag.|$|E

25|$|The 12th Street NW {{entrance}} {{would become}} the secondary entrance, providing public access to the restaurants and retail stores. Awnings would be over windows and the entrance on the ground floor, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> for the hotel added over the entrance. Outdoor seating would be added on the 12th Street NW, 11th Street NW, and Pennsylvania Avenue NW sides of the building. C Street NW would not be reopened to automobile traffic. The Trump Organization said it would remove the ahistoric glass and steel ground floor storefront on the C Street side and expand and renovate the public plaza there by adding outdoor seating and a performance space.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of gay {{spaces in the}} 1980s were curbed to some degree in the 1990s. Singapore's rapid economic growth had been attributed by its leaders to 'Asian values'. The promotion of these ideas by Singaporean leaders fostered a climate of social conservatism. Against this backdrop, gays were perceived {{as a threat to}} Asian values <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of the emergence of decadent Western liberalism and individualism. Complaints made by the public about public cruising led to police entrapment raids. Youthful and attractive undercover cops would pose as gay cruisers. The moment they were fondled by their targets, the latter would be arrested for outrage of modesty. Their names and occasionally mugshots were published in the press to humiliate them.|$|E
25|$|The Shenandoah Crash Sites {{are located}} in the hillsides of Noble County. Site No. 1, in Buffalo Township, {{surrounded}} the Gamary farmhouse, which lay beneath the initial break-up. An early fieldstone and a second, recent granite marker identify where Commander Lansdowne's body was found. Site No. 2 (where the stern came to rest) is a half-mile southwest of Site No. 1 across Interstate 77 in Noble Township. The rough outline of the stern is marked with a series of concrete blocks, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> marking the site is visible from the freeway. Site No. 3 is approximately six miles southwest in Sharon Township at the northern edge of State Route 78 {{on the part of the}} old Nichols farm where the nose of the Shenandoahs bow was secured to trees. Although the trees have been cut down, a semi-circular gravel drive surrounds their stumps and a small granite marker commemorates the crash. The Nichols house was later destroyed by fire.|$|E
