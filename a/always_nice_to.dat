500|$|Churchill's final {{departure}} from political office came some sixteen months later when, on 5 April 1955, he chaired his last cabinet, almost fifty {{years since he}} had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be Prime Minister, Churchill replied, [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be home". For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing bezique or sitting [...] "by the fish pond, feeding the golden orfe and meditating". Of his last years at the house, Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, recalled, [...] "in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'wheelbarrow' chair contemplating {{the view of the}} valley he had loved for so long". On 13 October 1964, Churchill's last dinner guests at Chartwell were his former principal private secretary Sir Leslie Rowan and his wife. Lady Rowan later recalled, [...] "It was sad to see such a great man become so frail". The following week, increasingly incapacitated, Churchill left the house for the last time. His official biographer Martin Gilbert records Churchill was, [...] "never to see his beloved Chartwell again". After his death in January 1965, Lady Churchill immediately relinquished her lease and presented Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to the public in 1966, one year after Churchill's death.|$|E
500|$|If the {{candidate}} was manic, {{he was also}} dedicated and filled with good humor, {{and he had a}} particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding [...] "Milk for Assembly" [...] signs while commuters drove {{into the heart of the}} city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, Jim Jones, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to The San Francisco Examiner, Jones and his parishioners were a [...] "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [...] [...] "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", The San Francisco Examiner, p.C.) [...] Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", Time, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President Jimmy Carter in 1978.

Jones' reputation" [...] with [...] "apparent bold-faced lies".) (Coleman, Loren (2004), The Copycat Effect, Simon & Schuster, p.68.). [...] However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, [...] "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." [...] But to his volunteers, he said: [...] "Make sure you're <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> the Peoples Temple.

60|$|Well, {{as it came}} to pass, he got {{the word}} or two, for Mrs. Assingham's preoccupation was {{practically}} simplifying. The little crisis was of shorter duration than our account of it; duration, naturally, would have forced him to take up his hat. He was somehow glad, on finding himself alone with Charlotte, {{that he had not}} been guilty of that inconsequence. Not to be flurried was the kind of consistency he wanted, just as consistency was the kind of dignity. And why couldn't he have dignity when he had so much of the good conscience, as it were, on which such advantages rested? He had done nothing he oughtn't--he had in fact done nothing at all. Once more, as a man conscious of having known many women, he could assist, as he would have called it, at the recurrent, the predestined phenomenon, the thing always as certain as sunrise or the coming round of Saints' days, the doing by the woman of the thing that gave her away. She did it, ever, inevitably, infallibly--she couldn't possibly not do it. It was her nature, it was her life, and the man could always expect it without lifting a finger. This was HIS, the man's, any man's, position and strength--that he had necessarily the advantage, that he only had to wait, with a decent patience, to be placed, in spite of himself, it might really be said, in the right. Just so the punctuality of performance {{on the part of the}} other creature was her weakness and her deep misfortune--not less, no doubt, than her beauty. It produced for the man that extraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relation with her, when he was not a mere brute, mainly consisted; and gave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> her, nice about her, nice FOR her. She always dressed her act up, of course, she muffled and disguised and arranged it, showing in fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but one thing in the world, equal to her abjection: she would let it be known for anything, for everything, but the truth of which it was made. That was what, precisely, Charlotte Stant would be doing now; that was the present motive and support, to a certainty, of each of her looks and motions. She was the twentieth woman, she was possessed by her doom, but her doom was also to arrange appearances, and what now concerned him was to learn how she proposed. He would help her, would arrange WITH her to any point in reason; the only thing was to know what appearance could best be produced and best be preserved. Produced and preserved on her part of course; since on his own there had been luckily no folly to cover up, nothing but a perfect accord between conduct and obligation.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{degree of}} (over) {{generalization}} (to the self, over situations) {{is an important}} characteristic of depression and anxiety disorders. Little is known about cognitive mechanisms underlying this (over) generalization. In this context, the present study examined the effect of an abstract processing style (compared to a more concrete processing style) on generalization of angry faces to the self. An abstract processing style refers to thoughts about the meaning, causes and consequences of events or situations (‘Why’-thinking). Methods: To test the impact of an abstract processing experimentally, images of angry faces were paired {{with the name of}} the participant and happy faces were paired with another person’s name while participants adopted either an abstract (‘Why’) or a concrete (‘How’) processing style. A surprise recognition task, where participants were asked to indicate whether they had seen the faces before, served as a test of generalization of angry faces to the self. Results: Results indicated that participants who adopted an abstract processing style showed more generalization of angry faces to the self and a trend towards more generalization of happy faces to the other person, relative to participants who adopted a concrete processing style. Limitations: Our sample was a non-clinical student sample and thus conclusions about the generalizability to clinical samples should be done with caution. Conclusions: These results suggest that abstract thought may underlie the generalization of bad/failure/angry feelings toward the self (‘Everyone is always angry with me’) and of good feelings towards other people (‘Everyone is <b>always</b> <b>nicer</b> <b>to</b> other people’) that is often seen in depression and social anxiety disorder. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} regret is {{designed}} for the long-term interaction of multiple agents. However, most concepts of regret do not consider even the short-term consequences of an agent’s actions: e. g., how other agents may be “nice” to you tomorrow if you are “nice” to them today. For instance, an agent that always defects while playing the Prisoner’s Dilemma will never have any swap or external regret. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of regret, called response regret, that allows one to consider both the immediate and short-term consequences of one’s actions. Thus, instead of measuring how an action affected the utility on the time step it was played, we also consider {{the consequences of the}} action on the next few time steps, subject to the dynamic nature of the other agent’s responses: e. g. if the other agent <b>always</b> is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> us after we are <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> it, then we should always be nice: however, if the other agent sometimes returns favors and sometimes doesn’t, we will not penalize our algorithm for not knowing when these times are. We develop algorithms for both external response regret and swap response regret, and show how if two agents minimize swap response regret, then they converge to the set of correlated equilibria in repeated bimatrix games...|$|R
