25|$|Aerosol {{particles}} in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence monsoon and global atmospheric circulation systems. Some aerosols <b>produce</b> <b>clouds</b> which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, <b>produce</b> thin <b>clouds</b> in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative radiative forcing (cooling influence). Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths. Aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries, {{but it is not}} yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified.|$|R

50|$|IEDs may use {{artillery}} shells or conventional high-explosive charges as their explosive load {{as well as}} homemade explosives.

50|$|Under {{convective}} instability thermal mixing through convection {{in the form}} of warm air rising leads to the development of clouds and possibly precipitation or convective storms. Dynamic instability is produced through the horizontal movement of air and the physical forces it is subjected to such as the Coriolis force and pressure gradient force.

40|$|Results of some cancer {{researches}} {{show that}} a number of hormones in ceratin tumors are growing up. Often, the majority of these hormones are produced by tumor cells or by an unknown origin in the neoplastic area. Also, it is clear that some of these ectopic hormones are produced only by specific tumors. In addition, different effects of these <b>abnormally</b> <b>produced</b> hormones on the immune system are shown in recent years. Thus, we decided to study the hormonal status of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The results of this study showed that the LH and FSH levels in the majority of patients are rising above normal while testosterone level in many of them is decreased. In the next step, we are going to study the immunological effects of LH, FSH, and testosterone one the lymphocyte function in vitro...|$|R

5000|$|Pyrocumulonimbus are {{cumuliform}} {{clouds that}} can form {{over a large}} fire and that are particularly dry. When the higher levels of the atmosphere are cooler, and the surface is thus warmed to extreme temperatures due to a wildfire, volcano, or other event, convection will occur, and <b>produce</b> <b>clouds</b> and lightning. They are similar to any cumulus cloud but ingest extra particulates from the fire. This increases the voltage difference between the base {{and the top of}} the <b>cloud,</b> helping to <b>produce</b> lightning.|$|R
