5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> rapidly ages into an 80-year-old man, Fringe {{division}} agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{and consultants}} Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) investigate. They tie {{the case to}} the murders of young women, who have all had their pituitary glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome.|$|E

Meanwhile, <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> {{to the wealthy}} Lee family is snatched by Max, the mother's ex-boyfriend, prompting the {{security guards}} give chase, ignoring the burglars, and corner Max on an escalator. Following a violent struggle, Max and the baby fall over the side—the baby is caught by Thongs, while Max plummets to his death. While the guards are distracted, Thongs and Octopus leave in the Landlord's minivan.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E

Reyes explains to Doggett that Van Allen is avenging his own murder and that all the murders that {{are linked to the}} case have been in groups of four. Reyes believes Van Allen takes his own life each time in order to restart the series of murders. Reyes frantically calls Holland, informing her that she is the fourth victim. Van Allen arrives at the church, but is stopped by Reyes. Later, Reyes muses to Scully that in the past, she had always failed to stop Van Allen's spirit. In this life, however, she managed to succeed. The shot changes to Van Allen dying, only to be reincarnated into <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> spends almost 9 hours a {{day just}} in REM sleep. By {{the age of five}} or so, only {{slightly}} over two hours is spent in REM. The function of REM sleep is uncertain but a lack of it impairs the ability to learn complex tasks. Functional paralysis from muscular atonia in REM may be necessary to protect organisms from self-damage through physically acting out scenes from the often-vivid dreams that occur during this stage.|$|E
25|$|Pyloric {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} a pylorus that is narrow. This is due to congenital hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter. The lumen of the pylorus is narrower, and less food is able to pass through. This problem is often detected in the early weeks of life. When it is present, <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> may projectile vomit after eating, but despite vomiting remain hungry. Pyloric stenosis may be managed by the insertion of a stent, or through surgical cutting of the pyloric sphincter, a pyloromyotomy.|$|E
50|$|Management {{consists}} of vigilant observation over days to detect progression. The subgaleal space {{is capable of}} holding up to 50% of <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby's</b> blood and can therefore result in acute shock and death. Fluid bolus may be required if blood loss is significant and patient becomes tachycardic. Transfusion and phototherapy may be necessary. Investigation for coagulopathy may be indicated.|$|R

40|$|The {{prenatal}} diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion is often really difficult and {{the diagnosis is}} usually retrospective. Herein, we report a case of <b>a</b> male <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> who presented at delivery with an enlarged, swollen and tender scrotum. US showed an enlarged right testis, with dishomogeneous texture, fluid collection between the testis and the tunica vaginalis and large hydrocele. Differential diagnosis included hydrocele complicated by infection or hemorrhage, testicular tumor or postnatal testicular torsion. Color and power Doppler did not reveal any flow signal, and the diagnosis of antenatal torsion with initial necrosis was made. The role of color Doppler US is emphasized in directing the patient to emergency, surgical exploration, when testicular salvage may be possible. Delayed surgical treatment can be proposed, when the diagnosis of antenatal torsion has {{a high degree of}} certainty. However, the Doppler examination of <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby's</b> testis is <b>a</b> very difficult challenge even for an experienced radiologist...|$|R
25|$|Within some Friends Churches in the Evangelical Friends Church, in {{particular}} in Rwanda, Burundi, {{and parts of the}} U.S., an adult believer's baptism by immersion in water, is optional. Within Liberal Friends, Conservative Friends, and Pastoral Friends Churches, Friends do not practise water baptism, Christening, or other initiation ceremonies to admit a new member or <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby.</b> Children are often welcomed into the meeting at their first attendance. Formerly, children born to Quaker parents automatically became members (sometimes called Birthright membership), but this is no longer the case in many areas. Some parents apply for membership on behalf of their children, while others allow the child to decide whether to become a member when they are ready, and older in age. Some meetings adopt a policy that children, some time after becoming young adults, must apply independently for membership.|$|E

When Dean and Sam attempt to save those people, they meet Deputy Jenna Nickerson, who's taking care of <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> girl whose father was infected and eventually died. The baby is taken to Jenna's grandmother's house, where the baby begins levitating toys. This prompts the old lady to call an exorcist, and Jenna to call Dean. When Dean arrives, he finds out the exorcist is Crowley, who found out the baby is The Darkness, and eventually flees taking her with him.

2500|$|Robert Guthrie {{is given}} {{much of the}} credit for {{pioneering}} the earliest screening for phenylketonuria in the late 1960s using blood samples obtained by pricking <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby's</b> heel {{on the second day of}} life on filter paper. Congenital hypothyroidism was the second disease widely added in the 1970s. Guthrie and colleagues also developed bacterial inhibition assays for the detection of maple syrup urine disease and classic galactosemia.

500|$|One {{evening in}} July 1986, Charlene {{came home with}} <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> and shocked her mother by {{claiming}} that he was her son. Charlene told Madge a story, so convincing that Madge believed {{she had become a}} grandmother. However, Charlene soon revealed that the baby was actually her half-brother Sam (Thomas Hamston; Scott Wealands). She explained to Madge that she had been helping to care for him, after his mother Susan (Gloria Ajenstat), turned to Charlene for help. Susan had had an affair with Charlene's father Fred, until he threw her out. Charlene knew Madge would not be happy looking after another woman's child, so she claimed he was her son. Soap Box author Hilary Kinglesy noted the situation helped expose Charlene's [...] "soft heart" [...] and her sensitive side.|$|E
500|$|Midge was re-introduced in 1988 {{as part of}} {{the play}} line, though two vintage {{reproduction}} dolls were made specifically for collectors in 1993 and 1998. The dolls sold in this time period usually had red hair, often with freckles, and her eye color was usually blue. Also in the period, Wedding Day Midge was sold, with the groom being Alan Sherwood, who had been marketed as Midge's boyfriend in the vintage years. Midge and Alan had three children introduced named Ryan, Nikki, and Cassandra. They also had twins who were never introduced. [...] This was known as the Happy Family line, and in the set, Midge was sold [...] "pregnant" [...] with Nikki as <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby.</b> The Happy Family product became the subject of controversy when some parents disliked the [...] "pregnant" [...] Midge toy because they believed that Midge was too young to have children.|$|E

40|$|Low birthweight (less than 2500 g) is {{the major}} factor {{associated}} {{with the death of}} infants within the first 4 weeks of life. The mean birthweight of <b>newborn</b> <b>babies</b> of <b>a</b> certain geographic area reflects the quality of maternal and child health care service as well as the degree of socioeconomic development of that particular region. Hence, birthweight is being used increasingly as an indicator for health and socioeconomic planning. However, in a developing country such as Thailand, two-fifths of the babies are delivered at home and are not weighed because scales are not available. To solve this problem in rural areas, a circular nomographic chart was developed with which the birthweight can be computed from <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby's</b> chest and mid-arm circumferences. Preliminary trials comparing these charts with standard baby scales showed a high degree of accuracy with sufficient sensitivity and specificity...|$|R

2500|$|In {{a tale of}} the Ungazighmiit, an {{old woman}} expresses her desire to become ill, die and then [...] "come" [...] as a boy, a hunter. After {{specific}} preparations following her death, <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> will be named after her. Similarly to several other Eskimo cultures, the name-giving of <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby</b> among Siberian Yupik meant that a deceased person was affected, a certain rebirth was believed. Even before {{the birth of the}} baby, careful investigations took place: dreams and events were analyzed. After the birth, the baby's physical traits were compared to those of the deceased person. The name was important: if the baby died, it was thought that he/she has not given the [...] "right" [...] name. In case of sickness, it was hoped that giving additional names could result in healing.|$|E

5000|$|Frequency is {{the number}} of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also {{referred}} to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. [...] For example, if <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>baby's</b> heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its period—the time interval between beats—is half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.|$|R
