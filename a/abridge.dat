5|$|Gyles v Wilcox (1740) 26 ER 489 was a {{decision}} of the Court of Chancery of England that established the doctrine of fair abridgement, which would later evolve into the concept of fair use. The case was heard and the opinion written by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, and concerned Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller who had published a copy of Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown. Soon after the initial publication, the publishers Wilcox and Nutt hired a writer named Barrow to <b>abridge</b> the book, and repackaged it as Modern Crown Law. Gyles sued for a stay on the book's publishing, claiming his rights under the Statute of Anne had been infringed.|$|E

Most of the <b>abridged</b> series that are created are based on anime and uploaded onto YouTube, which sometimes results in their takedown due to copyright infringement. The first <b>abridged</b> series, Yu-Gi-Oh! The <b>Abridged</b> Series, was created by Martin Billany (better known by his screen name LittleKuriboh) in 2006 and has since inspired multiple new ones.

25|$|With few {{commissions}} for painting, Hazlitt {{seized the}} opportunity to ready for publication his philosophical treatise, which, according to his son, he had completed by 1803. Godwin intervened to help him find a publisher, and the work, An Essay on the Principles of Human Action: Being an Argument in favour of the Natural Disinterestedness of the Human Mind, was printed in a limited edition of 250 copies by Joseph Johnson on 19 July 1805. This gained him little notice as an original thinker, and no money. Although the treatise he valued above anything else he wrote was never, at least in his own lifetime, recognised for what he believed was its true worth, it brought him attention as one who had a grasp of contemporary philosophy. He therefore was commissioned to <b>abridge</b> and write a preface to a now obscure work of mental philosophy, The Light of Nature Pursued by Abraham Tucker (originally published in seven volumes from 1765 to 1777), which appeared in 1807 and may have had some influence on his own later thinking.|$|E

25|$|President K. R. Narayanan's {{address to}} the nation on the golden jubilee of the Indian Republic (26 January 2000) is {{considered}} a landmark: {{it was the first time}} a President attempted to analyse, with due concern for growing disparities, the several ways in which the country had failed to provide economic justice to the Indian people, particularly the rural and agrarian population; he also stated that discontent was breeding and frustrations erupting in violence among the deprived sections of society. In his address to Parliament later that day, he praised the work of B. R. Ambedkar on the Indian constitution and cautioned against attempts to change its basic structure, concurring with Ambedkar's preference for accountability and responsibility over the stability of the government. He reiterated this in stronger terms in his next Republic day address (2001); on this occasion, he took exception to certain proposals seeking to <b>abridge</b> the franchise, and pointed out the wisdom of reposing faith in the common men and women of India as a whole, rather than in some elite section of society.|$|E

500|$|Black took an absolutist {{approach}} to First Amendment jurisprudence, believing {{the first words}} of the Amendment that said [...] "Congress shall make no law..." [...] Black rejected the creation of judicial tests for free speech standards, such as the tests for [...] "clear and present danger", [...] "bad tendency", [...] "gravity of the evil," [...] "reasonableness," [...] or [...] "balancing." [...] Black would write that the First Amendment is [...] "wholly 'beyond the reach' of federal power to <b>abridge...</b> I {{do not believe that}} any federal agencies, including Congress and the Court, have power or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are 'more important interests.'" ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} notable aspects of Justice Black's {{jurisprudence}} was {{the view that the}} entirety of the federal Bill of Rights was applicable to the states. Originally, the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government, as the Supreme Court ruled in Barron v. Baltimore (1833). According to Black, the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, [...] "incorporated" [...] the Bill of Rights, or made it binding upon the states as well. In particular, he pointed to the Privileges or Immunities Clause, [...] "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall <b>abridge</b> the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." [...] He proposed that the term [...] "privileges or immunities" [...] encompassed the rights mentioned in the first eight amendments to the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits {{states from}} {{enacting}} laws that <b>abridge</b> {{the freedom of}} speech.

Laws that regulate speech based on the expressive content of the speech are presumptively unconstitutional; such restrictions are only permissible when they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. For {{the purposes of the}} First Amendment, government regulation of speech is considered [...] "content-based" [...] when it targets speech because of ideas or messages that are expressed. Furthermore, some laws may still be considered [...] "content-based" [...] even though they appear to be facially content-neutral. Laws are considered [...] "content-based" [...] if they cannot be [...] "justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech" [...] or if they were adopted [...] "because of disagreement with the message [...] conveys".|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to validate two <b>abridged</b> versions of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) : one intended for use in face-to-face interviews, and the other developed for telephonic interviews, using data from Sweden and the US to validate the <b>abridged</b> scales against dementia diagnoses as well as to compare their performance to that of the full MMSE scale. The <b>abridged</b> versions were based on eight domains from the original MMSE scale. The domains included in the MMSE-SF were registration, orientation, delayed recall, attention, and visual spatial ability. In the MMSE-SF-C, the visual spatial ability item was excluded, and instead, one additional orientation item was added. There were 794 participants from the Swedish HARMONY study [mean age 81. 8 (4. 8); the proportion of cognitively impaired was 51 %] and 576 participants from the US ADAMS study [mean age 83. 2 (5. 7); the proportion of cognitively impaired was 65 %] where it was possible to compare <b>abridged</b> MMSE scales to dementia diagnoses and to the full MMSE scale. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity levels of the <b>abridged</b> tests, using clinical diagnoses as reference. Analyses with both the HARMONY and the ADAMS data indicated comparable levels of sensitivity and specificity in detecting cognitive impairment for the two <b>abridged</b> scales relative to the full MMSE. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the two <b>abridged</b> scales corresponded well to those of the full MMSE. The two <b>abridged</b> tests have adequate validity and correspond well with the full MMSE. The <b>abridged</b> versions could therefore be alternatives to consider in larger population studies where interview length is restricted, and the respondent burden is high...|$|R
