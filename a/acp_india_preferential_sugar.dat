40|$|In a {{press release}} on July 10 th 2003 the European Commission {{condemned}} the Brazilian, Australian and Thai challenge to the EU's 'C' sugar exports, claiming it was 'nothing less than {{an attack on the}} EU's trade preferences for developing countries'. The Commission argued that the challenge risks 'undermining the benefits of the EU regime for many sugar-dependent developing countries, especially ACP countries'. EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy maintained that the WTO action could 'destabilise the sugar-dependent economies of small ACP countries', whilst merely deflecting attention form the real causes of depressed world market prices, namely the rapid expansion of Brazilian and Australian sugar exports (from 1. 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes in the case of Brazil). Comment: While the Commission maintains that EU exports of sugar are largely the result of the preferential import of 1. 9 million tonnes of sugar, {{the reality is that the}} EU has been exporting around 5 million tonnes per annum in recent years, with the system of quota administration within the EU encouraging overproduction. The Commission implies that the EBA preferences extended to LDCs are allowing increased sugar exports from developing countries. However the EU maintains in place a maximum-supply-needs ceiling which limits the total amount of <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> imported into the EU. Increased LDC exports of sugar are thus at the expense of ACP beneficiaries of the special <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> arrangement. This will remain the case until the EU raises the maximum-supply-needs ceiling or LDCs are given full duty-free access in 2009. While the European Commission maintains that the WTO challenge is likely to destabilise ACP sugar-dependent economies, the eventual extension of CAP reform to the sugar sector, involving a shift from price support to direct aid to farmers, is likely to profoundly affect the value of sugar preferences extended to ACP sugar suppliers.

Moreover, in 2017 the European Sugar Regime will expire, ending the quota system and <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> prices, largely affecting small producers, particularly in Africa. Diversification emerges as an option for sugar-oriented mills. Two evident alternatives are ethanol and electricity production that allow better use of molasses and cane fibers, respectively. Molasses is the cheapest feedstock for ethanol production, while the cane fibers—in the form of bagasse—are readily available at the mill. The transition from sugar to sugar, ethanol and electricity may require substantial investment capital, yet our results show that significant progress can start at relatively small cost. In this work, we use simulations to explore the impact of ethanol and electricity production in an existing sugar mill in Mozambique. In spite of the large amounts of energy obtained from ambitious scenarios, such as Ethanol- 2 and Ethanol/EE, molasses-based ethanol (Ethanol- 1 scenario) seems more attractive in economical and infrastructural terms.

Three effects were noted when various sugars were added to MeSGal preloaded cells: (i) no decrease in intracellular MeSGalP concentration after addition of fructose, sucrose, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, glycerol, 6 -deoxyglucose, alpha-methyl D-glucoside, 2 -deoxygalactose, glucose 1 -phosphate, or glucose 6 -phosphate; (ii) slow loss of preaccumulated MeSGalP evoked by lactose, 2 -deoxy-D-glucose, or unlabeled MeSGal; and (iii) a short lag followed by extremely rapid expulsion of intracellular MeSGalP elicited by glucose or mannose and a slower expulsion elicited by glucosamine. The expelled compound was free MeSGal, indicating the involvement of dephosphorylation in the expulsion mechanism. Deoxyglucose inhibited the expulsion evoked by mannose, and prepoisoning of cells with fluoride or arsenate prevented the glucose-dependent expulsion. The expulsion is due to activation of an expulsion mechanism rather than to turnover of MeSGalP and leak of internal MeSGal with concomitant inhibition of MeSGal influx.

40|$|Genomic {{analysis}} and physiological experiments {{conducted on the}} lignocellulosic biomass degrading bacterium C. phytofermentans, indicates that it can degrade and utilize a wide-range of carbohydrates as possible growth substrates. Previous experiments characterized gene expression using custom whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays. The results indicated that C. phytofermentans utilizes ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for carbohydrate uptake and does not use the sole phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (PTS) {{for any of the}} tested substrates. Distinct sets of Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) genes were also up-regulated on specific substrates indicative of C. phytofermentans ability to selectively degrade lignocellulosic biomass. We also identified a highly expressed cluster of genes which includes seven extracellular glycoside hydrolases and two ABC transporters with unknown specificity on a number of substrates. These results lead to the hypothesis that when grown on plant biomass, C. phytofermentansis capable of degrading and transporting all major carbohydrate components of lignocellulose biomass. To test this, C. phytofermentans was grown on three different lignocellulosic biomass substrates (Brachypodium distachyon, cornstover, and switchgrass). Gene expression and HPLC analysis indicated that C. phytofermentans is utilizing multiple substrates with multiple sugar ABC transporter clusters, glycoside hydrolases, and sugar utilization pathways being expressed. To further test this,the sugar utilization pattern for C. phytofermentans was investigated. Growth studies were performed on individual saccaharides (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, and fucose) as well as combinations of all these sugars. From these studies we determined that C. phytofermentans does not show a characteristic diauxic shift indicative of <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> utilization or carbon catabolite repression (CCR). This result was supported further by HPLC analysis indicating that co-utilization of sugars was occurring, however their were differences in the rates of consumption.

40|$|The ongoing trade negotiations, {{unilateral}} trade {{concessions and}} {{obligations under the}} WTO are pushing the EU sugar regime to undertake reforms. These reforms will alter the positions of developing countries in the global sugar markets. This paper will describe the trade preferences granted to developing countries under the EU sugar regime. Sugar imports into the EU from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) {{are expected to be}} totally liberalised from year 2009 onwards because of the ?Everything But Arms? (EBA) concession. During the transition period until year 2009, the EBA concession is gradually granting quota preferences and partial duty-free access to sugar imports from the LDCs. Simultaneously, the temporary import quotas (Special <b>Preferential</b> <b>Sugar)</b> given to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are assumed to be decreasing during the transition period. Within this background, a complete unilateral liberalisation of the EU sugar sector is simulated to depict the winners and losers in the global sugar markets if no preferences are governing the imports of sugar into the EU. The supply responses, which strongly affect the outcomes, are dependent on both the nature of substitution for sugar {{as well as on the}} efficiency of sugar production in different countries. The multi-region general equilibrium framework (GTAP) is used for this analysis. The results show that small concessions will not threaten the EU internal market, but total liberalisation of sugar imports from the LDCs will be a major threat to the EU sugar regime. The current regime limits sugar imports from all developing countries or some efficient producers, if the cost data is a right estimate of the potential supply response from developing countries. The LDCs will be the winners under the EBA concession supported by the current regime, but a few efficient sugar producers will be the winners if the current regime is entirely liberalised.

40|$|Carbon catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) {{is a well-known}} phenomenon that involves the preferential utilization of glucose as a carbon source. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the CAMP receptor protein (CRP) mediate CCR.

In this study, we report yet another CCR hierarchy that causes the <b>preferential</b> utilization of <b>sugars</b> (arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose) over a short-chain fatty acid (propionate). Expression of the propionate catabolic (prpBCDE) genes is down-regulated in the presence of these sugars. Sugar-mediated repression of the propionate catabolic genes is independent of sugar-specific regulators such as AraC and dependent on global regulators of sugar transport such as the cAMP-CRP complex and the Phosphotransferase System (PTS). Inhibition of the prpBCDE promoter is encountered during rapid sugar uptake and metabolism.

Using the disaggregated 5 digit SITC (Rev 3) level data, the estimates of intra-industry trade and export revealed comparative advantage in Parts and Components (P&C) in India's manufacturing sector are analysed separately from that of total trade flows over the period from 1994 and 2008. This provides useful insights into the nature and magnitude of production fragmentation involving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The analysis demonstrates that India has reoriented its growth strategy, towards an outward orientation, during the past two decades, but the pace of its reform has not caught up with this paradigm shift. As a result, the level of participation by Indian industries in global and in Asian IPNs is low. Most of India's exports comprise lowtechnology, labour-intensive goods that do not involve much fragmentation, such as textiles, gems and jewellery and animal and leather products.

The inhibition of photosynthesis became greater as irradiance increased across the range experienced in growth conditions (170 to 700 �mol m � 2 sec � 1). TK almost completely limited the maximum rate of photosynthesis in saturating light and saturating CO 2.

The key variables that have been of interest in quantitative exercise include, trade creation, trade diversion, and net trade effects; overall welfare effects; and the potential implications for tariff revenues. Quantitative assessments in the paper have been undertaken by exploiting a partial equilibrium model and an associated database that provides information on India’s bilateral trade flows at a highly disaggregated level and protective structures as reflected in its tariff schedule. The results suggest that in each case overall trade effects for India have been positive, i. e. in every case trade creation outweighs trade diversion.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{patterns of}} bilateral trade between Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and CARs. It also investigates whether providing India transit route to Afghanistan has opportunity costs for Pakistan’s trade potential with Afghanistan and CARs. In 2009, Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan amount to US$ 1. 3 billion {{which make up}} for 7. 8 % of Pakistan’s total exports. For the same year, India’s exports to Afghanistan stand at 471 million dollars which make 0. 3 % of India’s total exports. Looking at the product wise composition of Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, mineral fuels, oils, distillation products are on the top with share of around 29 %. Salt, sulpher, earth, plaster, lime and cement and cereals have a share of around 11 %. While animal, vegetable fats and oils, cleavage products and articles of iron and steel have the share of around 7 %. On the other hand, the top five exports of India to Afghanistan are man-made filaments with 42 % share, pharmaceutical products with 11 % share, electric and electronic equipment with 7 % share and rubber and articles with 6 % share. Clearly there is no overlap between exports of Pakistan and India to Afghanistan. Nonetheless Pakistan has already lost its market share to India in pharmaceuticals. The tariff applied to Pakistan by Afghanistan on pharmaceuticals is 2. 50 % while <b>India</b> which enjoys <b>Preferential</b> Trade Agreement with Afghanistan only faces an average tariff of 0. 60 % on pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals are Pakistan’s top performing exports to CARs with 42. 5 % share of total exports to CARs. India also exports pharmaceuticals to CARs but its share in total exports to CARs is only 25. 5 %. In Afghanistan, Pakistan has clearly lost its market share to India due to presence of <b>preferential</b> tariffs for <b>India</b> in Afghanistan. If Pakistan provides transit route to India for its exports to Afghanistan, cheaper pharmaceuticals of Indian origin can then be re-exported to CARs capturing Pakistan’s market share in CARs. Much like pharmaceuticals there are other Pakistani products which are likely to lose out to India in Afghanistan and CARs if India is provided transit route to Afghanistan. The Wagah-Peshawar-Torkham route which roughly extends up to 800 km is probably the shortest possible one between India and Afghanistan; which would greatly reduce the logistics cost of shipping goods from India to Afghanistan and beyond. In addition to that, the preferential treatment currently enjoyed by Indian products in Afghanistan under the PTA would further cost Pakistani goods by eroding their competitiveness in the Afghan market. In {{the absence of a}} robust mechanism to contain the informal trade, allowing Indian goods a passage through Pakistan’s territory would, in all likelihood, worsen the smuggling situation, something Pakistan can ill afford to accept. Therefore, under the circumstances, there are clear economic disadvantages to Pakistan in extending the transit facility to India without adequate safeguards and preferably a quid pro quo, be it political or economic. ...|$|R
