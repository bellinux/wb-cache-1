500|$|Daily was {{successful}} {{as a starting}} pitcher early in his major league career. [...] In 1883 and 1884, he won 20 or more games each season, while finishing in the top ten among league leaders in major pitching categories such as earned run average (as calculated retroactively, since E.R.A. was not an official statistic at the time), innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts. [...] Daily established the pitching record for strikeouts in a season (later surpassed), tied a record by tossing two consecutive one-hitters, broke the record for one-hitters in a season, and threw a no-hitter. [...] After his initial three years of success, the final three years of his career were marked by quick decline in his seasonal numbers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> from organised baseball shortly thereafter. [...] Today he remains a mysterious figure, as there is little record of his activities after his career. [...] It is unclear where he lived and where he died.|$|E

Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose came up to him and told him [...] "Hey, enjoy your last show".
