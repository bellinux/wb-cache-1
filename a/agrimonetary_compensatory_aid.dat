40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find out if {{technology}} within pedagogy can help pupils with dyslexiaperform on the same level as their peers without using <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid.</b> Is it possible to replacethe <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> with the technology in question? Can the same technology also be used tosupport other pupils as well and in turn removing the stigma of needing <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid?</b> To learn the answers to these questions I have done a qualitative text analysis. This analysis focuson technology in the form of podcasts and Web 2. 0 based teaching platforms. The analysis alsofocus on pupils with dyslexia and what kind of help <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> can be. The texts will beanalyzed based on the concept of equivalence and Habermas's theory of technology as ideology. The conclusions I have reached is that it is not possible to help all pupils with dyslexia with theseforms of technology. Not in such a manner that the <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid</b> in question can be replaced. This is due to the fact that not every pupil with dyslexia need the same support.

The aim of the work has been to find out if disabled people, the subsidy applicants, are satisfied with the amount of the subsidies and if the new aid helps them eliminate, alleviate or even overcome their handicap. The theoretical part is concerned with the subsidy scheme and the legal regulations which form the framework for granting subsidies provided by social department officers. This part also explains what the expressions "compensatory aids" and disabled person" mean. The practical part contains a questionnaire survey which was conducted with chosen disabled people on the subsidy for <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> granted by the City Council in České Budějovice. in 2007 and 2008.

Theoretical part is mainly focused on results of stroke that patients have to live with. It represents what occupational therapy is about and its irreplaceable role {{in the process of}} the patient's return to active life. It shows wide range of rehabilitation process and patient's difficulties with availability of complete materials with its issue. There are materials describing etiology, causes and results of stroke on the market, but not so many publications describing procedure {{how to deal with it}} and how to reach the highest level of patient's independence in normal life when it once happened.

40|$|This First Degree (Bachelor) Thesis {{deals with}} the course in Operation of {{electronic}} <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids.</b> The course was attended by two clients with severe visual impairment for whom methodological guidelines {{in the form of}} codes of practice were created. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. Further, the theoretical part is divided into six chapters the first of which is focused on visual impairment. The second chapter {{deals with the}} development of individuals suffering from visual impairment. The next chapter seeks to define the education of persons suffering from visual impairment and the related specialized pedagogical counselling. The fourth chapter bears on specialized pedagogical counselling for persons suffering from visual impairment. The fifth chapter applies to social rehabilitation and brings a presentation of consultancy facilities dealing with social rehabilitation as well. The last chapter describes <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> for persons suffering from visual impairment. The goal of this thesis is to optimize a part of the existing course in Operation of electronic <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> by adapting the codes of practice for the use by clients suffering from visual impairment. A partial aim consists in gaining knowledge about the course in Operation of electronic <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> through a debate with the instructor of course and, based on the instructor?s recommendation, to specify a theme that will be worked out in the codes of practice subsequently. Another aim of the thesis consists also in creating a guidance document that will contribute to a higher level of the course in Operation of electronic <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> and in subsequent verification thereof in practice. In accordance with the objectives set relevant research questions have been defined. For the achievement of the objectives set qualitative research was assigned and the following methods were used for the data collection. The first method applied is structured interview. The interview was conducted with the instructor of the course in Operation of electronic <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids.</b> Based on the interview outcomes, the theme was designed that was developed into four codes of practice later on. The second method adopted in the research survey was observation through participation. There were defined observation categories corresponding to the partial aims of the thesis which were entered into the record sheet covering the observations to be realized. The last method employed was the method of secondary analysis of the clients? personal documentation. The research itself was carried out {{in the course of the}} period from February to mid- April in the premises of Tyflokabinet České Budějovice, o. p. s., the institution that is realizing the course in Operation of electronic <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids.</b> The group subject to research consisted of a sightless pupil and a partially sighted pupil. The result of my work represents an original methodological document. Thanks to the evaluation of the subject matter presented at the end of each lesson, it was found that the codes of practice were, on the other hand, beneficial to the course in Operation of electronic <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> and, on the other hand, contributed to the understanding of the subject matter treated. Based on observations, I found that the teaching lesson of the course is influenced by the time of one hour allotted to the course and by the attention of attending clients, too. Based on the observations realized we can say that various games and activities can be made up that are intended for the practicing of the subjects discussed, however, the time allotted to the course teaching, viz. 60 minutes, must be taken into consideration. It has been proven that the 60 minutes were often not sufficient for discussing all the subjects prepared, still the time of 60 minutes is too long for maintaining the attention of the clients...|$|R
40|$|Loss {{of vision}} or a severe sight injury means a very {{significant}} change {{in the life of the}} affected person. <b>Compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> play in important part in incorporating thus handicapped people into all varieties of social life. Nowadays people with serious sight handicap can choose from many <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids,</b> optical and non-optical ones. A guiding dog is one of many possible compensations of visual defect or seriously injured eyesight. For a guiding dog to become an approved <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid</b> according to Act n. 100 / 1998 Sb. further specified by regulation 182 / 1991 Sb. two basic conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the dog must pass a special training with a final test and secondly the applicant must be eligible to using a dog as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid.</b> The paper aims at providing an illustrative outline of the most typical situations concerning owners of guiding dogs in South Bohemia. During the research the author encountered many difficulties. One of which was the lack of unity of provided services by individual organizations dealing with training of guiding dogs. The greatest differences occurred in the service when handing over the dog (the extant and details concerning documentation of the dog, the health card, the extant of information for the future owner) and in the following service when a problem arises. To fulfill the aim of the present paper a Form for semidirected interview was created, which contains 4 fields (identification data, acquisition, possession and the use of the guiding dog). The semi directed interviews were aimed at the owners of the guiding dogs. There are 27 guiding dogs in South Bohemia. The greatest number of guiding dogs is in the district of Jindřichův Hradec. The author presumes that this paper will help potential clients to orientate themselves in claiming a compensatory aid-the guiding dog.

This means that even if a pupil has reading and writing disabilities the education {{should be in the}} classroom {{with the rest of the}} pupils. The education should include every one. The aim of my study was to investigate the education with pupils that have reading and writing disabilities. I wanted to get a deeper knowledge about working methods that are used for pupils with these problems. In my study I have used qualitative research methods. I have used group interviews and observational studies. In addition to this I have also used informal interviews during the observational studies. One class teacher and one special teacher was interviewed and observed in the study. My results showed that pupils with reading and writing disabilities often were excluded from the classroom during a few lessons per week. The results also showed that the working methods that the class teacher and the special teacher use are different. The class teacher worked with the same working methods for all the children in the class while the special teacher was using the computer as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid.</b> For pupils with reading and writing disabilities the work with a computer as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid</b> is a motivating working method.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the regard paid {{to the use of}} Assistive Technology (AT) when {{assessing}} the knowledge of Year 9 pupils with dyslexia in the subject Swedish. A starting point was to examine the knowledge of a group of teachers in the areas of dyslexia and AT. The issues then developed as to which AT a dyslexic pupil is allowed to use in an assessment situation and how the use of these tools affects the assessment. There was an examination of the guidelines that the teacher group can use as support when assessing the knowledge of dyslexic pupils on the basis of AT. The method used was qualitative semi-structured interviews. The group examined was made up of four subject teachers in Swedish. The results showed that the teacher group had limited knowledge of both dyslexia and AT. It also emerged that computers were {{the most common form of}} <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid</b> in assessment situations. The use of AT did not affect the assessments. The curriculum contained no guidelines for assessing knowledge on the basis of AT and left a lot of room for interpretation by individual teachers. The conclusions drawn were that there is a need for teacher training to include courses on dyslexia and the areas of application of AT. Greater knowledge would better ensure that the correct <b>compensatory</b> <b>aid</b> is chosen for each pupil in each assessment situation. Clear guidelines are also needed so that assessments can be regarded as fair and of equivalent value...|$|R

40|$|English {{is taught}} as a {{compulsory}} second language in Swedish schools {{and is one}} of three core subjects needed to be passed in order to receive a leaving certificate. Statistics show that 6. 9 % of the students do not aquire proficiency enough to receive a G (pass) in English in grade nine. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate to what extent weak language learners are considered in the English classroom and if <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> are used to further support their learning conditions. The method used for the study is qualitative interviews which were semi-structured. Four interviews with English teachers were conducted within the same municipality. The result shows that there are aspects that can be considered in order to provide better opportunities for weak language learners within the English classroom as well as outside the English classroom. Some teachers find it difficult to separate lack of motivation from lack of knowledge which makes discovering the students as early as possible important. In the English classroom weak language learners can be supported by smaller discussion groups since one problem seems to be oral skills. A connection to Swedish can be observed and students with difficulties in reading and writing in their native language experience more problems when learning English. The interviewees state the importance of first focusing on oral skills in the target language, before introducing written skills. Regarding support outside the English classroom the investigation shows that optional English, parents and homework are important features. In the optional English class weaker language learners get an opportunity to speak and revise previous blanks of knowledge. Parents are important for showing their children that they find English important but also for supporting the children while doing homework. Concerning <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids,</b> most teachers did not use them nor had they knowledge enough about available aids. The most frequently used aid was a CD where texts are recorded...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} {{the role of the}} nurse {{in the development of the}} self-sufficiency of the geriatric patient in the health care facility and in the residential social facilities. In connection with this objective, the main hypothesis has been established: Nurses working in a health care facility perceive the importance of developing self-sufficiency differently than nurses working in social care facilities. The empirical part of the thesis was elaborated using a quantitative research survey, which was carried out using a questionnaire of author´s own design. The questionnaire included questions about nursing perceptions and attitudes to maintain and develop the self-sufficiency of a patient/senior-age client in a hospital and social care facility. The first part was focused on basic identification data, the second part dealt with how sisters perceive the maintenance and development of seniors' self-sufficiency. The next part was to find out how nurses are self-serving in a self-sufficient patient. Further, the questionnaire examined the nurses' efforts to use <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> and their opinion of working with other specialists. The obtained results were processed in MS Excel using graphs and statistical testing. The research group consisted of nurses working in hospital facilities and social care facilities in the South Bohemian Region. The results of the thesis are divided into 5 areas, where the view and attitude of nurses working in individual facilities for the development of self-sufficiency of the patient / client of the senior age is compared. Further, they describe the opinions of the sisters on: the perception of the importance of the development of seniors' self-sufficiency, the influence of self-sufficiency on the quality of the senior´s life, the performance of self-care for the seniors and the use of <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> in maintaining and developing their self-sufficiency. The work provides a general view of the patient/seniors in the field of maintaining and developing self-sufficiency. The results can be used by nurses in practice as well as students of non-medical health care disciplines. It also provides evidence of the importance of maintaining and developing self-sufficiency in providing comprehensive care and improving the quality of life of seniors.

" The theoretical part {{is divided into}} 5 main chapters. The first chapter defines basic terms: spinal muscular atrophy, classification, diagnosis and basic care of people suffering from spinal muscular atrophy. The second part deals with possible therapies. Particularly about rehabilitation and spa treatment, conservative and operative therapy, alternative treatment and medication, <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids,</b> mainly wheel chairs. This chapter also mentions respiratory, orthotic and physiotherapeutic care. Regarding physiotherapeutic care there are descriptions of: using a ball for massage, ergotherapy, basal stimulation, hydrotherapy and pool, hypotherapy. In the conclusion of this chapter there is {{a description of the}} project REaDY (REgistry of muscular DYstrophy). The third chapter is named "The family of a child suffering from spinal muscular atrophy. " It seemed important to mention stages of grief parents are going through after their handicapped child was born. The stages were described by a famous Swiss thanatology expert Elizabeth Kübler-Ross. There are recommendations for parents and people taking care of handicapped child {{at the end of the}} third chapter. The fourth chapter addresses the upbringing and education of children with spinal muscular atrophy. The intellect of these children is not affected so they can be integrated into nursery, primary and secondary schools attended by unhandicapped children. The last chapter deals with nongovernmental organisations having great social benefit for handicapped people. The practical part of this work has two main goals: to find out what services are offered by nongovernmental organisations to the families of children with spinal muscular atrophy and how are these families satisfied with offered services. The qualitative type of research was used for achieving these goals: the technique of semi-structured interviews. The target set of the research part consisted of workers of nongovernmental organisations specialised in spinal muscular atrophy and the parents of children suffering from it. The interviews were focused on gaining the list of services provided by nongovernmental organisations regarding the caring families. Seven families were asked for participation in this research. Five families agreed to be involved in the interview. The list of provided services makes another part of the research. Therefore a social worker from Arpida (rehabilitation centre for handicapped people) and a special consultant from Kolping Family Smečno were addressed. It was found out that organisations mentioned above provide short-term stays, rehabilitations, ergotherapy, swimming pool, hypotherapy, <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> and consulting. Parents are particularly interested in short-term stays, they can have a rest and an assistant takes care of their child. This service is of utmost importance for parents. It brings both a physical and a psychological relief. Intellect is not affected in children and it is not easy to invent new activities. At the same time the contact with another person is invaluable. There is also a great demand for rehabilitation, which is beneficial and unsubstitutable. Parents say that consulting is also important. The consulting is usually needed for purchases of <b>compensatory</b> <b>aids</b> or integration of children into schools. Almost all parents agreed to be fully satisfied with provided services. One of the respondents would be more satisfied if the short-term stays took place more frequently, not only during the summer. Concerning financial issue the basic income comes from social services The results of this work can be used to get an overview of services provided by nongovernmental organisations and to find out how satisfied those users of the services are...|$|R
