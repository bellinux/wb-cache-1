Hillenburg and Duffy met with various cartoonists—including James Kochalka, Hilary Barta, Graham Annable, Gregg Schigiel, and Jacob Chabot—to contribute to each issues. Retired horror comics writer and artist Stephen R. Bissette returned to write a special Halloween issue in 2012, with Tony Millionaire and Al Jaffee. In an interview with Tom Spurgeon, Bissette said, [...] "I've even broken my retirement to do one work-for-hire gig [...] so I could share everything <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of current job".|$|E
500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; I was doing it mainly for the characters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor, poor, little girl! She don't cry often, Mistress Blythe--she's too brave for that. She {{must feel}} terrible {{when she does}} cry. A night like this is hard on poor women who have sorrows. There's {{something}} <b>about</b> it <b>that</b> <b>kinder</b> brings up all we've suffered--or feared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh; d----n it; I don't {{understand}} that. I'm never dark <b>about</b> {{anything of}} <b>that</b> <b>kind.</b> I'll go bail it's {{more than five}} times what I do." ...|$|R
5000|$|The next album, Modern Romans, was {{notable for}} its {{political}} content. Been later stated, [...] "There {{was a great}} deal happening politically - Grenada, Lebanon, or the government saying the Russians are evil and the Russian government probably saying the same <b>about</b> us. <b>That</b> <b>kind</b> of thinking inspired me to write the last lines of 'Walls Came Down'." ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne {{was rather}} alarmed by this appeal; but Elizabeth {{answered}} carelessly, without looking up, 'Oh! you know I know nothing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of work.' ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{official}} {{video for}} [...] "Invisible" [...] was released to YouTube on September 8, 2011. The video depicts Grey in various scenes ranging from {{on top of}} a skyscraper to {{in the middle of a}} busy street. The video has reached over three million views currently while only being accessible for one week. When asked about the video, Grey replied by saying “I wanted it to be Peter Parker by day meets Spiderman by night. An everyday kid, who isn’t really that cool but there’s something else going on, that people don’t know <b>about,</b> <b>That’s</b> <b>kind</b> of the journey that I went on. I discovered that my insecurities and my flaws were things that I actually need to embrace, and I let them become my superpowers.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure they}} wouldn't say {{so if they}} weren't. There's quite a new plan, and it sounds most sensible. And so I don't think, darling, that if I were you I should make myself unhappy <b>about</b> all <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing. They must know best. They're all so much older than you. And you're getting quite a little line between your eyes." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “In {{the past}} {{people might have}} raised {{concerns}} <b>about</b> storing <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of information [keystrokes and voice] on a mobile device, but...if it’s already on there, why not use it to provide additional security? It’s practically already recording your voice, and it’s already recording what you’re typing and things like that, so, I’m not sure the objection of storing that information on a mobile device is valid.” [...]...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{just the}} same. Nobody thinks {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing. Now, {{what is it}} I have got to do? We had better turn back again {{as soon as we}} can, because I must go up to the house before I go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} must be told; but not now. He is nearly broken-hearted about dear mamma. He could {{not bring himself to}} care <b>about</b> {{anything}} of <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> at present. And then it is Mr. Tregear that should speak to him first." ...|$|R
50|$|Aaron has {{mentioned}} {{that a lot}} of times, the songs he writes he doesn't necessarily know what they are <b>about</b> but <b>that</b> they <b>kind</b> of take {{a life of their own}} later and reveal themselves to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed!" [...] exclaimed Willy, {{her mind}} involuntarily running towards Nancy Shott, to whom a voyage to the West Indies would doubtless {{be of great}} service. [...] "Don't let's bother <b>about</b> {{anything}} of <b>that</b> <b>kind!</b> Let's make the first trip by ourselves! I {{think that will be}} glorious!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's one Johnson, a Dictionary-maker, {{about whom}} my Lord Chesterfield wrote some most capital papers, when his dixonary was coming out, to patronise the fellow. I {{know they were}} capital. I've heard Horry Walpole say so, and he knows all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing. Confound the impudent schoolmaster!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce laughed. [...] "Yes, I've read Doctor Boyden's books. What does he {{know about}} it? Did he ever study a {{wonderful}} psychic like your mother? Has he candidly examined these phenomena? Never in his life! I know all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of investigator. He is basing his conclusions on somebody's else's conjectures or prejudices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is nonsense, of course. I am {{determined}} to have no girl who has not a title. It isn't that I care <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing in the least, but the Duke does. And then I think the list will sound more distinguished in the newspapers, if all the Christian names are given with the Lady before them. There are to be his three sisters, Lady Anne, Lady Antoinette, and Lady Anatolia;--then my two sisters, Lady Alphonsa and Lady Amelia. To be sure they are very young." ...|$|E
2500|$|One-time friend Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins wrote {{lyrics to}} the Massive Attack song [...] "Teardrop", {{thinking}} of Buckley's death, stating: [...] "That was so weird ... I'd got letters out and I was thinking <b>about</b> him. <b>That</b> song's <b>kind</b> of <b>about</b> him – <b>that's</b> {{how it feels}} to me anyway." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fraser {{wrote the}} song's lyrics. While {{recording}} the song on 29 May 1997, {{she found out}} that her once-close friend, Jeff Buckley, had drowned. [...] "That was so weird ... I'd got letters out and I was thinking <b>about</b> him. <b>That</b> song's <b>kind</b> of <b>about</b> him - <b>that's</b> {{how it feels to}} me anyway." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Smile Sessions: Archival {{recordings}} of the Beach Boys unfinished album Smile took nearly 45 years to compile for a dedicated release. Numerous complications contributed to its excessively protracted delay, including bandleader Brian Wilson's irrational fear of the album. Brother and bandmate Carl Wilson compared the album's structuring to editing a film, as compiler Alan Boyd explains, [...] "I think he was right <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> The <b>kind</b> of editing <b>that</b> the project required seemed more like the process of putting a film together than a pop record." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is hardly}} fair {{to go back}} on bygones and talk like this," [...] he said, [...] "even if your {{position}} {{had something to do with}} it; only at first of course, you must remember that when we married mine was not without attractions. Two thousand a year to start on and a baronetcy and eight thousand a year in the near future were not--but I hate talking <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing. Why do you force me to it? Nobody could know that my uncle, who was so anxious that I should marry you, would marry himself at his age, and have a son and heir. It was not my fault, Honoria. Perhaps you would not have married me if you could have foreseen it." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of the morning there came from the officers, men, and {{passenger}} of the Dipsey a very cordial and pleasant message to Mr. Clewe and Mrs. Raleigh, congratulating them upon the happy event of which they had been informed. Sarah Block insisted on sending a supplementary message for herself, in which she was privately congratulatory to as great an extent as her husband would allow her to go, and which ended with a hope that if they lived to be married they would content themselves with doing their explorations on solid ground. She did not want to come back until she had seen the pole, but some of her ideas <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of travelling were getting to be a good deal more fixed than they had been.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{development}} of the whole northern portion of the prairie country depends {{on the success of}} the experiments that are being made," [...] Singleton went on. [...] "Their summers are hot but short; if they can get a grain that ripens early, they can cultivate vast stretches of land that are now, from economic reasons, uninhabitable, and it would make farming a more prosperous business in other tracts. Crops growing in the favored parts are occasionally frozen. It's a coincidence that a day or two ago I got a letter inquiring <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of wheat from a friend in Canada who is, as it happens, farming with a cousin of Lansing's." [...] Then he laughed. [...] "All this, however, {{has nothing to do with}} the object of your visit. Give me a few more minutes to think it over." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Maniac" [...] {{was written}} by Josh Ramsay of Marianas Trench. Natalie Mejia {{explained}} the main concept behind the song saying, [...] "It is just <b>about</b> a love <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of drives you crazy. You know how love can be. It is a universal law". Nichole Cordova later added, [...] "We've all been through that crazy love, so that's what the song is about." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Clive James {{was asked}} by Charlie Rose in 1993 to name the three most famous people of the century, he cited Elvis Presley, Mohammed Ali, and Bruce Lee. He also {{mentioned}} Adolf Hitler, saying, [...] "but {{the fact is the}} young Neo-Nazis in Germany now don't really know much <b>about</b> Hitler. So <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of fame not necessarily lasts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Conor Oberst, the band's frontman, {{allegedly}} said [...] "Hot Knives is a song.. um, sort of <b>about</b> a woman <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of discovers <b>that</b> {{her life}} is a sham and can't really exist in her reality any longer and has to transform completely into a new, uh, species. It sounds crazy, but it's not that crazy. It could happen to you, too" [...] on the NME Track-by-Track.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonder if I'll get {{a chance}} to use those things this winter," [...] he muttered. [...] "Little old New York doesn't know much <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of foot-gear. I suppose Pat has worn out two or three pairs since he gave me those, and here I haven't had 'em on but once in three years, and then there was hardly snow enough for an excuse. I guess I'd be some tenderfoot all right, all right, on those things up in the woods. Good old Pat! Wonder what he's doing. It's a long time since I've heard from him. Well, I ought not to kick over a little extra grind! He's trying to get an {{education}} and support himself and help his folks at the same time. Wish he could come down here for the vacation. What fun it would be to show him around and listen to his remarks on the big city. It would be almost as much fun as going into the big woods in the winter. Fact is, I envy him right now, and I'll bet he doesn't envy me a penny's worth." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} paper there was perhaps {{too much about}} mere debate; {{and there was nothing}} said at all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of talk which is merely {{luminous}} and restful, a higher power of silence, the quiet of the evening shared by ruminating friends. There is something, aside from personal preference, to be alleged in support of this omission. Those who are no chimney-cornerers, who rejoice in the social thunderstorm, have a ground in reason for their choice. They get little rest indeed; but restfulness is a quality for cattle; the virtues are all active, life is alert, and it is in repose that men prepare themselves for evil. On the other hand, they are bruised into a knowledge of themselves and others; they have in a high degree the fencer's pleasure in dexterity displayed and proved; what they get they get upon life's terms, paying for it as they go; and once the talk is launched, they are assured of honest dealing from an adversary eager like themselves. The aboriginal man within us, the cave-dweller, still lusty as when he fought tooth and nail for roots and berries, scents this kind of equal battle from afar; it is like his old primaeval days upon the crags, a return to the sincerity of savage life from the comfortable fictions of the civilised. And if it be delightful to the Old Man, it is none the less profitable to his younger brother, the conscientious gentleman. I feel never quite sure of your urbane and smiling coteries; I fear they indulge a man's vanities in silence, suffer him to encroach, encourage him on to be an ass, and send him forth again, not merely contemned for the moment, but radically more contemptible than when he entered. But if I have a flushed, blustering fellow for my opposite, bent on carrying a point, my vanity is sure to have its ears rubbed, once at least, {{in the course of the}} debate. He will not spare me when we differ; he will not fear to demonstrate my folly to my face.|$|E
5000|$|It {{really was}} all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing - the {{psychological}} answer to religion being the opiate of the masses, whereas we thought ideas were, {{more than anything}} else. Curt Smith ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought,' said Edie, {{with hardly}} {{a touch of}} unintentional satire, 'that the best thing <b>about</b> anecdotes of <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> in a {{newspaper}} was their utter irrelevancy. But if Beau Brummel won't do, couldn't you manage to work in Guicciardini and the galleys? That's strictly Italian, you know, and therefore relevant; and I'm sure the newspaper leaders are extremely fond of <b>that</b> story <b>about</b> Guiccardini.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{when the}} service was over Mary Isabel was dismayed {{to see that the}} sky had clouded over and looked very much like rain. Everybody hurried home, and Mary Isabel tripped along the shore road filled with anxious {{thoughts}} <b>about</b> her dress. <b>That</b> <b>kind</b> of silk always spotted, and her hat would be ruined if it got wet. How foolish she had been not to bring an umbrella! ...|$|R
2500|$|In a March 2010 MTV {{interview}} {{about the new}} album, Way explained, [...] "There's no title yet...I'm actually <b>kind</b> of excited <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It's <b>kind</b> of 'anything goes' at this point, but I'm so happy with the songs." [...] Though the band since decided on the title of their fourth album, it continued to go unannounced, with various rumors circulating and the band stating on their website {{that it will be}} revealed [...] "all in due time" [...] and in Way's words, [...] "a special way this time. Maybe some sort of event, something fun, something soon." ...|$|R
