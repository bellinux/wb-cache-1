40|$|Abstract This study {{intends to}} examine the {{relationships}} among satisfaction, complaint, and retailer switching behavior of consumers' fresh food product purchases and the factors influencing location switching behavior. Considering consumers at different retail formats having various purchasing patterns, this study surveyed respondents at traditional markets and at the hypermarkets in Taiwan. Respondents at traditional markets valued the freshness, free of contamination, and overall quality of fresh food products more heavily. Respondents at hypermarkets {{paid more attention to}} freshness, free of contamination, <b>and</b> <b>refrigerate</b> equipment and conditions of the retail stores. This study used the evaluated importance and satisfaction of fresh food products to group respondents into clusters. The results indicated that respondents had various post-purchase behaviors under the situations of expectancy disconfirmation. The respondents in the cluster of “partially satisfied customers” of traditional markets tended not to complain or complained privately when experiencing dissatisfaction with the sanitary conditions or the environment of the markets. Respondents of traditional markets when experiencing satisfaction were more likely to spread the information privately using word-of-mouth or further increased the levels of loyalty. Respondents in the cluster of “satisfied customers” of traditional markets believed that complaint could be a way to get responses from retailers and to direct improvement whenever dissatisfaction occurred. This group of respondents realized that channels of submitting complaints existed and was willing to battle for consumer rights. Analyzed results of hypermarket respondents indicated that most of them did not complain or only complained privately. However, they delivered word-of-mouth positively and increased the levels of loyalty when experiencing satisfaction. The respondents in the cluster of “satisfied customers” were more willing to file complaints than the respondents of “partially satisfied customers”. “Satisfied customers” of hypermarkets would complain to gain consumer rights while “partially satisfied customers” would complain due to responsibilities and the belief that retailers would react and enhance product or service qualities. In general, consumers could not stand with the retailers' ignorance or unresponsiveness to complaints. Respondents of traditional markets indicated high switching intentions. “Partially satisfied customers” had relatively high possibilities to switch to different retailers within the same traditional markets. “Dissatisfied customers” had relatively high intentions to switch to other traditional markets where they had not been to previously. Respondents of hypermarkets had relatively high possibilities to switch to other retail locations besides the traditional markets where they had not been to. The relationships of complaint behavior and location switching indicated that less “satisfied customers” of traditional markets would complain privately and switch retailers. More “partially satisfied customers” had tendencies to complain privately and switch to different retailers within the same traditional markets. “Dissatisfied customers” were more likely to complain privately and switch to other traditional markets or hypermarkets for fresh food products. Privately complained respondents of hypermarkets within the cluster of “partially satisfied customers” were more likely to switch locations than those of “satisfied customers”. This study suggests retailers to ensure the qualities and freshness of fresh food products. Retailers need to encourage customers to raise complaints of dissatisfaction with products, services, or the environment so the retailers can have chances to recover the errors or failure. The levels of satisfaction could be increased and the possibilities of location switching could be reduced if retailers properly handled the complaints. The traditional markets lack of organized customer service centers to manage customers' dissatisfaction or complaints. How individual retailers deal with complaints can be determinate. On the contrary, the customer services of hypermarkets are more functional and advantageous. Hypermarkets need to vigorously encourage customers to deliver complaints and dissatisfaction so the functions of customer services can be reinforced and eventually become the weapons to compete in the contemporary retailing environment. 摘要 本研究的目的在於瞭解消費者購買生鮮食品之滿意度、抱怨行為、與轉換零售地點間之關係，並探討影響購物地點轉換之因素。考量在不同地點購買生鮮食品的消費者有不同的購買型態及特性，本研究以傳統市場及量販店之消費者行為作為研究對象。傳統市場的受訪者對於生鮮食品的「新鮮程度」、「無病媒污染」、及「整體品質」較為重視，量販店之受訪者對於生鮮食品的「新鮮程度」、「無病媒污染」、及「保鮮設備」較為重視。 本研究以傳統市場及量販店受訪者對生鮮食品之重視程度與滿意度進行分群。受訪者在期望失衡的情況下採取的後續行為並不相同，傳統市場的「部分滿意群」對於環境衛生及整體週遭環境不滿意之後續行為大多會採取不抱怨的方式或是私下抱怨，但若在滿意的情形下受訪者會採取私下之口碑宣傳或增加忠誠度的行為方式。對影響抱怨行為的認知上，「完全滿意群」較為認同當有不滿時需提出抱怨以得到零售商的回應及改善，且此群受訪者瞭解抱怨管道並有意願爭取消費者的權益。量販店受訪者的分析結果顯示當有不滿意發生時大部份受訪者不會採取抱怨行動或僅採取私下行動。當有滿意之感受時，會傾向於採取正面的宣傳態度及增加忠誠度。在影響提出抱怨的認知上，「完全滿意群」明顯比「部分滿意群」會因為較瞭解抱怨管道及為了爭取消費權益而提出抱怨，「部份滿意群」則因責任心和相信業者會正向回應及改善產品或服務而提出抱怨。消費者皆不認同業者對抱怨採消極或忽略的補救方式。 傳統市場的三個集群都有相當高的購買地點轉換意圖，「部分滿意群」轉換到同一市場中曾去過的攤販之可能性明顯高於其他兩群，「完全不滿意群」則明顯有相對較高的意圖轉換到不曾去過的傳統市場購買。量販店的消費者在地點轉換時，到不曾去過的傳統市場之轉換率較低外，到其他地點的轉換可能性均很高。 抱怨行為及轉換地點間的關係顯示傳統市場的受訪者中，「完全滿意群」採取私下抱怨並轉換購買地點的人數較少，「部分滿意群」會採取私下抱怨並轉換到與原來相同之傳統市場但不同攤販的人數較多。「完全不滿意群」採取私下抱怨並轉換到其他傳統市場或量販店購買生鮮食品的情形較多。在量販店受訪者的分析結果中，「部分滿意群」在轉換購買地點時，採取私下抱怨的人數明顯較「完全滿意群」多。 本研究分析之結果建議業者應注意及強調生鮮食品品質問題，確保販賣產品之新鮮程度，並且主動且正向鼓勵消費者提出對產品、服務、或環境有任何不滿的抱怨，並予以適當補救，提高消費者滿意程度並減低消費者轉換購買地點之可能性。傳統市場由於是攤商的形式，消費者的不滿或抱怨並非有統一的客服中心或管理處加以統整，個別攤商的處理或補救之方式即形成決定性的影響。相對於傳統市場，量販業者在客服的機制上較具有優勢，量販業者需強化客服的功能，主動且善意的瞭解顧客的不滿及抱怨，並適切的予以補救，此將是量販業者在競爭的零售環境下掌握客群及維持顧客關係的利器。目 錄 i 圖目錄 ii 表目錄 iii 第壹章 緒論 1 第一節 研究背景 1 第二節 研究動機與目的 6 第三節 研究範圍與對象 8 第四節 研究流程 9 第貳章 文獻探討 10 第一節 顧客之抱怨行為 10 第二節 顧客不滿意原因之探討 20 第三節 企業之顧客抱怨處理 32 第四節 消費者購物地點轉換行為的探討 37 第參章 研究方法 39 第一節 研究架構 39 第二節 研究變數之操作定義與衡量方式 41 第三節 研究方法 49 第肆章 實證分析 53 第一節 樣本資料 53 第二節 生鮮食品之重視程度分析結果 64 第三節 抱怨行為之分析結果 69 第四節 轉換購買地點之分析 94 第伍章 結論與建議 99 第一節 結論 99 第二節 建議 102 第三節 研究限制與未來發展 104 參考文獻 105 一、國內文獻 105 二、國外文獻 106 附錄一：傳統市場問卷 113 附錄二：量販店/超市問卷 12...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Edward Hutchinson & Ervin Fodor ### Abstract It {{is often}} useful to {{concentrate}} and purify the pleomorphic, enveloped virions of influenza viruses prior to analysis. This protocol describes a standard method for purifying ‘spherical’ influenza virions, {{the most common}} morphology of laboratory-adapted strains, by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient. The protocol, which takes around eight hours to complete, is designed for virions shed into the growth media of infected cells, and would also be suitable for concentrating virions from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Two different density gradients are described: a conventional gradient of sucrose and a gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™ density gradient medium). A high degree of virion purity can be achieved, but small quantities of contaminants will remain. These can be removed by an optional haemadsorption-elution (HAd) step, which takes an additional one and half hours. This allows extremely efficient removal of the original contaminants, but introduces other, distinct contaminants at low levels. ### Materials Consumables required: 1. 0. 45 μm syringe filters - 50 ml syringes - 50 ml plastic tubes - 15 ml plastic tubes – optional - Thickwall tubes for the SW 28 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 25 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 355642) - Thinwall tubes for the SW 41 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 331372) - 5 ml syringe and needle (21 G or similar) - 1. 5 ml tubes - Standard plasticware, pipettes, permanent marker pen Reagents required: 1. 10 × NTC solution (1 M NaCl, 0. 2 M Tris-HCl pH 7. 4, 50 mM CaCl 2) - sucrose or OptiPrep™ density gradient medium (Sigma; D 1556) - sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - ddH 2 O - adult chicken blood cells in Alsever’s (TCS Biosciences; FB 010) – optional ### Equipment 1. Rotating wheel – optional - Refrigerator - 37 °C water bath - Benchtop centrifuge with refrigeration (e. g. a Rotanta 460 R, Hettich Lab Technology) - Mass balance - Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) - Beckman Coulter SW 28 swinging bucket rotor - Beckman Coulter SW 41 swinging bucket rotor - Aspiration vessel suitable for infectious material (e. g. an Integra Vacusafe; optional) - - 80 °C freezer ### Procedure 1. Prepare solutions in advance and store in the refrigerator – all should be used cold. Prepare: - a. 1 × NTC solution (from 10 × stock). - b. Working dilutions for the density gradient. If using sucrose, make 50 ml aliquots of 30, 40, 50 and 60 % solutions (w/v) by adding the required mass of sucrose to 5 ml 10 × NTC and topping up with ddH 2 O. Mix on a rotating wheel until dissolved, then pass through an 0. 45 μm syringe filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Mix equal amounts of these solutions in additional tubes to produce 35, 45 and 55 % solutions (w/v). If using OptiPrep™, follow a similar procedure to prepare a 10 – 40 % (w/v) series of iodixanol solutions in NTC (OptiPrep™ is 60 % iodixanol, so 12 ml solutions at 10, 20, 30 and 40 % should contain 1. 2 ml 10 × NTC and 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml OptiPrep™, respectively. Intermediate concentrations (15, 25 and 35 %) can be prepared by mixing, as above.) - c. To prepare a step gradient, layer 1. 5 ml {{of each of the}} seven solutions into a thinwall tube. Starting with the most concentrated solution, use a pipette to slowly add layers, 0. 75 ml at a time, taking care not to mix layers (the interfaces of different concentrations should remain visible). Gradients can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C (some mixing by diffusion is acceptable); if prepared during the purification this should be done during the first ultracentrifugation step. If only one gradient is required a balance can be quickly prepared by mixing 5. 25 ml of the most and least concentrated solutions, or using 10. 5 ml of the middle concentration. - d. If performing HAd, prepare chicken blood. To prevent lysis, blood should be centrifuged at no more than 1, 250 g (around 2, 500 rpm if using 15 ml tubes in a benchtop centrifuge, depending on the rotor) at 10 °C; although it should be kept cold it should not be put directly on ice. On receipt cells should be rinsed twice in chilled PBS. Comparison of the cell pellet to liquid in another tube should be used to estimate the volume of cells, and the pellet resuspended in PBS to 20 % packed cell volume (pcv) for storage in the refrigerator. If haemolysis occurs during storage the cells should be rinsed again in PBS and resuspended in an appropriate volume. When about to begin purification, pre-warm an aliquot of PBS to 37 °C. - Prepare virus to be concentrated. A maximum of 150 ml of virus-containing medium can be prepared without prior HAd. This can be obtained from six 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks which have been seeded with a suitable cell line (e. g. Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells), infected when sub-confluent with an influenza virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 48 h. - When the virus is ready to harvest, extensive cytopathic effect will be apparent by microscopy. Transfer the media to six 50 ml tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at approximately 2000 g (around 4, 000 rpm, depending on the rotor) to pellet cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant to six (thickwall) tubes and place in the buckets of an SW 28 rotor. Weigh the buckets (with the lids on) and transfer media between them as necessary to balance. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 18, 000 g (10, 000 rpm) in an SW 28 rotor to further pellet cellular debris. Retain 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - If extremely high purity is required (and chicken red blood cell contaminants are not problematic) perform HAd as described in steps (3) – (9). Otherwise, proceed to step (10). - Optional. Transfer supernatants to six clean, chilled 50 ml tubes and add 325 μl of chicken red blood cells (20 % pcv) to each tube. Mix by gentle inversion <b>and</b> <b>refrigerate</b> for 30 min, inverting regularly. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend all pellet in a single aliquot of 10 ml chilled PBS – to do so, sequentially rinse each tube with the same 5 ml aliquot of PBS, repeat with a second 5 ml aliquot, and pool both aliquots a single 15 ml tube. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml chilled PBS (some agglutination of cells is likely to be apparent). Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml 37 °C PBS, transfer to a clean, room-temperature 50 ml tube and increase the volume to 20 ml with 37 °C PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min, mixing regularly by gentle inversion. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C), and take 100 μl of the supernatant for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Prepare two thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol. Gently layer the supernatant onto the 5 ml cushion, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Add 20 ml PBS or water to the second tube to balance. Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volume of the balance tube as necessary. Proceed to step (11). - If HAd was not performed, prepare 6 thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol in each. Gently layer the supernatants onto the 5 ml cushions, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 28 rotor at 4 °C for 90 min at 112, 000 g (25, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatants, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible). When nearing the bottom of the tube, run the aspiration pipette around the meniscus and tilt away from the pellet to remove the supernatant. Add 50 μl chilled 1 × NTC to each tube (or around 500 μl to the single tube if HAd was used) and resuspend by pipetting up and down. Pool the suspension and layer gently onto the top of a density gradient (see 1. c, above) taking care not to mix the layers. Place the gradient tube and a balance tube into SW 41 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 150 min at 209, 000 g (35, 000 rpm). Afterwards, the virions should be visible as a ‘milky’ band of material at around 40 % sucrose or 30 % iodixanol. Hold the tube against a dark background and use a pen to mark the position of the meniscus and of the virions. Secure the tube and, using a 5 ml syringe and needle, carefully pierce the side of the tube a few millimetres below the virions. While moving the needle tip gently forwards and backwards, withdraw around 1 cm height of the gradient (1 – 2 ml), including the band of virions. Eject the contents of the syringe into a new thinwall tube containing 9 ml chilled 1 × NTC, and rinse out the syringe once in this solution. Place the tube and a balance tube in SW 41 rotor buckets weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min at 154, 000 g (30, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Add around 80 μl chilled 1 ×NTC and resuspend by pipetting; this should give around 150 μl of a milky solution of purified virions. Reserve around 10 % for analysis, and store the rest in a 1. 5 ml tube at - 80 °C. ### Timing - 1. Solution preparation. When convenient. - 2. Generation of virus. Two days. - 3. Harvesting and clarification. 40 min. - 4. Transfer, balance and clarification. 50 min. - 5 – 9. HAd (optional). 90 min. - 10. Layering onto cushions. 15 min. - 11. Ultracentrifugation. 120 min. - 12. Ultracentrifugation. 180 min. - 13. Ultracentrifugation. 80 min. Approximate time for purifications (steps 3 – 13) : 8 hours without HAd, 9 and a half hours with HAd. ### Troubleshooting - Growth of virus can be assessed before beginning by microscopic examination of cells (step 3). If no cytopathic effect is visible it is unlikely that there will be enough virus to purify. - With the volumes described, concentrated virus should be visible in steps 12 and 13 (though a dark background may be necessary in step 12, and the band may be faint). Additional bands may appear in step 12 depending on the mixing of the gradient steps and on the morphology of the virus; for most applications the major band can be harvested, but if this is ambiguous the entire gradient can be harvested in aliquots from the top (step 13 is then not required). - Samples taken throughout the purification can help to identify problems. A number of assays can be used to detect virions, including plaque assay (to detect fully infectious virions – typically recovery of infectious material is around 10 – 30 %) and SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (to assess purity). If chicken blood is being used a quick assay for the presence of virions (whether infectious or not) can be performed while other steps are being carried out using a modified haemagglutination (HA) assay. In a 96 -well round-bottomed dish add 50 μl PBS to 11 of the 12 columns, leaving the first column empty (a multi-channel pipette is helpful throughout this assay). In the first column add 100 μl of sample or PBS (up to eight samples per dish; material from the final step in the purification should only be used if heavily diluted beforehand), and perform twofold serial dilutions of this by transferring 50 μl into the second column, mixing, changing pipette tip and repeating across the dish. Then add 50 μl chicken red blood cells (at 1 % pcv) to each well, mix and leave to stand, preferably at 4 °C. For each sample the last dilution in which the blood cells agglutinate and cannot settle {{to the bottom of the}} well contains one haemagglutinating unit (HAU). Note that, as this is a modification of the standard assay, the HAU values here are useful only for relative measures and should not be compared to other experiments. Note also that the assay is rather insensitive to low concentrations of virus. Typical end-points are 1 / 128 for the input material (in 120 ml) and 1 / 512 after HAd (in 20 ml – i. e. around 2 / 3 recovery of material). ### Anticipated Results The method described should result in a thousand-fold decrease in volume with, typically, a 10 – 30 % recovery of infectious material (plaque-forming units). As some virus will be inactivated during purification the physical recovery of material is likely to be better than this. Electron microscopy shows that virions generally remain intact during purification (see Fig 1 b of ref (1) and Fig 1 b of ref (2)). Purification without HAd is sufficient to remove the majority of contaminating material, as can be seen by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in Fig 1 a of ref (1) and Fig 1 a of ref (2), and this is likely to be sufficient for the majority of applications. However, as shown in Fig 3 b of ref (2) low levels of contaminants are still present when material is purified in this way. These contaminants can be excluded by HAd, as shown in Fig 3 c of ref (2), though this method introduces additional contaminants derived from chicken red blood cells. Readers interested in the presence of specific protein contaminants after purification with and without HAd are referred to the supplementary data of ref (2). ### References 1. Hutchinson, E.

It is based on mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that express, from the endogenous loci, remodelers fused with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) -tag. Two versions of the TAP-tag, introduced at the C terminus, have been used successfully: (FLAG 3 -TEV-HA) and (FLAG-HA). ES cells are first fixed either with formaldehyde, or {{with a combination of}} disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and formaldehyde. ES cells are then permeabilized, and incubated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to fragment the genome into mononucleosomes. These nucleosomes are then incubated with agarose beads coupled with an antibody against HA or FLAG epitopes. After a series of washes, tagged-remodeler-nucleosome complexes are eluted, either by TEV protease cleavage or by peptide competition. The eluted protein is then subjected to a second immunopurification step, using beads coupled to the antibody against the second HA or FLAG epitope. After elution, DNA is extracted from the highly purified mononucleosome fraction, and processed for high-throughput sequencing. ### Materials 1. Solution I: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 15 mM, Sucrose 0. 3 M, KCl 60 mM, NaCl 15 mM, MgCl 2 5 mM, EGTA 0. 1 mM Solution II: Solution I with 0. 6 % (v/v) IGEPAL CA- 630 (SIGMA, ref. I 3021) - MNase buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, CaCl 2 1 mM - TKNSE buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, EDTA 4 mM - TEGN: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, MgCl 2 3 mM, EDTA 0. 1 mM, 10 % Glycerol, 0. 01 % IGEPAL - SDS elution buffer: 1 % SDS, 0. 1 M NaHCO 3 ### Procedure 1. Preparation of ES cells - Prior to the experiment, expand ES cells to twelve 70 - 80 % confluent 10 cm culture dishes (1. 5. 10 e 7 cells/dish). Tagged ES cells are cultured at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2, on mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (feeder cells), in DMEM (Sigma) with 15 % fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), pen/strep (Invitrogen), 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and a saturating amount of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as described in (Tessarollo, 2001). - The day before the experiment, pass the cells into twenty five 10 cm culture dishes coated with gelatin, without feeder cells. Between 30 and 50. 10 e 7 cells are expected for one tandem ChIP experiment. - The first day of the procedure, 2 h before starting the protocol, check the aspect and confluence of ES cells. Change the ES cell medium, using precisely 10 ml of fresh medium per 10 cm dish, and further incubate the cells for 2 h at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2. - Set a water bath at 37 °C, <b>and</b> <b>refrigerate</b> the centrifuge (e. g. 5810 R eppendorf centrifuge, with an A- 4 - 62 rotor). Put the following solutions on ice: Solution I, Solution II, MNase buffer, Complete 50 x (Roche, ref. 11836145001) and PBS 1 X. - When the 2 h incubation period in fresh medium is finished, trypsinize one dish and count the cells (these cells will be used only for counting, in order to calculate the amount of MNase required for genome fragmentation). We expect 1 to 2. 10 e 7 cells per dish. 2. Fixation. Caution: formaldehyde must be manipulated in a chemical fume hood. - Option 1 : Fixation with formaldehyde: - Remove the cells from the incubator and rapidly add 275 μl of formaldehyde 36. 5 % (SIGMA, ref. F 8775) in each dish, directly into the culture medium, and mix well. The final concentration of formaldehyde is 1 %. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. - Option 2 : Fixation with DSG and formaldehyde: - Dilute DSG to 2 mM in PBS. The DSG (Di-(N-succinimidyl) glutarate, Sigma-Aldrich Ref. 80424) stock solution is 500 mM (50 mg in 306 μl of DMSO) - Wash the ES cell culture dishes with 10 ml PBS at room temperature, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. - Add 4 ml of DSG 2 mM solution per 10 cm dish - Shake gently and make sure that the DSG solution has been in contact with all cells in the dish. - Keep the dishes at room temperature under the hood during 45 min. Shake gently 3 - 4 times during this period. - Add 4 ml of 2 % formaldehyde in PBS to each dish (final concentration 1 %). Mix well. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. Removal of the fixation agent and collection of fixed ES cells - Quickly remove the formaldehyde (or DSG + formaldehyde) solution from the dishes by vacuum aspiration (transfer this waste into an appropriate trash recipient). - Immediately wash each dish with 10 ml of cold PBS, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. Repeat this washing step once. - Add 2 ml of PBS (with protease inhibitors) per dish. - Scrap cells and collect them in four 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. Store the collected cells on ice. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. - Wash each tube of cells twice with 10 ml PBS 1 x without protease inhibitors. - Wash each tube of cells once with 5 ml Solution I. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. 3. Permeabilization of ES cells with IGEPAL - Resuspend each of the four cell pellets in 2 ml Solution I with protease inhibitors. - Add 2 ml Solution II with protease inhibitors. - Mix gently by pipetting or inverting the tubes several times. - Leave 10 min on ice. During this step, the cells are permeabilized by IGEPAL. Note that because of the formaldehyde fixation, nuclei are not efficiently released from the cells. - Centrifuge 10 min at 2000 g (3153 rpm using an eppendorf A- 4 - 62 rotor), 4 °C. 4. Chromatin fragmentation by MNase - Wash each cell pellet twice with 6 ml MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Resuspend each cell pellet in 500 μl MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Mix well with ± 20 up-and-down, using a P 1000 pipetman. Make sure that there are no more clumps of cells. - Transfer the cell suspension of each conical centrifuge tube into a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. Store on ice. - Dilute MNase (New England Biolab, ref. M 0247 S, 200 units/μl) to a concentration of 10 units/μl in MNase buffer. - Add MNase to each microfuge tube. 60 - 75 units of MNase are required to digest the chromatin of 10 million cells. The optimal amount of MNase has to be tested for each new batch of enzyme. The proper amount of MNase will release mostly mononucleosomes, but di- and tri-nucleosomes should still be visible when a sample is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel. - Mix well with a P 1000 pipetman. - Incubate 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Mix once by inverting the tubes after 5 min of incubation. - Transfer on ice, and add to each tube 20 μl EDTA 100 mM pH 8, 10 μl Complete 50 x, and 5 μl of PMSF 0. 1 M. Store on ice. - Make 4 cycles of sonication using, for instance, a Diagenode Bioruptor: 20 s ON / 40 s OFF. The purpose of this limited sonication step is not to shear chromatin, but to optimize the release of mononucleosomes from the MNase-digested cells. - Centrifuge at 14 000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C. - Collect and pool the supernatants of the four tubes, which correspond to the input chromatin, ready for the first Immunopurification step. Discard the pellets. Collect an 80 μl aliquot of this input chromatin for DNA analysis and quantification, and for western blot analysis. DNA preparation from input chromatin Before DNA analysis, the formaldehyde-mediated cross-link must be reversed. - In a new microfuge tube, add 20 μl of input chromatin, 480 μl H 2 O, 20 μl NaCl 5 M and 0. 5 μl RNase A (30 μg/μl). - Incubate overnight at 65 °C. - add 10 μl EDTA 0. 5 M, 20 μl Tris-HCl 1 M pH 8. 0 and 4 μl proteinase K 10 mg/ml. Incubate 2 h at 55 °C. - Add 500 μl Phenol/Chloroform, vortex 30 s, and centrifuge 10 min at 13000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1. 5 microfuge tube. - Add 50 μl of NaAc 3 M pH 5. 2. Mix. - Add 1 ml 100 % ethanol (- 20 °C), and mix by inverting 10 times the tubes. - Precipitate DNA 1 h at - 20 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). - Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C, 13000 rpm. Discard the supernatant, centrifuge again for 30 s and remove the last drop of liquid. - Wash the DNA pellet with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol. Centrifuge and discard all the liquid. - Add 20 TE (Tris-HCl pH 8, 0. 1 mM EDTA). Once prepared, the DNA is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel, to analyze the distribution of mono- and oligo-nucleosomes in the input chromatin. In addition, DNA is quantified by measuring the OD at 260 nm. 5. Preparation of HA- or FLAG-agarose beads for steps 1 and 2 of the tandem affinity purification scheme Anti-HA-agarose (ref. A 2095) and anti-FLAG-agarose (ref. A 2220) beads are purchased from SIGMA. - Resuspend the beads, and pipet the required amount of beads into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube: 80 μl of beads (this is the volume of beads estimated after centrifugation, not the volume of slurry) for the first immunoprecipitation step, 40 μl for the second step. - Wash the beads three times with 10 ml TKNSE buffer. Centrifuge one min at 1000 rpm between each wash to collect the beads. - Keep the beads at 4 °C until use. 6. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation: first step of the tandem affinity protocol - In four 1. 5 ml microfuge tubes, mix 500 μl of input chromatin with 20 μl of HA antibody-agarose beads. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - Pool the content of the four microfuge tubes into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge 2 min at 1000 rpm, at 4 °C. - Take an 80 μl aliquot of the unbound fraction of the first IP as a control for western blot analysis (store on ice). - Wash the beads 8 times with 10 ml TEGN. - Resuspend in 500 μl TEGN if elution is to be made by TEV proteolysis, or in 300 μl of TEGN for elution by peptide competition (see below), and transfer into a new 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Take a 10 μl aliquot of this bead suspension to control the efficiency of the first immunoprecipitation by western blot. Store on ice until analysis. 7. Elution, first step of the tandem affinity protocol - Option 1 : Elution by TEV digestion TEV elution is efficient for the FLAG 3 -TEV-HA tag. For the simple FLAG-HA tag, go to option 2 (elution by peptide competition). - Add 50 μl TEV (1 mg/ml). - Incubate for 6 h at 30 °C, using a thermomixer set at 750 rpm. Check that the beads are well mixed, but not harshly, during this incubation. - Option 2 : Elution by peptide competition For proteins fused with a simple FLAG-HA tag, elution is performed by peptide competition. HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) and FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) are solubilized at 4 μg/μl in 0. 5 M Tris-HCl (PH 7. 5). - Resuspend the bead pellet in 300 μl TEGN. Transfer into a 500 μl microfuge tube. - Add 100 μl of peptide (4 μg/μl). Use the HA peptide if you started your purification with the anti-HA antibody. - Add protease inhibitors: 8 μl Complete 50 x and 4 μl PMSF 0. 1 M. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - After TEV digestion or peptide elution, transfer the mixture of beads and elution solution in a centrifuge column (Pierce®, 0. 8 ml, ref. 89868). - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm at room temperature. - Collect the eluate in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube, store on ice. Collect also the beads in a separate tube, to control the efficiency of the elution process. - Take an aliquot of the eluate (e. g. 10 μl) and store on ice. 8. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation: second step of the tandem affinity protocol - Add 40 μl of beads coupled to the second antibody (e. g. anti-FLAG, if you have used the anti-HA in the first step of the protocol) to the eluate of the first purification step, in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - Transfer the content of the microfuge tube (beads in suspension) into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge 2 min at 1000 rpm, at 4 °C. - Take an 80 μl aliquot of the unbound fraction of the second IP. Leave on ice until analysis. - Wash 8 times with 10 ml TEGN. - Centrifuge at 4 °C, 2 min at 1000 rpm. - Resuspend in 300 μl (final volume including the beads) TEGN and transfer into a 500 μl microfuge tube. 9. Elution, second step of the tandem affinity protocol - Add 100 μl of competitor peptide (4 μg/μl). - Incubate 5 h at room temperature on a rotating wheel. - Transfer the beads and eluate into a Pierce centrifuge column. - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the eluate into a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. This sample contains the chromatin eluted by peptide competition. Store on ice and collect a 40 μl aliquot for western blot analysis. Keep the beads for the second elution step with the SDS elution buffer. - Add 400 μl of preheated (55 °C) SDS elution buffer to the beads. - Agitate during 15 min onto a thermomixer (55 °C). - Transfer (beads+ eluate) in a centrifuge column. - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the eluate in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. This sample corresponds to the second eluate, in which the chromatin remaining attached to the beads after peptide elution has been eluted by the action of SDS. - Take a 40 μl aliquot of eluate 2 and store all samples on ice or until Western blot analysis. 10. Western blot analysis - Run the samples collected at the various steps of the protocol on your favorite protein gel running and blotting system. For the agarose beads collected after the elution steps, directly add the SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer to the beads, heat as for liquid samples, centrifuge 30 s at 13 000 rpm, and load the supernatant onto the gel. The purification efficiency of the tagged protein during the tandem affinity ChIP protocol will be revealed by using an antibody against HA or FLAG epitope. 11. DNA preparation from the purified remodeler-nucleosomes complexes - Add to the eluates 170 μl H 2 O and 20 μl NaCl 5 M. - Incubate overnight at 65 °C for cross-link reversal. - add 10 μl EDTA 0. 5 M, 20 μl Tris-HCl 1 M pH 8. 0 and 4 μl proteinase K 10 mg/ml. Incubate 2 h at 55 °C. - Add 500 μl Phenol/Chloroform, vortex 30 s, and centrifuge 10 min at 13000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Add 25 μg of glycogen (Roche, ref. 10901393001) and 50 μl of NaAc 3 M pH 5. 2. Mix. - Add 1 ml 100 % ethanol (- 20 °C), and mix by inverting 10 times the tubes. - Precipitate DNA 1 h at - 20 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). - Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C, 13000 rpm. The DNA-glycogen pellet should be visible {{at the bottom of the}} tube. - Collect and discard the supernatant. Centrifuge again for 30 s and discard the last drop of liquid. - Wash the DNA-glycogen pellet with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol. Centrifuge and discard all the liquid. - Dry the pellet (15 - 30 min, at room temperature). - Resuspend in 20 μl of H 2 O. This DNA sample will be used for high-throughput sequencing. - Quantify the DNA using a Picogreen DNA detection kit (Invitrogen). ### Timing 3 to 4 days (excluding ES cell culture), depending on the elution option chosen for step 1 ### Author Information Arnaud Depaux, Maud de Dieuleveult, Isabelle Hmitou, Sylvie Jounier, Hélène Humbertclaude & Matthieu Gerard, **Gerard's Lab, mammalian epigenomics** Correspondence to: Matthieu Gerard ([matthieu. gerard@cea. fr](matthieu. gerard@cea. fr)) *Source: [Protocol Exchange]([URL] Originally published online 31 October 2014 *...|$|E
