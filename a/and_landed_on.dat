5|$|During World War II PRR carried {{troops and}} matériel for the Allied war effort, and the Curve was under armed guard. The {{military}} intelligence arm of Nazi Germany, the Abwehr, plotted to sabotage important industrial {{assets in the}} United States in a project code-named Operation Pastorius. In June1942 four men were brought by submarine <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> Long Island, planning to destroy such sites as the Curve, Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River.

5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly {{on his right}} shoulder. He later played volleyball <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder again while going for a dig. He heard a strange sound.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins made a {{location}} on {{land at the}} mouth of the Duwamish River; they formally claimed it on September 14, 1851. Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party. Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point on September 28, 1851. The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland, Oregon, <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{pregnant}} {{when she decided}} to venture out alone on a hunt in a Buda forest on 17May 1395. Her horse tripped, threw her <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> top of her. The trauma induced labor and she gave birth prematurely to a son. The queen succumbed to the fatal injuries; being far from any kind of assistance, her son died as well. She was buried in the cathedral of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary's sister, Jadwiga, claimed the crown, but Sigismund retained it without much difficulty.|$|E

5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove. Spiegel Grove was sunk in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef. However, the ship turned over <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> the bottom upside down. Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E
5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA Space Shuttle mission {{and the third}} flight of the Space Shuttle Challenger. It {{launched}} on August 30, 1983 <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> September 5, conducting the first night launch and night landing of the Space Shuttle program. It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford.

5|$|The Apollo {{astronaut}}s {{were chosen}} from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans, plus from two later astronaut groups. All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans.

Dr. Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space, <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training {{of all of the}} Apollo landing crews.|$|E

DDP followed by covering Young for the pinfall and the win.|$|E
5|$|Darin Cortland Ruf (born July 28, 1986) is an American {{professional}} baseball first baseman and outfielder for the Samsung Lions of the KBO League. He {{was born in}} Omaha, Nebraska, and played at Westside High School. Subsequently, he attended Creighton University, and excelled playing baseball there before the Philadelphia Phillies drafted him in 2009. In the minor leagues, he initially hit for a high batting average, but in 2011 combined that with power numbers {{to become one of}} the Phillies' top prospects. He made his major league debut in September 2012, after having hit 38 home runs to lead the Eastern League. In 2013, he split time between Triple-A and the major league Phillies, and was among the league's top rookies during the season. He was embroiled in a roster battle for a bench spot entering 2014, but hurt his oblique, <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> the disabled list prior to the season.|$|E
5|$|James {{then began}} an angle with Melina on January 29, 2007, when Melina became {{the number one}} {{contender}} for the Women's Championship. Following a successful title defense on February 5, James teamed with Super Crazy in a mixed tag team match against Melina and Johnny Nitro. After Melina pinned James for the victory, she challenged her to a rematch for the title. James would subsequently lose the Women's Championship to Melina on February 19 and, in continuation of their storyline feud, failed to regain the title during the first women's Falls Count Anywhere match in WWE history. During the finish of the match, James fell from the top turnbuckle <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> her neck, {{which resulted in a}} rushed finish. James, however, was not seriously injured in the incident.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, 1943, Day {{was drafted}} into {{military}} service. He was commissioned in the 818th Amphibian Battalion <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> Utah Beach {{six days after}} Operation Overlord to drop supplies. Following VE-Day, he was stationed in France. Day and fellow Negro leaguer Willard Brown were recruited to the Overseas Invasion Service Expedition (OISE) All-Stars; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Sam Nahem was the player-manager of the team. The team easily overcame the competition to reach the ETO World Series to face the 71st Infantry Division team, composed predominantly of Major League Baseball players. By contrast, the OISE club consisted of a mismatched roster of various minor leaguers, Negro leaguers, and semi-professionals. Before a crowd of 50,000 at Stadion Nürnberg in Germany, Day pitched in Game Two for a 2–1 victory as the OISE All-Stars eventually won the championship in seven games.|$|E
5|$|Spread {{across several}} {{different}} transport vessels, {{after completing the}} crossing– during which the battalion’s machine guns were employed for anti-aircraft defence– the 2/1st's companies were split up: 'A' Company, supported the Australian 2/4th Battalion, while two companies– 'B' and 'C'– supported the New Zealand 4th Brigade, and another– 'D' Company– {{was assigned to the}} Australian 17th Brigade. The campaign proved to be short-lived, as the Allies were quickly pushed back by the advancing Germans, and the battalion was subsequently withdrawn around the end of April and early May, having fought major actions around the Aliakmon River, Servia Pass, Lamia and Mount Olympus. During the evacuation, elements of three companies were taken aboard the transport Costa Rica, which was later attacked by German aircraft. As the vessel was sinking, the troops on board were evacuated by Royal Navy destroyers <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> Crete, minus the majority of their equipment which was lost at sea.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav {{retreated to}} Dorostolon, which the Byzantine armies besieged for sixty-five days. Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came {{to terms with}} John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the {{southern}} Crimea, and return west of the Dnieper River. In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' with food and safe passage home. Sviatoslav and his men set sail <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> Berezan Island {{at the mouth of}} the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter. Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, so that even a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-grivna, reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle. While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable to the attacks of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer four decades later.|$|E
