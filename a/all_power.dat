5|$|Ontario {{electricity}} outages were minor, mostly {{caused by}} the windstorms of April 28. Although they affected thousands of people at different times throughout the day, <b>all</b> <b>power</b> was restored {{by the end of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held <b>all</b> <b>power,</b> but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one hour}} later, Hiryū's second attack wave, {{consisting}} of ten B5Ns and six escorting A6Ms, arrived over Yorktown; the repair efforts {{had been so}} effective that the Japanese pilots assumed that Yorktown must be a different, undamaged carrier. They attacked, crippling Yorktown with two torpedoes; she lost <b>all</b> <b>power</b> and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters were shot down in this attack.|$|E

5|$|In February 1938, Hitler {{emphasised}} to Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg {{the need}} for Germany to secure its frontiers. Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite regarding Austrian independence for 13 March, but Hitler demanded that it be cancelled. On 11 March, Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg demanding that he hand over <b>all</b> <b>power</b> to the Austrian NSDAP or face an invasion. The Wehrmacht entered Austria the next day, to be greeted with enthusiasm by the populace.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} Mughal rulers who divided {{power between}} Mughal and Rajput chiefs, during Bahadur Shah's reign <b>all</b> <b>power</b> resided with him. The Sikh khalsa (army), {{under the leadership}} of Banda Singh Bahadur, and their army defeated the Mughals in battle at Samana, Sirhind and Rahon and captured the cities of Samana, Sirhind, Malerkotla, Saharanpur, Rahon, Behat, Ambheta, Ropar and Jalandhar from 1709 to 1712. With an army of eighty thousand soldiers, he also besieged the city of Jalalabad in present-day Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs is {{a seminal}} case in {{administrative}} law {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of Singapore in 1988. The Court decided the appeal in the appellants' favour on a technical ground, but considered obiter dicta the reviewability of government power in preventive detention cases under the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). The case approved the application by the court of an objective test in the review of government discretion under the ISA, stating that <b>all</b> <b>power</b> has legal limits {{and the rule of}} law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. This was a landmark shift from the position in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister of Home Affairs, which had been an authority for the application of a subjective test until it was overruled by Chng Suan Tze.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} {{connections}} between the invariants of the different powers of an ideal. We investigate how to construct minimal resolutions for <b>all</b> <b>powers</b> at once using methods from algebraic and polyhedral topology {{with a focus on}} ideals arising from combinatorics. In one construction, we obtain cellular resolutions for <b>all</b> <b>powers</b> of edge ideals of bipartite graphs on n vertices, supported by (n − 2) –dimensional complexes. Our main result is an explicit minimal cellular resolution for <b>all</b> <b>powers</b> of edge ideals of paths. These cell complexes are constructed by first subdividing polyhedral complexes and then modifying them using discrete Morse theory. 1...|$|R

5|$|Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933. The Nazi Party {{then began to}} eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. <b>All</b> <b>power</b> was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In {{the midst of the}} Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.|$|E
5|$|LANSA Flight 502 was a Lockheed L-188A Electra {{operated}} by Líneas Aéreas Nacionales Sociedad Anónima (LANSA) which crashed shortly after takeoff from Quispiquilla Airport near Cusco, Peru, on August 9, 1970, after losing <b>all</b> <b>power</b> {{from one of}} its engines. The four-engine turboprop aircraft, registered OB-R-939, was bound from Cusco to Lima, carrying 8 crew and 92 passengers. All {{but one of the}} occupants died from injuries sustained from impact forces and post crash fire. Two people on the ground were also killed. There were 49 American high school exchange students on board, all of whom perished. A Peruvian government investigation concluded that the accident was caused by improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, aggravated by lack of maintenance and overloading. LANSA was fined and its operations were suspended for 90 days. At the time, the crash was the deadliest ever in Peruvian history.|$|E
5|$|Power workers {{immediately}} began repairing the power failures by clearing tree branches and replacing fuses and circuit breakers. Peco energy restored power to 72% {{of the affected}} customers by {{two days after the}} storm, with 85% restored by two nights. By two days after the storm, Pennsylvania Power and Light restored power to about 80% of its impacted customers, with about 93% restored by two nights after the storm. By five days after Isabel, most power outages in southeastern Pennsylvania were repaired, with all outages restored by a week after the hurricane. Allegheny Power restored power to about 20% of its customers by two days after the storm. Most power outages for the company were restored by five days after the hurricane, with <b>all</b> <b>power</b> completely restored by a week after Isabel.|$|E

5|$|Residents in both Massachusetts and Connecticut {{were also}} without power {{for up to}} one week, which caused many food {{products}} to spoil {{due to lack of}} refrigeration. The states brought in workers from other states, although the delay in restoring the widespread outages caused many schools to remain closed. In Connecticut, one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines. About 477,000 Connecticut Light & Power customers in the state lost power, a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during Hurricane Irene in 2011. Later in 2011, a nor'easter in October left over 830,000people statewide without power, also breaking the record set by Gloria. In New Hampshire, most power outages were quickly restored, and all were restored within six days. In Maine, <b>all</b> <b>power</b> outages were restored in 11days.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia is a polyethnic nation {{consisting}} of 80 {{different ethnic groups}} and 84 indigenous languages. Due to the diverse population and rural areas throughout the nation, it was nearly impossible to create a strong centralized state; though it was eventually accomplished through political evolution. Prior to 1974, nationalism was only discussed within radical student groups, but by the late 20th century the issue {{had come to the}} forefront of political debate. Ethiopia was forced to modernize their political system to properly handle the nationalism debates. The Derg military government took control with a Marxist–Leninist ideology, urging self-determination and rejecting compromise over any nationality issues. In the 1980s, Ethiopia suffered a series of famines and after the USSR broke apart, they lost their aid from the Soviet Union and the Derg government collapsed. Eventually Ethiopia restabilized and adopted a modern political system that models a federal parliamentary republic. It was still impossible to create a central government holding <b>all</b> <b>power,</b> so the government was torn. The central federal government now presides over ethnically-based regional states and each ethnic state is granted the right to establish their own government and democracy.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from <b>all</b> <b>power</b> sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{despite his}} {{apparent}} liberalism, Antonio López was a dictator who allowed Paraguayans no {{more freedom to}} oppose the government than they had had under Francia. Congress became his puppet, and the people abdicated their political rights, a situation enshrined in the 1844 Constitution, which placed <b>all</b> <b>power</b> in López's hands.|$|E
