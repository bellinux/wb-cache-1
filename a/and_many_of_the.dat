Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, abandoned {{in the second half}} of the 1980s.

Blenker was a German immigrant himself, a refugee of the Revolutions of 1848, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> units under his command were heavily German-American. Encamped at Roach's Mills, Virginia, the 68th participated {{in the defense of}} Washington, losing three men in their first combat, a minor skirmish with a Confederate patrol.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained {{without the possibility of}} air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, {{none of them were}} inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town's major industries, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E

5|$|An ultranationalist Mi-24 Hind {{helicopter}} destroys a vital {{bridge and}} traps the joint force.

Distracted, Zakhaev turns to the Loyalist forces at which point Price gives Soap a M1911; the latter kills Zakhaev and his escort. Loyalist forces start tending to the wounded immediately.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this and similar controversies, Alf Dubs {{introduced}} a private member's bill named the Solicitors (Independent Complaints Procedure) Bill on 12 February 1985, which would move the responsibility of regulating the solicitors profession to a body outside the Law Society.

5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal grid system. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E
