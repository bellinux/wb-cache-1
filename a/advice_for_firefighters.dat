30|$|The {{limitations}} of this study and suggestions for future studies are as follows. The range of this study was limited to design proposal and development of test products of protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters.</b> Future studies should improve the material, and produce protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> that consider water-resistance, ventilation, and light weight. Ergonomic evaluations should be conducted in an environment with KFI certification, that is similar to the actual environment where firefighters work. The results of this study were development of designs for high-sensitive protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> that considered convenience <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> active in the field, and are expected to be useful as foundation material for research and development of future protective footwear products <b>for</b> <b>firefighters.</b>|$|R

30|$|According to KFIS 008 (Korea Fire Institute Standards (KFIS) 2001), {{protective}} footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> must protect {{the human body}} from various dangerous elements including an extreme external environment, heat, fire, chemical substances, sharp objects, and shock. They must also maximize movement, and provide safety and comfort <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> who work in extreme conditions. The structure of {{protective footwear}} <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> consists of the main body, inner sole, protective sole, lining, shin guard, outer sole, and slip prevention grooves. There are two types footwear: rubber footwear and leather footwear. Rubber footwear uses vulcanized rubber on the outside, and aramid fiber for the lining, and has a pulling loop-type opening. Leather footwear has leather material on the outside, penetration prevention fabric on the inside, and a zipper-type opening. According to KFIS 008 (KFIS 2001), protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> in Korea {{must be at least}} 30  cm high {{from the bottom of the}} outer sole. When the heel and soles are attached to the upper leather, no metal parts such as nails or screws can be used. The weight limitation for rubber footwear is 2.8  kg, and the limitation for leather footwear is 3.0  kg. The evaluation categories for protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> include tension, electricity-resistance, water-resistance, heat-resistance, heat transmission, and internal heat conduction. The international and domestic standards for protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> include NFPA 1971 (National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 2013), CSN EN 15090 (Safety Protection Standards (CSN EN) 2012), and ISO 15538 (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2001).|$|R

30|$|Published {{studies on}} {{protective}} footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> include {{a study on}} wear of personal firefighting protection gear (Bang 2010), {{a study on the}} physiological reactions when climbing stairs wearing firefighting rubber footwear and firefighting leather footwear (Huang et al. 2009), and a study on the effects of leather firefighting protective footwear on physical sense of balance (Huh and Bang 2013). Bang (2010) found that the preferences of <b>firefighters</b> <b>for</b> protective gear was in the order of fire suit (3.10), general work wear (3.04), helmet (2.97), leather protective footwear (2.68), gloves (2.6), and rubber protective footwear (2.59). The results of satisfaction analysis of firefighting protection gear showed that satisfaction was highest in order of general work wear (3.21), helmet (3.17), fire suit (3.15), leather protective footwear (2.97), gloves (2.77), and rubber protective footwear (2.75). Analysis of the overall satisfaction of firefighters’ protection gear indicated that there was a need to improve protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters.</b> The satisfaction rate of protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> was low because of the thick material used for protection, and the weight and discomfort from metal parts, and bad storage conditions. Huang et al. (2009) conducted physiological analysis while climbing stairs wearing rubber protective footwear and leather protective footwear. Physical fatigue was lower for rubber footwear compared to leather footwear, and flexibility was higher at the knees and the back of the foot. However, {{there is a lack of}} studies that analyze designs of protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters,</b> and develop protective footwear according to the designs and review of current conditions, which could aid smoother field action <b>for</b> <b>firefighters.</b> Therefore, there is a need for a study that will provide specific points of improvement for protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters,</b> and develop a product based on these points, for improved protection and safe field activities of firefighters. Previous related studies include an analysis of protective footwear products <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> (Kang et al. 2015), a review of the current conditions of protective footwear worn by firefighters (Lee and An 2016), and an analysis of protective footwear products and design proposals (Jung et al. 2016). Kang et al. (2015) selected the latest protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> of different countries and comparatively analyzed them. The products included Sancheong ([URL] the US brand Globe ([URL] the German brand Haix ([URL] and the Chinese brand Penco ([URL] The results confirmed that rubber protective footwear had excellent water resistance and elasticity while leather protective footwear had excellent ventilation, and diverse pattern changes were found to be possible in terms of design. Lee and An (2016) found that the majority of protective footwear <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> were in the size range between 260 and 270  cm. The most common foot type was the Greek type, where the second toe is the longest, and regular foot arches were more common than arched or flat types. Jung et al. (2016) proposed two types of combined openings for protective footwear: laces and zipper, and laces and buckle. The laces and buckle type that can adjust size was chosen and thirty designs were proposed with this opening.|$|R

40|$|Firefighting is {{extremely}} strenuous and physically demanding work and involves {{ability to cope}} with emergency life-or-death situations. Because of the high physical demands of firefighting, successful job performance and minimizing of morbidity and mortality depends on fitness for duty. The firefighting department of Tehran does not perform periodic medical assessment <b>for</b> <b>firefighters.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate medical fitness among firefighters in Tehran. In this cross sectional study we examined 147 firefighters. Medical and occupational history obtained by interview, then we performed physical examination, blood tests, ECG, spirometry and audiometry. Then results compared with guidelines <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> in the USA, Australia and the United Kingdom. Seven percent of our participants had a kind of pulmonary dysfunction and 25 % had some degrees of hearing loss. A considerable percent of them had modifiable coronary heart disease risk factors. Thirteen participitants were unfit for this job that among them; ten firefighters were unfit based on vision capability, one case due to hypertention and two cases because of pulmonary dysfunction. Because of hazardouse nature of firefighting; preplacement, periodic medical evaluations and assesment of fitness <b>for</b> <b>firefighters</b> in Iran is highly recommended.
