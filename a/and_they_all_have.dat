500|$|P.exclamans {{lives in}} a {{hierarchical}} society with one queen that lays the eggs. However, all of the females have the same morphology <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary (queen death, queen migration). Since the queen has the same morphology {{as the rest of}} the workers in the colony, this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned and what makes her special. Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose, fructose and trehalose than workers, leading to higher cryoprotectant levels. P.exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant, which work by increasing the solute concentration in cells. This results in a greater survivability in colder weather. It was found that queens have a 76% survival rate in [...] weather compared to 17% survival of the workers over a 15-day test period. The queens also have a 0.5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies. This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season. The queens seem to be the only ones capable of diapause.|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{stated that}} it was [...] "fabulous from a writing perspective" [...] to have an eight episode order, as [...] "you can plan it and know where you're heading... They're all their own stories <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> their own drive, but it's sort of {{building}} toward a big thing {{at the end of}} the eight episodes." [...] Elaborating on this, Atwell said, [...] "it's incredibly tight, the script, which is great. It's fast moving and fast paced but luckily because it's not stretched out of 22 episodes, nothing is diluted. Every line is vital to not only moving the story and the action [...] but also developing the characters." [...] The season's overarching storyline revolves around the chemical weapon Midnight Oil, which is based on the Madbomb of the Captain America comics. The Madbomb was originally considered for use in , before negotiations with actors to adapt the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline were completed. Also in July, it was revealed that Carter's husband would be explored in the series. However, he was ultimately not explored much in the first season, with McFeely saying, [...] "This was the season where she says goodbye to Steve ... In a second season, she could be freer to have those conversations about a life after him." ...|$|E

A country of 85 million people, a great civilization, many educated men and women, if they want to get a bomb WILL get it. They have demonstrated they could do it under the most severe sanctions...

60|$|But this time, {{it seems}} to me, we have {{consciously}} and responsibly to carry ourselves through the winter-period, the period of death and denudation: that is, some of us have, some nation even must. For there are not now, as in the Roman times, any great reservoirs of energetic barbaric life. Goths, Gauls, Germans, Slavs, Tartars. The world is very full of people, but all fixed in civilizations of their own, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> all our vices, all our mechanisms, and all our means of destruction. This time, the leading civilization cannot die out as Greece, Rome, Persia died. It must suffer a great collapse, maybe. But it must carry through all the collapse the living clue to the next civilization. It's no good thinking we can leave it to China or Japan or India or Africa--any of the great swarms.|$|E

The Manyuema called us many names, saying that they would eat us all before they left our country--that this was our punishment for killing their friends last year. I did not hear much, for I ran away quickly." ...|$|E

60|$|First, {{the people}} are divided into classes and ranks, with more {{accuracy}} of distinction than is used in this country, {{or in any other}} country under heaven. Every class is divided into families, some of whom are more distinguished and more honorable than others; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> rights, privileges, and immunities belonging to them. Even in cases of conquest, no confiscation is to take place. A Brahmin's estate comes by descent to him; it is forever descendible to his heirs, if he has heirs; and if he has none, it belongs to his disciples, and those connected with him in the Brahminical caste. There are other immunities declared to belong to this caste, in direct contradiction to what has been asserted by the prisoner. In no case shall a Brahmin suffer death; in no case shall the property of a Brahmin, male or female, be confiscated for crime, or escheat for want of heirs. The law then goes on to other castes, and gives to each its property, and distinguishes them with great accuracy of discrimination.|$|E
60|$|These uneatable {{insects are}} {{probably}} more numerous than is supposed, although we already know immense numbers that are so protected. The most remarkable are the three families of butterflies--Heliconidae, Danaidae, and Acraeidae--comprising {{more than a thousand}} species, and characteristic respectively of the three great tropical regions--South America, Southern Asia, and Africa. All these butterflies have peculiarities which serve to distinguish them from every other group in their respective regions. They all have ample but rather weak wings, and fly slowly; they are always very abundant; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> conspicuous colours or markings, so distinct from those of other families that, in conjunction with their peculiar outline and mode of flight, they can usually be recognised at a glance. Other distinctive features are, that their colours are always nearly the same on the under surface of their wings as on the upper; they never try to conceal themselves, but rest on the upper surfaces of leaves or flowers; and, lastly, they all have juices which exhale a powerful scent, so that when one kills them by pinching the body, the liquid that exudes stains the fingers yellow, and leaves an odour that can only be removed by repeated washings.|$|E
60|$|Turning to Table 3: {{the first}} four wild rabbits have skulls of the same length, and these differ but little in capacity. The Sandon rabbit (No. 4) is interesting, as, though now wild, it {{is known to be}} descended from a domesticated breed, as is still shown by its {{peculiar}} colouring and longer body; nevertheless the skull has recovered its normal length and full capacity. The next three rabbits are wild, but of small size, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> skulls with slightly lessened capacities. The three Porto Santo feral rabbits (Nos. 8 to 10) offer a perplexing case; their bodies are greatly reduced in size, as in a lesser degree are their skulls in length and in actual capacity, in comparison with the skulls of wild English rabbits. But when we compare the capacities of the skull in the three Porto Santo rabbits, we observe a surprising difference, which does not stand in any relation to the slight difference in the length of their skulls, nor, as I believe, to any difference in the size of their bodies; but I neglected weighing separately their bodies. I can hardly suppose that the medullary matter of the brain in these three rabbits, living under similar conditions, can differ as much as is indicated by the proportional difference of capacity in their skulls; nor do I know whether it is possible that one brain may contain considerably more fluid than another. Hence I can throw no light on this case.|$|E
