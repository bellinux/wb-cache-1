5|$|An Ontario Parks visitor's permit is not {{required}} to drive through Algonquin Park. However, one is required for the use of any trails, campgrounds, the Visitor Centre, or similar facilities within the park boundary. Moose and deer are very common through Algonquin, especially <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> in the morning, and present a major driving hazard.|$|E

5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|A pure browser, {{the lesser}} kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. The lesser kudu is mainly active <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E

5|$|Adults are {{extremely}} mobile during the day, and find refuge in resting sites in flowers and young leaves <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> early morning. They migrate from crop to crop following flower availability. Field density can vary. In France, numbers are around 20 adults/100 plants {{at the beginning}} of the colonization and 150 adults/100 plants at population peak when pressure is high.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the idea}} of the greater Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} {{the idea of}} children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> comfort them if they had been chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E

5|$|Fight Club {{was filmed}} mostly <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> Fincher {{purposely}} filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps {{to create a}} background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes {{in the basement and}} instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef squids (particularly in jigging) are usually done <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> utilise bright lights, {{taking advantage of}} their attraction to illumination. They are especially abundant during the full moon and in foggy weather. Populations of bigfin reef squids are not seasonal, {{and they can be}} fished throughout the year. They are also used as fish bait in hook and line fishing.|$|E
5|$|Fluent in Pashto, English, and Urdu, Yousafzai {{was educated}} mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, {{who is a}} poet, school owner, and an {{educational}} activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School. She once stated to an interviewer that {{she would like to}} become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.|$|E

5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|Having {{isolated}} Damascus, Khalid {{ordered his}} army to surround {{the city on}} August 21, 634 (the 20th of Jamadi-ul-Akhir, 13 Hijri). The corps commanders were instructed to repel any Byzantine attack from the respective gates, and seeking assistance {{in the case of}} heavy attack. Dharar bin al-Azwar commanded 2.000 horsemen from the mobile guard to patrol in the empty areas between the gates <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> to reinforce any corps attacked by the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E

5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there late <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and {{we came up with}} the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) {{killed off}} all the elms that once {{populated}} the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
