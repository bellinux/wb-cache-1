She says she's really into him, but can't {{be with him}} [...] "right now" [...] because of her boyfriend. The gang sees through her ruse, telling Ted that he's been [...] "hooked," [...] a {{euphemism}} for stringing someone along until they meet someone better.|$|E

60|$|Borrowdean smiled. A certain rough-and-ready humour <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> always {{appealed to}} him. He looked around.|$|E
6000|$|When Bob and {{his father}} were left alone, the miller said, 'Well, Robert, <b>about</b> <b>this</b> young <b>woman</b> of thine--Matilda what's her name?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What chance, Frederic, can she have? She {{knows all}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> horrid <b>woman,</b> and yet refuses {{to give her}} up! What chance can she have after that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How?" [...] asked Demi, {{feeling that}} there was a {{peculiar}} charm <b>about</b> <b>this</b> old <b>woman,</b> and some sort of joke about the cats, because Dan was smiling to himself.|$|R
6000|$|There {{seemed to}} him {{something}} almost unearthly <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> with her soft grey gown and marble face [...] " [...] 111 ...|$|E
60|$|Again I bowed, {{thinking}} to myself that I knew nothing that would please me more, who was eaten up with a devouring curiosity <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It is unimportant," [...] she said. [...] "Nobody understands them, of course, but we {{all look}} as though we did. Something <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> rather reminds me of our hostess." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{recording}} is of Dell {{talking with}} an unknown woman about gossip about them within the church. They talk about Dell’s wife being sick {{and even though}} she was sick, Dell and his wife supported <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> to grow in the church.

60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I couldn’t do it. It {{would kill}} her love for me. And now <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> this Mrs. Cheveley. How can I defend myself against her? You knew her before, Arthur, apparently.|$|E
60|$|Mercedes Higgins sighed cheerfully and for {{the time}} was lost in retrospection. Saxon was curious to hear more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> who must have lived much as the Spanish-Californians {{had lived in the}} old days.|$|E
60|$|From this on {{they had}} a royal good time. Rose grew happier than she had been for weeks. There was {{something}} strangely masterful <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> {{in spite of her}} sweet smile and soft gray eyes.|$|E
5000|$|In Command Centre, Maya {{explains}} that Psychons math {{is different than}} humans base 10 math, and that's why she can make calculations so much simpler than the computer. Koeing notes that, while that may be true, she still needs to convert her answers into Earth math, and with a dismissive look, brings up the conversion formula on the screen for Koenig to read. It is hopelessly complex. Koenig begins to follow Maya out of command center to question her further, but is confronted by a smiling Helena. [...] "You know, Alan's been telling me <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>women</b> on the planet. Beautiful and naked I understand." [...] Koenig could hardly see them, he explains, though Helena is dubious. [...] "Beautiful, naked... and green?" [...] she says. [...] "Green, they were?" [...] he replies, [...] "I didn't really notice that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Reader, I {{would gladly}} make a confidant of {{yourself}} in this matter, {{and tell you}} all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> charming little <b>woman,</b> {{if it were not}} for the fact that she is standing at my elbow at this very minute, causing me to make blots, and telling me not to write nonsense! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Manchmal haben Frauen..." [...] ("Sometimes women have...") {{is a song}} by Die Ärzte. It is the {{eleventh}} track and the second single from their 2000 album Runter mit den Spendierhosen, Unsichtbarer!. It is {{about a man who}} meets a drunken man in a bar who tells him something that's unbelievable for him - sometimes women like a little spanking. The man rushes home and asks his girlfriend <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> The <b>woman</b> starts to beat the man stating that guys like him always deserve some beating.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} we should find out more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> {{especially}} as she seems to be a friend to our people," [...] said the old Boer. [...] "Now, who dares to go and learn the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{probably}} shall, when I {{write my}} reminiscences," [...] she replied. [...] "Tell me <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b> And don't stand about in that restless {{way at the}} other end of the room. Bring a chair close to me--there, close to my side!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trash! But {{the word}} from him in such a letter is simply an {{additional}} insult. And what does he know <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> who has come back? He vouches for her, but what can he know of her? Just what she tells him. He is simply a fool." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{performed}} {{several times}} at Henry Wood's promenade concerts. He wrote: [...] "It {{is difficult to}} express adequately what all musicians felt <b>about</b> <b>this</b> great <b>woman</b> who looked like a queen among pianists - and played like a goddess. The instant she walked onto the platform her steady dignity held her audience who watched with riveted attention while she arranged the long train she habitually wore. Her masculine vigour of tone and touch and her marvellous precision on executing octave passages carried everyone completely away." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} at his loom full half an hour, {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> old <b>woman,</b> when, having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment, he glanced through a window which was in his corner, and saw her still {{looking up at the}} pile of building, lost in admiration. Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet, and of her two long journeys, she was gazing at it, as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to her.|$|R
5000|$|... « Still, I {{am pleased}} to know more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> courageous <b>woman.</b> In my travels, I have looked for her name on the Righteous Gentiles {{memorial}} at Yad Vashem, in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and just recently, on the new Wall of the Righteous in Paris. I think of her often, with affection and gratitude. She {{is no longer a}} vague, anonymous figure in my mind. Her country and the Jewish community have honored her, and honored themselves by doing so. And I take special pride in my heroine.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{a certain}} way. Not that I {{remember}} what the fast-going lady was like; {{but there was something}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> that put me in mind of the other. Vigo was her name; now I recollect it,--a Miss Vigo. It's nine or ten years ago now, and I {{was little more than a}} boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|And it is <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> {{with whom}} he finds no fault, but that she bores him, that our philanthropist writes, “Sum fatigatus et aegrotus”—Sum mortaliter in amore with {{somebody}} else! That fine flower of love, that polyanthus over which Sterne snivelled so many tears, could not last {{for a quarter of}} a century! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she decided, [...] "there is no use denying it. You are hatefully good-looking, {{and somehow}} or other I think your clothes have {{improved}} you. You {{have a little more}} air than when you first came to town. Are you quite sure that you haven't made up your mind <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> in a hurry?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Jenner Brenning, a young rural attorney, {{finds himself}} dumbfounded when proposing to a woman, Irene Marlowe, who has clear {{affections}} for him yet she refuses based upon her belief {{that she is}} insane, and later describes it as more possession than insanity. When asked further <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> the <b>woman</b> explains. Long ago when Irene was in her mother's womb, her parents lived in cabin in a more rustic area with their firstborn, a daughter. The father, Charles Marlowe, was a typical woodsman and regularly {{went out into the}} wild to hunt for food.|$|R
6000|$|Nat Hicks {{stopped the}} Kennicotts {{on their way}} home. Carol hated him for his manner of {{assuming}} that they two had a mysterious understanding. Without quite winking he seemed to wink at her as he gurgled, [...] "What do you folks think <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Mullins <b>woman?</b> I'm not strait-laced, but I tell you we got to have decent women in our schools. D' you know what I heard? They say whatever she may of done afterwards, this Mullins dame took two quarts of whisky to the dance with her, and got stewed before Cy did! Some tank, that wren! Ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|R
5000|$|An old {{king was}} {{accompanied}} by a beautiful and young servant-maid Cecilia, who was the love of his life. Historians still argue <b>about</b> who <b>this</b> mysterious <b>woman</b> really was. Some of them maintain that {{in the last years of}} his life, reaching his seventies - she became his wife. One of the contemporary chronicles mention her as [...] "the queen Cecilia".|$|R
6000|$|... "And so he will, and it'll {{be a great}} {{temptation to}} me to know where I can get it so easily. But {{he was telling me}} all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> before I thought of my own concerns--and I didn't like to be talking to him of what I wanted myself, when he'd been asking a favour of me. It would be too much like looking for payment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{more reason}} I should copy him," [...] said Amyas, setting his lips, {{and trying to}} look desperately determined, and then {{suddenly}} jumping up, he leaped upon Frank, and throwing his arms round his neck, sobbed out, [...] "There, there, now! For God's sake, let us forget all, and think about our mother, and the old house, and how we may win her honor before we die! {{and that will be}} enough to keep our hands full, without fretting <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> and that.--What an ass I have been for years! instead of learning my calling, dreaming about her, and don't know at this minute whether she cares more for me than she does for her father's 'prentices!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will get}} it over as soon as possible, sir," [...] said Pedgift Senior, still persisting, as only lawyers and women can persist, in forcing his way little by little nearer and nearer to his own object. [...] "Let us go back, if you please, to the {{practical}} suggestion which I offered to you when the servant came in with Miss Gwilt's note. There is, I repeat, only one way left for you, Mr. Armadale, out of your present awkward position. You must pursue your inquiries <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> to an end--on the chance (which I consider next to a certainty) that the end will justify you in the estimation of the neighborhood." ...|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, Kingston's {{praise of}} William Carlos Williams expresses her {{appreciation}} of his seemingly genderless work: [...] "I love In the American Grain {{because it does}} the same thing. Abraham Lincoln is a 'mother' of our country. He talks <b>about</b> <b>this</b> wonderful <b>woman</b> walking through the battlefields with her beard and shawl. I find that so freeing, that we don't have to be constrained to being just one ethnic group or one gender-- both and Williams make me feel that I can now write as a man, I can write as a black person, as a white person; I don't have to be restricted by time and physicality." ...|$|R
40|$|S. H. Mosenthal’s {{blockbuster}} drama Deborah, popularized in the English-speaking {{world as}} Leah, The Forsaken, delivered generations of nineteenth-century theatergoers fantasies <b>about</b> Jewish <b>women.</b> <b>This</b> paper explores the rich performance {{history of this}} work, offering {{a new perspective on}} the role of popular culture in launching distinctly liberal forms of philosemitism...|$|R
5000|$|Sara Steward of the New York Post also {{praised the}} film and, despite noting that it [...] "likely won’t {{be seen by}} anyone not {{sympathetic}} to the mission of these four doctors," [...] concluded that [...] "After Tiller is groundbreaking in giving voice {{not only to the}} doctors, but to those who always seem to get overlooked in the high-volume political debate <b>about</b> <b>this</b> topic: the <b>women</b> themselves." ...|$|R
