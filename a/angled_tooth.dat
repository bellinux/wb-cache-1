The root stress in higher pressure <b>angle</b> <b>teeth</b> against unit load decreased {{because of the}} thick root of the tooth.

Analysis was performed using the finite element method with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted {{for a variety of}} gear tooth and rim configurations.

Design maps of tooth/rim fracture modes including effects of gear geometry, applied load, crack size, and material properties were developed. The occurrence of rim fractures significantly increased as the backup ratio (rim thickness divided by tooth height) decreased. The occurrence of rim fractures also increased as the initial crack location was moved down the root of the tooth. Increased rim and web compliance increased the occurrence of rim fractures. For gears with constant pitch radii, coarser-pitch teeth increased the occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures. Also, 25 deg pressure <b>angle</b> <b>teeth</b> had an increased occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures when compared to 20 deg pressure <b>angle</b> <b>teeth.</b> For gears with constant number of teeth or gears with constant diametral pitch, varying size had little or no effect on crack propagation paths...|$|R

40|$|Little {{has been}} {{published}} on the behaviour of polymer gears operating under lubricated conditions. An experimental and analytical programme was undertaken to classify the regimes of EHL under which polymer spur gears operate. In doing so theoretical film thicknesses were calculated and then used to classify the regime according to Johnson's Map. The effects of lubrication on the operating efficiencies of high-performance polymer gears were interpreted and from these results coefficients of friction were derived. In addition to this the effect of tooth geometry was investigated and the beneficial influence of high-pressure <b>angle</b> <b>tooth</b> geometry is demonstrated. At loads typically associated with polymer gears the operating regime is shown to be mixed film lubrication. When high-pressure angle gears were tested at high loads the operating regime became full film lubrication and relatively little tooth flank damage occurred...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES : The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the mandibular angle as a {{reflection}} of the biomechanical forces acting on the mandible and relate it to aging and loss of teeth. METHODS : A total of 717 mandibles of adult individuals were selected from the Pretoria Bone Collection. These mandibles were allocated to dentition subgroups according to their pattern of <b>tooth</b> loss. The <b>angle</b> of the mandible was measured with a mandibulometer. The variation in the mandibular angle was statistically analyzed by age regressions and comparisons between adjusted means of dentition subgroups. RESULTS : Aging per se was not associated with a greater mandibular <b>angle.</b> With limited <b>tooth</b> loss, aging was associated with a smaller mandibular angle in females. Generally the mandibular <b>angle</b> increased with <b>tooth</b> loss and was accentuated when an even occlusion pattern was lost rather than with more extensive tooth loss. A more pronounced increase in mandibular <b>angle</b> with <b>tooth</b> loss was noted in females and individuals of European ancestry. CONCLUSIONS : Tooth loss and not aging is associated with an increase in the mandibular angle. Masculinity and being from African ancestry provided some protection against an increase in the mandibular <b>angle</b> with <b>tooth</b> loss. The accentuated increase in the mandibular angle when an even occlusion pattern was disturbed supports the notion that an uneven loss of teeth was indeed associated with inefficient mastication. The unexpected decrease in angle noted in females with aging but limited tooth loss may be indicative of constructive changes beyond puberty. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|The <b>angled</b> <b>teeth</b> engage more {{gradually}} than do {{spur gear}} teeth, {{causing them to}} run more smoothly and quietly. With parallel helical gears, each pair of teeth first make contact at a single point at {{one side of the}} gear wheel; a moving curve of contact then grows gradually across the tooth face to a maximum, then recedes until the teeth break contact at a single point on the opposite side. In spur gears, teeth suddenly meet at a line contact across their entire width, causing stress and noise. Spur gears make a characteristic whine at high speeds. For this reason spur gears are used in low-speed applications and in situations where noise control is not a problem, and helical gears are used in high-speed applications, large power transmission, or where noise abatement is important. The speed is considered high when the pitch line velocity exceeds 25 m/s.|$|R
40|$|Effective gear designs balance strength, durability, reliability, size, weight, and cost. However, {{unexpected}} gear failures {{may occur}} even with adequate gear tooth design. To design an extremely safe system, the designer must ask {{and address the}} question "What happens when a failure occurs?" With regard to gear-tooth bending fatigue, tooth or rim fractures may occur. For aircraft, a crack that propagated through a rim would be catastrophic, leading to the disengagement of a rotor or propeller, the loss of an aircraft, and possible fatalities. This failure mode should be avoided. However, a crack that propagated through a tooth {{might or might not}} be catastrophic, depending on the design and operating conditions. Also, early warning of this failure mode might be possible because of advances in modern diagnostic systems. An analysis was performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center to develop design guidelines to prevent catastrophic rim fracture failure modes in the event of gear-tooth bending fatigue. The finite element method was used with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted for a variety of gear tooth and rim configurations. The effects of rim and web thicknesses, initial crack locations, and gear-tooth geometry factors such as diametral pitch, number of teeth, pitch radius, and <b>tooth</b> pressure <b>angle</b> were considered.
