Knowing about her past, Jalaja arranges a meeting of Malliswari with Nagaraju {{on the banks of the}} Tungabhadra river at midnight.|$|E

She travels to several additional locations that Poirot does not travel to in the book, such as the engine, the baggage car, and an old shack outside of the snowed in train. Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> research the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> resign. Gibbs {{made clear that}} he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E

Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E

A strike was threatened by Ford if the other demands were not met, to which Durst responded by immediately terminating Ford and the others on the strike committee who accompanied him. Ford and the strike committee refused to collect their pay and exit the ranch, prompting Durst to call Deputy Sheriff Henry Daken <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> arrest the strike leader. No arrests were made owing {{to the lack of}} an arrest warrant.|$|E
25|$|A {{disagreement}} with the King of Meath resulted in Máel Sechnaill withdrawing his support. Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late. To compound Brian's problems, the Norse contingents, led by Sigurd Hlodvirsson, Earl of Orkney and Brodir of the Isle of Man, arrived on Palm Sunday, 18 April. The battle occurred five days later, on Good Friday, 23 April 1014 (898 years before the planned date of the Easter Rising in 1916) {{just north of the}} city of Dublin, at Clontarf.|$|E
25|$|Various anecdotes in Livy's {{history of}} Rome reflect the toga's {{symbolic}} value. In one, the patrician hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, retired from public life and clad (presumably) in tunic or loincloth, is ploughing his field when emissaries of the Senate arrive, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{put on his}} toga. His wife fetches it and he puts it on. Then he is told {{that he has been}} appointed dictator. He promptly heads for Rome. Donning the toga transforms Cincinnatus from rustic, sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless, of impeccable stock and reputation – into Rome's leading politician, eager to serve his country; a top-quality Roman. Rome's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all Rome's great men wore togas, and must always have done so.|$|E

25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 1810, the {{precursors}} {{of the independence}} - Camilo Torres Tenorio, José Acevedo Gómez, José Miguel Pey and Jorge Tadeo Lozano, among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of Francisco José de Caldas. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; {{the precursors}} were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution. They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, Antonio Villavicencio and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in Cartagena de Indias. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had {{to come from the}} Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from doing something about it. Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> allow a Junta to take place: they knew {{that he was going to}} oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something they knew he would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.|$|E
25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this is the face of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to a man on a road in the mountain <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman would turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E

25|$|Karadžić was {{fortunate}} to be a relative of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who {{taught him how to}} read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the Tronoša Monastery in Loznica. As a boy he learned calligraphy there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the First Serbian Uprising seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the gymnasium at Sremski Karlovci, for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, Karadžić left for Petrinja where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he left for Belgrade, {{now in the hands of}} the Revolutionary Serbia, in order to meet the highly respected scholar Dositej Obradović, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for Jadar and began working as a scribe for Jakov Nenadović. After the founding of the Belgrade Higher School, Karadžić became one of its first students.|$|E

He will tell you 'slovenliness' and 'vulgarity.' When these went into the teacher's room they came out, badly damaged.

500|$|They {{decided to}} wait for the next man to come through the gate <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make the decision. That person was 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his prophethood. He asked the elders of the clans to bring him a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to the right spot. [...] Then, Muhammad set the stone in place, {{satisfying}} the honour of all of the clans. After his Conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad is said to have ridden round the Kaaba seven times on his camel, touching the Black Stone with his stick in a gesture of reverence.|$|E

500|$|The future, however, was not {{as simple}} as Balzac wanted to believe. Hańska's family did not approve of the French author; her Aunt Rozalia was {{especially}} disdainful. To make matters worse, her late husband's uncle protested the Hański's will in which she had inherited Hański's estate. Horrified that her daughter would be robbed of everything, Hańska insisted that she must end her relationship with Balzac. [...] "You are free", she wrote to him. As she made plans to protest the uncle's interference in St. Petersburg, Balzac wrote back to offer his help. He suggested that he could become a Russian citizen and [...] "go to the Czar myself <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sanction our marriage". She asked for his patience, which he offered anew.|$|E

500|$|NASA {{administrator}} James Webb {{became increasingly}} worried about Shea's mental state. Specifically, {{he was concerned}} that Shea {{might not be able}} to deal with the hostile questioning that he would receive from the congressional inquiry into the Apollo 1 fire. Senator Walter Mondale had accused NASA engineers of [...] "criminal negligence" [...] with regard to the design and construction of the Apollo command module, and it was reliably expected that Shea would be in the firing line. In March, Webb sent Robert Seamans and Charles Berry, NASA's head physician, to speak with Shea <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take an extended voluntary leave of absence. This would, they hoped, protect him from being called to testify. A press release was already prepared, but Shea refused, threatening to resign rather than take leave. As a compromise, he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness. Yet this approach to removing Shea from his position was also unsuccessful. As one of his friends later recounted: ...|$|E
