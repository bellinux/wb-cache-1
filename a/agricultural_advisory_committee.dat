40|$|This paper {{comprises}} {{a descriptive}} and theoretical {{analysis of the}} organizational representation structure within the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committees</b> of the European Commission. The descriptive analysis is focused on two main structural components: (1) share of seats held by organizations and (2) centrality of anorganization within the AACS. While in the theoretical part these two structural components are combined in one consistent social capital index corresponding to the political influence, an organization could gain from its structural position within the AACS. On {{the basis of the}} introduced social capital concept further analyses regarding the impact of organizational representation structures on political influence of organizations have been undertaken. Main results of the analyses are the following: (1) The overall structure of organizational representation within the AACS is characterized by a high relative and absolute concentration of the seat distribution in favor of the organizations of the agricultural lobby; (2) A cross-national comparison within the agricultural producer category implies {{that as long as the}} number of seats distributed by interest groups is variable, a decentral interest representation through multiple organizations is more effective compared to a central interest representation through one global organization. While a comparison between the different economic categories implies that if the total number of seats held by an interest group is exogenously determined and fixed, a central interest representation through one global organization seems to be more effective in comparison to a decentral interest representation through multiple organizations...|$|R

5000|$|Prosser served six two-year {{terms in}} the {{legislature}} under Governors Stanley K. Hathaway, a fellow Republican, and Edgar Herschler, a Democrat. He was named to these committees: (1) Agriculture, Public Lands and Water Resources, (2) Mines, Minerals, and Industrial Development, (3) Transportation and Highway, and (4) Rules and Procedures. The Department of Environmental Quality was established during his term {{as chairman of the}} Mines and Minerals Committee. [...] In addition, Chairman Prosser worked for passage of the Wyoming Mined Land Reclamation Act and the Industrial Siting Act, both laws being the backbone of state environmental protection legislation. The Mined Land Reclamation Act requires mining companies to restore disturbed areas to their natural state and was a prototype of similar legislation adopted nationally. Prosser sponsored the Wyoming Beef Council Act, which established a checkoff system to collect funds to promote the sale of beef. Representative Prosser also worked successfully to remove the ad valorem tax on livestock, which saves ranchers $6 to $10 per year per head. He also worked to improve brand inspection laws. From his capacity at the Stockgrowers Association, Prosser cautioned ranchers not to overproduce cattle during periods of high prices. Once a downturn in the economy took effect, the ranchers would be unable to make good profits on future sales. [...] "The real culprit is the guy who looks back into the mirror while preparing for your daily shave," [...] Prosser told cattlemen in their annual convention in June 1977. Prosser was the past president of the International Livestock Brand Conference, which coordinated the transfer of cattle across state lines. In 1983, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Northern International Livestock Exposition because of his overall contributions to agriculture. He was a past chairman of the Laramie County (Cheyenne) Fair Board and a past president of his county Farm Bureau. [...] After World War II, Prosser served on the Laramie County Draft Board.

Reagan named Prosser to the National Public Lands Advisory Board. In 1998, he was chosen as a finalist in the field of agriculture for the honor [...] "Wyoming Citizen of the Century".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} perceptions of secondary agricultural education teachers in the United States toward the adult agricultural education organizations affiliated with their programs. A random sample of 367 teachers, stratified proportionally by state, was generated. Data were collected from March through May 1994 using a mail questionnaire. Usable responses were obtained from 244 teachers. Two (n= 96) or one (n= 82) adult organization(s) were commonly affiliated with secondary <b>agricultural</b> education programs. <b>Advisory</b> <b>committees</b> were affiliated with 199 programs, often advising on course content, assessing equipment and facility needs, and evaluating programs. Adult organizational goals that were being met by over 50 % of all types of organizations included assisting the secondary agricultural education program with public relations, promotion, and identifying community resources; supporting FFA youth activities; and assisting young agriculturists to remain in agriculture.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Cooperative work {{experience}} in agricultural education is {{one form of}} supervised occupational experience that provides the student in agriculture with practical application of skills and knowledge {{in one of the}} many agricultural occupations. Cooperative {{work experience}} students are placed with employers in agribusiness service, processing, or in distribution for work experience consistent with their occupational goals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the program structure, program involvement, program planning, and use of available resources of agricultural cooperative work experience programs in Oregon high schools by assessing the existing agricultural cooperative work experience programs. Data collected for this study were obtained by sending questionnaires to all ninety Oregon high schools identified as having reimbursable agricultural programs. Completed questionnaires were received from 65 or 72. 2 percent of the schools and 41 or 63. 1 percent of those schools reported having an agricultural cooperative work experience program. The study revealed that 19 or 46. 3 percent of the schools with cooperative work experience programs in agriculture have a plan for selecting their cooperative work experience students. It was also revealed that 23 or 56. 1 percent of the schools were using a. planned method of selecting cooperative work experience stations less than 50 percent of the time. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>committees</b> were involved in publicizing and promoting the program in 27 or 65. 9 percent of the schools, program evaluation in 26 or 63. 4 percent of the schools, and developing and locating cooperative work experience stations in 28 or 68. 3 percent of the schools.
