5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note {{of the work}} in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E
5|$|These escaped {{slaves were}} able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip {{themselves}} with captured military equipment {{as well as their}} gladiatorial weapons. Sources are somewhat contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|After pushing Max away, Donna finally invites him to {{the club}} to see her perform. When he arrives she {{performs}} a set, speaking about how she is pregnant and planning to have an abortion. Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is one of the nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E

25|$|Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana was {{the last}} {{fatality}} during the Battle at Palmito Ranch, likely making him the final combat death of the entire war, since historians generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the final battle.|$|E
25|$|Health {{insurance}} benefits are an attractive way for employers {{to increase the}} salary of employees as they are nontaxable. As a result, 65% of the non-elderly population and over 90% of the privately insured non-elderly population receives health insurance at the workplace. Additionally, most economists <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> tax shelter increases individual demand for health insurance, leading some to claim that it is {{largely responsible for the}} rise in health care spending.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scientists}} were {{not convinced that}} this species belonged to either Yandusaurus or Agilisaurus, and in 2005, it was once again reassigned, this time to its own newly created genus. It {{is now known as}} Hexinlusaurus multidens (Barrett et al. 2005). Several studies <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> species is slightly more derived than Agilisaurus (Norman et al. 2004; Barrett et al. 2005; Butler 2005). Both Yandusaurus and Hexinlusaurus were also found in the Dashanpu Quarry.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} Chola kings {{for whom}} there is tangible evidence are {{mentioned in the}} Sangam literature. Scholars generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> literature belongs to the second or first few centuries of the common era. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present a connected account {{of the history of}} the period cannot be derived. It records the names of the kings and the princes, and of the poets who extolled them.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October 1835, the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand {{was signed}} by the United Tribes of New Zealand, a loose {{confederation}} of Māori tribes from the far north of New Zealand organised by British resident James Busby. This document recognised Māori independence, and most pākehā academics <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> declaration was abrogated five years later by the Treaty of Waitangi, which ceded the independence (recognised by King William IV of the United Kingdom) of Māori to the British Crown.|$|E
25|$|The main {{impression}} that historians once retained from the Historia focused on Gregory's anecdotes about violence; until recently, historians tended {{to conclude that}} Merovingian Gaul was a chaotic, brutal mess. Recent scholarship has refuted that view. Through more careful readings, scholars have concluded that Gregory's underlying purpose was to highlight the vanity of secular life and contrast it with the miracles of the Saints. Though Gregory conveys political and other messages through the Historia, and these are studied very closely, historians now generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> contrast is the central and ever-present narrative device.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, the Swedish Postal Museum caused {{controversy}} {{by declaring}} the stamp to be a forgery, but after examinations by two different commissions, it was <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was a genuine}} stamp.|$|R
25|$|It {{was once}} common to {{consider}} military applications {{as having been}} the true main reason the Nazis constructed autobahns, but historians now generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was an exaggeration. Foreigners suggested a covert military purpose for the Reichsautobahns as early as 1934, but a 1946 British Intelligence report noted that sections {{that would have been}} militarily useful were not completed and that some completed sections were not apparently used during the war. The project did, however, develop logistical skills and technology that were used for military purposes, notably in the building of the Westwall under Todt's supervision, and it disguised the development of those resources.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Gabriel {{are disproportionately}} large in {{relation}} to the scale of the rooms they occupy. Art historians <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> follows the conventions of both the International Gothic and late Byzantine traditions of the icon by showing saints, especially Mary, in a much larger scale than their surroundings. In this instance their size is probably a device to convey the idea that they are heavenly apparitions who have come momentarily before the donors who are in the lower register. Van Eyck used this conceit most dramatically in his Madonna in the Church, (c. 1438–40) which is likely a panel from a dismantled diptych.|$|E
25|$|La Salle's {{prime focus}} in 1678 was {{building}} Le Griffon. Arriving at Fort Frontenac in late September, he had neither {{the time for}} nor the interest in building a vessel at Fort Frontenac to transport building materials, some {{of which he had}} recently obtained in France, to a site above Niagara Falls where he could build his new ship. Beckwith's conclusion was that he chose one of his existing vessels, one of about ten tons burden, for sending the first group of men to Niagara. Some of La Salle's associates called this vessel a brigantine; others called it a bark. The accounts <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> little vessel played a part in the building of Le Griffon.|$|E
5000|$|By 1781, {{the engine}} {{had been working}} in its reconstructed form for some years. Whatever the {{improvements}} had been, they left Watt and Boulton still <b>agreeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was, [...] "one of the worst engines they had".|$|R

25|$|In response, Brian {{assembled}} {{the forces of}} the Province of Munster with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by Máel Mórda's ally and cousin, Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Together Máel Mórda and Sigtrygg determined to meet Brian's army in battle rather than risk a siege. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the Battle of Glenmama. The Irish annals all <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Sulcoit thirty-two years before, by capturing and sacking the enemy's city.|$|E
500|$|In early August up to 100 men, {{including}} Bucknall, Erskine, Hinde {{and other}} senior officers, {{were removed from}} their positions and reassigned. Historians largely <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was {{a consequence of the}} failure at Villers-Bocage and had been planned since the battle. Daniel Taylor is of the opinion that the battle's outcome simply provided a convenient excuse and that the sackings took place to [...] "demonstrate that the army command was doing something to counteract the poor public opinion of the conduct of the campaign".|$|E
500|$|Suger {{also added}} a two-line Latin {{inscription}} on the chalice mount, known {{only from the}} engraving made by Félibien, which reads: hoc vas Xpe tibi [...] mente dicavit tertius in Francos [...] regmine [...] Karlus. In English, this legend means: [...] "The [...] Charles III, on the French throne, consecrated this vessel for you, Christ, with a [...] mind." [...] Most scholars <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> inscription links it to Charles the Bald, who ruled Western Francia from AD 840–877. Others think it refers to either the Charlemagne who ruled Francia from AD 768–814, or Charles the Simple who also ruled Western Francia from AD 919–23, although these suggestions seem unlikely.|$|E
