40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} {{study was to examine}} the contribution of phonological, morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> to the prediction of reading and spelling in a Greek bi-dialectal setting. The target group (N= 404) consisted of children, aged 6 to 9 years at the start of the project, who learn literacy in Cyprus, where a dialect is spoken in certain contexts but where Standard Modern Greek is also widely used. At present there are few studies with Greek Cypriot children on how phonological, morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> relates to reading and spelling. Because there are no standardised measures of phonological, morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> with Greek Cypriot children, measures of these factors were developed during the pilot study and their internal consistency was assessed. With the larger sample the measures were validated by examining their construct validity. The first wave of data collection showed that morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> make unique contribution to the prediction of reading and spelling in Greek. The second wave of data collection showed that the measures of morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> predicted performance in reading and spelling eight months later, even partialling out grade level, estimation of verbal intelligence and initial scores in reading and spelling. A model with dialect awareness as a mediator between phonological <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> <b>and</b> reading and spelling fitted the data better than a model with phonological or morphological <b>awareness</b> as mediators, <b>and</b> hence, phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> help children to become aware of the differences between their dialect and the standard variety, <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> in turn facilitates reading and spelling. Cross-lagged correlations showed that the more experience children have with reading and spelling, the more likely they are to develop morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness.</b> This study makes theoretical, empirical and practical educational contributions. The established mediational model contributes to the theoretical knowledge of the connection between dialect <b>awareness</b> <b>and</b> phonological <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> <b>and</b> reading and spelling while the {{longitudinal study}} contributes to theory the long term relation of morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> with reading <b>and</b> spelling in Greek. Empirically, the study established the plausibility of a causal link between morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> <b>and</b> reading and spelling, which must be tested in further research using intervention methods. In practice, this study contributes valid measures for assessing morphological <b>and</b> dialect <b>awareness</b> in the Greek Cypriot setting.

5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages <b>and</b> <b>awareness</b> on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding <b>and</b> <b>awareness</b> of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Coulter {{appeared}} as a contestant on the Australian reality television show Celebrity Circus in May 2005, alongside eight other celebrities. The show's task was to train contestants as circus performers. In February 2008, she was a mentor on the third season of the celebrity singing show, It Takes Two, and was partnered with professional golfer and tennis player Scott Draper. Coulter and Draper were the third duo to be eliminated from the competition on 4 March. Later that year, she returned to Australian Idol as a host and reporter alongside James Mathison and Andrew Günsberg. Coulter co-hosted the show for two seasons, and received a nomination at the 2009 Logie Awards for Most Popular New Female Talent. Coulter became a mentor for the first season of The Voice Australia in 2012, and paired up with coach Seal to prepare the contestants in his team for the show's battle rounds. In 2014, Coulter became a contestant on the fourteenth season of Dancing with the Stars Australia and was partnered with professional dancer Jarryd Byrne. She {{made it to the}} grand finale and placed third in the competition. Coulter hosted the television program Life Changing Adventures, which premiered on 7Two on 11 June 2017.

5|$|Of the 314 {{personnel}} aboard Voyager at {{the time}} of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team. A Royal Commission into the events of the collision was held in 1964, and found that while Voyager was primarily at fault for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout <b>and</b> <b>awareness</b> of the larger ship's location, Melbournes bridge crew was also at fault, for failing to alert Voyager and not taking measures to avoid the collision. Robertson was posted to the training base —a move that he and the Australian media saw as tantamount to a demotion—but resigned instead. The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled, and following pressure from the public, media, and politicians, combined with revelations by Voyagers former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This is the only time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident. The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions. Robertson and the other officers of Melbourne were absolved of blame for the incident.|$|E
5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability <b>and</b> <b>awareness</b> made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relative}} contributions of phonological, semantic radical, <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> to Chinese word recognition in deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children. Measures of word recognition, general intelligence, phonological, semantic radical, <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> were administered to 32 DHH and 35 hearing children in Hong Kong. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that tone, semantic radical, <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> made independent contributions to word recognition in DHH children after the effects of age and intelligence were statistically controlled for. Semantic radical <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> was found to explain significantly more variance than tone awareness in predicting word recognition in DHH children. This study has replicated previous evidence regarding the importance of semantic radical <b>and</b> morphological <b>awareness</b> in Chinese word recognition in hearing children and extended its significance to DHH children.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{simultaneously}} examined {{predictors of}} phonological awareness {{within the framework}} of 2 theories: the phonological distinctness hypothesis and the lexical restructuring model.

Method: This cross-sectional quantitative study included a total of 700 participants between 2 and 5 years of age. Participants were identified as being from homes of lower or higher socioeconomic status (SES) based on preschool funding source, and they completed 2 measures of vocabulary, 8 measures of phonological <b>awareness,</b> <b>and</b> 2 measures of speech sound accuracy. Results: Results indicate that SES, age, speech sound accuracy, and vocabulary each contributed unique variance to the prediction of phonological awareness. Age amplified the relations between speech sound accuracy <b>and</b> phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>and</b> between SES <b>and</b> phonological <b>awareness</b> but not between vocabulary <b>and</b> phonological <b>awareness.</b> Conclusion: The current study provides further support for both the phonologica...|$|R
