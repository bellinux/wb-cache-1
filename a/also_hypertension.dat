Among the potential candidate genes, those of the renin-angiotensin system and the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) rank high because of their importance in the atherosclerotic process. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in these genes (the angiotensinogen Met 235 Thr, the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion, the angiotensin II type- 1 receptor A 1166 C, and the eNOS Glu 298 Asp) with the presence or absence of atherosclerotic renovascular disease in 456 consecutive hypertensive patients referred for renal angiography on the suspicion of renovascular hypertension. Nondiseased normotensive (n� 200) and hypertensive (n� 154) patients from a family practice served as external controls. Renal artery disease was present in 30 % of our angiography group. The Asp allele of the eNOS Glu 298 Asp polymorphism was associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis with an odds ratio of 1. 44 (95 % confidence interval 1. 00 to 2. 09) versus hypertensives with angiographically proven patent arteries, of 1. 89 (1. 24 to 2. 87) versus hypertensive family practice controls, and of 2. 09 (1. 29 to 3. 38) versus normotensive family practice controls. However, this allele also differed significantly between patients with patent renal arteries and normotensive and hypertensive controls.

This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} pharmacometric models for biomarkers, side effects and efficacy in order to identify predictors of clinical response in anti-cancer drug therapy. The variability in myelosuppression was characterized in six different cytotoxic anticancer treatments to evaluate a model-based dose individualization approach utilizing neutrophil counts as a biomarker. The estimated impact of inter-occasion variability was relatively low in relation to the inter-individual variability, indicating that myelosuppression is predictable from one treatment course to another. The approach may thereby be useful for dose optimization within an individual. To further study and to identify predictors for the severe side effect febrile neutropenia (FN), the relationship between the shape of the myelosuppression time-course and the probability of FN was characterized. Patients with a rapid decline in neutrophil counts and high drug sensitivity were identified to have a higher probability of developing FN compared with other patients who experience grade 4 neutropenia. Predictors of clinical response in patients receiving sunitinib for the treatment of gastro-intestinal stromal tumor (GIST) were identified by the development of an integrated modeling framework. Drug exposure, biomarkers, tumor dynamics, side effects and overall survival (OS) were linked in a unified structure, and univariate and multivariate exposure variables were tested for their predictive capacities. The soluble biomarker, sVEGFR- 3 and tumor size at start of treatment were found to be promising predictors of overall survival, with decreased sVEGFR- 3 levels and smaller baseline tumor size being predictive of longer OS. <b>Also</b> <b>hypertension</b> and neutropenia was identified as predictors of OS.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational and transversal study, including 298 consecutive patients with echocardiographic diagnosis of AoS. LVH was defined as myocardial mass > 224 g for men and > 162 g for women. Patients were classified as having mild (peak gradient 50 mmHg) AoS and separated into two subgroups: with and without hypertension.

40|$|This letter {{discusses}} the the paper by Ocak et al. The authors {{found that the}} age- and sex-standardized mortality rate (SMR) for pulmonary embolism (PE) was 12. 2 times higher in dialysis patients than in the general population. Such SMR was even {{higher than that of}} myocardial infarction (MI) (11. 0), stroke (8. 4), and other cardiovascular disease (8. 3). The association between the different grade of impaired renal function and MI received important confirmation, and a recent study from our group conducted on a large regional database of hospital admissions found that mortality rates during hospitalization in patients admitted with MI was significantly higher in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with patients without renal dysfunction. On the other hand, the mortality risk for PE in CKD and dialysis patients is not so firmly established. Epidemiological data in this population of patients are very limited, are often based on different codification systems, and originate from different populations (e. g. outpatients or inpatients). We evaluated the effect of renal dysfunction on in-hospital mortality for PE, considering 24, 690 cases of PE recorded in a large regional database from 1999 to 2009. In-hospital mortality for PE was not different in patients without renal dysfunction, with CKD, or ESRD, and was independently associated with age (OR 1. 045), female sex (OR 1. 322), hypertension (OR 1. 096), diabetes mellitus (OR 1. 120), dementia (OR 1. 171), peripheral vascular disease (OR 1. 349) and malignancy (OR 1. 065). In patients hospitalized for PE, age and comorbidity were associated with in-hospital mortality for PE, whereas CKD {{did not appear to be}} an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Therefore, differently from MI patients, we failed to detect significant differences in the prevalence of PE-related death in ESRD and CKD patients compared with patients without renal dysfunction (24. 0 % vs. 23. 6 % vs. 18 %, respectively). There are several differences between the study by Okac et al and our study that may explain the different results. First, the choice of identification codes. Death attributable to PE was defined by ERA-EDTA code 21 in the study by Okac et al, and we utilized the ICD- 9 -CM code 415. 1 to identify all subjects with emergency hospital admissions for PE. Second, in the study by Okac et al older age at the beginning of renal replacement therapy (equal or greater than 85 years) was associated with an increased risk of PE. However, the authors did not include comorbidities in the analysis, and it is likely that these were more prevalent in dialysis patients. In agreement with Okac et al, we found that age, female sex, diabetes mellitus (and <b>also</b> <b>hypertension,</b> dementia, peripheral vascular disease and malignancy) were independently associated with mortality. Of course, a pivotal important difference is that the study by Ocak et al studied age- and sex-mortality in registry ambulatory patients, whereas we focused on in-hospital PE-related death. This may represent a major issue, given that the diagnosis of PE during hemodialysis is difficult, and PE ranks second position, after coronary heart disease (7. 5 % of cases), among necropsy-confirmed causes of out-of-hospital sudden deaths in the general population. Although a reduced renal function undoubtedly represents an important risk factor for increased cardiovascular mortality, we believe that the evaluation of PE mortality in CKD and dialysis patients should consider which type of population is enrolled in the different studies, the evaluation of in-hospital subjects underlines the importance of comorbidities...|$|E
40|$|Hypertension {{has been}} {{associated}} with causing deleterious effects to the cerebrovasculature, which are thought to underlie the formation of white matter lesions (WML) and predispose individuals to age related cognitive decline. In humans hypertension frequently occurs concomitantly with other vascular risk factors making it difficult to ascertain the primary mechanisms of hypertension in isolation. Animal models of hypertension have been used in an aid to establish the mechanisms of hypertension in isolation. To date the knowledge gleaned from animal models has undoubtedly provided an insight as to the role of hypertension and cerebrovasculature remodelling but, these models have limitations such as lack of genetically matched controls and the inability to control the severity of hypertension, restricting the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. All studies within this thesis used the Cyp 1 a 1 Ren 2 inducible hypertensive rat model, induced by dietary addition of Indole- 3 -carbinol (I 3 C), allowing the severity and duration of hypertension to be tightly controlled and compared to genetically matched controls. This thesis set out to address the hypothesis that sustained hypertension will lead to alterations to the structural integrity of the cerebrovasculature and white matter, which will be exacerbated with age and that hypertension will be associated with alterations to gene expression and cognitive function. Initially this thesis sought to investigate the effect of hypertension on the structural integrity of the vasculature in the Cyp 1 a 1 Ren 2 rat model. Firstly, blood pressure in the Cyp 1 a 1 Ren 2 rat model was characterised and {{it was found that the}} dietary addition of I 3 C, caused a sustained level of increased blood pressure in all three cohorts. Cerebrovascular alterations were found to consist of increased eNOS expression in the young brain, which progressed with increased duration of hypertension to vascular morphological alterations of decreased vessel width and a redistribution of tight junction protein claudin- 5. With age, hypertensive vascular alterations consisted of increased eNOS expression and vascular density. Additionally, there was evidence that hypertension caused a vascular inflammatory response in the young and aged brain. Secondly, this thesis investigated the effect of hypertension on gene expression. Overall it was found that hypertension altered genes related to collagen growth factors, ion channels, eNOS related Map-Kinase pathway and inflammatory genes. Thirdly, this thesis sought to investigate the impact of hypertension on the overall structural integrity of the brain and white matter examining neurons, myelin, oligodendrocytes, axons and microglia, in several regions of the young and aged brain. In general, this study found that hypertension did not cause overt structural or myelin alterations in the majority of regions analysed, with only evidence of myelin alterations occurring within the subcortex of hypertensive animals from each of the young cohorts analysed. However, an adverse subcortical inflammatory response was found in hypertensive animals of the young 6 -month cohort and also in hypertensive animals from the aged 4 -month cohort, where the inflammatory response was not exclusive to the subcortex of hypertensive animals but also occurred in multiple white matter tracts. Lastly this thesis chose to examine the effect of hypertension on cognitive function, specifically spatial reference and working memory using the Morris water maze and found no evidence of alterations in the cognitive functions examined. Conclusions The results presented within this thesis demonstrated that hypertension in isolation leads to modest alterations to the integrity of the cerebrovasculature and white matter, with no evidence of alterations to specific cognitive functions examined, demonstrating the importance of studying hypertension in isolation. Additionally, this study highlights the initial hypertensive induced alterations to the cerebrovasculature, such as endothelial signalling, vascular structure and inflammation, providing a window for therapeutic intervention at a time point when there are minimal alterations to the overall structural integrity of the brain. Future studies in this model should concentrate on examining different severities of hypertension and <b>also</b> <b>hypertension</b> concomitantly with other vascular risk factors to try and recapitulate pathological alterations found in humans...|$|E

40|$|Congenital kidney malformations of {{the kidney}} and urinary tract (CAKUT) include a large {{spectrum}} of diseases occurring subsequently to a misdevelopement in kidney development during gestation. The majority of theses diseases are prenatally diagnosed, {{for this reason}} accurate diagnosis is needed for counseling to parents and to decide of the better management at birth. Since 2008, we create a database to establish a cohort of neonates diagnosed with CAKUT to include prospectively pre and postnatal data to improve knowledge in these diseases. CAKUT are the most frequent cause of end stage renal disease during childhood. The wide variability of these pathologies {{is due to the}} complexity of kidney development. CAKUT may be secondary to an anomaly of tissue interaction at an early stage or to a modification of a molecular pathway at different steps of nephrogenesis. Hence, nephrogenesis may lead in the majority of the cases to low renal endowment similarly to what is observed in premature and neonates borne small for age. With the first nephrons, primitive renal function appears and small amount of urine began to be produced at 10 weeks of gestation and increased progressively to reach a mature glomerular filtration rate at the age on one year. Since renal function at birth is immature, its evaluation is chief to discriminate among neonates, those who may present a possible low renal endowment and subsequently an increased risk of renal progression. However in this population, the evaluation of renal function is challenging, because of the difficulty to validate potential renal markers with a gold standard. In these work, we proposed to present a new approach for CAKUT disease with the measure of renal function since birth using Cystatin C (CysC), a renal marker, recognized to be sensible for neonates. Reference interval of Cystatin C for this age is proposed in the literature and we validate in our center a reference interval for CysC in normal term babies. When comparing CysC values of this control group, to neonates from our cohort with kidney malformation, we showed that neonates with bilateral kidney malformation had a statistically CysC increased value compared to the control group. We proposed a cut-off value for Cystatin C, above which it may indicate an increased risk to present impaired renal endowment. The majority of renal and urinary tract malformation will be revealed prenatally and the most frequent presentation is the detection on the ultrasounds of an antenatal pelvic dilatation. Many authors have proposed guidelines for the management at birth of antenatal pelvic dilatation with variable cut-off’s of posterior anterior diameter. These guidelines are important to identify neonates at risk of severe obstruction or who need an imaging evaluation to rule out vesico-ureteral reflux and avoid subsequent infections and renal scars. For the future, the target will be to succeed to delay renal function. With early and multidisciplinary management of these neonates since the last decade, we already noticed a delay in renal function progression, however there is a strong need to identify predictor factors to improve long term prognosis. Indeed renal endowment increased the risk to present renal progression but <b>also</b> <b>hypertension</b> and in adulthood cardio-vascular diseases. For this purpose, we followed, our cohort of neonates with CAKUT, two years after birth to analyzed predictors of renal function progression using CysC and creatinine as markers for renal function. We found that the bilateralism of the renal malformation and or the relative renal function asymmetry detected by the initial scintigraphy were factors of renal progression. Another approach, proposed to decrease renal function progression is to target the treatment of proteinuria with ACE inhibitors. Finally, to accurately assess neonatal renal function, the validation of Cystatin C with a gold standard will be essential. Likewise, neonates with CAKUT, premature and small for age neonates, because of possible impaired renal endowment will benefit of a useful clinical tool for the measure of renal function, often undeerdiagnosed in thie population...|$|E

Overproduction of these molecules causes an increase in the production and release of the catecholamines, leading the cardiovascular system to become elevated in the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure, along with the increase in the heart rate of the individual.|$|R
