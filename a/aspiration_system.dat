25|$|The Sims 2 {{characters}} pass through seven life stages — babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with University), adults, and elders — with eventual death of old age, while babies in The Sims only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The <b>aspiration</b> <b>system</b> (described above) is also new to The Sims 2. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits {{as opposed to}} Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics {{play a major role}} in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.|$|E

50|$|The aim {{of barley}} {{cleaning}} {{is to remove}} foreign matter (straw, chaff, dust and thin corns) found in the incoming grain, leaving only the grain most likely to produce a good malt. Magnets are used to remove metals from the grain, in turn reducing the possibility of sparks, {{which could lead to}} a dust explosion. Rotating and shaking sieves are used to remove unwanted foreign matter either larger (straw and un-threshed ears) or smaller (sand and thin corns) than the normal barley grain. During the sieving process an <b>aspiration</b> <b>system</b> removes the dust and chaff. De-stoners or shaking screens are used to separate small stones from the barley. The stones, which are more dense than the barley, move out the top of the machine and the cleaned barley exits at the bottom. Half corn separators may be used to remove broken kernels. Half kernels need to be removed as only the one half will germinate and produce enzymes. At the end of the cleaning process the grain is weighed to determine the cleaning losses (the difference between the weight of grain received and the weight of the grain after cleaning) and it is transferred to a silo for storage.|$|E

40|$|Since {{circulating}} {{tumor cells}} (CTCs) are tumor cells which {{are found in}} the blood of cancer patients, CTCs are potential tumor markers, so a rapid isolation of CTCs is desirable for clinical applications. In this paper, a three-dimensional polystyrene (PS) microfiber fabric with vacuum <b>aspiration</b> <b>system</b> was developed for capturing CTCs within a short time. Various microfiber fabrics with different diameters were prepared by the electrospinning method and optimized for contact frequency with cells. Vacuum aspiration utilizing these microfiber fabrics could filter all cells within seconds without mechanical damage. The microfiber fabric with immobilized anti-EpCAM antibodies was able to specifically capture MCF- 7 cells that express EpCAM on their surfaces. The specificity of the system was confirmed by monitoring the ability to isolate MCF- 7 cells from a mixture containing CCRF-CEM cells that do not express EpCAM. Furthermore, the selective capture ability of the microfiber was retained even when the microfiber was exposed to the whole blood of pigs spiked with MCF- 7 cells.

40|$|Previous {{approaches}} to search based test data generation {{tend to focus}} on coverage, rather than oracle cost. While there may be an <b>aspiration</b> that <b>systems</b> should have models, checkable specifications and/or contract driven development, this sadly remains an aspiration; in many real cases, system behaviour must be checked by a human. This painstaking checking process forms a significant cost, the oracle cost, which previous work on automated test data generation tends to overlook. One simple way to reduce oracle cost consists of reducing the number of tests generated. In this paper we introduce three algorithms which do this without compromising coverage achieved. We present the results of an empirical study of the effectiveness of the three algorithms on five benchmark programs containing non trivial search spaces for branch coverage. The results indicate that it is, indeed, possible to make reductions in the number of test cases produced by search based testing, without loss of coverage...|$|R
