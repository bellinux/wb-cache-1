25|$|The adidas Golden Ball {{could only}} {{go to one}} of the members of the victorious Ghanaian side, and so it was, with Lamptey taking home a very special {{souvenir}} from his Italian sojourn. Lamptey was the beating heart of a very good side. His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 1843, Prescod {{was one of}} {{two people}} elected from the new {{constituency}} of Bridgetown. This was particularly difficult, as not only had he to overcome the prejudices, he had to work especially hard since it was only people who owned land who could vote. Moreover, this was not a secret ballot. At that time the polling booth was a piece of paper with the names of the candidates shown.

People were disemboweled and torn apart shortly after death and laid out for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> It is speculated that this ritual was a form of dedication to the gods. The type of human sacrifice included victims being hacked in pieces, dismembered, exposed to the elements and carnivores before being deposed in trash. Research showed that one man who was sacrificed was not a native to the Titicaca Basin, leaving room to think that sacrifices were most likely of people originally from other societies.|$|E
25|$|Herod the Great built {{a palace}} within the {{fortress}} of Herodium. Herod himself commissioned a lavish palace {{to be built}} between 23 and 15 BCE atop Herodium for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> The palace itself consisted of four towers of seven stories, a bathhouse, courtyards, a Roman theatre, banquet rooms, a large walkway (“the course”), as well as extravagant living quarters for himself and guests. Once Herod died and the Great Revolt started, Herodium was abandoned. The Jews eventually had a base at Herodium where they built a synagogue which can still be seen today, unlike much of Herod’s Palace.|$|E

After the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Zhou Tai was appointed as {{the commander of the}} garrison at Ruxu, with Xu Sheng and Zhu Ran as his subordinates. However, both of them were unwilling to submit to Zhou Tai's command, citing the latter's humble origins in comparison to their more affluent family backgrounds. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Ruxu and hosted a party for all the officers there, during which he asked Zhou Tai to display his battle scars for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> He later awarded Zhou with an imperial parasol.

25|$|After the 1997 season, Moss {{decided to}} go pro. He {{did not have a}} good offseason. Moss's past issues were laid out for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> and {{questions}} of his character began to rise. Moss was expected to be the most watched contestant of the NFL Combine, but he did not show up. Rumors swirled that the reason for his absence was to avoid the drug test. Moss opted to work out at the Marshall pro day, where scouts from nearly every NFL team came to watch him work out. Moss turned in a legendary performance, running the 40 yard dash in just 4.25 seconds, despite running into the wind. He also posted a 39-inch vertical leap while catching nearly every pass thrown. Scouts for the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 8th overall pick and were greatly interested in Moss, told owner Jerry Jones that Moss was the greatest individual prospect they had ever seen.|$|E

Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} up to them to protect their own privacy.

25|$|Richardson {{was chosen}} to tour Australia in 1897/1898, but this was where his {{successful}} years ended. Richardson was always a heavy drinker, but around this time the habit became unmanageable and his weight began increasing, thus reducing his speed and stamina. He produced one great performance on the disappointing 1897/1898 tour with eight wickets for 94 in the first innings of the fifth Test, {{but as soon as}} he returned to England his decline was plain for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Indeed, in the first two months of the season Richardson accomplished almost no performance of note, and even when he improved from the beginning of July onwards, Surrey could no longer rely on him to bowl over after over on the extremely true Oval pitches; his body could no longer carry the workload of previous years. In a few games late in the season at the Oval, against Yorkshire (when Surrey inflicted that county's biggest defeat) and Warwickshire (when he took a career-best 15 for 83 on a pitch offering no help), he appeared as potent as the bowler of 1897. Nevertheless, his haul of wickets in the County Championship fell from 237 to 126 and their cost from about 14 runs per wicket to over 21.|$|E

25|$|In early August 1836, the vizier of the Herzegovina Eyalet, Ali Pasha Rıdvanoğlu, {{attacked}} Grahovo, a town on Montenegro's northern frontier {{that had}} long been claimed by the Montenegrins. Its Christian inhabitants, still Ali Pasha's feudatories, had refused to pay the haraç, an Ottoman poll tax on non-Muslims. Ali Pasha's forces overran the town, burned {{it to the ground}} and took countless Christians hostage; the rebels appealed to Njegoš for help. As honour demanded, Njegoš sent a force led by his teenaged brother Joko and his nephew Stevan to rescue the hostages while Ali Pasha was in Gacko waiting for reinforcements to address the Montenegrin advance. The Montenegrins had assembled a force of several hundred warriors led by Joko, Stevan and eight Petrović chiefs. They were initially successful in rescuing one of the imprisoned clan leaders and his followers, but were overwhelmed by the combined forces of Ali Pasha, Trebinje's Osman Pasha-beg and the cavalry reinforcements of Smaïl-aga Čengić. The Turks made use of a feigned retreat to lure the Montenegrins into a trap, surrounded them and used reinforcements to cut off their lines of retreat. More than forty of the Montenegrin warriors were hacked to death in the ensuing chaos, including Stevan and all eight Petrović chiefs. Joko was killed by Smaïl-aga himself, and his severed head was impaled on a spike for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Njegoš responded by launching a counter-attack near Grahovo and fought the Ottomans to a standstill. Grahovo's inhabitants fled to the Austrian-held territory on the Adriatic coast, but after being refused sanctuary, they were forced to return to the ruined town, swear an oath of loyalty to the Sultan and beg for forgiveness from the vizier. Consequently, they refused to avenge the deaths of the Petrovićes for fear of Ottoman retaliation.|$|E

500|$|After Joseph Smith's death, the Egyptian {{artifacts}} were in {{the possession}} of his mother, Lucy Mack Smith, and she and her son William Smith continued to exhibit the four mummies and associated papyri to visitors. Two weeks after Lucy's death in May 1856, Smith's widow, Emma Hale Smith Bidamon, her second husband Lewis C. Bidamon, and her son Joseph Smith III, sold [...] "four Egyptian mummies with the records with them" [...] to Abel Combs on May 26, 1856. Combs himself later sold two of the mummies, along with some papyri, to the St. Louis Museum in 1856. Upon the closing of the St. Louis Museum, these artifacts were purchased by Col. John H. Wood and found their way to his museum in Chicago, c. 1863. Wood was particularly proud of these items and had them on display for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> but unfortunately, the museum and all its contents were destroyed in 1871 during the Great Chicago Fire. Today, it is presumed the papyri which formed the basis for Facsimiles 2 and 3 were lost in the inferno.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} at Vanity Fair deteriorated upon management's return. They {{sent out a}} memo forbidding the discussion of salaries {{in an attempt to}} rein in the staff. Benchley, Parker, and Sherwood responded with a memo of their own, followed by placards around their necks detailing their exact salaries for <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Management attempted to issue [...] "tardy slips" [...] for staff who were late. On one of these, Benchley wrote out, in very small handwriting, an elaborate excuse involving a herd of elephants on 44th Street. These issues contributed to a general deterioration of morale in the offices, culminating in Parker's termination, allegedly due to complaints by the producers of the plays she skewered in her theatrical reviews. Upon learning of her termination, Benchley tendered his own resignation. Word of it was published in Time by Alexander Woollcott, who was at a lunch with Benchley, Parker, and others.
