25|$|In January 1933, Adolf Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor of Germany and {{it quickly became}} unsafe for Jewish scientists {{to remain in the}} country. Leó Szilárd fled to London where he proposed, and in 1934 patented, the idea of a nuclear chain reaction via neutrons. The patent also introduced the term critical mass to describe the minimum amount of material required to sustain the chain reaction and its potential to cause an explosion. (British patent 630,726.) He subsequently assigned the patent to the British Admiralty so that it could be covered by the Official Secrets Act. In <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> Szilárd was the father of the atomic bomb academically.|$|E
25|$|A {{remarkable}} tribal leader named Nurhaci (r. 1616–1626), {{starting with}} just a small tribe, rapidly gained control over all the Manchurian tribes. During the Imjin War he offered to lead his tribes {{in support of the}} Ming army. This offer was declined, but he was granted honorific Ming titles for his gesture. Recognizing the weakness in the Ming authority north of their border, he took control over all of the other unrelated tribes surrounding his homeland. In 1610 he broke relations with the Ming court; in 1618 he demanded the Ming pay tribute to him to redress the seven grievances which he documented and sent to the Ming court. This was, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> a declaration of war as the Ming were not about to pay money to the Manchu.|$|E

In 1924, at Pound's request, she welcomed George Antheil into her social circle, procured artwork and books that were sent on to Dorothy and Ezra in Rapallo, and mediated in a dispute between Pound and Lewis. She was uninterested in Pound's politics and economic views and particularly disliked his later Cantos. After her husband's death, Olivia's income was sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle. During the 1920s and 1930s she gradually increased Dorothy's income (which was also increased by various family bequests), and in the 1930s she made investments in Dorothy's name, sending the proceeds to Dorothy and Pound. In <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> according to Harwood, Olivia Shakespear is the [...] "unsung heroine" [...] of the modernist period, {{because much of the}} money Ezra Pound generously used to support struggling writers such as T.S.

5000|$|In {{a seminar}} at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, {{based on an}} {{extensive}} analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr and Alexander Vassiliev confirmed that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviet Union. The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but was never successful; Oppenheimer did not betray the United States. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union. Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev also state Oppenheimer [...] "was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s". According to biographer Ray Monk: [...] "He was, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> practical and <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>a</b> supporter of the Communist Party.

40|$|Death is an {{integral}} part of organizational life, not only in talk and symbolism but also in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> physical <b>sense.</b> Despite numerous examples which illustrate the importance of organizational death as a meaning-making construct, scholars of organization have only rarely treated death as an explicit focus of study. Examples such as those above illustrate the pervasiveness of notions of death in constructing visions of an organization’s past in relation to its present and future. They can be seen as arising from the fact of human mortality and our need to live with constant awareness of it, which in turn gives rise to many aspects of social and cultural organization (Bauman 1992). This includes the possibility that organizations themselves constitute an immortality project that enables us to avoid confronting the inevitability of our own death (Becker 1973). The aim of this special issue is to explore the theme of organizational death in a way which takes into account recent developments in understandings of death which have shifted away from narrowly individualistic framings of dying and bereavement, towards an understanding of organizations and cultures as based on the maintenance of continuing bonds between the dead and the living (Walter 1999). This move away from the sequestration of death from everyday life in the twentieth century (Mellor and Schilling 1993), and its reintegration into various aspects of social and cultural organization in the twenty-first century, is potentially significant in shaping representations meanings and identities in organizations. We argue that there is a need for new perspectives that take account of these theoretical and societal shifts that have fundamentally reshaped lived experience of death and loss in late modern society (Bell and Taylor 2011). This special issue is based on selected contributions to a workshop hosted by the Culture, Organizations and Markets Group at Keele University in 2012. In organizing the workshop, we wanted to bring together scholars with an interest in exploring changes in understanding organizational death, and to start an interdisciplinary research conversation based on analyses and interpretations drawn from a variety of sociological, philosophical, psychological and psychoanalytical perspectives. We also wanted to create a supportive and receptive space within which to explore these issues. Having already approached organizational death in different ways (Bell and Taylor 2011; Hansson and Wigblad 2006; Vaara and Tienari 2008), we were struck by the taboo that continues to surround this theme in organizational research contexts. In bringing together workshop contributors, we found that they, too, had stories to tell about the discomfort that talking about organizational death sometimes provokes and also the particular kind of interest that it generates, for example, amongst academics at conferences. They also talked about the revealing ways in which audiences respond to talk about death, for example, by remaining silent or introducing humour as a way of dealing with discomfort...|$|R

2500|$|Ford {{strongly}} {{felt that}} there were many positive aspects to rural life. [...] At the same time, he recognized that the promise of high wages was encouraging young people to discard the agrarian life of their parents and move to the cities. [...] The spreading of industrialization (due in part, Ford knew, to his very own factory system) was making farming less attractive and giving farmers less to do in the winter. [...] Ford developed the village industries program as a way to bring manufacturing jobs to the countryside, allowing residents to reap the economic advantages without giving up their agricultural heritage. [...] His village industries were intended to strengthen rural communities by providing jobs to unemployed and under-employed local residents, allowing farmers to work in the winter and return to farming in the summer. [...] It was also, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> intended to maintain the bucolic settings and lifestyles that Ford remembered from his boyhood and idealized to some extent.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was with}} the advent of television, however, that George's {{character}} exploded into the biggest drawing card the industry had ever known. With the networks looking for cheap, effective programming to fill its time slots, pro wrestling's glorified action became a genuine hit with the viewing public, as it was the first program of any kind to draw a real profit. Consequently, it was Gorgeous George who brought the sport into the nation's living rooms, as his histrionics and melodramatic behavior made him a larger-than-life figure in American pop-culture. His first television appearance took place on November 11, 1947 (an event that was recently named among the top 100 televised acts of the 20th century by Entertainment Weekly) and he immediately became a national celebrity at the same level of Lucille Ball and Bob Hope (who personally donated hundreds of chic robes for George's collection) while changing the course of the industry forever. No longer was pro wrestling simply about the in-ring action, but George had created a new sense of theatrics and character performance that had not previously existed. Moreover, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> it was Gorgeous George who single-handedly established television as a viable entertainment medium that could potentially reach millions of homes across the country. [...] It is said that George was probably responsible for selling as many television receivers as Milton Berle.|$|E

[...] The [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga" [...] in 1980 {{is one of the most}} notable stories in the title's history. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that [...] "'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities." [...] Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were [...] "almost constantly at war over who the characters were." [...] Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight, Proteus, and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on The X-Men. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] storyline (#141-142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left The X-Men with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, The X-Men was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule, with a steady sales incline that continued long after Byrne left.|$|E

6000|$|And at {{the other}} end of the scale, also, one misses an element. There is no {{territorial}} aristocracy, no aristocracy at all, no throne, no legitimate and acknowledged representative of that upper social structure of leisure, power and State responsibility which in the old European theory of Society was supposed to give significance to the whole. The American community, one cannot too clearly insist, does not correspond to an entire European community at all, but only to the middle masses of it, to the trading and manufacturing class between the dimensions of the magnate and the clerk and skilled artisan. It is the central part of the European organism without either the dreaming head or the subjugated feet. Even the highly feudal slave-holding [...] "county family" [...] traditions of Virginia and the South pass now out of memory. So that in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> the past of the American nation is in Europe, and the settled order of the past is left behind there. This community was, as it were, taken off its roots, clipped of its branches, and brought hither. It began neither serf nor lord, but burgher and farmer; it followed the normal development of the middle class under Progress everywhere and became capitalistic. The huge later immigration has converged upon the great industrial centres and added merely a vast non-servile element of employees to the scheme.|$|E
60|$|Now {{in truth}} this {{particular}} conception of American hopefulness would {{be anything but}} hopeful for America. If the argument really were, as it is still vaguely supposed to be, that America must have a long life before it, because it only started in the eighteenth century, we should find a very fatal answer {{by looking at the}} other political systems that did start in the eighteenth century. The eighteenth century was called the Age of Reason; and there is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> in which the other systems were indeed started in a spirit of reason. But starting from reason has not saved them from ruin. If we survey the Europe of to-day with real clarity and historic comprehension, we shall see that it is precisely the most recent and the most rationalistic creations that have been ruined. The two great States which did most definitely and emphatically deserve to be called modern states were Prussia and Russia. There was no real Prussia before Frederick the Great; no real Russian Empire before Peter the Great. Both those innovators recognised themselves as rationalists bringing a new reason and order into an indeterminate barbarism; and doing for the barbarians what the barbarians could not do for themselves. They did not, like the kings of England or France or Spain or Scotland, inherit a sceptre that was the symbol of a historic and patriotic people. In this sense there was no Russia but only an Emperor of Russia. In this sense Prussia was a kingdom before it was a nation; if it ever was a nation. But anyhow both men were particularly modern in their whole mood and mind. They were modern to the extent of being not only anti-traditional, but almost anti-patriotic. Peter forced the science of the West on Russia to the regret of many Russians. Frederick talked the French of Voltaire and not the German of Luther. The two experiments were entirely in the spirit of Voltairean rationalism; they were built in broad daylight by men who believed in nothing but the light of common day; and already their day is done.|$|E
