5|$|Considered washed-up, the 34-year-old Tittle {{was traded}} to the Giants {{following}} the 1960 season. Over the next four seasons, he won multiple NFL MVP awards, twice set the league single-season record for touchdown passes, and led the Giants to three straight NFL championship games. Although he was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a championship to the team, Tittle's time in New York is regarded among the glory years of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E

Once again, Somervell was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> vital projects on time. The most enduring of these projects was the Pentagon, which is today one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. From 1942 to 1945, Somervell commanded the Army Service Forces, the logistical arm of the United States Army.|$|E

5|$|When one inhales or exhales, {{according}} to verses 4.47–65, the Nadis {{are loaded with}} vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to different stages of breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power is}} variable, and during low wind periods {{it must be}} {{replaced}} by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E

5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was {{a branch of the}} military, this structure could not be used in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the ground station. The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. The ground station needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from Digital Equipment Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, they chose to award the contract to FFI on the condition that they pay for a PDP-8 if they were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a computer themselves.|$|E
5|$|The band {{arrived in}} Japan on 9 August, {{a week before}} the tour started, to a strong reception, and were greeted with gifts and flowers. Birch was not {{confident}} that the recording quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any balance control and that the recorder's size did not appear big enough on sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the end result, concentrating on simply being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a good show. Lord later noticed however that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver.</b>|$|E

5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E
5|$|When Japanese forces {{took control}} of the Indies in 1942, the empire's Dōmei Tsushin news agency {{established}} a branch office in Jakarta. Antara was renamed Yashima on 29May, and it was eventually absorbed by the Dōmei news network three months later. Press activity flourished as Dōmei opened offices in major cities throughout Java. When Indonesia's independence was proclaimed on 17August 1945, Adam Malik obtained a copy of the text and dictated it by telephone to his colleagues at the agency. The resulting news bulletin slipped past Japanese censors and was broadcast throughout Dōmei's newswire network. Dōmei officials attempted to retract the bulletin, but a courier was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a copy of the proclamation using the agency's name to the Hōsō Kanrikyoku radio station in midst of the confusion. Antara assumed control of Dōmei's local network when the Japanese surrendered to Allied forces weeks later and reopened under private management on 3September.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} gray wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{decided that}} the summer 1942 {{campaign}} would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus. The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war, began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe. The Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded {{by the end of}} November in Operation Uranus, Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day. The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.|$|E
5|$|Pescarolo {{started the}} 2003 FIA Sportscar Championship {{season with a}} victory at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Estoril, with Boullion partnering Stéphane Sarrazin in the C60. Like the {{previous}} year, three C60s were entered at the 24 Hours of Le Mans; Courage ran Jonathan Cochet, Jean-Marc Gounon and Stéphan Grégoire in their car, whilst Pescarolo ran Boullion, Sarrazin and Lagorce in one car, with Nicolas Minassian, Soheil Ayari and Hélary in the other. The three C60s finished seventh, eighth and ninth respectively, which equated to fifth, sixth and seventh in the LMP900 category. Pescarolo followed this result {{with a string of}} retirements at the 500 km of Monza, the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Oschersleben and the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Donington. The 1000 km of Spa saw a return to form, as Sarrazin and Lagorce took second, before Pescarolo ended the FIA Sportscar Championship season with a victory at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Nogaro (where Ayari replaced Sarrazin). Despite the mid-season slump, Pescarolo were still <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> Courage second in the SR1 Constructor's Championship. The final race of the C60's season came at the non-championship 1000 km of Le Mans, where Sarrazin, Lagorce and Bourdais took second place.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure to}} deliver to Guadalcanal most of the troops and {{especially}} supplies in the convoy prevented the Japanese from launching another offensive to retake Henderson Field. Thereafter, the Imperial Navy was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the continuing threat from Allied aircraft based at Henderson Field, plus nearby U.S. aircraft carriers, the Japanese had to continue to rely on Tokyo Express warship deliveries to their forces on Guadalcanal. However, these supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who – by 7 December 1942 – were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground and air attacks. On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could be retaken from the Allies, Japan's Imperial General Headquarters—with approval from the Emperor—agreed on 31 December to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of {{a new line of}} defense for the Solomons on New Georgia.|$|E
