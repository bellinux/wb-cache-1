5|$|The UN {{units were}} able to defeat and repel the North Koreans repeatedly, {{including}} through a coordinated offensive across the entire perimeter.

He was given a 30-day jail sentence, however a plea bargain was made whereby the judge ordered him to arrange to give a {{performance}} at Indiana University with the proceeds {{to be given to}} charity. Bissell was also given a $100 fine. After being fired by the ABT (along with Gelsey Kirkland), they were re-hired and celebrated by doing a stash of cocaine they had smuggled in the lining of a ballet slipper.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E

Sagan {{was still on}} top, 49 points ahead of Alberto Contador. Vanmarcke moved up from eighth to fifth, while Stannard moved into tenth place. Tinkoff remained ahead of Team Sky in the team rankings; in the nations' rankings, Australia moved back into the lead, with Belgium moving into second <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> Spain into third.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division {{was heavily}} engaged with the NK 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The {{divisions}} clashes {{centered on the}} town of Yongdok, with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On 5 August, the North Koreans launched their attack, again taking the town from the South Korean forces <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> them south. At 19:30 on 6 August, the South Koreans launched a counteroffensive to retake the hill.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the assault}} of the 2nd New Zealand Division had drawn in both 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, {{with the result}} that there was a wide gap in the Axis lines to the south west. Through this gap Montgomery pushed the {{remainder}} of his armour, breaking the Afrika Korps line <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> westwards into its rear areas and supply lines. By 4 November, the battle was won and Montgomery was entertaining the captured Afrika Korps commander, von Thoma, to dinner in his caravan.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April, the 28th Regiment pushed {{south along}} {{mountain}} roads through Tuzla. The following day it continued on {{as far as}} Stupari. On 25 April, the 27th Regiment advanced south to capture Zvornik. At the same time, the 28th Regiment sent I/28 east towards Vlasenica and II/28 continuing south towards Kladanj, capturing the town on 27 April. Due {{to the level of}} the Drinjača at Kladanj, instead of fording the river <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> east towards Vlasenica, II/28 continued south-east towards Han Pijesak, where they met elements of 7th SS Division advancing north.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by {{resting on the}} breast <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> themselves forward, often {{with the help of}} their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{eventually}} {{were able}} to overwhelm the US forces with sheer numbers, capturing Hwanggan <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> the American units further south. However, the action solidified the 27th Infantry's position as a valuable reserve unit for the US Eighth Army during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. The 27th ditinguished itself in several critical battles, including the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E

The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.|$|E

The valley's name, coined by the Apollo 17 crew, was eventually approved by the International Astronomical Union in 1973.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incomplete}} pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies {{got their first}} big offensive break {{of the second half}}. On a designed play, Taylor scrambled for 31yards, the largest play in the game for the Hokies. Two successful runs by running back Branden Ore followed, earning the Hokies 23more yards <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> the offense deep into Boston College territory. A false-start penalty set the Hokie offense back, but on the next play, quarterback Sean Glennon connected with wide receiver Eddie Royal on a 24-yard strike for a touchdown. The touchdown and extra point were the first points of the second half and gave Virginia Tech a 2316 lead with 6:30 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> north {{in the direction of}} Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E

5|$|Image {{provided}} David Brothers {{to serve}} as the series' editor. Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark wanted to work with a European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.|$|E
5|$|In Saxony, a joint {{force of}} Austrians and Brunswickers {{under the command}} of General Kienmayer was far more successful, {{defeating}} a corps {{under the command of}} General Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the capital, Dresden, <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> back an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had been agreed. The Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.|$|E

He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E
