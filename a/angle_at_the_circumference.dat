Logically we ought to use the word know only of conceptions, and reserve the word believe for perceptions. [...] "I know that the <b>angle</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumference</b> on any diameter of a circle is right," [...] but [...] "I believe that the sun will rise tomorrow." [...] The proof that a breach of routine will not occur for a finite future depends upon the solid experience that we are ignorant only in areas in which, statistically, all constitutions of the unknown are found to be equally probable.|$|E
30|$|Wood is {{anisotropic}} material and wood has very low tension strength in {{perpendicular to the}} grain direction. The flexural load causes bending moment which consists of tension and compression stress. At the same time the local compressive stress below loading block squeezes the tube-shape center-bored round timber like rubber tube. The squeezing force caused tension stress in {{perpendicular to the grain}} at the outer surface and inner surface of the cross section. As a result, the center-bored round timbers were flattened and collapsed. This flattening failure mode is well known in steel pipe design. Under center-point bending stress, a pointing load forms plastic hinges in the steel pipe which are separated by a 90 ° <b>angle</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumference.</b> Because of the plastic hinges, the stress pipe can be flattened. In a tree with a hole inside due to decay, a similar failure mode was observed [24 – 26]. A tree splinters longitudinally at theses points into at least four pieces [25, 27]. The center-bored round timber specimens in this study collapsed similarly as a tress with an inner hole.|$|E

The tool design (tool orthogonal clearance, drill-point angle) and the parameters (feed rate, cutting speed) are varied when drilling. The axial feed force and the spiral angles of the cutting edges can cause damages to the CFRP when circular milling. In this study, the possibilities to reduce those errors by the application of end mills with no spiral <b>angle</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumference</b> cutter and no feed in axial direction are investigated. This milling process requires pre-drilled holes, and the final rivet hole dimension is then machined by circled movements without any motion in axial direction. For this special circular milling process, the tool design (rake angle of the circumference cutters) {{as well as the}} setting parameters (depth of cut, feed rate, cutting speed, up and down milling) are varied. The machining quality of both processes is compared. This is done by measuring the delaminations using an optical microscope. The fiber protrusion are visually identified {{with the help of an}} adapted imageprocessing algorithm. The diameters of the rivet holes are measured on two planes of the hole by a coordinate measuring machine. The cylindricity of the holes is determined using an instrument for roundness measurement...|$|E

This booster {{will be used as}} an injector, which is named as Cooler Injector Synchrotron (CIS), for the {{existing}} IUCFCooler ring. The IUCF CIS will be able to accelerate high-intensity polarized protons or deutrons coming from a RFQ linac from 7 MeV (6 MeV) to 200 MeV (105 MeV). The beam bunch then will be extracted and injected into the Cooler ring for further acceleration. The finalized lattice design for the CIS has four superperiods. Each period is composed of a drift space and a dipole magnet which has 90 # bending angle and 12 # edge <b>angle</b> <b>at</b> both ends. <b>The</b> <b>circumference</b> of <b>the</b> CIS is 17. 364 meters, one fifth of that of the Cooler ring.
