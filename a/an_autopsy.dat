5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate.

Even after <b>an</b> <b>autopsy,</b> Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents in the subway.|$|E

It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest.

5|$|A doctor {{performed}} <b>an</b> <b>autopsy</b> {{and showed}} Eddy her husband's diseased heart, but she responded by giving more interviews about mesmerism. Fraser {{wrote that the}} articles made Eddy a household name, a real-life version of the charismatic and beautiful Verena Tarrant in Henry James's The Bostonians (1885–1886), with her interest in spiritualism, women's rights and the mind cure. Shortly after the death, Eddy moved next door to 571 Columbus Avenue with several students.

Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, <b>an</b> <b>autopsy</b> was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E

Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities.|$|E
5|$|During <b>an</b> <b>autopsy,</b> {{the agents}} {{discover}} that the baby suffocated by inhaling dirt—meaning it was buried alive. Scully suggests that the baby's defects could {{have been caused by}} inbreeding. Mulder insists this would be impossible, since the Peacocks seem to live in an all-male household. Suspecting that the Peacocks have kidnapped and raped a woman, Mulder and Scully investigate their now-abandoned residence and discover blood, scissors, and a shovel on a table. Arrest warrants are issued for the three brothers. In retaliation, the Peacocks break into Sheriff Taylor's house during the night and murder him and his wife.|$|E

Scully later discerns that the substance coating the body was a concentrated digestive enzyme, and that the remains are lacking in body fat.|$|E
