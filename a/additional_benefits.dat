40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-inferiority (NI) {{trials in}} drug {{research}} {{are used to}} demonstrate that a new treatment is not less effective than an active comparator. Since phase IV trials typically aim at informing a clinical decision, {{the value of a}} phase IV non-inferiority trial hinges also on its clinical relevance. In such trials, clinical relevance would refer to the added benefit claims of a specific drug, apart from efficacy, relative to its comparator drug in the trial. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed 41 phase IV trials and extracted information on whether the authors mentioned any <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> beyond the NI (efficacy) claim of the drug and whether the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> was proven in the trial. We checked whether the additional claim was based on descriptions only or on formal statistical analyses. RESULTS: Our results showed that 22 out of the 41 NI trials mentioned <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of the test drug and most of these claims were related to the safety profile. Of all the post-authorization NI trials that claimed <b>additional</b> <b>benefit,</b> 10 out of 22 NI trials used formal statistical analyses to show <b>additional</b> <b>benefit,</b> and only one included a sample size calculation for the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> prior to the trial. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is room for improvement in terms of designing phase IV NI trials with added benefit claims and in proving these additional claims...|$|R

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide <b>additional</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for <b>additional</b> <b>benefits,</b> such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
