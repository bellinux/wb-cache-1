Previous {{studies suggest that}} generating vertical force to support body weight and horizontal forces to brake and propel body mass are the major determinants of the metabolic cost of running. In the present study, we investigated how independently altering body weight and body mass affects the metabolic cost of running. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that reducing body weight would decrease metabolic rate proportionally, and <b>adding</b> <b>mass</b> and weight would increase metabolic rate proportionally. Further, because previous studies show that <b>adding</b> <b>mass</b> alone {{does not affect the}} forces generated on the ground, we hypothesized that <b>adding</b> <b>mass</b> alone would have no substantial effect on metabolic rate.

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} intercoolers, it is common practice to add extra fuel to the intake air (known as [...] "running an engine rich") {{for the sole purpose of}} cooling. The amount of extra fuel varies, but typically reduces the air-fuel ratio to between 11 and 13, instead of the stoichiometric 14.7 (in petrol engines). The extra fuel is not burned (as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction), instead it undergoes a phase change from atomized (liquid) to gas. This phase change absorbs heat, and the <b>added</b> <b>mass</b> of the extra fuel reduces the average thermal energy of the charge and exhaust gas. Even when a catalytic converter is used, the practice of running an engine rich increases exhaust emissions.|$|E
2500|$|A heavyweight car is {{one that}} is {{physically}} heavier than a lightweight car due to its construction. [...] While early cars used wood construction, Pullman switched to heavyweight riveted steel construction in 1910, more or less {{at the same time as}} other rail car manufacturers. [...] Heavyweights are said to offer a more luxurious ride due to their <b>added</b> <b>mass</b> (from the plate steel construction and concrete floor) and, usually, six-wheeled trucks (bogies). [...] The stepped roof line of early heavyweights usually consisted of a center sill section (the clerestory) that ran the length of the car and extended above the roof sides by as much as a foot. [...] This section of the roof usually had windows or shutters that could be opened for ventilation while the train was in motion. [...] However, railroad crews and passengers quickly discovered that when these windows were opened on a passenger train pulled by one or more steam locomotives, smoke and soot from the locomotives tended to drift in through the windows, especially when the train went through a tunnel.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to answer the {{question}} whether adaptations to local perturbations are restricted to the perturbed limb or whether they induce a reorganization of all co-moving limbs. Specifically, we studied the adaptations in arm movements to mass perturbations in seven healthy adults during walking on a treadmill. Four different perturbation conditions were employed in random order (no perturbation, <b>mass</b> <b>added</b> to both wrists, to the right wrist, and to the right ankle). During each experimental condition ten different belt speeds (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5, 4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0 km/h) were successively offered, while the ann movements and the electromyographic activity of the musculus deltoid posterior and anterior were measured. The results indicated that cadence was not affected by <b>adding</b> <b>mass</b> to the wrist or ankle. However, <b>adding</b> <b>mass</b> to a wrist not only resulted in an increase in muscle activity and a decrease of movement amplitude of the perturbed arm, but also in alterations in the non-perturbed arm. Notably, <b>adding</b> <b>mass</b> to one ankle induced adaptive changes in both arms, in that both muscle activity and arm movement increased. The present results indicate that during walking the loading of one of the limbs induces a general reorganization, involving all participating bodily segments, presumably to maintain balance while providing rhythm constancy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHuman {{physiological}} hand tremor has a resonant component. Proof {{of this is}} {{that its}} frequency can be modified by <b>adding</b> <b>mass.</b> However, <b>adding</b> <b>mass</b> also increases the load which must be supported. The necessary force requires muscular contraction which will change motor output and is likely to increase limb stiffness.

Using a human centrifuge to increase head-to-foot gravitational field strength, we were able to control for the increased effort by increasing force without changing mass. This revealed that the peak frequency of human hand tremor is 99 % predictable {{on the basis of a}} resonant mechanism.

As a result, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) As the land width becomes shorter or the helix angle decreases, the cross-coupling stiffness, direct and cross-coupling damping, and <b>add</b> <b>mass</b> coefficients decrease; (2) As the axial Reynolds number increases, the stiffness and damping coefficients increase. But the <b>add</b> <b>mass</b> coefficient is not influenced by the axial Reynolds number; (3) The rotational Reynolds number influences greatly the direct and cross-coupling stiffness and direct damping coefficients; and (4) As the journal rotating frequency increases, the leakage flow decreases.
