5|$|The {{landing craft}} used {{included}} twelve <b>actual</b> <b>World</b> War II examples, 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs, standing {{in for the}} British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord. The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect {{of blood in the}} seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in operating condition. The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional, Soviet T-34 tanks. The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers. One was created for the film using the chassis of a Czech-built Panzer 38(t) tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m/43 assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.|$|E

25|$|The lone {{ammonium}} molecule problem {{provides a}} problem for Jackson's solution to epiphenomenal ectoplasm. It was proposed by Jaegwon Kim in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson's idea of supervenience, a possible world W was identical to the <b>actual</b> <b>world,</b> except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn's rings. This may not seem to provide much of a problem, but because Jackson's solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of W to be vastly different from in the <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b> If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, {{it would not be}} consistent with our understanding of physicalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the <b>actual</b> <b>world</b> {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{has some}} similarity to modal realism in philosophy, {{which is the}} view that the possible worlds used to interpret modal claims exist and are of a kind with the <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b> Unlike the possible worlds of philosophy, however, in quantum mechanics counterfactual alternatives can influence the results of experiments, as in the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing problem or the Quantum Zeno effect.

500|$|Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a {{world can}} be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures {{complete}} the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b> In other words, each such possible world contains a world segment, meaning everything about that world up {{to the point where the}} person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the <b>actual</b> <b>world,</b> the person would instead go wrong in completing that world.

Science is a way of [...] "observ the world, mak educated guesses about how it works and conduct expierments [...] in order to confirm or disprove our ideas about the world. [...] Science requires that we be rational, that we try to actively understand the world, and to take steps to verify our understanding." [...] In this sense, it is the ultimately responsible perspective. Magic, on the other hand, is [...] "the metaphysics of immaturity" [...] because it does not require understanding the reality of the <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b> Magic, according to Karavitis, is therefore an irresponsible perspective to take.|$|E

My choice of references is not entirely arbitrary: their basic approach shows certain similarities that underline the shortcomings of both in dealing with literature, in spite of the stimulating arguments they unfold.

2500|$|The {{problem of}} {{necessary}} beings was proposed by Jackson in 1998, {{in which he}} stated that a necessary being exists in all possible worlds as a non-physical entity, and therefore proves physicalism false.

50|$|Possible worlds {{theory in}} {{literary}} studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that {{are created by}} fictional texts, fictional universe. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is {{a specific type of}} possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of <b>actual</b> <b>worlds</b> (<b>actual</b> events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time. Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy {{in much the same way}} as the actual universe.|$|R
2500|$|Epiphenomenal ectoplasm was {{proposed}} by Horgan and Lewis in 1983, {{in which they}} stated, a possible world (a world that could possibly exist) W is identical to our world {{in the distribution of}} all mental and physical characteristics (i.e. they are identical), except world W contains an experience called epiphenomenal ectoplasm that does not causally interact with that world. If supervenience physicalism is true, then such a world could not exist because a physical duplicate of the <b>actual</b> <b>world</b> (the world that is known to exist) could not possess an epiphenomenal ectoplasm. This was rectified by Frank Jackson, by adjusting the application of supervenience within physicalism to state [...] "Physicalism is true at a possible world W if and only if any world which is a minimal physical duplicate (i.e. identical) of W is a duplicate of W simpliciter." ...|$|E

[...] Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. [...] "What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them." [...] As Shelly Kagan says, [...] "Given the parameters of the <b>actual</b> <b>world,</b> {{there is no question that}} …(maximally)… promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity…a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed." ...|$|E

In addition the epic includes the themes of death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance, self-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. Tolkien mentions the Lord's Prayer, especially the line [...] "And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil" [...] in connection with Frodo's struggles against {{the power of the}} One Ring.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{argue that}} the view {{developed}} by Nelson Goodman, known as “irrealism,” is a coherent position distinct from the standard conceptions of both realism and idealism. However, a careful examination of his central argument for irrealism shows that, at best, there is much work left to do in defending the position. ^ Special effort is made to clarify Goodman 2 ̆ 7 s use of such terms as ‘version’, ‘world’, and ‘rightness’, while also taking seriously several of Goodman 2 ̆ 7 s crucial claims, including the claims {{that there are many}} <b>actual</b> <b>worlds</b> and that we “make” such worlds. On the interpretation developed (Chapters 1 and 2), irrealism is distinct from realism and idealism. On the one hand, it rejects the notion of a unique independent world along with the idea that one system of representation is preeminent and all inclusive. On the other hand, it gives no neutral world a role in “underpinning” representational systems (or versions), but <b>actual</b> <b>worlds</b> are belief-constraining; since versions must meet requirements of rightness, a complete relativism to representational system is avoided. ^ Goodman 2 ̆ 7 s central argument rests on the following crucial assumptions: (1) There are alternative ostensibly conflicting versions that present good and equal claims to truth. (2) There is no unique independent world. (3) While some cases of alternative ostensibly conflicting versions may be reconciled by relegation to different parts or subclasses of the same world or by relativization to a representational system or by relativization to a frame of reference, there exist some cases (at least one such case) which cannot be so reconciled and there are no other ways to reconcile them. I discuss these assumptions in detail (Chapters 3 – 5). Issues arise for Goodman 2 ̆ 7 s support of each assumption. Since irrealism is a coherent position, but Goodman 2 ̆ 7 s support for it inadequate, I conclude that much work remains in defending the position. ...|$|R
