25|$|Answers {{are worth}} one point {{for every person}} in the 100-member survey who gave them. The winning family in each round scores the total points for all {{revealed}} <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal (if applicable). The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value. The first family to score 300 points wins the game and advances to the Fast Money bonus round for a chance to win a cash bonus. Until 1992, both teams received $1 per point scored.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dimension}} of Euclidean -space is [...] When trying to generalize to {{other types of}} spaces, one is faced with the question [...] "what makes [...] -dimensional?" [...] One answer is that to cover a fixed ball in [...] by small balls of radius , one needs {{on the order of}} [...] such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the Minkowski dimension and its more sophisticated variant, the Hausdorff dimension, but there are also other <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question. For example, the boundary of a ball in [...] looks locally like [...] and this leads to the notion of the inductive dimension. While these notions agree on , they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.|$|E

6000|$|... "First," [...] said Stephen, [...] "was the Declaration. The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> was the Plea. The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> was the Replication. Then {{came the}} Rejoinder, then the Surrejoinder, then the Rebutter, then the Surrebutter. But they rarely got that far," [...] he added unwisely.|$|R

The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question is yes. Should there be another referendum? I believe the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question is no." ...|$|R
60|$|Except for the conclusion, and {{the absence}} of a mystic bright light in the bedroom, this case exactly <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Miss Lee, in 1662. Dr. Hibbert would have liked this example.|$|E
60|$|I {{got tired}} of inventing new <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{question}}, and by and by I got horribly tired of the question itself. Whoever asked it became my enemy at once, and I was usually almost eager to make that appear.|$|E
60|$|What {{are they}} indeed, my friends? You will find many <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, in this, {{as in all}} ages: but the one which Scripture gives is this. Life is none other, {{according}} to the Scripture, than God Himself, Jesus Christ our Lord, who bestows on man His own Spirit, to form in him His own character, which is the character of God.|$|E

6000|$|Interposed, however, {{between the}} {{nomination}} of the Apostles and a visit to Capernaum; occupying, therefore, a place which <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the [...] "Sermon on the Mount" [...] in the first gospel, there is, in the third gospel, a discourse which is as closely similar to the [...] "Sermon on the Mount," [...] in some particulars, as it is widely unlike it in others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrong again," [...] I retorted. [...] "I have a {{plan for}} letting chance decide which of the stories the first one shall be. They shall be all {{numbered}} as they are done; corresponding numbers shall be written inside folded pieces of card and well mixed together; you shall pick out any one card you like; you shall declare the number written within; and, good or bad, the story that <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> number shall be the story that is read. Is that fair?" ...|$|E
60|$|There are two {{possible}} <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, and I {{am sure that}} very many well-meaning people would make the wrong one. They would answer POVERTY, when they ought to answer SLAVERY. Face to face every day with the shameful contrasts of riches and destitution, high dividends and low wages, and painfully conscious of the futility of trying to adjust the balance by means of charity, private or public, they would answer unhesitatingly that they stand for the ABOLITION OF POVERTY.|$|E
60|$|There was no <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question: in Magdalen's position, {{there was}} {{literally}} no <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> {{it on her}} side. She was silent.|$|R
60|$|Under this girl's calm quizzical glance, Courtier endeavoured <b>to</b> find an <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question.|$|R

60|$|Neither Barnet nor his companions, it is clear, had any {{assurance}} {{in their}} <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question. Already {{once in the}} history of mankind, in America, before its discovery by the whites, an organised civilisation had given way to a mere cult of warfare, specialised and cruel, and it seemed for a time to many a thoughtful man as if the whole world was but to repeat on a larger scale this ascendancy of the warrior, this triumph of the destructive instincts of the race.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is O'Connell's house;" [...] {{and a warm}} dispute ensues {{whether a}} large mansion, with a stone chapel by it, <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> name. At all events the region looks desolate enough, {{and they say the}} natives of it are almost savages. A {{passenger}} remarks, that [...] "O'Connell never really did any thing for the Irish, but lived on his capacity for exciting their enthusiasm." [...] Thereupon another expresses great contempt for the Irish who could be so taken in. Nevertheless, the capability of a disinterested enthusiasm is, on the whole, a nobler property of a human being than a shrewd self-interest. I like the Irish all the better for it.|$|E
60|$|Full-sized {{specimens}} of this animalcule attain {{a length of}} between 1/300 or 1/400 of an inch, so {{that it may have}} ten times the length and a thousand times the mass of a Heteromita. In shape, it is not altogether unlike Heteromita. The small end, however, is not produced into one long cilium, but the general surface of the body is covered with small actively vibrating ciliary organs, which are only longest at the small end. At the point which <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> from which the two cilia arise in Heteromita, there is a conical depression, the mouth; and, in young specimens, a tapering filament, which reminds one of the posterior cilium of Heteromita, projects from this region.|$|E
60|$|There {{could be}} but one <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question. Ferris {{must have come}} to see Hardwick.|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{wholesome}} influences had preserved me, so far, from moral contamination by the vile {{blood that}} ran in my veins? There were two <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question which, in some degree, quieted my mind. In the first place, resembling my good mother physically, I might hope to have resembled her morally. In the second place, the happy accidents of my career had preserved me from temptation, at more than one critical period of my life. On the other hand, in the ordinary course of nature, not one half of that life had yet elapsed. What trials might the future have in store for me? and what protection against them would {{the better part of}} my nature be powerful enough to afford? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is something, at any rate, George," [...] he went on, {{as the man}} was rowed away. [...] "The whole {{proceeding}} is a {{very strange}} one, {{and you see the}} description of the man with Carthew exactly <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the man who found out from the boat's crew that Dr. Maddison was attending Lady Greendale; and now you see that {{it is quite possible that}} the Phantom is somewhere near, or was somewhere near yesterday afternoon. Carthew may have hired a foreign crew, and sailed in her a couple of days after her own crew came over; or he may have hired another craft either abroad or here. At any rate, there is something to do. I will go up to town by the midday train, and then down to Dover, and cross to Ostend tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{must turn}} to my more {{personal}} affairs. After all, {{it is impossible}} for a man to satisfy his soul, if he has anything of the sort about him which in the remotest degree <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> description, with the husks of wealth, luxury and indolence, supplemented by occasional theological and other arguments between his friends; Becoming profoundly convinced of this truth, I searched round for something to do and, like Noah's dove on the waste of waters, found nothing. Then I asked Bickley and Bastin for their opinions as to my best future course. Bickley proved a barren draw. He rubbed his nose and feebly suggested that I might go in for [...] "research work," [...] which, of course, only represented his own ambitions. I asked him indignantly how I could do such a thing without any scientific qualifications whatever. He admitted the difficulty, but replied that I might endow others who had the qualifications.|$|E
60|$|LATTER. If a man wrongs a woman, {{he ought}} to right her again. There's no <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R

60|$|Those {{words were}} decisive. It is hardly too much <b>to</b> say <b>that</b> Blanche's future {{depended}} on Blanche's <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{great point}} is," [...] Mr. Playford {{said to the}} midshipmen after a long talk with the prisoner, [...] "that at {{starting}} they generally hung about these islands, Guadeloupe, St. Lucia, and so on, for some time, and it was considered their best cruising ground, though also the most dangerous one, as we have always some cruisers in those waters. That would certainly place the island somewhere off the north coast of Caracas. He declared that the first day out they generally passed the western point of an island of considerable size with some high hills. The only island that <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> account is, as {{you see in the}} chart, Margarita. Therefore I feel convinced that the pirate hold is in one of these groups, off Caracas, either Chimana, Borrshcha, or these two islets called Piritu Islands. Altogether, you see, there are over a dozen of these islands scattered along near the mainland.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} spoke of this," [...] he replied gravely. [...] "I {{have arrived at}} many <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> difficulty--which did not give me the trouble I had anticipated. In the first place, I am {{convinced}} that {{it was much more}} of a difficulty ten, twenty, thirty years ago than it is to-day. That which I formerly thought was a radical tendency towards atrophy, the drift of the liberal party in my own Church and others, as well as that which I looked upon with some abhorrence as the free-thinking speculation of many modern writers, I have now come to see is reconstruction. The results of this teaching of religion in modern terms are already becoming apparent, and some persons are already beginning to see that the Creeds express certain elemental truths in frankly archaic language. All this should be explained in the churches and the Sunday schools,--is, in fact, being explained in some, and also in books for popular reading by clergymen of my own Church, both here and in England. We have got past the critical age." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{then told}} him of the message you had {{received}} from my brother [Elibank] and the other leading men of the party, in that country, that not a man of consequence would stir unless the debarkment was made {{at the same time}} in England, and that every person who pretended the contrary, ought to be regarded as the enemy of your R.H. as well as of France. He then told me that in case you did not choose to go with Mr. de Guillion that it would be necessary to send one with a declaration in your name; I told him I could make no <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> proposition, as I had never heard you talk of declarations of any sort before you was landed in England, and that you had settled all that matter, with your friends in England and Scotland. He assured me that the intentions of the King and his Ministers were unalterable as to their fixed resolution to serve you, but that they met with difficulties in regard to the transports and flat-bottomed boats which retarded the affair longer than they imagined, and that though they had already spent twenty four million every thing was not yet ready.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must refer you,' {{returned}} Mr Barnacle, {{ringing the}} bell, 'to the Department itself {{for a formal}} <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> inquiry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, because there's nobody with me!' cried Humpty Dumpty. 'Did {{you think}} I didn't know the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>THAT?</b> Ask another.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly," [...] said he, [...] "my <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> must {{depend on}} thine <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this--Am I {{supposed}} to have my back against a cliff, or {{to be surrounded by}} the ten?" ...|$|R
