5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, <b>as</b> <b>Chris</b> Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E

5|$|Historically the {{constituency}} covered {{only the}} city of Bath, however it was enlarged into some outlying areas between 1997 and 2010. The constituency since 2010 once again covers exactly {{the city of}} Bath (it is co-extensive with the unparished area), and is currently represented by Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse who beat Conservative Ben Howlett at the 2017 general election. Howlett had replaced the retiring Liberal Democrat Don Foster at the 2015 general election. Foster's election was a notable result of the 1992 general election, <b>as</b> <b>Chris</b> Patten, the previous Member (and Cabinet Minister) played a major part, as Chairman of the Conservative Party, in re-electing the government of John Major, but failed to defend his marginal seat.|$|E

5|$|The king's {{disintegrating}} {{authority over}} his army was also {{manifested in the}} invasion of Frankish Burgundy which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following Mummolus' victory at Embrun. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and {{opening the door to}} an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by Guntram in about 571. Alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually {{have been involved in the}} offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of Austrasia, Sigebert I. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such <b>as</b> <b>Chris</b> Wickham.|$|E

5|$|Stevenage {{started the}} season poorly, losing 3 {{out of their}} first 4 games and conceding 13 goals in the process, {{including}} a 5–0 loss to Wrexham {{on the first day}} of the season. The club secured its first victory under Westley in late August 2008, a 3–1 win away at Barrow, before winning four games on the bounce in September. However, through the first half of the club's 2008–09 campaign, Westley's side were suffering from the same inconsistency that was common in his first spell as manager of the Hertfordshire side, losing three games on the trot in November – the last of which was a 2–1 home defeat to Wrexham, it was to be Stevenage's last defeat at Broadhall Way in the league for 18 months. Westley brought in former player, Dino Maamria as first-team coach at the club. This, coupled with important signings during the campaign, such <b>as</b> <b>Chris</b> Day, Mark Roberts, and Jon Ashton, meant that Stevenage witnessed an up-turn in form halfway through the campaign. A 24-game unbeaten run stretching from December 2008 to April 2009, as well as winning crucial games towards the latter stages of the season, ultimately meant that Westley's men made the Conference Premier play-offs, finishing in the last play-off place. Despite taking a 3–1 lead into the second leg, Stevenage lost 4–3 overall on aggregate to Cambridge United. Westley did, however, enjoy success in the FA Trophy when he led the side out at Wembley Stadium in front of 27,102 as Stevenage beat York City 2–0 in the Final. The win was Westley's first taste of success as manager of Stevenage. After the game, it was announced that Westley was to stay on as manager for another year.|$|E
5|$|During a {{night out}} in {{the one of the}} Zones – the cordoned off zone of {{decaying}} ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. <b>As</b> <b>Chris</b> becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well <b>as</b> <b>Chris</b> Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A quarter of an hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E
