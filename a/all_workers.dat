5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of <b>all</b> <b>workers</b> by ten percent. One hundred miles would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{full control}} over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized. While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps. The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent <b>all</b> <b>workers,</b> administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of national socialism {{in the spirit of}} Hitler's Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community").|$|E
5|$|Haywood was an {{advocate}} of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing <b>all</b> <b>workers</b> in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level; this was {{in contrast to the}} craft unions that were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL. His belief that workers of all ethnicities should be united also clashed with many unions. His preference for direct action over political tactics alienated him from the Socialist Party leadership and contributed to his recall from the party's executive committee in 1913.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to requesting international aid, the Yemen government declared Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates as disaster areas, after then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh surveyed the affected areas. The president also utilized the nation's military to assist storm victims, and sent aircraft with tents, food, and medicine {{to the worst}} hit areas. To {{raise money for the}} disaster recovery, the Yemeni government cut one day of salary for <b>all</b> <b>workers,</b> equating to $4.25million, and the government provided another $100million from its annual budget. Local charities and residents collectively raised $8.5million. Yemen's Red Cross provided meals and water to about 21,000people. The agency also provided school kits for 4,500students whose facilities were damaged. Ultimately, the Red Cross assisted over 70,000storm victims through health programs, and also helped residents cope with stress, hygiene promotion, and other ongoing vulnerabilities to their livelihoods.|$|E
5|$|On November 7, Ralston {{called a}} meeting with company and union leaders to begin {{negotiations}} to resolve the strike. The temporary solution was that <b>all</b> <b>workers</b> {{who had not been}} involved in violence could return to work, the company would raise wages by five percent, recognize the union, guarantee a minimum weekly salary, and Thorpe and national union leaders would immediately leave the state. The union and company agreed to later submit all grievances to the Indiana Public Service Commission for arbitration, and agreed that their decisions would be final. The arrangement was submitted to a workers' vote and was approved unanimously; the strike ended at 6:00 pm.|$|E
5|$|Players build a {{space station}} on a flat plane using tetromino-shaped floors that {{represent}} rooms. Rectangular workers generate the resources to build more spaces by working in these rooms. The workers occasionally must defend the base against attackers, who come in waves of increasing difficulty. The player can have the workers research four TMA-1-style monoliths for additional shield, speed, and generator upgrades. Rooms are used for special purposes: mineral mining (extractors), growing food (gardens), cooking it (kitchens), making workers (quarters), and creating power (reactors). The goal is to flourish and protect the station's inhabitants, but there are three concrete objectives: research all four monoliths, survive 28 waves, and research all monoliths in under 45 minutes. The game ends if <b>all</b> <b>workers</b> are killed. There is a tutorial, but no story. The player is not specifically told about the endgame goals.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement (NHIS-OHS) {{identified}} work organization {{factors and}} occupational psychosocial and chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks. Among <b>all</b> U.S. <b>workers</b> {{in the construction}} sector, 44% had non-standard work arrangements (were not regular permanent employees) compared to 19% of <b>all</b> U.S. <b>workers,</b> 15% had temporary employment compared to 7% of <b>all</b> U.S. <b>workers,</b> and 55% experienced job insecurity compared to 32% of <b>all</b> U.S. <b>workers.</b> Prevalence rates for exposure to physical/chemical hazards were especially high for the construction sector. Among nonsmoking workers, 24% of construction workers were exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10% of <b>all</b> U.S. <b>workers</b> were exposed. Other physical/chemical hazards with high prevalence rates {{in the construction industry}} were frequently working outdoors (73%) and frequent exposure to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes (51%).|$|R

5|$|The {{people of}} Navenby enjoy a high {{employment}} rate, although most {{work outside the}} village. Almost 600 commute each day, with the average journey to work being 12.5miles (20.18km). The 2001 census revealed that of 1,186people questioned aged 16–74, 722 were economically active, with men working an average of 44.8hours each week and women an average of 31.2. The service industry was the largest sector of the local economy, employing 67% of <b>all</b> <b>workers,</b> compared to 1841 when 48% worked in agriculture. Manufacturing work {{was carried out by}} 178people in 2001 and 565 were in the service industries. Of these workers, 371 were classed as managerial and professional. In 1841, just 16.6% of male workers had middle class jobs, but the 2001 census showed this figure had increased to 47.9%.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to <b>all</b> <b>workers.</b> There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} a colony {{only has a}} single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by <b>all</b> <b>workers</b> birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E
