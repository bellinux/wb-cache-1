At one time he was a Protestant declared; not without reasons of various kinds. The Duchy of Geldern (what we call GUELDERS) had fallen to him, by express bequest of the last Owner, whose Line was out; and Wilhelm took possession. But the Kaiser Karl V. quite refused to let him keep possession.

This paper studies nanoparticle fluidization by using adhesive CFD-DEM (Discrete Element Model) simulation, which includes an adhesive contact model having the ability to model the contact and bounce/stick between elastic-plastic and cohesive particles. The discrete elements represent the simple <b>agglomerates</b> of nanoparticles. The effects of particle density, fluidizing gas velocity, and van der Waals force on gas-solid flow and <b>agglomerate</b> behaviors are investigated. It is shown that the particles, representing simple <b>agglomerates,</b> form large <b>agglomerates</b> during fluidized process. As the <b>agglomerates</b> move around in the bed, they continuously break and recombine. The solid movement is evaluated by a dispersion coefficient and it decreases with increase in cohesion. By monitoring the evolution of contacts, the <b>agglomerate</b> breakage is visualized and compared for the different conditions. Increasing fluidizing gas velocity and reducing particle adhesion both increase <b>agglomerate</b> breakage rate. The structure parameters of <b>agglomerates</b> are further analyzed: averaged coordination number of <b>agglomerates</b> around 3. 0, packing fraction around 0. 2 – 0. 3, and fractal dimension around 1. 9 – 2. 3, {{which can be used}} to indicate structures and formation mechanisms of <b>agglomerates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Wet {{agglomeration}} processes have predominantly {{been investigated}} by changing operation variables of process-scale experiments. So far, most fundamental work {{concentrated on the}} strength of the liquid bonds in the <b>agglomerate</b> and its relation to the process. Previous studies on the relationship between droplet size and <b>agglomerate</b> size in fluid bed agglomeration indicated that, besides <b>agglomerate</b> strength, liquid distribution determines the <b>agglomerate</b> properties to a large extent. This paper focuses on the mechanism of growth of a single <b>agglomerate</b> originating from one droplet of binder liquid. A model is introduced which describes <b>agglomerate</b> growth as a function of time. We discern two stages of growth of an <b>agglomerate.</b> Initially, fast growth takes I,lace by wetting of the powder particles by a droplet, which result in the formation of an initial <b>agglomerate.</b> This stage of fast growth is followed by a second stage of slower growth, which results from drainage of binder liquid from the initial <b>agglomerate</b> to the outer layers of the growing <b>agglomerate.</b> This model predicts <b>agglomerate</b> growth and the final <b>agglomerate</b> size by taking into account the particle sie distribution, the viscosity, the surface tension, the contact angle, the porosity, the wetting saturation and the residual saturation.

40|$|Background: Wet {{agglomeration}} is {{a method}} wherein the crystals of dispersion are held together in aggregates by small amount of a liquid acting as an intercrystal binder. In present study, in order to study the possible modification of <b>agglomerate</b> structure, low concentrations of additives (0. 1 - 1 %) were added to binder liquid. Methods: Piroxicam <b>agglomerates</b> were produced by wet agglomeration method by three solvent systems including a good solvent (dimethylformamide or acetone), antisolvent (water) and a binder liquid (ethylacetate or isopropylacetate). Span 80, talc, ethylcellulose and Eudragit RS in different concentrations were used as additives. The <b>agglomerates</b> were evaluated for production yield of <b>agglomerates,</b> size, friability and drug release properties. Results: The results showed that formation of <b>agglomerates</b> was possible in presence of span and talc. However, no <b>agglomerates</b> could be obtained with polymers tested (ethylcellulose and Eudragit RS). Talc increased <b>agglomerate</b> size, whereas the obtained <b>agglomerates</b> were more susceptible to breakup. However, using span as opposed to talc resulted in <b>agglomerates</b> with higher strength but smaller particle size. The dissolution tests showed that both additives adversely affected the dissolution rate of piroxicam from the <b>agglomerates.</b> Conclusion: Result of this study suggested that additives even in small amounts {{played a major role}} in <b>agglomerate</b> properties...|$|R

This novel numerical approach allows for assessment of the mechanical properties and morphological features of the <b>agglomerates.</b> An interesting outcome is that the fractal dimension depends on the material properties represented via interaction energy. The <b>agglomerate</b> porosity increases with increasing <b>agglomerate</b> mass and may approach unity. With increasing Hamaker constant and fixed particle size, the <b>agglomerates</b> are characterized by a lower fractal dimension, higher packing porosity, higher mechanical strength, larger agglomeration size, and lower crystalline fraction. For a fixed Hamaker constant, <b>agglomerates</b> of the smaller primary particles exhibit a more compact packing structure, higher mechanical strength, smaller <b>agglomerate</b> size, and higher crystalline fraction. The local structure analysis indicates that for a fixed Hamaker constant, there are more particles in crystalline structure within the <b>agglomerates</b> constituted by the smaller primary particles. Likewise, for a fixed primary particle size, a lower Hamaker constant allows particles to configure into more stable <b>agglomerate</b> structures, thus providing useful insights into <b>agglomerate</b> morphology...|$|R
