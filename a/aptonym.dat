500|$|Nominative {{determinism}} is {{the hypothesis}} that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine New Scientist in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting surnames. These included a book on polar explorations by Daniel Snowman and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation {{that some sort of}} psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in New Scientist, as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept aptronym, and its synonyms <b>aptonym,</b> namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. [...] "Aptronym" [...] merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why it has come to fit.|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained. When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the Kentish Note Book magazine a list appeared with [...] "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff". [...] Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term aptronym is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist Franklin P. Adams. Linguist Frank Nuessel coined <b>aptonym,</b> without an [...] "r", in 1992. Other synonyms include euonym, Perfect Fit Last Name (PFLN), and namephreak. In literary science a name that particularly suits a character is called a charactonym. Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include Charles Dickens (e.g., Mr. Gradgrind, the tyrannical schoolmaster) and William Shakespeare (e.g., the lost baby Perdita in The Winter's Tale). Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do not say anything about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.|$|E

But an important subset of this field has been hitherto neglected: {{the study of the}} names of law 2 ̆ 7 s protagonists-law and onomastics. This Essay takes the first step into this promising arena by identifying a previously unexplored category of cases, which it dubs 2 ̆ 2 legal <b>aptonyms.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Many are familiar with <b>aptonyms</b> but lack the vocabulary to describe them. Aptonyms—literally 2 ̆ 2 apt names 2 ̆ 2 —are those proper names that are 2 ̆ 2 regarded as (humorously) appropriate to a person 2 ̆ 7 s profession or personal characteristics. 2 ̆ 2 Think of Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s quick-tempered Sir Hotspur, Dickens 2 ̆ 7 s acerbic Mrs. Sowerberry, or Rowling 2 ̆ 7 s pernicious Draco Malfoy. Although the study of <b>aptonyms</b> is widespread in other fields, it has yet to make inroads into law. Until now...|$|R
