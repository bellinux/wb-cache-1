5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
25|$|I {{never got}} a big bang out of putting people in jail. I always felt there was some good in every person – even though you had to find it in some of them. I also had prosecuted many people who didn’t have {{representation}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> their sentences {{would have been more}} lenient if they could have had an attorney.|$|E

25|$|I thought I was in with {{a chance}} but I didn't want to build up my hopes. The way I worked it out, {{it was to be}} me or Ken MacLeay <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I had a few years {{experience}} on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E
25|$|I {{started selling}} out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I {{probably}} shouldn't {{have done that}} picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, {{and this was the}} structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I didn't have final cut.|$|E
25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E

"I may {{not have}} much education," [...] said he, [...] "but {{let me tell you}} this, Captain Fourneau, I've sailed these waters since I was a little nipper of ten, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the line when I'm on it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the doldrums, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to find my way to the oil rivers.

500|$|... "The pilot lay on {{his stomach}} as if asleep. His arms were hidden beneath his body. As I came closer, I saw {{a pool of blood}} that had issued from the side of his crushed skull; brain matter was exposed. I turned the dead pilot over onto his back and opened the zipper of his flight jacket, saw the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Marseille never {{actually}} received the Diamonds personally) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> immediately who this was. The paybook also told me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1880 Shaw began {{attending}} {{meetings of}} the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to [...] "search for truth in all matters affecting {{the interests of the}} human race". Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship. Shaw later reflected: [...] "You knew everything that I didn't know <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> everything you didn't know... We had everything to learn from one another and brains enough to do it".|$|E

500|$|After her {{departure}} from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films, Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records, but was later dropped due to disagreements {{between her and the}} label. [...] "They wanted to market me in the way that would make the most money. They wanted to make me the new Samantha Fox. And I never wanted that. That wasn't what it was about for me. I pretty much had a sense of myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that I would be an imposter," [...] Lords said.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) Gardner {{states that he}} first heard the term Wica while being {{initiated}} into the New Forest coven in September 1939, stating that [...] "I realised I had stumbled on something interesting; but I was half-initiated before the word Wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> where I was, and that the Old Religion still existed." [...] This account was repeated in his biography, Gerald Gardner: Witch (1960), written by Idries Shah but attributed to Jack L. Bracelin, {{in which he is}} quoted as saying that [...] "it was halfway through when the word Wica was first mentioned; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that that which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] If Gardner's account was accurate and the New Forest coven had really existed, then the fact that Gardner spelled the word as Wica would not necessarily indicate that the coven members had spelled it the same way. As he relates, from Gardner's account, [...] "it seems that he had heard rather than read the word {{in the midst of his}} initiatory rite" [...] and that, [...] "suffering from a poor grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, something caused by the fact that he was self-educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia", he would have therefore spelled the word phonetically as Wica.|$|E

500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} {{to do is to}} study her employer. After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what to say and how to say it.|$|E
500|$|Sonia was {{diagnosed}} with type 1 diabetes at age seven, and began taking daily insulin injections. Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old. After this, she became fluent in English. Sotomayor has {{said that she was}} first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series. [...] She reflected in 1998: [...] "I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest." ...|$|E
500|$|When Songz began {{recording}} for Ready; {{the purpose}} of the album was to crossover and increase his exposure on radio. The album's lead single, [...] "I Need a Girl" [...] was released to connect to mainstream radio. Songz said that [...] " [...] was a very radio-geared record which would do great and play on radio heavily during whatever time. It wasn't a record I expected to last forever, or one I was even excited about singing, but it was a record I knew would do well." [...] Speaking of the following singles, Songz thought that [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] would be a [...] "career-defining record, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> 'Say Aah' would be a monster club record." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it {{was an effort to}} force Cooder to focus on the project, [...] "He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> he was back in Havana." [...] Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer's first solo album, in 1998.|$|E
500|$|According to the Church of Scientology, [...] "even some {{fifty years}} later, those who sailed with Mr. Hubbard in 1932 would still speak of that voyage {{as the one}} grand {{adventure}} in the twilight of their youth." [...] Hubbard put it somewhat differently, writing in 1935 that the expedition [...] "was a crazy idea at best, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it, but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet." [...] He told Look magazine in 1950 that the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition [...] "was a two-bit expedition and financial bust, and I quit the ship at Puerto Rico in 1933." [...] The collapse of the expedition led a number of its members to make legal claims against Hubbard for refunds.|$|E

[...] In 2010, Pearson {{was named to the}} 2011 class in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. He received the most votes, from 50 of 53 voters. [...] "I am just proud that that many people thought enough to vote for me", Pearson said. He added that he had not felt slighted by Bill France, Jr. beating him into the 2010 class by one vote.
