40|$|Title IV of the 1990 {{amendments}} to the Clean Air Act initiated a historic experiment in <b>incentive-based</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>regulation</b> by permitting electric generating facilities to trade allowances for emission of sulfur dioxide. To date, relatively little allowance trading has occurred. However, the costs of compliance have been much less than anticipated. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to address the apparent paradox-that the allowance trading program may not require (very much) trading in order to be successful. Title IV represented two great steps forward in environmental regulation: (i) a move toward performance standards and (ii) formal allowance trading.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of EU {{adoption}} of a Sky Trust (Barnes and Breslow 2003) on the income distribution of Hungary, a lower-middle income EU member. � We use plausible parameters for an EU carbon charge and revenue recycling system, input-output data to track {{the effect of a}} carbon charge on commodity prices, and household consumption survey data to examine the effect on expenditure by decile. We find that the carbon-charge revenue collection is nearly flat with respect to income. Combined with Sky Trust revenue recycling, the net effect on income distribution is moderately progressive. For a Sky Trust structure that would significantly increase the likelihood of the EU meeting Stern Review and IPCC greenhouse gas reduction targets, households in the top decile of the Hungarian income distribution would see incomes fall by 859 USD, or 4. 4 percent. Households in the lowest decile of the Hungarian income distribution would see household budgets rise by 498 USD, or 11. 4 percent. At the median household income, the effect is small but positive.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{possibility}} of an <b>incentive-based</b> (IB) <b>environmental</b> <b>regulation</b> of domestic civil aviation in Sweden. From a regulation perspective, we identify important characteristics of domestic aviation. We discuss several, both practical and theoretical, critical aspects on IB regulation. In the short-run, the environmental performance of an IB regulation might be poor, since the most likely source of emission reductions is a {{reduction in the number of}} flights. However, we also find that the dynamic effects of an IB regulation are clearly better than for command-and-control regulations. Given this discussion, we investigate the prospects of implementing an optimal IB regulation and compare this with the present regulation and pricing of the infrastructure. We show that introducing an IB regulation could improve the over-all efficiency of the pricing system. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{environmental}} {{damages from}} emissions are spatially nonuniform, permit trading has been modeled most {{often as a}} “pollution offset program” in which emission permits are traded between agents, subject to constraints on ambient air quality. To date the institution envisioned to implement such a program involves trading on a bilateral and sequential basis. However, simulation studies indicate that the sequence of trades may alter the outcome and undermine the cost savings from a pollution offset program. This paper identifies a design for the trading institution that tends to overcome this phenomenon and improve the efficiency of equilibria obtained in a simulation model. We model a bilateral trading process for the reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions with a stochastic description of the sequence of trades within groups of nations in Europe. When trading takes place between disaggregated, stylistic representations of economic enterprises, rather than between national governments, a significantly greater portion of potential savings is achieved. In fact, under most sets of assumptions, approximate first order stochastic dominance is achieved wherein the more decentralized the trading agents, the greater the expected savings from a trading program.

40|$|The {{universal}} theme of {{deregulation of the}} electricity industry is {{the dismantling of the}} exclusive franchise, opening up some segments of the industry to competition. Technological changes in generation have helped eliminate the perception that generation is a natural monopoly, but this change has not occurred in transmission and distribution services. Marketing functions have also been opened up to competition in many places. This paper includes a brief overview of the different approaches to restructuring that have been adopted in selected countries around the world. It also surveys the existing literature that explores various aspects of how electricity restructuring is likely to affect the environment. The effect of restructuring on the environment consists of four constituent influences: (1) changes in electricity demand and how it substitutes for (and complements) the consumption of other products, (2) the substitution among fuels and other inputs in electricity production, (3) efficiency improvements that stem from the introduction of competition, and (4) the interaction of firm behavior and market structure with existing and new <b>incentive-based</b> approaches to <b>environmental</b> <b>regulation.</b> Notwithstanding the possibility that electricity consumption displaces the use of other fuels in end uses, most studies find some negative environmental effect from increased consumption, especially with respect to carbon emissions. However, the efficiency gains that can be expected in delivering electricity services create the opportunity for additional environmental controls. Regulatory reform has arrived in the electricity sector, and it is expected to offer welfare gains that can be shared between economic and environmental objectives. ...|$|R
