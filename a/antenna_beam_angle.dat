40|$|Phased array {{radar systems}} employ {{multiple}} antennas {{to create a}} radar beam that can be steered electronically. By manipulating the relative phase values of feeding signals among different antennas, the effective radiation pattern of the array can be synthesized to enhance the main lobe in a desired direction while suppressing the undesired side lobes in other directions. Hence the radar scanning angles can be electronically controlled without employing the bulky mechanical gimbal structure, which can significantly reduce radar system size, weight and power consumption. In recent years, phased array technologies have received great attentions and are explored in developing many new applications, such as smart communication systems, military radars, vehicular radar, etc. Most of these systems are narrow band systems, where the phase delays are realized with narrow band phase shifter circuits. For the impulse ground penetrating radar however, its operating frequency spans an ultrawide bandwidth. Therefore the traditional phase shifters are not applicable due to their narrow band nature. To resolve the issue, in this study, a true time delay approach is explored which can precisely control time delays for the feeding pulse signals among different antennas in the array. In the design, an on chip programmable delay generator is being developed using Global Foundry 0. 18 µm 7 HV high voltage CMOS process. The time delay control is realized by designing a programmable phase locked loop (PLL) circuit which can generate true time delays ranging from 100 ps (picoseconds) to 500 ps with the step size of 25 ps. The PLL oscillator 2 ̆ 7 s frequency is programmable from 100 MHz to 500 MHz through two reconfigurable frequency dividers in the feedback loop. As a result, the <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> can be synthesized to change from 9. 59 ° to 56. 4 ° with a step of 2. 75 °, and the 3 dB beamwidth is 10 °. The power consumption of the time delay circuit is very low, where the supply voltage is 1. 8 V and the average current is as low as 472 uA...|$|E

40|$|A {{phase-locked loop}} (PLL) based {{frequency}} synthesizer capable of generating highly linear broadband frequency sweeps as signal {{source of a}} high resolution 80 GHz FMCW radar system is presented. The system achieves a wide output range of 24. 5 GHz starting from 68 GHz up to 92. 5 GHz. High frequencies allow the use of small antennas for small <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> The wide bandwidth results in a radar system with a very high range resolution of below 1. 5 cm. Furthermore, the presented synthesizer provides a very low phase noise performance of − 80 dBc/Hz at 80 GHz carrier frequency and 10 kHz offset, which enables high precision distance measurements with low range errors. This is achieved by using two nested phase-looked loops with high order loop filters.

Observations of {{secondary}} radiation, stimulated electromagnetic emission (SEE), produced during ionospheric modification experiments using ground-based, high-power, high-frequency (HF) radio waves are considered. The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility {{is capable of}} generating narrowband SEE {{in the form of}} stimulated Brillouin scatter (SBS) and stimulated ion Bernstein scatter (SIBS) in the SEE spectrum. Such narrowband SEE spectral lines have not been reported using the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) heater facility before. This work reports the first EISCAT results of narrowband SEE spectra and compares them to SEE previously observed at HAARP during electron gyro-harmonic heating. An analysis of experimental SEE data shows observations of emission lines within 100 Hz of the pump frequency, interpreted as SBS, during the 2012 July EISCAT campaign. Experimental results indicate that SBS strengthens as the pump frequency approaches the third electron gyro-harmonic. Also, for different heater <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> <b>angles,</b> the CUTLASS radar backscatter induced by HF radio pumping is suppressed near electron gyro-harmonics, whereas electron temperature enhancement weakens as measured by EISCAT/UHF radar. The main features of these new narrowband EISCAT observations are generally consistent with previous SBS measurements at HAARP...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of modern series production automotive radar sensors to pedestrian recognition {{is an important}} topic in research on future driver assistance systems. The aim {{of this paper is}} to understand the potential and limits of such sensors in pedestrian recognition. This knowledge could be used to develop next generation radar sensors with improved pedestrian recognition capabilities. A new raw radar data signal processing algorithm is proposed that allows deep insights into the object classification process. The impact of raw radar data properties can be directly observed in every layer of the classification system by avoiding machine learning and tracking. This gives information on the limiting factors of raw radar data in terms of classification decision making. To accomplish the very challenging distinction between pedestrians and static objects, five significant and stable object features from the spatial distribution and Doppler information are found. Experimental results with data from a 77 GHz automotive radar sensor show that over 95 % of pedestrians can be classified correctly under optimal conditions, which is compareable to modern machine learning systems. The impact of the pedestrian's direction of movement, occlusion, <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> elevation <b>angle,</b> linear vehicle movement, and other factors are investigated and discussed. The results show that under real life conditions, radar only based pedestrian recognition is limited due to insufficient Doppler frequency and spatial resolution as well as antenna side lobe effects...|$|R

40|$|Backscatter data {{collected}} with a 398 MHz phased-array radar operated at Homer, Alaska (59. 72 deg N, 151. 53 deg W) have been analyzed {{for information on}} the height of radar auroral echoing. Altitude was resolved through the variation of backscattered power with <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> elevation <b>angle.</b> The mean height of backscattering could be determined with an accuracy of 1 - 2 km over small ((TURN) 20 x 20 km(2 ̆ 72)) areas and short ((TURN) 1 min) periods. In this thesis, the results are presented in the form of maps of the spatial distribution of echo height.;The data base encompassed approximately 40 hrs of observation carried out in 1973, 1976, and 1978. Echo activity most often spanned a 10 - 20 km range of height centered on 100 - 110 km. The echoing region was always sharply bounded from below at 96 - 98 km. The upper altitude limit of echo activity was 115 - 120 km. The height range in events of the post-midnight sector was 97 - 110 km vs. 97 - 118 km in events of the pre-midnight sector. Echoing was restricted to directions nearly perpendicular to the geomagnetic field, giving rise to systematic spatial and temporal variations of height. Magnetic aspect control of echo height was weaker in events of discrete radar aurora.;The height range of the Homer echo activity is shown to be consistent with the onset of primary two-stream plasma instability within auroral electrojet current. The modulation of height within the altitude limits of echo activity by the magnetic aspect geometry is attributed to strong directional confinement of plasma wave growth. It is suggested that the spatial and temporal variabilities of radar auroral altitude derive from structure within auroral ionization and variability of auroral electrojet current...|$|R

40|$|The Io-Jupiter {{interaction}} generates strong decametric radio emissions (DAM), {{which appear}} as arcs in the time-frequency plane. These emissions are <b>beamed</b> at an <b>angle</b> from {{the magnetic field}} lines, which may vary with frequency and longitude amongst other properties. Empirical models of this <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> describe {{the shape of the}} DAM arcs and offer insight into the emission mechanism for DAM. Several studies have investigated the variation in the emission <b>beaming</b> <b>angle.</b> The studies span a range of frequencies which depend on the observational means (spacecraft, ground-based radio telescopes) used to obtain data. Subsequently, because of the varying assumptions made (e. g. relativistic vs. non-relativistic electrons for the wave polarization), methods used (e. g. prescribing a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function vs. determining a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function from observational geometry) and frequency ranges observed, different results have been found in each study. In the present paper, we model the shape of the emission with an empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function and adjust the parameters to best fit the emission arcs. However, our model builds on previous models by taking into account the location of Io in the Jovian magnetic field. We also look at a broader frequency range than many of the intermediate studies. We find that a simple empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function describes the shape of the A, B, and D arcs and that the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function must decrease at high and low frequencies.

In this paper, we consider the X-SAR <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> alignment in azimuth. For a single-pass cross-track SAR interferometer, we establish the relation between yaw and pitch mis{{alignment of}} the <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> and the resulting relative shift of the Doppler frequency bands. This relation is used to provide solutions for the mechanical adjustments of the outboard <b>antenna</b> and electronic <b>beam</b> steering to correct for azimuth misalignment. Furthermore, {{the effects of the}} X-SAR effective outboard antenna pattern on the azimuth beam alignment are analyzed. As a result, a so-called "relaxing" factor is derived, which increases the limit for the difference in antenna azimuth angle with respect to the requirement on spectral overlap, and hence spatial interferogram resolution. However, we also show that the alignment requirement is driven by the constraint on decreasing the azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio (AASR) for the effective outboard antenna pattern to reduce the resulting additional height error. The strategy for misalignment determination and correction is presented, and results of the analysis of the in-flight X-SAR <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> alignment are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Equispaced beam {{arrangements}} are typically used for IMRT plans. This beam arrangement provides adequate dose coverage {{to the target}} while sparing dose to other structures. However, an equispaced beam arrangement may not provide the best dose coverage to the target while sparing dose to the other structures. <b>Beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization attempts to optimize the beam directions to produce a better IMRT plan; this is achieved by increasing dose to the target while minimizing dose to the remaining structures. Most methods of <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization attempt to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and the <b>beam</b> intensity profiles to find an optimal set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> This thesis attempts to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> without determining the beam intensity profiles. An MCNP simulation is run to score the beam directions; the simulation is run as an adjoint problem to reduce simulation time, with the target as the source and the detectors scoring the dose for the gantry <b>angles</b> of the <b>beam.</b> Then, an optimization algorithm is run to select a set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> for an optimized IMRT plan. The optimized IMRT plan is compared to an equispaced IMRT plan on a commercial treatment planning system to determine if this method of <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization is better than using an equispaced beam arrangement.

A mechanical gimbal-mounted airborne radar is used to steer the <b>antenna</b> <b>beam.</b> The difficulty with a gimbaled radar is that the radar measurement becomes inaccurate if the target is outside the <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> width, which is usually less than 2 deg.
