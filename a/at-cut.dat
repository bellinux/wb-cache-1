50|$|<b>AT-cut</b> {{crystals}} are singularly rotated Y-axis cuts {{in which}} {{the top and bottom}} half of the crystal move in opposite directions (thickness shear vibration) during oscillation. The <b>AT-cut</b> crystal is easily manufactured. However, it has limitations at high and low temperature, as it is easily disrupted by internal stresses caused by temperature gradients in these temperature extremes (relative to room temperature, ~25 °C). These internal stress points produce undesirable frequency shifts in the crystal, decreasing its accuracy. The relationship between temperature and frequency is cubic. The cubic relationship has an inflection point near room temperature. As a consequence the <b>AT-cut</b> quartz crystal is most effective when operating at or near room temperature. For applications which are above room temperature, water cooling is often helpful.|$|E

High-purity quartz crystals are grown with especially low content of aluminium, alkali metal and other impurities and minimal defects; the low amount of alkali metals provides increased resistance to ionizing radiation.

5000|$|The {{electro-mechanical}} analogy {{provides for}} mechanical equivalents of a resistor, an inductance, and a capacitance, {{which are the}} dashpot (quantified by the drag coefficient, ξp), the point mass (quantified by the mass, mp), and the spring (quantified by the spring constant, κp). For a dashpot, the impedance by definition is Zm=F / (du/dt)=ξm with F the force and (du/dt) the speed). For a point mass undergoing oscillatory motion u(t) = u0 exp(iωt) we have Zm = iωmp. The spring obeys Zm =κp/(iω). Piezoelectric coupling is depicted as a transformer. It {{is characterized by a}} parameter φ. While φ is dimensionless for usual transformers (the turns ratio), it has the dimension charge/length in the case of electromechanical coupling. The transformer acts as an impedance converter in the sense that a mechanical impedance, Zm, appears as an electrical impedance, Zel, across the electrical ports. [...] Zel is given by Zel = φ2 Zm. For planar piezoelectric crystals, φ takes the value φ = Ae/dq, where A is the effective area, e is the piezoelectric stress coefficient (e = 9.65·10−2 C/m2 for <b>AT-cut</b> quartz) and dq is the thickness of the plate. The transformer often is not explicitly depicted. Rather, the mechanical elements are directly depicted as electrical elements (capacitor replaces a spring, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For {{miniaturized}} strip <b>AT-cut</b> quartz resonator, {{the demand}} of performance is higher and higher, so the design ability {{is more important}} than before. But to get a precise simulation electrical response of the <b>AT-cut</b> quartz plate by a common commercial FEM tool is not easy and time consuming also. Base on Mindlin’s [1] 2 -D model and Lee-Brebbia’s [2] FEA method, Pao [3] et al. presented an efficient numerical method in calculating the electrical response different modes of <b>AT-cut</b> strip quartz crystal resonator with electrode. Base on weak coupling of quartz material and mass loading effect of electrode, we solve this problem by separating the mechanical vibration and electrical coupling effects. The method considers not only the pure mechanical vibration but also the electrical response, so we can identify different modes effectively and efficiently. However, to be a practical design tool, the parameters used in the simulation is better come from real samples. In this paper, we extend the works to parameters extraction for design optimization. A blank with electrode was built and its acoustic and electrical material parameters (including damping coefficient) of the quartz resonators could be extracted by fitting to few measured sample admittance curves. The extracted parameters could be used for design optimization purpose. To exam the effectiveness of the parameters extraction, another blank with electrode quartz resonator was built and the results showed the calculated impedance curves could match the measured ones, and a practical <b>AT-cut</b> strip quartz resonator design tool could be made based on extended Minlin’s 2 D model.

40|$|A {{technique}} for contactless electromagnetic interrogation of <b>AT-cut</b> quartz piezoelectric resonator sensors is proposed {{based on a}} primary coil electromagnetically air-coupled to a secondary coil connected to the electrodes of the resonator. The interrogation technique periodically switches between interleaved excitation and detection phases. During the excitation phase, the resonator is set into vibration by a driving voltage applied to the primary coil, whereas in the detection phase, the excitation signal is turned off and the transient decaying response of the resonator is sensed without contact by measuring the voltage induced back across the primary coil. This approach ensures that the readout frequency of the sensor signal is to a first order approximation independent of the interrogation distance between the primary and secondary coils. A detailed theoretical analysis of the interrogation principle based on a lumped-element equivalent circuit is presented. The analysis has been experimentally validated on a 4. 432 MHz <b>AT-cut</b> quartz crystal resonator, demonstrating the accurate readout of the series resonant frequency and quality factor over an interrogation distance of up to 2 cm. As an application, the technique {{has been applied to}} the measurement of liquid microdroplets deposited on a 4. 8 MHz <b>AT-cut</b> quartz crystal.
