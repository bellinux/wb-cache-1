30|$|To these of my opinions, many Chinese {{scholars}} added {{their points}} of views from different positions (Leibold, 2013, Ma Rong, 2014). Along the traditional theoretic line of “nationality/minzu,” {{the first group}} of scholars supports the classic Stalin theory. One of them said openly that there is no “Zhonghua Minzu”(Chinese nation) existing in China, except “ 56 minzus (nationalities)”(Du Yonghao, 2010). Some scholars believed that the biggest problem at present is that the practice and realization of the Autonomy Law for Minzu (ethnic minority) Regions are insufficient; of all 155 autonomous units in China, there were still 15 that did not issue <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulations</b> according to the Autonomy Law; autonomy is possible only with <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulations</b> in practice (Hao shiyuan, 2013 : 81). So for them, the biggest task to undertake at the moment for the adherence and improvement of minority autonomous rights is to legislate detailed <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulations</b> for <b>autonomous</b> regions at all levels. The scholars criticized the commission system for minority affairs across the country, suggesting it should become a much more powerful division of the government to implement official policies for minorities. They believed that to strengthen the position and power of the commission system for minority affairs would benefit the practice of the CCP’s policies for minorities (Hao Shiyuan, 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Regarding {{psychological}} {{responses to}} exercise, this study aimed {{to analyze the}} mediating effects of motivational regulations and intensity in the association between basic psychological needs satisfaction and emotional responses. This was a cross-sectional study of 495 health club members (M = 40. 50 years; SD = 13. 54); of these, 186 were women (37. 6 %) and 309 men (62. 4 %), with an average attendance of 2. 61 sessions per week (SD= 1. 29). Self-determination theory motivational regulations and basic psychological needs (BPN), perceived exercise intensity, and emotional response were measured. Serial mediation procedures were followed to test the interactions of variables. Models with <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulations</b> predicted positive emotional responses. As for the negative emotional response, the models with external regulation presented the highest predictions for negative activation. Results indicate that BPN satisfaction is associated with better emotional response, partially explained by <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulations</b> and perceived exercise intensity. In externally regulated individuals, perceived exercise intensity appears to be important to sustain a better emotional response...|$|R

In veiled language it made references to <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulations</b> as to assault on integrity of Spain, and to street violence as to chaos {{and the rule of}} criminals. Claiming responsibility for the country, the document pledged loyalty to the Republican system, but declared Cortes illegal from the very onset.

We followed a sample (N= 308) of 9 - 14 year old swim club athletes during a 32 -week season, measuring their reports of the parent-initiated motivational climate as well as <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> {{at the beginning of}} the season, at midseason, and at the end of the season. Cross sectional analyses at each point revealed that children whose parents created a mastery climate, which defines success in terms of enjoyment of the activity, self-improvement, and effort, reported higher levels of <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> (intrinsic motivation) than did those whose parent created an ego climate that emphasized winning, avoidance of mistakes, and ability comparison with others. In contrast, ego climate scores were positively related to extrinsic motivation scores. Girls exhibited higher <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> than did boys.

40|$|Recent studies {{based on}} {{self-determination}} theory (Deci & Ryan, 2002) {{have found that}} <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> is linked to healthy eating behaviours, while controlled regulation is linked to dysfunctional eating behaviours (Pelletier, Dion, Slovinec-D'Angelo, & Reid, 2004). The main purpose of this thesis was to build on this previous work by examining the relations between regulation styles for eating behaviours and approach vs. avoidance food planning strategies {{in order to better}} understand success (healthy eating behaviours) and failure (bulimic symptoms and failure at weight-loss) at the regulation of eating behaviours. In total, three studies were conducted. In the first study, a new scale was developed to assess approach food planning and avoidance food planning, namely the Planning of Eating Behaviours Scale (PEBS). Results from confirmatory factorial analyses supported the two-factor structure of the scale. In addition, construct validity was assessed through correlations between the PEBS subscales and measures of well-being. In Study 2, mediational analyses were performed to examine whether approach and avoidance food planning could account for the effects of regulation styles on eating behaviours. Results indicated that approach food planning is a partial mediator of the relation between <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> and healthy eating behaviours, such that women with <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> are more likely to use approach food planning, which in turn is positively associated with healthy eating behaviours. Avoidance food planning was identified as a partial mediator of the relation between controlled regulation and dysfunctional eating behaviours (e. g., bulimic symptoms and food concerns), such that women with controlled regulation are more likely to use avoidance food planning which in turn is more likely to lead to dysfunctional eating behaviours. Finally, Study 3 examined whether two types of planning interventions alter the relationship between regulation styles and the outcome of the regulation. The approach-oriented intervention made women with high levels of <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> more successful at weight loss. Results also indicated a main positive effect for <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> on body weigh goal attainment and healthy food choices. The avoidance-oriented intervention was found to have no impact on measures of success, whether on its own or in interaction with regulation styles...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} theoretically-based {{research}} on the motivational processes linked to the adoption and maintenance of an active lifestyle in people with affective disorders. Within the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) framework, we investigated the SDT tenets in people with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder by examining the factor structure of the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire- 2 (BREQ- 2) and by investigating associations between motivation, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores. A total of 165 patients (105 ♀) (45. 6 ± 14. 2 years) agreed to participate. An exploratory factor analysis demonstrated sufficient convergence with the original factor for amotivation, and external and introjected regulation. The items of identified and intrinsic regulation loaded on the same factor, which was labelled <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation.</b> Significant correlations were found between the total IPAQ score and the subscales amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation and <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation.</b> The relative autonomy index (RAI) was associated with the PANAS scores.

In two cross-sectional studies, 252 elementary school children (43. 7 % male; mean age = 10. 7 years, SD = 1. 3 years) and 334 junior high school children (49. 7 % male, mean age = 14. 07 years, SD = 1. 01 years) were administered a questionnaire assessing their motivation for various school subjects. Results based on structural equation modeling using the correlated trait-correlated method minus one model (CTCM- 1) showed that autonomous and controlled motivations assessed at the school subject level are not equally school-subject-specific. We found larger specificity effects for autonomous (intrinsic and identified) than for controlled (introjected and external) motivation.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{into the role of}} exercise motives (what people want from exercise) has overlooked the possible role of gains (what people get) and hence the possible benefits of motive fulfillment (when people get what they want). To redress this imbalance, we examined the additive and interactive effects of motives and subjective gains on exercise-specific outcomes. Young adults (N = 196) completed measures of exercise motives and gains, and exercise behavioral regulation, amount, satisfaction, and intention. Four representative motives/gains were selected: appearance, positive health, challenge, and affiliation. Path analysis was used to test the effects of motives, gains, and their products (the interactive effects) on behavioral regulations, and thereby exercise amount, satisfaction, and intention. Controlled regulation increased with appearance motive, unless appearance gain was high. Controlled regulation had a negative effect on exercise satisfaction. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> increased with positive health motive, provided positive health gain was high; with challenge motive and gain; and with affiliation motive. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> had positive effects on exercise amount, satisfaction, and intention. The study corroborates previous findings about the effects of motives. It establishes the value of also studying gains, as moderators of the effects of motives, and in their own right. The findings are interpretable in terms of self-determination theory. Exercise promotion could be more effective if it focused on gains in conjunction with motives...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of influence of single and prolonged exposure of audio-visual stimulation (AVS) on heart rate variability and the mechanisms of the autonomic regulation in athletes, involved in cyclic sports activity. Material and methods.  In this study 60 athletes aging of 17 – 23 years old, specializing in middle-distance running, were involved. The running volume in the zones of varying intensity was from 185 to 225  km/month. The experiment was conducted in January – March 2014, at the Scientific Educational Center “Physiology of ontogenesis” at the Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Life Safety of NSPU. Training course of audiovisual stimulation (AVS) consisted of 20 – 22 sessions, which were conducted in a day with using a portable audiovisual stimulator “NOVO PRO” (USA). ECG registration signal was performed using hardware and software complex VNS-Micro (Neurosoft, Ivanovo, Russia) in standard electrocardiogram lead II. Athletes who received AVS course in the morning, before sports training loads, have received training with activating program, and after exercise – by using a relaxed program. Results.  In athletes after 20 – 22 sessions of AVS the decreased influence of the sympathetic regulation and contribution of central levels of management in the regulation of heart rate were found. A decrease of intensity of regulatory system was observed. Increased influence of the parasympathetic regulation and strengthening of <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> contour was found. AVS contributed to increasing influence of respiratory waves on the heart rhythm and a more economical functional activity. AVS single exposure caused a significant increase in the functioning of <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> contour, the growing influence of parasympathetic effects and higher contribution of respiratory waves in the formation of heart rate by using activating as well relaxing programs. However, a more pronounced effect was observed after application of relaxing program. Conclusion.  Application of AVS contributed to increase activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, the growing influence of <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulation</b> contour, the increase influence of respiratory waves on the heart rhythm and a more economical its work at rest and during an orthostatic test. AVS training may be recommended by sports training for maintaining top competition form, faster recovery and improve the functional state of regulation mechanisms. </span...|$|E

It eventually materialized in Vascongadas and Navarre as lista catolico-fuerista, with Oreja elected as its deputy from the rural Biscay district. During his first term as a deputy he dedicated himself to the Basque-Navarrese autonomy, approached not as a tactical necessity, but {{as a matter of}} principle. He contributed to the so-called Estella Statute and kept supporting <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulations</b> even when the government-imposed draft moved religious issues from regional to central portfolio. Another thread of his parliamentary activity - often merged with the Basque cause - was opposing secularization motions of the Left and backing the Church, especially trying to preserve its education infrastructure. Supporting reunification of Carlism in 1932 Oreja joined its united organization, Comunión Tradicionalista, though he remained relatively lukewarm to dynastical issues and supported broad monarchical alliances on national or regional basis. He was heading the Biscay section of Requeté, a rapidly growing Carlist paramilitary militia. He successfully represented the party during the 1933 electoral campaign to the Cortes, again standing in the Biscay province and again in alliance with PNV. As late as November 1933 he still advocated the apparently doomed autonomy “contra viento y marea”, which, however, did not amount to endorsing Basque nationalism or Basque separatism. Some scholars oppose him to “integristas” in the autonomy discourse.|$|R
