"Blood-induced icterus" [...] {{produced}} by the release of massive amounts of a coloring material from blood cells followed by the formation of bile was recognized and described by Vanlair and Voltaire Masius' in 1871. About 20 years later, Hayem distinguished between congenital hemolytic anemia and an acquired type of infectious icterus associated with chronic splenomegaly. In 1904, Donath and Landsteiner suggested a serum factor was responsible for hemolysis in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. French investigators led by Chauffard {{stressed the importance of}} red-cell autoagglutination in patients with <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia.</b> In 1930, Lederer and Brill described cases of acute hemolysis with rapid onset of anemia and rapid recovery after transfusion therapy.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the predictive values of hemolytic anemias registered in the Danish National Patient Register. Patients and methods: All patients with a first-ever diagnosis of hemolytic anemia from either specialist outpatient clinic contact or inpatient admission at Odense University Hospital from January 1994 through December 2011 were considered for inclusion. Patients with mechanical reason for hemolysis such as an artificial heart valve, and patients with vitamin-B 12 or folic acid deficiency were excluded. Results: We identified 412 eligible patients: 249 with a congenital hemolytic anemia diagnosis and 163 with <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> diagnosis. In all, hemolysis was confirmed in 359 patients, yielding an overall PPV of 87. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 83. 5 %– 90. 2 %). A diagnosis could be established in 392 patients of whom 355 patients had a hemolytic diagnosis. Diagnosis was confirmed in 197 of the 249 patients with congenital hemolytic anemia, yielding a PPV of 79. 1 % (95 % CI: 73. 5 %– 84. 0 %). Diagnosis of <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> could be confirmed in 136 of the 163 patients, resulting in a PPV of 83. 4 % (95 % CI: 76. 8 %– 88. 8 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the abnormal serum factors of <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> in patients with leukemia and lymphoma could be characterized as antibody by the immune adherence technique. The patho-genesis of this disorder has not been completely explained and it was felt that the study of specific immunologic reactions might help to determine whether these serum factors are erythrocyte anti-body. The technique of immune adherence (1, 2) was used not only because its flexibility and sensi-tivity make it most suitable for the study of anti-gen-antibody reactions but particularly because, insofar as is at present known, immune adherence will not occur unless antigen and specific comple-ment-fixing antibody are present. The basic premise of this reaction states that in the presence of antigen, specific antibody, complement, and indicator (either primate red cells or nonprimate platelets), the antigen will adhere to the indicator particles. Immune adherence may be determined either macroscopically by red cell floccule forma-tion or microscopically by dark-field illumination. METHODS AND MATERIALS A.

The 4 sera with the highest titers of cold agglutinins showed distinguishable abnormal electrophoretic components. The titers correlated with {{the height of the}} abnormal components. Ultracentrifugal analysis of the electrophoretic fractions indicated that the cold agglutinins were associated with proteins having a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 19 S. The abnormal component from the serum with the highest biological activity showed almost no contamination with lower molecular weight proteins. The amount of 19 S material found correlated with the titer of agglutinating activity. The high molecular weight character of the cold agglutinins was confirmed by procedures of density gradient zone centrifugation. The biological activity sedimented with proteins of the 19 S class in all the sera including those of relatively low titer with which no abnormal electrophoretic components were observed. Dissociation of the abnormal high molecular weight components was possible by means of certain sulfhydryl compounds. This resulted in disappearance of cold agglutinin activity.
