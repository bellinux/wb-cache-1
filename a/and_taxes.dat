5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers.

The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role.

40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) is the {{etiologic}} agent of adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, an aggressive clonal malignancy of human CD 4 -bearing T lymphocytes. HTLV- 2, although highly related to HTLV- 1 {{at the molecular}} level, has not been conclusively linked to development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Differences between the biological activities of the respective tax gene products (<b>Tax</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2) may be one factor which accounts for the differential pathogenicities associated with infection. To develop an in vitro model to investigate and compare the effects of constitutive expression of <b>Tax</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2, Jurkat T-cell lines were infected with lentivirus vectors encoding <b>Tax</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2 in conjunction with green fluorescent protein, and stably transduced clonal cell lines were generated by serial dilution {{in the absence of}} drug selection. Jurkat cells that constitutively express <b>Tax</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2 (<b>Tax</b> 1 /Jurkat <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2 /Jurkat, respectively) showed notably reduced kinetics of cellular replication, <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 1 inhibited cellular replication to a higher degree in comparison to Tax 2. Tax 1 markedly activated transcription from the cdk inhibitor p 21 cip 1 /waf 1 promoter in comparison to Tax 2, suggesting that upregulation of p 21 cip 1 /waf 1 may account for the differential inhibition of cellular replication kinetics displayed by <b>Tax</b> 1 /Jurkat <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2 /Jurkat cells. The presence of binucleated and multinucleated cells, reminiscent of large lymphocytes with cleaved or cerebriform nuclei often seen in HTLV- 1 - and - 2 -seropositive patients, was noted in cultures expressing <b>Tax</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2. Although <b>Tax</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Tax</b> 2 expression mediated elevated resistance to apoptosis in Jurkat cells after serum deprivation, Tax 1 was unique in protection from apoptosis after exposure to camptothecin and etoposide, inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II, respectively.

If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E

His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage.
