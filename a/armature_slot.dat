40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the new design}} of Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Motor (HEFSM) using segmental rotor structure. HEFSMs are those that consists all the excitation flux sources at their stator with robust rotor structure. The rotor is designed as segmental due to the reason that segmental rotor has ability to yield the magnetic path for conveying the field flux to nearby stator armature coil {{with respect to the}} rotation of the rotor. This design gives the clear advantage of shorter end winding compared to the toothed rotor as there is no overlap winding between field excitation coil (FEC) and armature coil. In this paper the initial design of HEFSM with segmental rotor has been improved by changing segment span, FEC slot area and <b>armature</b> <b>slot</b> area until maximum torque and power of 33. 633 Nm and 8. 17 KW respectively have been achieved. Moreover coil test analysis, induced voltage, cogging torque, magnetic flux characteristics, torque vs. field current density and torque vs. power speed characteristics are examined on the basis of 2 -D finite element analysis (FEA...|$|E

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: The {{generator}} tested for characteristic action under different load conditions {{is of the}} revolving field, separately excited, stationary armature type. The above drawing shows the principal points {{in the construction of}} the machine. On the left is the main pulley which is run by the main drive belt; on the right is a smaller one from which a small direct current generator is run for exciting the alternator field. The shaft is lubricated by rings which dip into an oil reservoir. The revolving field receives its exciting current from the exciter through two slip rings. The field spider and pole faces are of laminated steel that in the pole faces is japanned and that in the spider is not. These laminations are held together by bolts as shown in drawing. The armature ring is built of japanned laminations which are held together by bolts and clamps. If the laminations should for any reason become loose and cause a disagreeable humming they may readily be tightened. There are six field coils which are wound as shown; all coils are in series each adjacent one being wound opposite and the terminals brought to the slip rings. One brush on the ring is shown; there are two brushes on each ring. The scheme of an <b>armature</b> <b>slot</b> is shown on drawing and is the construction most commonly employed by modern dynamo builder...|$|E

This paper {{describes}} a design optimization to achieve optimal {{performance of a}} two novel single-phase short-stroke tubular linear permanent magnet motors (TLPMMs) with rectangular and trapezoidal permanent magnets (PMs) structures.

40|$|I. THE SYNCHRONOUS REACTANCES OF ALTERNATORS WITH PERMANENT MAGNET EXCITATION AND ALTERNATORS WITH SKEWED ARMATURE SLOTS: The {{method for}} calculating the two reactances of salient pole alternators with {{permanent}} magnet excitation has been developed. Owing {{to the presence}} of the magnets, the direct axis armature reactance {{has been found to be}} much smaller than in electromagnet excited machines of similar sizes. The quadrature axis reactance is thus found to be likely the greater of the two. The influence of skewing the <b>armature</b> <b>slots</b> has been studied, both for electromagnet excited and permanent magnet excited machines. It has been found that the general influence is to decrease the armature reaction reactances and to increase the leakage reactances. The influence upon the total reactances is to a certain extent to reduce the difference between the reactances along the two axes. Formulae are given for both types of excitation. The practical correctness of the formulae when saturation is not appreciable has been confirmed indirectly by comparing calculated and tested regulation curves of two existing machines. II. THE CARDIOID DIAGRAM METHOD OF DETERMINING THE VOLTAGE REGULATION OF SALIENT POLE ALTERNATORS AND THE LOAD VOLTAGE INCREASE PHENOMENON IN ALTERNATORS WITH PERMANENT MAGNET EXCITATION: A graphical method has been developed for rapidly determining from two reactances the regulation of alternators for a wide range of power factor. The same method is used to study the performance of alternators with permanent magnet excitation. The study shows that it is possible to develop a system applicable to uniform rising regulation curves over a wide range of power factors from unity to that due to purely inductive load. III. THE OPTIMUM PROPORTIONS OF THE FIELD STRUCTURE OF PERMANENT MAGNET EXCITED ALTERNATORS: The optimum design of the field structure of permanent magnet excited alternators with specified lengths of air gap and stability has been obtained for two types of problems; viz., 1) when given space, to find the required maximum flux density in the air gap, and 2) when both space and the air gap flux density are known and the requirement is minimum weight of the magnets. A method of specifying the stability of the excitation magnets has been suggested. It has been shown that appreciable improvements are possible for many existing designs. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{permanent}} magnet (PM) linear motor, there is force ripple, which is detrimental to positioning. This force ripple is mainly due to cogging force and mutual force ripple. These forces {{are affected by}} geometric parameters of brushless PM motor, such as width of magnet, height of magnet, shifted length of magnet pole, length and height of <b>armature</b> and <b>slot</b> width. If flux density distribution can be described by geometric parameters {{that are related to}} the force ripple and force ripple is described by the flux density distribution, the optimal design can be done by considering force ripple as cost function and geometric parameters as design variables. In this paper, at first, flux density distribution in the air gap is calculated by analytic solution of Laplace and Possion equations in the function of geometric parameters.

40|$|Permanent magnet (PM) {{and field}} {{excitation}} coil (FEC) in hybrid excitation machine (HEMs) {{act as a}} main flux sources which has numerous attractive features compared to interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSM) usually employed in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The advantage of both permanent magnet and field excitation coil located on the stator is robust rotor structure alike with switch reluctance machine (SRM). Furthermore, this machine becoming more attractive because of variable flux control capabilities from FEC, which is appropriate to be applied for high-speed motor drive systems. This HEM can be categorized as hybrid excitation flux switching machine (HEFSM). In this paper, a novel 12 Slot- 10 Pole HEFSM in which the FEC is wounded in radial direction on the stator is proposed for traction drives in HEVs. The design target of maximum torque and power are 303 Nm and 123 kW, respectively.

50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{lines of}} flux have {{to attract and}} pull the armature in contact with it to complete engagement. Most industrial couplings use {{what is called a}} single flux, two pole design (A-2). Mobile clutches of other specialty electromagnetic clutches can use a double or triple flux rotor (A-4). The double or trip flux refers to the number of north/south flux paths (A-6), in the rotor and <b>armature.</b> These <b>slots</b> (banana slots) (A-7) create an air gap which causes the flux path to take {{the path of least resistance}} when the faces are engaged. This means that, if the armature is designed properly and has similar banana slots, what occurs is a leaping of the flux path, which goes north south, north south (A-6). By having more points of contact, the torque can be greatly increased. In theory, if there were 2 sets of poles at the same diameter, the torque would double in a clutch. Obviously, that is not possible to do, so the points of contact have to be at a smaller inner diameter. Also, there are magnetic flux losses because of the bridges between the banana slots. But by using a double flux design, a 30%-50% increase in torque, can be achieved, and by using a triple flux design, a 40%-90% in torque can be achieved. This is important in applications where size and weight are critical, such as automotive requirements.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{solution of the}} eddy currents in the permanent magnets (PMs) in the Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (AFPMSM) using a coupled solution of Maxwell’s equations and electric circuit network. This is based on calculating the axial field in an accurate way {{on the surface of}} the PM. This method is able to take into account the effect of <b>armature</b> field and <b>slots.</b> The eddy currents are obtained by imposing this solution on the PM which is modeled by a simple electric network. This network is composed of simple resistances and inductances. The inductances are used to model the reaction field effect of the eddy currents flowing through the PM and also the skin effect. To show this effect, the machine is excited with different sources at different speeds. Also, a variant of the model is made that neglects the inductances, in order to show in which conditions this "low-frequency approximation" is acceptable. It is concluded from this paper that inclusion of the reaction field is necessary when the machine is excited by a pulse width modulated (PWM) current, while for a sinusoidal excitation, the reaction field effect has minor contributions to the total eddy losses. In addition, the reaction field has major influence at higher speeds rather than lower speeds for PWM injection. In conclusions, for a preliminary design, the resistance model without the reaction field computation would be enough for the calculation of the PM losses. The circuit model is also capable of obtaining the solution with PM segmentation. In this paper different PM segments were studied from the circuit model and FE model point of view. Compared to the Finite Element (FE) Model, the circuit model has the advantage of flexibility in geometrical machine parameters, less CPU time, and accurate results for the PM losses up to 10 %...|$|R
