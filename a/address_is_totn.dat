40|$|The first {{question}} to be asked in any consideration of <b>addressing</b> <b>is</b> what are the types of object for which <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> being provided? The {{most common form of}} an <b>address</b> <b>is</b> the postal <b>address.</b> In this case, the “addressable object” is the postal delivery point. This <b>address</b> <b>is</b> frequently used as a synonym for the building, be it residential, commercial or public, and for referencing purposes beyond the delivery of mail. The <b>address</b> <b>is</b> usually built around a property identifier (e. g. building number or name), street name, and a sequence of geographic areas (town, county, country etc). However, {{there is no reason why}} <b>addresses</b> should <b>be</b> restricted to buildings. This paper discusses the requirement for addresses, how <b>addresses</b> can <b>be</b> created for a range of classes of addressable object, and outlines a definitive <b>address</b> infrastructure.

50|$|The debug <b>address</b> {{registers}} <b>are</b> effective {{whether or}} not paging <b>is</b> enabled. The <b>addresses</b> in these registers <b>are</b> linear <b>addresses.</b> If paging <b>is</b> enabled, the linear <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> translated into physical addresses by the processor's paging mechanism. If paging is not enabled, these linear <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> the same as physical addresses.|$|R

50|$|In the {{automatic}} address configuration process, network hosts select a random candidate address within the reserved range and use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) probes to ascertain that the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> {{not in use}} on the network. If a reply is received to the ARP, it indicates the candidate IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> already in use; a new random candidate IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> then created and the process repeated. The process ends {{when there is no}} reply to the ARP, indicating the candidate IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> available.|$|R

50|$|Universally {{administered}} and locally administered <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished by}} setting the second-least-significant {{bit of the}} first octet of the <b>address.</b> This bit <b>is</b> {{also referred to as}} the U/L bit, short for Universal/Local, which identifies how the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> administered. If the bit <b>is</b> 0, the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> universally administered. If it <b>is</b> 1, the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> locally administered. In the example address 06-00-00-00-00-00 the first octet is 06 (hex), the binary form of which is 00000110, where the second-least-significant bit is 1. Therefore, it is a locally administered address. Consequently, this bit is 0 in all OUIs.|$|R
50|$|These <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> {{only valid}} on the link, {{such as a}} local network segment or {{point-to-point}} connection, that a host is connected to. These <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> not routable and like private <b>addresses</b> cannot <b>be</b> the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.|$|R
50|$|Anycast <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> {{syntactically}} {{identical to}} and indistinguishable from unicast addresses. Their {{only difference is}} administrative. Scopes for anycast <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> therefore {{the same as for}} unicast addresses.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{users are}} able to choose a range of IP {{addresses}} for their VPC. Within this range, users can assign various private and public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to instances in the VPC in order {{to communicate with the}} Internet and other instances of VPCs. These <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> assigned to specific instances rather than the user's entire VPC account.Static assignment of Public IP <b>addresses</b> <b>is</b> not possible, instead the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> assigned and unassigned in certain cases, causing the address of an instance to change. When a consistent IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> needed, a third type of IP Address, Elastic IP <b>addresses,</b> can <b>be</b> used in place of Public IP addresses.|$|R

50|$|RFC 3927 {{defines the}} special address block 169.254.0.0/16 for link-local <b>addressing.</b> These <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> only valid on links (such {{as a local}} network segment or {{point-to-point}} connection) connected to a host. These <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> not routable. Like private addresses, these <b>addresses</b> cannot <b>be</b> the source or destination of packets traversing the internet. These <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> primarily used for address autoconfiguration (Zeroconf) when a host cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server or other internal configuration methods.|$|R
