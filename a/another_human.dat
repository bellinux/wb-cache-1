5|$|Shepard {{is brought}} to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to {{investigate}} a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues about the Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors. The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned. Shepard is given command of a new starship, the Normandy SR-2, piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI, and begins to assemble a team to stop the Collectors. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that <b>another</b> <b>human</b> colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard successfully defends the colony, but is unable to stop {{a large portion of}} the population from being captured.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. <b>Another</b> <b>human</b> example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E

50|$|The {{preferred}} transition {{speed is}} {{the speed at}} which an organism typically changes from one gait to <b>another.</b> <b>Humans</b> spontaneously switch from a walk to a run as speed increases. In humans, the preferred transition speed from walking to running typically occurs around 2.0 m/s (4.5 mph), although slight differences have been shown based on testing methodology.|$|R
25|$|When {{an object}} is {{partially}} blocked by <b>another,</b> <b>humans</b> unconsciously {{tend to make}} up for it and complete the shapes (See Amodal perception). It has however been demonstrated that pigeons do not complete occluded shapes. A study based on altering the grey level of a perch that was coloured differently from the background showed that budgerigars do not detect edges based on colours.|$|R

25|$|There {{is greater}} {{substance}} {{in this film}} than just a cultural exchange. When Brummies Met Sindhis taps into the human being’s ability to connect with <b>another</b> <b>human</b> being, irrespective of race, creed, religion, profession, or location even.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>human</b> freed by Morpheus, but one who regrets {{taking the}} red pill {{and seeks to}} be {{returned}} to the Matrix. Pantoliano had worked with the Wachowskis prior to appearing in The Matrix, starring in their 1996 film Bound.|$|E
50|$|Dæmons {{frequently}} {{interact with}} each other in ways that mirror the behaviour of their humans, such as fighting one <b>another</b> when their <b>humans</b> are fighting, or nuzzling one <b>another</b> when their <b>humans</b> embrace, and such contact between dæmons is unremarkable.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the human}} brain is {{organized}} into areas {{that focus on the}} processing of distinct sensory input and output and also interact with one <b>another,</b> <b>humans</b> are assumed to learn and perform best in processing those patterns of information for which their neurophysiological system has been evolved. Mental representations manifest, for example, in human long-term memory (Figure 1). Other evidence for massive modularity is that human cognitive performance for respective domains correlates with the degree of damage to the corresponding cortical areas.|$|R

25|$|Human {{evolutionary}} genetics studies how one human genome differs from <b>another</b> <b>human</b> genome, the evolutionary past {{that gave rise}} to it, and its current effects. Differences between genomes have anthropological, medical and forensic implications and applications. Genetic data can provide important insight into human evolution.|$|E
25|$|Dennett and Harris have {{asserted}} that theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made to fulfill social, biological, and political needs. Dawkins balances {{the benefits of}} religious beliefs (mental solace, community-building, promotion of virtuous behavior) against the drawbacks. Such criticisms treat religion as a social construct and thus just <b>another</b> <b>human</b> ideology.|$|E
25|$|Kriyamana is {{everything}} that we produce in the current life. All kriyamana karmas flow in to sanchita karma and consequently shape our future. Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma until we are born again in <b>another</b> <b>human</b> body.|$|E

25|$|These {{particular}} laws allow Robocop to harm a {{human being}} {{in order to protect}} <b>another</b> <b>human,</b> fulfilling his role as would a human law enforcement officer. The classified fourth directive is one that forbids him from harming any OCP employee, as OCP had created him, and this command overrides the others, meaning that he could not cause harm to an employee even in order to protect others.|$|E
25|$|Article 17 {{provides}} {{that no one}} may use the rights guaranteed by the Convention to seek the abolition or limitation of rights guaranteed in the Convention. This addresses instances where states seek to restrict a human right {{in the name of}} <b>another</b> <b>human</b> right, or where individuals rely on a human right to undermine other human rights (for example where an individual issues a death threat).|$|E
25|$|Superboy first meets <b>another</b> <b>human</b> {{survivor}} of Krypton, Klax-Ar, a villain who claims he destroyed the planet, in Superboy #67 (1958). Three years later, both the Phantom Zone and its most infamous occupant, General Zod, make their first appearances in Adventure Comics #283 (1961), {{in a story}} that features Superboy accidentally trapping himself in the Phantom Zone after a cache of dangerous Kryptonian weapons arrives on Earth. Zod and other Phantom Zone villains would become recurring villains in Superboy stories, {{and go on to}} plague Superman.|$|E
25|$|Sevarta (chedaprstha) samhanana nama-karma gives quite a weak joining, {{by which}} {{the ends of the}} bones only touch one <b>another.</b> The <b>humans</b> in this era as per Jain {{cosmology}} have this type of joint structure.|$|R

25|$|Kyōya is <b>another</b> <b>human</b> who {{was sent}} to this world by Aqua. He was given a cursed sword known as Gram as his chosen item upon entry, but loses it in a fight to Kazuma, who uses his Steal skill to swipe it. Kazuma later pawns it off for extra money. Kyōya parties with two girls, spear and dagger users, by his side. When word of the Chivalrous Thief's burglaries spreads, Kyōya is summoned to the capital {{to serve as a}} guard.|$|E
25|$|The {{book has}} three storylines or {{intertwined}} layers. In one level it describes {{in a form}} of a journal the actual incidents in chronological order, a 5-month period from March to August 2009. In other level it ponders the author's inner feelings and anxieties in a difficult and unprecedented circumstances. And yet in another level the text contains ethical and moral reflections pertaining universal questions of helping <b>another</b> <b>human</b> beings referring, among others, to sociologist Zygmunt Bauman and philosopher Peter Singer, especially his Practical Ethics and The Life You Can Save.|$|E
25|$|Idolatry is {{prohibited}} in many biblical passages, {{although there is}} no single section that contains a complete definition. Rather {{there are a number of}} commandments on this subject spread through the books of the Tanakh, and taking these passages together, idolatry may be defined as the worship of idols (or images); the worship of polytheistic gods by use of idols (or images); the worship of created things (trees, rocks, animals, astronomical bodies, or <b>another</b> <b>human</b> being); and even the use of idols in the worship of the God of Israel.|$|E

25|$|Her most {{important}} {{work is the}} monograph Intention (1957). Three volumes of collected papers were published in 1981: From Parmenides to Wittgenstein; Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Mind; and Ethics, Religion and Politics. <b>Another</b> collection, <b>Human</b> Life, Action and Ethics appeared posthumously in 2005.|$|R
25|$|Kelavkar and Badr (1999) {{stated that}} the ALOX15 gene maps to 17p13.3 in close {{proximity}} to the tumor-suppressor gene TP53 (191170). In humans, it is encoded by the ALOX15 gene located on chromosome 17p13.3. This 11 kilobase pair gene consists of 14 exons and 13 introns coding for a 75 kiloDalton protein composed of 662 amino acids. 15-LO is to be distinguished from <b>another</b> <b>human</b> 15-lipoxygenase enzyme, ALOX15B (also termed 15-lipoxygenase-2). Orthologs of ALOX15, termed Alox15, are widely distributed in animal and plant species but commonly have different enzyme activities and make somewhat different products than ALOX15.|$|E
25|$|During John Byrne's {{run in the}} 1980s, Doom {{attempted}} to steal the cosmic powers of Terrax, but Doom's body was destroyed in the resulting fight between Terrax and the Silver Surfer. Doom survived by transferring his consciousness to <b>another</b> <b>human,</b> and is returned to his original body by the Beyonder (who had reached into the relative future to 'recruit' Doom for the conflict on Battleworld that the FF had participated {{in a few months}} ago from their perspective). While on Battleworld, Doom attempted and briefly succeeded in stealing the Beyonder's power, but it proves too vast for him to control and the disembodied Beyonder is able to take his power back.|$|E
25|$|Inhaled benzene is {{primarily}} expelled unchanged through exhalation. In a human study 16.4 to 41.6% of retained benzene was eliminated through the lungs within {{five to seven}} hours after a two- to three-hour exposure to 47 to 110 ppm and only 0.07 to 0.2% of the remaining benzene was excreted unchanged in the urine. After exposure to 63 to 405mg/m3 of benzene for 1 to 5 hours, 51 to 87% was excreted in the urine as phenol {{over a period of}} 23 to 50 hours. In <b>another</b> <b>human</b> study, 30% of absorbed dermally applied benzene, which {{is primarily}} metabolized in the liver, was excreted as phenol in the urine.|$|E
