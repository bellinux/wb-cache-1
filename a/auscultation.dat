5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and <b>auscultation</b> are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (<b>auscultation).</b> It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and <b>auscultation</b> of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
25|$|It was {{recently}} demonstrated that continuous Doppler enables the <b>auscultation</b> of valvular movements and {{blood flow sounds}} that are undetected during cardiac examination with a stethoscope in adults. The Doppler <b>auscultation</b> presented a sensitivity of 84% {{for the detection of}} aortic regurgitations while classic stethoscope <b>auscultation</b> presented a sensitivity of 58%. Moreover, Doppler <b>auscultation</b> was superior in the detection of impaired ventricular relaxation. Since the physics of Doppler <b>auscultation</b> and classic <b>auscultation</b> are different, {{it has been suggested that}} both methods could complement each other.|$|E
25|$|Early {{detection}} of pathology {{can be the}} difference between life and death. CADe can be done by <b>auscultation</b> with a digital stethoscope and specialized software, also known as Computer-aided <b>auscultation.</b> Murmurs, irregular heart sounds, caused by blood flowing through a defective heart, can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity. Computer-aided <b>auscultation</b> is sensitive to external noise and bodily sounds and requires an almost silent environment to function accurately.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auscultation</b> {{refers to}} {{listening}} for particular sounds (such as wheezing).|$|E
25|$|In TCM, {{there are}} five {{diagnostic}} methods: inspection, <b>auscultation,</b> olfaction, inquiry, and palpation.|$|E
25|$|A {{military}} noise-immune Doppler based stethoscope {{has recently}} been developed for <b>auscultation</b> of patients in loud sound environments (up to 110dB).|$|E
25|$|Electronic stethoscopes {{are also}} used with Computer-aided <b>Auscultation</b> {{programs}} to analyze the recorded heart sounds pathological or innocent heart murmurs.|$|E
25|$|A gallop rhythm {{refers to}} a (usually abnormal) rhythm of the heart on <b>auscultation.</b> It {{includes}} three or four sounds, thus resembling {{the sounds of a}} gallop.|$|E
25|$|The {{temporomandibular}} joints can be palpated {{anterior to}} or within the {{external acoustic meatus}} during movements of the mandible. <b>Auscultation</b> of the joint can also be done.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination is {{the examination of}} the patient for medical signs of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable. The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of {{physical examination}}: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and <b>auscultation</b> (listen), generally in that order although <b>auscultation</b> occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.|$|E
25|$|Most {{individuals}} with a significant ASD are diagnosed in utero or in early childhood {{with the use of}} ultrasonography or <b>auscultation</b> of the heart sounds during physical examination.|$|E
25|$|Pectus excavatum is {{initially}} suspected from visual {{examination of the}} anterior chest. <b>Auscultation</b> of the chest can reveal displaced heart beat and valve prolapse. There can be a heart murmur occurring during systole caused by proximity between the sternum and the pulmonary artery.|$|E
25|$|A 3D-printed {{stethoscope}} is an open-source {{medical device}} meant for <b>auscultation</b> and manufactured via means of 3D printing. The 3D stethoscope {{was developed by}} Dr. Tarek Loubani {{and a team of}} medical and technology specialists. The 3D-stethoscope was developed as part of the Glia project, and its design is open source from the outset. The stethoscope gained widespread media coverage in Summer 2015.|$|E
25|$|Using {{electronic}} stethoscopes, it {{is possible}} to record heart sounds via direct output to an external recording device, such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded <b>auscultation</b> through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study of murmurs and other heart sounds, for general research as well as evaluation of a particular patient's condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination {{of an individual}} with aortic insufficiency involves <b>auscultation</b> of the heart to listen for the murmur of aortic insufficiency and the S3 heart sound (S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction). The murmur of chronic aortic insufficiency is typically described as early diastolic and decrescendo, which is best heard in the third left intercostal space and may radiate along the left sternal border.|$|E
25|$|Some {{electronic}} stethoscopes feature direct {{audio output}} {{that can be}} used with an external recording device, such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded <b>auscultation</b> through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study for general research as well as evaluation and consultation regarding a particular patient's condition and telemedicine, or remote diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Upon <b>auscultation</b> of an {{individual}} with mitral stenosis, the first heart sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) because of increased force in closing the mitral valve. The first heart sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid heart valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{factors that}} {{influence}} a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not include: cost of the test, availability of additional tests, potential interference with subsequent test (such as an abdominal palpation potentially inducing intestinal activity whose sounds interfere with a subsequent abdominal <b>auscultation),</b> time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful {{for the establishment of}} statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, Irish {{physician}} Arthur Leared {{invented a}} binaural stethoscope and, in 1852, George Philip Cammann perfected {{the design of}} the stethoscope instrument (that used both ears) for commercial production, which has become the standard ever since. Cammann also wrote a major treatise on diagnosis by <b>auscultation,</b> which the refined binaural stethoscope made possible. By 1873, there were descriptions of a differential stethoscope that could connect to slightly different locations to create a slight stereo effect, though this did not become a standard tool in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Rectal {{temperature}} {{can help}} ascertain if an infectious or inflammatory cause {{is to blame}} for the colic, which is suspected if the temperature if >103F. Temperature should be taken prior to rectal examination, as the introduction of air will falsely lower rectal temperature. Coolness of extremities can indicate decreased perfusion secondary to endotoxemia. Elevated respiratory rate can indicate pain as well as acid-base disturbances. A rectal examination, <b>auscultation</b> of the abdomen, and nasogastric intubation should always occur in addition to the basic physical exam.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} physicians dedicated to the study of phthisiology was René Laennec, who died from the disease at the age of 45, after contracting tuberculosis while studying contagious patients and infected bodies. Laennec invented the stethoscope which he used to corroborate his auscultatory findings and prove the correspondence between the pulmonary lesions found on the lungs of autopsied tuberculosis patients and the respiratory symptoms seen in living patients. His most important work was Traité de l’Auscultación Mediate which detailed his discoveries on the utility of pulmonary <b>auscultation</b> in diagnosing tuberculosis. This book was promptly translated into English by John Forbes in 1821; it represents the beginning of the modern scientific understanding of tuberculosis. Laennec was named professional chair of Hôpital Necker in September 1816 and today he is considered the greatest French clinician.|$|E
25|$|AF {{can cause}} {{respiratory}} distress due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, {{the heart rate}} will be greater than 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) non-invasive blood pressure monitors. For this reason, when determining heart rate in AF, direct cardiac <b>auscultation</b> is recommended. Low blood pressure is most concerning and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation {{of congestive heart failure}} due to the reduced cardiac output. Respiratory rate will be increased in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of hypoxia related to any precipitating factors such as pneumonia. Examination of the jugular veins may reveal elevated pressure (jugular venous distention). Lung exam may reveal crackles, which are suggestive of pulmonary edema. Heart exam will reveal a rapid irregular rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by history, {{environmental}} conditions, <b>auscultation</b> of the ventral abdomen, radiographs, ultrasound, or fecal examination (See Diagnosis). Historically, medical {{treatment of the}} problem is with laxatives such as liquid paraffin or oil and psyllium husk. More recently veterinarians treat cases with specific synbiotic (pro and prebiotic) and psyllium combinations. Psyllium is the most effective medical treatment. It works by binding to the sand to help remove it, although multiple treatments may be required. Mineral oil is mostly ineffective since it floats {{on the surface of the}} impaction, rather than penetrating it. Horses with sand or dirt impaction are predisposed to Salmonella infection and other Gi bacteria, so antibiotics are often added to help prevent infection. Medical management usually resolves the colic, but if improvement doesn't occur within a few hours then surgery must be performed to flush the colon of any sand, which procedure that has a 60–65% survival rate. Horses that are not treated, or treated too late after the onset of clinical signs, are at risk of death.|$|E
25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be {{the presence of a}} pleural effusion, which can be noted on <b>auscultation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Auscultation</b> of {{the abdomen}} is {{subjective}} and non-specific, {{but can be}} useful. <b>Auscultation</b> typically is performed in a four-quadrant approach: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Auscultation</b> of {{the heart}} can be {{undertaken}} by medical professionals ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{advanced}} diagnostic skills (using {{and interpreting}} ECG, <b>auscultation,</b> neurological examination) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Auscultation</b> and {{percussion}} of {{the chest}} by using a stethoscope to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon <b>auscultation</b> of {{the heart}} sounds, [...] a {{systolic}} ejection murmur may be heard that is attributed to the pulmonic valve, due to the increased flow of blood through the pulmonic valve rather than any structural abnormality of the valve leaflets.|$|E
2500|$|Active {{models that}} attempt to {{reproduce}} living anatomy or physiology are recent developments. The famous [...] "Harvey" [...] mannequin was developed at the University of Miami {{and is able to}} recreate many of the physical findings of the cardiology examination, including palpation, <b>auscultation,</b> and electrocardiography.|$|E
2500|$|In {{traditional}} acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which {{points to}} treat by observing and questioning {{the patient to}} make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, <b>auscultation</b> and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge. <b>Auscultation</b> and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing, and observing body odor. Inquiring involves focusing on the [...] "seven inquiries": chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and menses and leukorrhea. Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender [...] "A-shi" [...] points and feeling the pulse.|$|E
2500|$|Heart sounds {{result from}} {{reverberation}} within the blood {{associated with the}} sudden block of flow reversal by the valves closing. Because of this, <b>auscultation</b> to determine function of a valve is usually not performed at {{the position of the}} valve, but at the position to where the sound waves reverberate.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with {{symptoms}} of CAP require evaluation. Diagnosis of pneumonia is made clinically, {{rather than on}} the basis of a particular test. Evaluation begins with a physical examination by a health provider, which may reveal fever, an increased respiratory rate (tachypnea), low blood pressure (hypotension), a fast heart rate (tachycardia) and changes in the amount of oxygen in the blood. Palpating the chest as it expands and tapping the chest wall (percussion) to identify dull, non-resonant areas can identify stiffness and fluid, signs of CAP. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope (<b>auscultation)</b> can also reveal signs associated with CAP. A lack of normal breath sounds or the presence of crackles can indicate fluid consolidation. Increased vibration of the chest when speaking, known as tactile fremitus, and increased volume of whispered speech during <b>auscultation</b> can also indicate fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Heart {{sounds are}} the noises {{generated}} by the beating heart and the resultant flow of blood through it. Specifically, the sounds reflect the turbulence created when the heart valves snap shut. In cardiac <b>auscultation,</b> an examiner may use a stethoscope to listen for these unique and distinct sounds that provide important auditory data regarding {{the condition of the}} heart.|$|E
