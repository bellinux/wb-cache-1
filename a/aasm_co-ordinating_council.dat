The adoption of a Marine Strategy for the monitoring and management of dugong and turtle populations in the seas around the islands was undertaken in 1999. In 2006, successful lobby by the authority and the ICC resulted in the granting of $300,000 from the Federal Government to study the risks of climate change on the six largest Torres Strait Islands. In 2010, after a nine-year legal battle, the TSRA made a successful native title claim to 40,000 km² of sea between Cape York Peninsula and Papua New Guinea. This was the largest native title claim in Australia's history.|$|R

In the following year Getano Lui Jnr., Chair of the ICC, made a number of public statements about the aspirations of ‘Torres Strait Islanders for self-government, most notably in his Boyer lecture, which made the point that {{there were a number of}} Australian territories with ‘tailor-made’ constitutions, and that there was ‘noreason why a ‘Torres Strait regional government could not be devised’.

50|$|The party {{grew from}} {{an attempt by}} Ivanov-Sukharevsky to get himself elected to the <b>Co-ordinating</b> <b>Council</b> of the Russian All-People's Union in January 1994. Although a fairly {{well-known}} figure {{he was not a}} member of this party and in a vote he was narrowly defeated in his aspiration. He linked up with Vyacheslav Demin, the editor of the journal Zemshchina and the two set about establishing a party that they claimed would represent the Russian Orthodox Church. The new group adopted the name Movement of Popular Nationalists and Ivanov-Sukharevsky was chosen as chairman upon its establishment in October 1994. In December the group merged with a group based around Vladimir Popov's Era Rossii magazine, the National-Socialist Movement(a group that fused neo-Nazism and monarchism in what was a not uncommon feature of the Russian far right), to form the NNP proper.|$|R

40|$|The Newfoundland <b>Co-ordinating</b> <b>Council</b> on Deafness is an {{organization}} concerned with {{the welfare of the}} deaf and with any agency or individual involved with the deaf. A needs assessment revealed that the production of a videotape series to teach sign language would aid the council in better fulfilling their mandate, and would also be beneficial to hearing parents of deaf children and to individuals who might have interactions with deaf individuals. A learner analysis examined the characteristics of the primary and secondary audiences, and a task analysis was devised to identify the necessary tasks which would be incorporated into the instructional package. Behavioral objectives were delineated, and a Likert scale questionnaire was developed to evaluate the actual learning experience. The videotape series and accompanying viewing guide were designed and produced in consultation with various experts. The package was pilot tested in rough form and changes were incorporated into the package. It was then final tested, and the results of the testing indicated that the package was successful in teaching the basics of sign language to both audiences. It was recommended that a Signs of Sound II instructional videotape series be produced as a continuation of the initial series, to deal with more advanced concepts and vocabulary...|$|R

40|$|MM - P&DMIn February 1990 {{the then}} State President put 42 years of {{apartheid}} ideology {{to rest and}} put the country on a new path of hope, by un-banning the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC). Negotiations for a democratic South Africa were initiated and were as inclusive as possible culminating in the Congress for Democratic South Africa (CODESA). The parties concerned negotiated an acceptable political solution for South Africa and in November 1993 the Transitional Executive Authority (TEC) was established. Subsequently the Sub-Council for Defence (SCD) was created. It later created the Joint Military <b>Co-ordinating</b> <b>Council,</b> which was charged with the integration process of all armed forces presented in the TEC. In 1994 the integration of seven military establishments who were former adversaries began in South Africa. This study examines the integration process of these seven armies and the demobilisation of those ex-combatants {{who could not be}} integrated into the new South African National Defence (SANDF). The seven armies that were integrated were uMKhonto we Sizwe (MK) and the Azanian People’s Liberation Army (APLA), the military wings of the ANC and PAC respectively; the former Bantustan Armies of Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; and the South African Defence Force (SADF). The experiences of Zimbabwe and Namibia are also examined in order to deepen the understanding and analysis of this research paper. These countries have, been chosen because of their similarities with the South African situation. The ex-combatants of these countries have not only shared camps with MK and APLA, but have also inspired them...|$|R
