5|$|<b>Asbestos</b> {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and <b>asbestos</b> have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with <b>asbestos,</b> the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. <b>Asbestos</b> can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|Glass fiber has {{increased}} in popularity since the discovery that <b>asbestos</b> causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products. However, the safety of glass fiber is also being called into question, as {{research shows that the}} composition of this material (<b>asbestos</b> and glass fiber are both silicate fibers) can cause similar toxicity as <b>asbestos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dion {{moved to}} <b>Asbestos,</b> Quebec after the {{conclusion}} of his hockey career and {{became involved in the}} local minor hockey movement, often in the capacity of a referee. He helped establish an arena in the city, the Centre Récréatif d'Asbestos, in 1954, which was later renamed Aréna Connie Dion. Since 1991, the <b>Asbestos</b> Minor Hockey Association has held an annual tournament at the arena in his honor. He also became involved in golf, designing several courses and helping lay foundations for the sport in <b>Asbestos.</b> He had a local tournament named after him in this sport as well, the inaugural edition of which was held in 1973. He was married to Muriel Flanigan, who died in 2011, and had four sons, Paul, Skip, Bob, and Mickey, and one daughter, Carol-Ann. He died on November 7, 2014 at the age of 96 at the Centre de Santé et Service Sociaux in <b>Asbestos,</b> following a two-week period of hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study using}} rats {{found that the}} biopersistence of {{synthetic}} fibers after one year was 0.04–10%, but 27% for amosite <b>asbestos.</b> Fibers that persisted longer {{were found to be}} more carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|After {{being traded}} {{down to the}} American Hockey League (AHL) in 1945, Dion {{continued}} to play professional hockey for nearly a decade, primarily with the Buffalo Bisons, and earned the Harry Hap Holmes Memorial Award in 1950 by being the goaltender with the lowest goals against average in the league. He retired from active competition in 1954 and moved to <b>Asbestos,</b> Quebec, where he {{was active in the}} local ice hockey and golf scenes. The arena in <b>Asbestos,</b> Aréna Connie Dion, is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely {{threat to the}} species is expansion of <b>asbestos</b> mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse of abandoned <b>asbestos</b> mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine. None of the sites are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. The species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{building}} likely used <b>asbestos</b> shingles {{for the front}} roofing, though {{they may have been}} removed by later renovations.|$|E
5|$|In April 1970, the New York City Department of Air Resources ordered {{contractors}} {{building the}} World Trade Center {{to stop the}} spraying of <b>asbestos</b> as an insulating material.|$|E

5|$|The Algo Centre Mall {{may contain}} <b>asbestos</b> {{which may have}} been {{released}} during the collapse and rescue demolition of the mall.|$|E
5|$|The headquarter's {{buildings}} {{have come to}} need extensive renovation, including the need to install sprinklers, fix leaks, and remove <b>asbestos.</b> Expansion has also come to be needed.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{military}} veterans have a 25–50% {{higher rate}} of lung cancer primarily due to higher rates of smoking. During World War Two and the Korean War <b>asbestos</b> also played a part and Agent Orange may have caused some problems during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|James Hargreaves (1834–1915) was {{a chemist}} and inventor, who, along with Thomas Bird, {{developed}} {{a process for}} the electrolysis of brine using <b>asbestos</b> diaphragms. In 1899, he became director of the newly opened General Electrolytic Alkali Company at Middlewich.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{was then}} the second largest gold {{producer}} in the world, after South Africa. The colony's gold output had expanded greatly during the 1930s, and it remained the territory's main source of income during the war, though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals, most prominently chrome and <b>asbestos.</b> Southern Rhodesia {{became one of the}} two main sources of chrome for the Allies (South Africa was the other) and the world's third largest producer of <b>asbestos</b> after Canada and the Soviet Union. By {{the end of the war}} the mines at Shabani and Mashaba were turning out 1.5million tonnes of <b>asbestos</b> a year, in addition to 600,000 tonnes of chrome. Gold output reached peak levels in 1941–42 and thereafter subsided. Southern Rhodesia also exported tungsten, mica and tin, and provided coal for the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. The Southern Rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit the colony's natural resources and increase production, but also set up some state industries in an attempt to spark growth. The establishment of the RATG prompted a minor economic boom, and also caused the primary direct demand placed on Southern Rhodesia's black population during the early stages of the war—a programme of conscripted labour to build the aerodromes.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{continued to}} serve as the headquarters for the Perth City Council from its completion until 1994, when it was vacated to allow for the removal of <b>asbestos</b> which had been used to insulate the building's steel frame. The Council moved to office space in the Westralia Square building.|$|E
5|$|A brick privy with a {{gabled roof}} clad in {{corrugated}} <b>asbestos</b> sheeting is located {{to the north}} of the cottage building. It was probably constructed circa 1930. Further north is the workshop building, which also housed the electricity generators at one point, dating from the 1950s. It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete mounting blocks. Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E
5|$|As a fleet flagship, her {{complement}} was 115 {{officers and}} 1,860 men in 1947. Air conditioning was provided {{for many of}} the ship's control spaces, and <b>asbestos</b> insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and bulkheads. Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make Vanguard suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around Vanguard.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of <b>asbestos</b> exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from <b>asbestos,</b> and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its limited}} {{distribution}} and similarity to other Adiantum species within its range, {{little is known}} of its ecology. It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered with thin soil, such as road cuts, talus slopes, and <b>asbestos</b> mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the alien nest were shot at the {{decommissioned}} Acton Lane Power Station in Acton, London. The crew {{thought it was a}} perfect place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors, but had to spend money to remove <b>asbestos</b> from the station. The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman (1989).|$|E
5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from <b>asbestos</b> mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The fern {{thrives in}} thin {{serpentine}} soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure {{in many of}} these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in <b>asbestos</b> mines, both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|The stable was {{designed}} by McKim, Mead & White and built in the late 19th century using the same yellow brick used for the main residence. The stable is {{two and a half}} stories high, 29 bays wide, and 5bays deep, and it has a gable roof covered with <b>asbestos</b> shingles that replaced its original ceramic tile. On the roof's ridge sits a shallow monitor, flanked by two taller octangular monitors with louvered ventilating elements and bell-cast copper roofs.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, <b>asbestos,</b> second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E
5|$|After the Sounds vacated Greer, Mayor Dean {{expressed}} interest in converting the facility to a community sporting complex or a new city park, but, {{nearing the end of}} his term, ultimately deferred the decision to the next mayor (Megan Barry, elected 2015). In the meantime, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch recommended that the stadium be demolished due to the potential costs for any renovation, including the removal of <b>asbestos.</b> The department asked Mayor Barry for $800,000 to fund the demolition of the concourse and seating bowl so as to expand the green space at the property which could then be sold to private developers. , the ballpark, now dilapidated and vadazlied, is still standing.|$|E
5|$|Ames and {{his family}} resided in the house briefly, the Connecticut College {{acquired}} the house in 1949 and used it for faculty housing until 1986. The house {{was in a state}} of disrepair by 1989 and was a hazard due to its construction with <b>asbestos</b> panels. It was slated to be demolished, but Ms. Hendrickson rallied supporter to the save the house after uncovering its history. A restoration and rehabilitation project was completed in 1994 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The other prefabricated house built by Ames, House at 130 Mohegan Avenue, was also added the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 18 was {{released}} on CD and cassette in the United States, Australia, and Canada and on CD, LP, and cassette formats in European markets by Elektra Records. In 2013, a two-part CD compilation collected Apollo 18 and some contemporary B-sides along with the band's other Elektra studio albums and surrounding material. The album was also released on LP in the United States and Canada by <b>Asbestos</b> Records in 2014 {{as part of a}} series of LP reissues spanning They Might Be Giants's period on the Elektra label.|$|E
5|$|Dion {{was born}} on August 11, 1918 in Saint-Rémi-de-Tingwick, Quebec and had twelve siblings: six {{brothers}} and six sisters. He got his start as an ice hockey goaltender with the Junior Verdun Maple Leafs of the Quebec Junior Hockey League in 1937 and was selected {{as one of the}} goaltenders for the 1938 Memorial Cup All-Star team. He also played one game with the senior Maple Leafs that season. He served briefly in the Canadian Army in Cornwall, Ontario and also worked as an <b>asbestos</b> miner for Johns Manville prior to quitting that job to play professional hockey.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned {{of the dangers of}} <b>asbestos</b> in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an <b>asbestos</b> (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of <b>asbestos</b> or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is left of}} the old Ashford town centre, {{apart from}} a cluster of medieval half-timbered {{buildings}} in Middle Row and around the churchyard in the town centre. A number of old buildings were removed {{to make way for the}} controversial ring road around the centre, including four public houses. Further demolition was required to build Charter House, an eight-story office building for Charter Consolidated, that opened in 1975. Charter subsequently moved back to London in 1985, and the building is now being converted into flats, though progress stalled owing to the discovery of <b>asbestos.</b> Charter compensated for the demolition by funding a restoration scheme on North Street, preserving several historic buildings.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar {{was added to}} the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use of <b>asbestos</b> mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as <b>asbestos</b> and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|Radstock {{was one of}} the {{missions}} established in 1913 by the Downside community. A temporary building of thin wooden beams and <b>asbestos</b> blocks was erected in 1913, and dedicated to St Hugh. Its altar rails and benches came from Prior Park. Dom Mackey was succeeded in 1918 by Dom Ambrose Agius, who acquired a disused printing works, formerly a barn and converted it into the present church in Westfield, which opened in 1929. It was rebuilt after a serious fire in 1991. It has a statue of the patron on its façade.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} issued on CD, LP, and cassette. Upon its release, Flood {{was met with}} praise from critics and achieved moderate success on sales charts. In 2013, the album was reissued {{as part of a}} CD series spanning They Might Be Giants' four Elektra releases. In 2014, it was reissued on LP in Europe by Music On Vinyl and in the United States by <b>Asbestos</b> Records for Record Store Day and Black Friday. Another LP reissue is anticipated for 2015 from the band's label, Idlewild Recordings.|$|E
