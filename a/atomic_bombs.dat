5|$|The Dayton Project was a {{research}} and development project {{that was part of}} the larger Manhattan Project to build the first <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs.</b> Work took place at several sites in and around Dayton, Ohio. Those working on the project were ultimately responsible for creating the polonium-based modulated neutron initiators which were used to begin the chain reactions in the <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs.</b> The Dayton Project ran from 1943 to 1949, when the Mound Laboratories were completed in nearby Miamisburg, Ohio and the work moved there.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs</b> would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs</b> would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Around 11 {{metric tons}} of {{plutonium}} may be possessed by Japan alone, with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in Britain and France. This is probably enough to make 6,000 <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|E

Deployed to North Field, Tinian in late May 1945, flying non-combat missions practicing <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> delivery techniques. The squadron carried out two <b>Atomic</b> <b>Bombing</b> missions over Japan in August 1945, being the only squadron {{in the world to}} ever carry out and deliver nuclear weapons in combat. Dropped the first <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> on Hiroshima, Japan, on 6 August 1945, and the second <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> on Nagasaki, Japan, on 9 August 1945.|$|R

50|$|One of Khan's {{achievements}} is his technical {{leadership of}} the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> project, modelled on the Manhattan Project that prevented the exploitation and politicisation of the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> project {{into the hands of}} politicians, lawmakers, and the military officials. Khan focused on developing the atomic weapons and a diverse nuclear program, and regarded this clandestine <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> project as building the science and technology for the country.|$|R

5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs</b> on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs.</b> Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
5|$|Frank Harold Spedding (October 22, 1902 – December 15, 1984) was a Canadian American chemist. He was {{a renowned}} expert on rare earth elements, and on {{extraction}} of metals from minerals.

5|$|By late 1941, Pontecorvo {{was having}} {{difficulty}} securing the radioisotopes that he needed. Unbeknown to him, the Manhattan Project, the wartime {{effort to build}} <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs,</b> was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs.</b> In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects.|$|E
5|$|Franck {{participated in}} the Manhattan Project during World War II as Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory.
