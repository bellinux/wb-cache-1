2500|$|In Slate magazine, Hitchens {{pondered the}} notion that, instead of curing {{antisemitism}} {{through the creation}} of a Jewish state, [...] "Zionism has only replaced and repositioned" [...] it, saying: [...] "there are three groups of 6 million Jews. The first 6 million live in what the Zionist movement used to call Palestine. The second 6 million live in the United States. The third 6 million are distributed mainly among Russia, France, Britain, and Argentina. Only the first group lives daily in range of missiles that can be (and are) launched by people who hate Jews." [...] Hitchens argued that instead of supporting Zionism, Jews should help [...] "secularise and reform their own societies", believing that unless one is religious, [...] "what the hell <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> the greater Jerusalem area in the first place?" [...] Indeed, Hitchens claimed that the only justification for Zionism given by Jews is a religious one.|$|E

[...] Mrs. Sandusky said her husband was having a disagreement, including yelling, with the boy—in the bathroom but [...] "clothed"—about attending a luncheon. She went on to characterize the boy as [...] "very demanding. ... And he was very conniving. And he wanted his way, and he didn’t listen a whole lot." [...] Mrs. Sandusky testified when it was still uncertain whether her husband would testify. Though Sandusky's defense attorney Joe Amendola had said on the opening day of the trial that Sandusky would testify, Amendola ultimately rested the case without calling him to testify in his own defense.|$|E
