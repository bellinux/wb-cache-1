5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder {{seems to have been}} widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians <b>all</b> <b>got</b> firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It <b>all</b> <b>got</b> to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've <b>all</b> <b>got</b> professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{match at}} Guildford was shortened to 22 overs a side due to rain. However, the scores {{were similar to}} {{what could have been}} in a 45-over game, as Sussex Sharks amassed 219 for 9 - Murray Goodwin top-scoring with 44, while Luke Wright plundered three sixes in a 14-ball 35. The Surrey bowlers <b>all</b> <b>got</b> wickets - except for Ian Salisbury - but also conceded more than seven runs an over. A Surrey Lions side including three debutants - Stewart Walters, Rory Hamilton-Brown and Jake Dernbach - crumbled despite the efforts of Mark Ramprakash who made 63, as they were all out for 171.|$|E

25|$|Former England {{international}} Darren Gough {{took four}} wickets for 16 runs, including both opening batsmen, as Essex Eagles took a six-wicket win at Trent Bridge over Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{to keep their}} unbeaten record going and to go second in the table. Nottinghamshire were bowled out for 154 as Essex off-spinner James Middlebrook helped out Gough, taking two for 27 including the wicket of top-scorer David Hussey. Essex' batsmen <b>all</b> <b>got</b> past 20 in the chase – excluding Ravinder Bopara who made a duck – and captain Ronnie Irani, opening the batting, guided Essex to 94 for 2 with a run-a-ball 53. Andy Flower then took Essex to the target after putting on 50 with brother Grant.|$|E
25|$|In a high-scoring {{match at}} Richmond, Middlesex Crusaders made 174 for 7 having opted to bat first. Owais Shah made yet another fifty – his fifth in eight innings – while Scott Styris and Paul Weekes made quick scores {{to up the}} run-rate. Shaun Udal, Sean Ervine and Craig McMillan <b>all</b> <b>got</b> two wickets. Hampshire Hawks started slowly, at about seven an over, but McMillan took a liking to Chris Peploe in {{particular}} as he smashed five sixes in his half-hour 65 not out, and thanks to McMillan's big hitting Hampshire won with sixteen balls and six wickets to spare. However, it was in vain – with only three wins, they finished fourth in the South Division tables, while Middlesex qualified despite having a poorer net run rate than Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Surrey Lions were {{consistently}} pegged {{back by the}} Sussex Sharks' bowling at The Oval, having been put in to bat by Sussex captain Chris Adams. Azhar Mahmood stood firm and knocked off 40 unbeaten runs, but Naved-ul-Hasan, James Kirtley and Mushtaq Ahmed <b>all</b> <b>got</b> two wickets for less than six runs an over as Surrey eventually {{had to settle for}} 144 for 8. In reply, Ian Ward made a quickfire 50, off 28 balls, before being bowled by Surrey off-spinner Nayan Doshi to send Sussex to 82 for 3. Adams and Murray Goodwin both made 28, while Azhar Mahmood took two for 21 from four overs. Eventually, a six from Naved-ul-Hasan won Sussex the game with three balls to spare to put them third in the table, but as they were the poorest third-placed side in the competition with only three wins, they were still knocked out.|$|E

25|$|Len Hutton (80) and Bill Edrich (20) saw England {{though to}} stumps {{and took the}} score to 60 the next morning before the first wicket fell. Cowdrey (79) added 99 with Hutton looking certain for a century before he smashed the ball into Alan Davidson's back, where it lobbed up for an easy, if painful, catch. Colin Cowdrey and Denis Compton (44) took the score to 230/3 {{by the end of}} the day and England were {{confident}} of a first innings lead, but they both fell early next morning and though the lower middle order <b>all</b> <b>got</b> going the tail collapsed again and the last four wickets fell for 20 runs and the last seven wickets for 111. Still 341 was England's highest score so far in the series and gave them a slim 18 run lead, the leg-spinner Richie Benaud (4/120) doing most of the work.|$|E
25|$|Opener John Maunders batted {{for four}} hours for his first century of the first class season, and a further two hours to make a total of 148, which helped Leicestershire to a solid total of 407 at New Road - yet the slow nature of his batting meant there was little time to force a victory. Paul Nixon also hit a three-hour fifty for Leicestershire, while Kabir Ali got the best bowling figures with four for 95, {{including}} nine no-balls and one wide. Spinners Ray Price and Chris Gayle took {{a total of five}} wickets in their 32.1 overs, while both Shoaib Akhtar and Gareth Batty went wicketless. Worcestershire's batsmen <b>all</b> <b>got</b> starts, but not much more, and David Masters dug out both openers to end with three for 49 as Worcestershire were all out for 290 - Claude Henderson taking care of the last four wickets with nine balls, to end with four for 72 in the innings.|$|E
25|$|After Super Tuesday {{all five}} territories had their contests. Puerto Rico held a primary {{and the four}} smaller insular areas (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and U.S. Virgin Islands) had {{convention}} style caucuses where no straw polls were taken, therefore our table does not show popular vote percentages in these rows {{but the number of}} delegates committed to each candidate. Romney secured all but two delegates from the territories. Of the six selected delegates from the Virgin Islands, one was elected as uncommitted, and another bound to Paul. On the Virgin Islands every caucus goer had six votes that he or her could cast for six different delegates. Every person wanting to be a delegate needed to pledge to a candidate or declare to be 'uncommitted' before the voting started. The six persons with the most votes became National Convention delegates. Only four persons ran as delegates pledge to Romney and they <b>all</b> <b>got</b> elected. The persons that ran as delegates pledge to Paul got a plurality of the votes, but only one of them was elected.|$|E

25|$|On lap 2, Schumacher took {{second from}} Alesi {{after a couple}} of {{unsuccessful}} earlier attempts. The Frenchman had been holding Schumacher up while Senna pulled out a 4-second lead. Senna and Schumacher pulled away {{from the rest of the}} pack, increasing their lead by over a second a lap. Both pitted on lap 21 but Schumacher was quicker and rejoined ahead. He pulled away to take a 10-second lead but then Senna began to reel him in. By lap 35, Verstappen, Brundle and Eddie Irvine had <b>all</b> <b>got</b> ahead of Wendlinger. As they came up to lap Éric Bernard, Verstappen tried to pass Irvine. Irvine pushed him onto the grass and Verstappen spun off, going over Irvine and tipping it into Bernard's car and then hitting Brundle, being launched into a series of barrel rolls. No-one was hurt, but Irvine was banned initially for one race, later extended to three races by the FIA after an unsuccessful appeal. By now, Alesi, who had stopped twice, was behind Hill who had only stopped once.|$|E
25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and {{we were having a}} lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we <b>all</b> <b>got</b> along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E
