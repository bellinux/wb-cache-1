Among the more notable upgrades, the Los Peñasquitos Creek Arch Bridge, along the portion of former US395 now used by I-15, was built in 1949, and replaced in 1964, with a second span built in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57. In 1927, the entire highway was renumbered, and since this change, the trunkline has carried the M-75 moniker. The M-75 designation was left unaltered when US27 between Gaylord and Indian River was {{converted to a}} freeway; this freeway was redesignated as I-75 in 1962. Some states, such as California, do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number, {{which is not the}} case in Michigan. A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake. As of 2008, the highway remains unaltered since the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque style {{dominated}} the Polish culture from the 1580s, {{building on the}} achievements of the Renaissance and for a while coexisting with it, to the mid 18th century. Initially Baroque artists and intellectuals, torn between the two competing views of the world, enjoyed wide latitude and freedom of expression. Soon however the Counter-Reformation instituted a binding point of view that invoked the medieval tradition, imposed censorship in education and elsewhere (the index of prohibited books in Poland from 1617), <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> out their convoluted ways. By the middle of the 17th century the doctrine had been firmly reestablished, sarmatism and religious zealotry had become the norm. Artistic tastes of the epoch were often acquiring an increasingly Oriental character. In contrast with the integrative tendencies of the previous period, the burgher and nobility cultural spheres went their separate ways. Renaissance publicist Stanisław Orzechowski had already provided the foundations for Baroque szlachta's political thinking.|$|E

5|$|The first {{segments}} of {{road in the}} location of what would become FM 1528 existed by the year of 1936. On September 26, 1939, a portion of road traveling from SH 24 to the community of Klondike was designated as Spur Highway 39 (Spur 39). and on September 28, 1949, through {{the order of the}} Texas Transportation Board, FM 1528 was designated, and Spur 39 was redesignated as part of the highway. In 1961, the highway had a bituminous surface, a combination of gravel and asphalt. By 1987, the highway had been minorly rerouted <b>and</b> <b>straightened,</b> and the entire length had been paved. Between 1986 and 1991, the highway's route was minorly rerouted between Klondike and Cooper, due to the construction of Cooper Lake.|$|E

This series of three cases represents the unique utilization of the MAC fixator in treating four different aspects of treatment of the radial club hand deformity: the fixator system may be used for ulnar lengthening <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> after previous wrist centralization (Patient 1), for ulnar lengthening <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> {{in the case of an}} unstable wrist (Patient 2), for wrist distraction and centralization preceding fusion (Patient 2), and simultaneous ulnar lengthening <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> with wrist stabilization (Patient 3).|$|R
25|$|However, {{during the}} early 1930s, when Hampton Court Way and the bridge were built, the River Mole was {{redirected}} to flow into the River Ember and both rivers now enter the Thames in a single widened <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> channel once occupied only by the River Ember.

25|$|NY443 roughly follows an 18th-century {{trail of}} the Mohawk Indians from the Hudson River to Schoharie Valley. It was {{probably}} {{a few years before}} 1787 when Stephen Van Rensselaer III had it upgraded <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> slightly to make it accessible by wagons. Before that the settlers in the Beaver Dam as the Town of Berne is now known, had to go by way of the wagon road from Altamont, through what is now Knox, to the Schoharie Valley.|$|E
25|$|A turnpike {{gate was}} {{constructed}} {{at the foot}} of the hill on the main road from London to Uxbridge, now Oxford Street, Bayswater Road and Holland Park Avenue along this part of its route. The point at which the turnpike gate stood was known as Notting Hill Gate. The gate was there to stop people passing along the road without paying. The proceeds were applied towards the maintenance of this important road. The gate was removed in the 19th century and the high road was widened <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> in the 1960s, involving the demolition of many buildings, the linking of two separate tube stations and the construction of two tower blocks.|$|E

At {{the western part of the}} area the River Rye and its numerous tributaries flow eastwards and join the Derwent to the north of Malton. The Derwent then flows southwards through Malton and the Kirkham gorge to eventually join the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh. Many of the watercourses in the Vale are maintained by the three Vale of Pickering internal drainage boards which are the Rye IDB, Thornton IDB and Muston & Yedingham IDB.|$|E
25|$|At Martinsville, Kenseth {{came into}} a turn going very fast, causing {{his car to}} wheel-hop. He hit Kevin Harvick hard, who's still in the Chase, causing Harvick to spin.

25|$|In 1909, a Road Board {{was set up}} {{to improve}} roads. It was {{initially}} funded by a tax on motor fuel and a later a licence duty on cars, the Road Fund. Road surfaces were improved and roads were widened <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> using money raised by the Road Fund. The Road Board was abolished in 1919 when its functions were transferred to the newly established Ministry of Transport. In 1922, after the foundation of the Irish Free State, the Minister for Local Government took over the functions of the Ministry of Transport. In 2002, the newly renamed Department of Transport took over responsibility for national roads. From 1921-1922 onwards, the partition of Ireland has led to different paths in the evolution of public road networks in Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland. Responsibility for roads in Northern Ireland fell on the Stormont administration from 1921 to 1972. In 1996, the Northern Ireland Roads Service was set up; it became an agency of the Northern Ireland Department for Regional Development when devolved government was restored in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Kashmiri Gate {{is one of}} the {{original}} 14 gates built into the wall {{to the north of the}} city. It was built by the British in 1835 by Major Robert Smith. Local people also call it Truckman gate. It has a square plan. There are two openings of the gate: one for entry and another for exit (pictured). During 1835, the British enlarged <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> it into a two-way gate as defensive measure against enemy attacks. In the present city setting, the gate is close to the Inter State Bus Terminals. It is now preserved as monument on the road to the Old Secretariat and the Delhi University. It was named as Kashmiri Gate since it was used by the emperors to go through on their visits to Kashmir and North India. It was also the historic venue of the intense fighting which took place in 1857, between the British army and the Indian freedom fighters. The fortifications were used to fire cannons at the British army encamped at Ludlow Castle. The freedom fighters gathered at a place close to the St. James Church to discuss war strategy. British troops fought fiercely at this gate and re-captured the city from mutinous Indian soldiers. During the war, the gate was badly damaged by the British to get control over Delhi. Subsequently, area surrounding the Kashmiri Gate became the commercial hub of Delhi, when the Civil Lines were developed by the British.|$|E
500|$|Intense {{flooding}} occurred {{throughout the}} Rogue Valley in 1955, and Little Butte Creek's meanders in the Denman Wildlife Area between Eagle Point and the Rogue River were blamed for severe erosion. The [...] {{section of the}} creek was subsequently bulldozed <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The straightness forced water downward instead of outward like a typical creek, scouring the stream bed down to bedrock and creating an unsuitable habitat for wild salmon. In 2007, a plan to divert the creek back into its old meanders was proposed. The $700,000 project involved building engineered riffles and log jams and adding boulders, extending the creek by approximately [...] It was completed in September 2011.|$|E

This shift to a senior place in the community {{was associated with a}} looser style and a more individualised iconography. It was during this period that he created the work Straightening spears at Ilyingaungau (1990), held by the Art Gallery of South Australia. This painting was described by both art expert Vivian Johnson and critic Susan McCulloch-Uehlin as his masterpiece, and by obituarist Rebecca Hossack as his most famous work: [...] "a series of shimmering horizontal lines representing spears being heated <b>and</b> <b>straightened</b> over a fire by Tolson's ancestors". This and other similar works were described by art critic Susan McCulloch-Uehlin as representing not only the preparation of the spears, but also elements of Dreamings concerning fights between ancestral figures at a rock bluff west of Alice Springs.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} since the American Revolution, the {{geography}} of the Boston area has undergone significant expansion, and the islands named Hog and Noddle's are no longer islands.

[...] In terms of modern geography, the Orient Heights neighborhood of East Boston is the present location of Hog Island and nearby Breeds Island, and much of the remainder of East Boston is what was then Noddle's Island.

VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us.

The road was reopened on November 15, 1919, completely paved except north of Lebec, including the grade at Grapevine, which was only oiled. After a bond issue was passed in July1919, this portion was paved from September1919 to May1921; the dangerous detour included a 20percent grade. This paving added about $1 million to the cost, for a total price of about $1.5million (about $ in [...] ), which was not paid off until 1965.
