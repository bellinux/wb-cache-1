In a field experiment using a test vehicle on the test track at the DENSO Abashiri Test Center in Hokkaido, 33 young drivers were surveyed on their headlight swivel-angle preference at three assessment points before each curve. The subjects stopped at each <b>assessment</b> <b>point</b> and selected the preferred low-beam swivel angle from the presented swivel angles. Curve alignment and <b>assessment</b> <b>point</b> were found to have a marked effect on the preferred swivel angle. Furthermore, we developed a multiple-regression model for estimating optimal swivel angles. It was found that headlight swivel should be predictive, toward assisting the driver’s judgment of curve sharpness before the curve section. In the near future, with the aid of commercial car navigation systems headlight swivel systems incorporating a dynamic algorithm should be able to predict road geometry before arriving at curves...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{equality}} of subjective- and objective-assessment methods in laparoscopic surgery are unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare a subjective assessment method to an objective assessment method to evaluate laparoscopic skill. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted. Seventy-two residents completed a basic laparoscopic suturing task on a box trainer at two consecutive assessment points. Laparoscopic skill was rated subjectively using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) list and objectively using the TrEndo, an augmented-reality simulator. Results: TrEndo scores between the two assessment points correlated. OSATS scores did not correlate between the two assessment points. There was a correlation between TrEndo and OSATS scores at the first <b>assessment</b> <b>point,</b> but not at the second <b>assessment</b> <b>point.</b> Overall, OSATS scores correlated with TrEndo scores. There was a greater spread within OSATS scores compared to TrEndo scores. Conclusion: OSATS scores correlated with TrEndo scores. The TrEndo may be more responsive at rating individual’s laparoscopic skill, as demonstrated by a smaller overall spread in TrEndo scores. The additional value of objective assessment methods over conventional assessment methods as provided by laparoscopic simulators should be investigated...|$|E
30|$|The second {{grouping}} of limitations relates to study design. Our design {{did not include}} a non-intervention comparison group. There should also be consideration as to the timing of our assessment points. We purposefully conducted the T 2 <b>assessment</b> <b>point</b> immediately after the performance but prior to the Q&A session, thinking that we wanted {{to assess the impact of}} the play specifically and that the Q&A session would not be standardized in delivery across different performances. However, this decision meant that we did not capture the impact of the post-performance discussions quantitatively, potentially a lost opportunity given that several participants mentioned in the qualitative interviews that this part of the intervention was particularly meaningful or evocative. A significant limitation in our study design occurs in that the 'intervention’ being evaluated at the T 2 <b>assessment</b> <b>point</b> does not include the Q&A period. However, for T 3, the Q&A is included in the 'intervention’ as participants were exposed to this between T 2 and T 3. The factors make it difficult to ascertain whether the impact was the result of the performance itself or the Q&A, although we will be addressing this point in the full report on the qualitative findings from the study.|$|E

Design Prospective longitudinal observational study. Setting Outpatient community health center. Participants Sixty-one of 154 consecutive patients. Intervention 6 MWTs (N= 2) were conducted at 3 assessment points: at CR start, postcompletion, and 6 -months postcompletion. Main Outcome Measure 6 MWT distance (6 MWD). Results Mean 6 MWD for the first (6 MWT 1) and second (6 MWT 2) 6 MWTs at the 3 assessment points were 507 ḵ (522 Ḵ), 532 Ḷ (560 ḷ), and 549 ṹ (575 ᱰ 7) m. Repeated 6 MWDs strongly correlated at each <b>assessment</b> <b>point,</b> with intraclass correlation coefficients of. 96 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 93 -. 98),. 97 (95 % CI,. 92 -. 98), and. 94 (95 % CI,. 89 -. 97), respectively. Relative increases in mean 6 MWD from 6 MWT 1 to 6 MWT 2 at each <b>assessment</b> <b>point</b> were 3 %, 5 %, and 5 %, respectively (P<. 001 in each case). Differences in walking speed derived from 6 MWD 1 and 6 MWD 2 did not translate into differences in exercise prescription. Conclusions The difference between 6 MWD 1 and 6 MWD 2 was consistent regardless of previous exposure to 6 MWTs. A single 6 MWT was as effective as 2 repeated 6 MWTs for outcome measurement and exercise prescription. We therefore recommend that when 6 MWDs are used for CR outcome measurement, either a single 6 MWT be used {{or the number of}} 6 MWTs performed be consistent at all assessment points.

40|$|In this paper, the non-probabilistic failure {{assessment}} method for a pipe with crack was proposed, and interval model was applied in this assessment method. Compared with the deterministic approach, the assessment parameters {{were regarded as}} interval parameters in the non-probabilistic method, which could reflect the uncertainty of data and avoid the unsafety of results caused by the scatter of these parameters. On the other hand, compared with traditional probabilistic method, the non-probabilistic method only needs the range or bound of the parameters rather than detailed statistics information of the parameters which may be uneasy to be obtained from practical engineering. So the new assessment method reduces the request for detailed statistics properties of parameters. In this paper, load, material mechanical properties {{and the size of}} crack were treated as interval parameters, and the non-probabilistic {{failure assessment}} method was established based on the level 2 normal assessment of the BS 7910 : 2005. In this case, the <b>assessment</b> <b>point),</b> (rr KL is not a deterministic value, rL and rK would vary in a certain interval. As a consequence, the <b>assessment</b> <b>point</b> was changed into a rectangle zone, and the non-probabilistic failure measure for pipe with crack could be obtained by the variation of the rectangle. The non-probabilistic failure measure can be defined as the ratio of the area of failure region to the total area of the rectangle. At last, the non-probabilistic failure assessment method was used to evaluate a titanium pipe, and the analysis results were compared with the results of deterministic method, probabilistic method according to Monte-Carlo and partial safety factors method, respectively. The analysis results sufficiently demonstrated that the new non-probabilistic failure assessment method proposed in this paper was feasible and available...|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to assess knee range of motion (ROM) as well as patients’ {{reported}} pain, stiffness and function up to six months after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The secondary aim was to analyze the extent to which knee ROM correlates with patient-rated outcome. A prospective study included 60 patients with primary TKA for osteorthritis, admitted at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic from April 2009 to October 2014. The patients were evaluated at 4 time points: at admission and at discharge, as well as at follow-up at 3 and at 6 months after surgery. The outcome parameters included: active knee ROM, as well as pain, stiffness and function according to self reported Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) questionnaire. Statistically highly significant improvement in flexion and extension was observed from admission to all other <b>assessment</b> time <b>points</b> (p< 0. 001).
