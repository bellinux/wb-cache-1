25|$|Thomas Dodd´s {{father was}} an <b>advanced</b> <b>amateur</b> {{photographer}} of Irish ancestry, who taught his son the essentials of photography: composition, depth, lighting, {{and how to make}} quality portraits. Dodd in turn, learnt the basic techniques of a dark-room laboratory (such as negative development, enlarging, printing etc.) as part of his extra-curricular activity while attending Winter Park High School in Orange County, Florida. Dodd became interested in artistic photography through admiring Ansel Adam´s prints at a gallery in Florida. Inspired by punk rock groups like the Sex Pistols and Ramones, Dodd learnt to play the guitar and spent the 1980s playing in punk rock bands in Florida and Atlanta. Soon after, Dodd became interested in Irish music and learnt to play the Celtic harp. In 1992 Dodd founded an ambient Celtic ensemble called Trio Nocturna, which had several sponsored appearances in New Orleans, Chicago and Atlanta. Trio Nocturna gained attention in the Gothic scene, recording three commercial albums named Morphia, Tears of Light and Songs of the Celtic Night.|$|E

2500|$|Baseball and {{softball}} games cannot end until both teams {{have had an}} equal number of turns at bat, unless further play (by the home team if they lead after [...] innings) cannot affect the outcome. [...] In the final scheduled inning (typically, in professional and <b>advanced</b> <b>amateur</b> leagues the ninth inning, but usually the seventh for youth leagues {{and softball}}, and the sixth for leagues for subteens such as Little League), if the visitors complete their turn at bat and still trail the hosts, the game ends. [...] If the visitors lead or the game is tied, the hosts take their [...] "last ups" [...] at bat.

2500|$|Dan (abbreviated online as [...] "d") ranks are for <b>advanced</b> <b>amateur</b> players. Although many organisations let players {{choose their}} own kyu rank to a certain extent, dan ranks are often regulated. This means that players will have to show good results in tournaments or pass exams to be awarded a dan rank. Serious {{students}} of the game will often strive to attain a dan rank, much as martial arts practitioners will strive to achieve a black belt. For amateurs, dan ranks up to 7th dan are available. Above this level, a player must become a professional player to achieve further promotions. In Japan and China, some players are awarded an amateur 8th dan rank as an honorary title for exceptional achievement. [...] In the United States, amateur dan ranks are often based on the AGA rating system. Under this system, some strong amateurs and former professional players have achieved up to 9th dan amateur, though generally they will register as 6th or 7th dan in international events. Similarly, some players have achieved 9th dan amateur ranks in the rating system of online Go servers.|$|E

25|$|While {{microscopy}} is {{a central}} tool in the documentation of biological specimens, it is, in general, insufficient to justify the description of a new species based on microscopic investigations alone. Often genetic and biochemical tests are necessary to confirm {{the discovery of a}} new species. A laboratory and access to academic literature is a necessity, which is specialized and, in general, not available to amateurs. There is, however, one huge advantage that amateurs have above professionals: time to explore their surroundings. Often, <b>advanced</b> <b>amateurs</b> team up with professionals to validate their findings and (possibly) describe new species.|$|R
