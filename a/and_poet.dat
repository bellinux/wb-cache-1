40|$|Political leaders <b>and</b> <b>poets</b> are {{important}} figures of societies. Political leaders hold {{the financial and}} administrative power of the society <b>and</b> <b>poets</b> hold the power of emotion and excitement in society. Therefore, both {{have the power to}} lead society. They also had various privileges and benefits because of power in their hands. The situation is not different for Arab society just before Islam. Tribal leaders <b>and</b> <b>poets</b> have high-status. However, the principles of Islam took the various privileges of the Arab political leaders <b>and</b> <b>poets</b> from their hands. Therefore, first strongest reactions to the Prophet’s message were given by the political leaders <b>and</b> <b>poets.</b> The Qur’an <b>and</b> the Prophet took various measures and respond to them. Over time, the position and value of both leaders <b>and</b> <b>poets</b> have been revealed with their true nature in terms of Islam. In this study, we will try to reveal the relation of poetry, <b>poet</b> <b>and</b> politics in the first days of Islam starting with the situation just before. We will try to do this from basic sources...|$|R

5|$|In 1836, Walter Savage Landor, an English writer <b>and</b> <b>poet,</b> {{published}} Pericles and Aspasia, one of {{his most}} famous books. Pericles and Aspasia is a rendering of classical Athens through a series of imaginary letters, which contain numerous poems. The letters are frequently unfaithful to actual history but attempt to capture the spirit of the Age of Pericles. Robert Hamerling is another novelist <b>and</b> <b>poet</b> who was inspired by Aspasia's personality. In 1876 he published his novel Aspasia, a book about the manners and morals of the Age of Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest. Giacomo Leopardi, an Italian poet influenced by the movement of romanticism, published a group of five poems known as the circle of Aspasia. These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Leopardi called this person Aspasia, after the companion of Pericles.|$|E
