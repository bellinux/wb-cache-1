5|$|The {{substitution}} of hydrogen atoms in an <b>alkane</b> by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties: melting and boiling points are lowered, density increases, solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases. Perfluorocarbons, {{in which all}} hydrogen atoms are substituted, are insoluble in most organic solvents, reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in liquid ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an <b>alkane</b> group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and <b>alkane</b> cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
50|$|Though {{water is}} a very polar molecule, <b>alkanes</b> and other {{hydrophobic}} molecules are more polarizable. <b>Alkanes</b> are the most polarizable molecules. Although alkenes and arenes {{are expected to have}} larger polarizability than <b>alkanes</b> because of their higher reactivity compared to <b>alkanes,</b> <b>alkanes</b> are in fact more polarizable. This results because of alkene's and arene's more electronegative sp2 carbons to the <b>alkane's</b> less electronegative sp3 carbons.|$|R
25|$|Free radicals, {{molecules}} with unpaired electrons, play a {{large role}} in most reactions of <b>alkanes,</b> such as cracking and reformation where long-chain <b>alkanes</b> are converted into shorter-chain <b>alkanes</b> and straight-chain <b>alkanes</b> into branched-chain isomers.|$|R
25|$|<b>Alkanes</b> with a {{chain length}} of {{approximately}} 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen, used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher <b>alkanes</b> have little value and are usually split into lower <b>alkanes</b> by cracking.|$|R
5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an <b>alkane</b> group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the <b>alkane</b> chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
25|$|Alkanes do not conduct electricity, nor {{are they}} {{substantially}} polarized by an electric field. For this reason, they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an <b>alkane</b> molecule, the coexistence of an <b>alkane</b> and water leads {{to an increase in}} molecular order (a reduction in entropy). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and <b>alkane</b> molecules, the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between <b>alkane</b> and water: Alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} enthalpy change of combustion, ΔcHo, for <b>alkanes</b> increases by about 650nbsp&kJ/mol per CH2 group. Branched-chain <b>alkanes</b> have lower values of ΔcHo than straight-chain <b>alkanes</b> {{of the same}} number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{irradiation}} for 100 h {{of crude}} oil from Basilicata (Southern Italy) gave {{in the case of}} linear and branched <b>alkanes</b> a reduction of 9 and 5 %, respectively. On the contrary, cyclic <b>alkanes</b> decreased for 54 % while aromatic hydrocarbonds showed a reduction of 47 %. These results are in agreement with a prevalente electron transfer mechanism. Photocatalysis (100 h) gave extensive degradation {{of crude oil}}: linear <b>alkanes</b> were degraded for 98. 66 %, branched <b>alkanes</b> were reduced for 97. 31 %, cyclic <b>alkanes</b> for 96. 04 %, while aromatic compounds and alkenes were reduced for 99. 54 and 98. 38 %, respectively. These results are in agreement with a prevalent hydrogen abstraction mechanism. When photocatalysis is performed in the presence of zeolite linear <b>alkanes</b> were degraded for 79. 85 %, branched <b>alkanes</b> were reduced for 45. 38 %, cyclic <b>alkanes</b> for 58. 10 %, while aromatic compounds were reduced for 91. 85 %.

25|$|In an <b>alkane,</b> each carbon atom has 4 bonds (either C-C or C-H), {{and each}} {{hydrogen}} atom is joined {{to one of}} the carbon atoms (so in a C-H bond).

40|$|Intermolecular potential models for water and <b>alkanes</b> {{describe}} pure component properties fairly well, but fail to reproduce properties of water-alkane mixtures. Understanding interactions between water and non-polar molecules like <b>alkanes</b> {{is important}} {{not only for the}} hydrocarbon industry but has implications to biological processes as well. Although non-polar solutes in water have been widely studied, much less work has focused on water in non-polar solvents. In this study we calculate the solubility of water in different alkanes (methane to dodecane) at ambient conditions where the water content in <b>alkanes</b> is very low so that the non-polar water-alkane interactions determine solubility.  Only the alkane-rich phase is simulated since the fugacity of water in the water rich phase is calculated from an accurate equation of state. Using the SPC/E model for water and TraPPE model for <b>alkanes</b> along with Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules for the cross parameters produces a water solubility that is an order of magnitude lower than the experimental value. It is found that an effective water Lennard-Jones energy εW/k = 220 [*]K is required to match the experimental water solubility in TraPPE <b>alkanes.</b> This number is much higher than used in most simulation water models (SPC/E—εW/k = 78. 2 [*]K). It is surprising that the interaction energy obtained here is also higher than the water-alkane interaction energy predicted by studies on solubility of <b>alkanes</b> in water.  The reason for this high water-alkane interaction energy is not completely understood. Some factors that might contribute to the large interaction energy, such as polarizability of <b>alkanes,</b> octupole moment of methane, and clustering of water at low concentrations in <b>alkanes,</b> are examined. It is found that, though important, these factors do not completely explain the anomalously strong attraction between <b>alkanes</b> and water observed experimentally...|$|R
