50|$|The {{most ancient}} {{evolutive}} group comprises African (<b>African</b> <b>silverbill),</b> Asian (Indian silverbill) and Australian (diamond firetail); {{this suggests that}} the whole Estrildids radiation might have originated around India.|$|E
50|$|The {{similarities}} {{within this}} {{group and the}} existence of subspecies with differing vocalisations and plumage mean that some races may be elevated to species status. <b>African</b> and Indian <b>silverbill</b> are now usually considered distinct species, and the two races of black-throated munia are often also split.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> is {{currently}} trapped for the cage bird trade. However, its numbers and its considerable range mean {{that this is}} unlikely to have any impact on the species' survival.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> is tame and sociable, {{often found}} {{perching}} in trees in dense flocks, touching one another. However, it {{is a particularly}} inactive bird, sitting huddled together {{for a long period}} of time. It stays in flocks all year round and usually breeds in loose colony.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> [...] (Euodice cantans) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird formerly considered conspecific {{with the}} Asian species Indian silverbill, (Euodice malabarica). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in dry savanna habitat, south of the Sahara Desert. This species has also been introduced to other countries such as Portugal, Qatar and United States.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> feeds {{mostly on}} grass seeds, picked {{from the ground}} but also taken from the growing plants if available. It will cling to grass stems to take seeds from the inflorescences. It seems that it feeds mainly on {{vegetable}} matter and rearing its young on seed as well. However, it has been recorded to take aphids from water mint (Meinertzhagen 1954).|$|E
50|$|The nest of the <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> {{is usually}} {{built in the}} form of a roundish bundle of grasses. It is lined with soft fibres and {{sometimes}} feathers, and may be placed in a thick bush or hedge or amongst the creepers on a house. The male is recorded in the wild as collecting all the nesting material (Meinertzhagen 1954), while the female only shares in construction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> is {{approximately}} 10 cm in length {{with a long}} black pointed tail. The adult has a stubby silver-blue bill, finely vermiculated light-brown upper parts, whitish underparts, black rump and black wings. The sexes are similar, but immatures lack the vermiculations. This species has a tseep call and a trilling song. The contact call of the male is a single tseep while the female is a double noted tsiptsip. Birds in flight keep up a constant tseep tseep tseep.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} earlier {{placed in the}} genus Lonchura but some authors {{suggested}} their placement in the genus Euodice. The placement was much debated but more recent studies {{suggest that it is}} closely related to the <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> (now Euodice cantans) and the two form a clade that is well separated from other Lonchura finches. A molecular phylogeny study identifies the separation of the species from the nearest common ancestors of Euodice cantans (of Africa) and Stagonopleura guttata (of Australia) around 11 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The Indian {{silverbill}} or {{white-throated munia}} (Euodice malabarica) {{is a small}} passerine bird found in the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining regions that was formerly considered to include the closely related <b>African</b> <b>silverbill</b> (Euodice cantans). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in the drier regions of the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent. It has also been introduced into {{many other parts of}} the world and has become established in some areas. They forage in small flocks in grassland and scrub habitats.|$|E
50|$|This munia was {{described}} as Loxia malabarica by Linnaeus who placed it along with the crossbills. Subsequently they {{were included in the}} genera Uroloncha and Aidemosyne and later in the genus Lonchura into which many of the estrildid finches were included by Jean Delacour in his 1943 revision. The species earlier included Lonchura cantans, the <b>African</b> <b>silverbill,</b> which is found in the dry savannah habitats south of the Sahara Desert. In captivity the African birds were found to preferentially pair with mates within their own populations and did not recognize the Indian populations as conspecific. They are however known to produce fertile hybrids.|$|E
50|$|In early literature, <b>African</b> <b>{{silverbill}}</b> (Euodice cantans) and Indian silverbill (E. malabarica) {{were treated}} as conspecific. In 1943, Jean Th√©odore Delacour firmly united both species in his revision of the Estrildinae. However, in 1964, James M. Harrison first studied the two in a strictly comparative manner and concluded that they were two separate species. He discovered that although the call notes were similar, the songs are distinctly different in form, but sharing a common pattern. They are sympatric {{in the south of}} the Arabian Peninsula and there is no record of natural hybridization. From Harrison's personal observation of birds in captivity, each of the two forms evinced a preference for its own kind. In 1985, Kakizawa and Watada confirmed Harrison's conclusion. They confirmed the genetic difference of the two species by the means of protein electrophoresis. In 1990, Sibley and Monroe accept the two as distinct species. Molecular sequence divergence studies indicate that this species along with the Indian siverbill are basal, having diverged from the common ancestors of other Lonchurae about 11 MYA. This and other evidence including differences in the arrangement of down in chicks and behaviour leads some authors to placing them in the separate genus Euodice.|$|E
