40|$|The {{course of}} thermal {{decomposition}} of basic <b>aluminium</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate was investigated. Temperature ranges {{were established in}} which dehydration of the com-pound and liberation of ammonia nd sulfur oxides take place. The presented scheme of thermal dissociation of the basic salt {{was based on the}} determination f the solid and gaseous products of the reaction. The thermal decomposition of basic <b>aluminium</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate is the final stage in Bretsznajder's method of producing metallurgical luminium oxide from Polish clays [1]. Previous studies on calcination of basic <b>aluminium</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate [2 - 4] were concerned with the essential stages and with some intermediates of decomposition of that compound in air. No studies have yet been performed on the decomposition of the basic salt in vacuum. No account has been given either of the gas-phase changes during the process, and the course of the reaction has been evaluated merely from the composition of the solid phases. The aim of the present work was to establish precisely the stages of decomposi-tion of basic <b>aluminium</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate, and to identify all the solid and gaseous intermediates of the decomposition. In the present part of the work the course of dissociation of the basic salt was studied with the use of thermal analysis, mass-spectrometry, infrared absorption and X-ray phase analysis...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out on the {{kinetics}} of thermal decomposition of basic <b>aluminium</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate in vacuum. The kinetic model of dissociation of the compound was identified. The results of the kinetic studies and the mechanism of the process are discussed. In a previous work we reported the stages of thermal decomposition of basic <b>aluminium</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate. The results created the possibility for more detailed studies on the kinetics of these stages. Earlier studies by many authors [1 - 10] have led to different results, which cannot be interpreted in an uniequivocal manner. The difficulties in interpretation arise from the multistage character of the decomposition and uncertainty about the intermediates of the dissociation.

40|$|The {{shelf life}} of a {{composite}} solid propellant {{is one of the}} critical aspects for the usage of solid propellants. To assess the ageing behavior of the composite solid propellant, the activation energy is a key parameter. The activation energy is determined by analysis of visco-elastic response of the composite solid propellant when subjected to sinusoidal excitation. In the present study, dynamic mechanical analyzer was used to characterize six different types of propellants based on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene, <b>aluminium,</b> <b>ammonium</b> perchlorate cured with toluene diisocyanate having burning rates varying from 5 mm/s to 25 mm/s at 7000 kPa. Each propellant sample was given a multi-frequency strain of 0. 01 percent at three discrete frequencies (3. 5 Hz, 11 Hz, 35 Hz) in the temperature range - 80 °C to + 80 °C. It was observed that all the propellants have shown two relaxation events (α- and β- transition) in the temperature range - 80 °C to + 80 °C. The α-transition was observed between - 66 °C and - 51 °C and β-transition between 7 °C and 44 °C for the propellants studied. The activation energy for both transitions was determined by Arrhenius plot from dynamic properties measured at different frequencies and also by time temperature superposition principle using Williams-Landel-Ferry and Arrhenius temperature dependence equations. The data reveal that the activation energy corresponding to α-transition varies from 90 kJ/mol to 125 kJ/mol for R-value between 0. 7 to 0. 9 while for β-transition the values are from 75 kJ/mol to 92 kJ/mol.

50|$|Other {{energetic}} {{materials in the}} vicinity of the pit also influence its safety. US missile propellants come in two general classes. The class 1.3, fire hazard but very difficult to impossible to detonate; an example is 70% <b>ammonium</b> perchlorate, 16% <b>aluminium,</b> and 14% binder. The class 1.1, both fire and detonation hazard, is a double-base propellant based on cross-linked polymer, containing 52% HMX, 18% nitroglycerine, 18% <b>aluminium,</b> 4% <b>ammonium</b> perchlorate, and 8% binder. The 1.1 propellant has 4% higher specific impulse (about 270 s versus 260 s), giving an 8% longer range for constant burning time. The insensitive high explosives are also less powerful, necessitating larger and heavier warheads, which reduces the missile range - or sacrificing some yield. The safety/performance tradeoff is especially important for e.g. submarines. As of 1990, the Trident SLBMs used both detonable fuel and non-insensitive explosives.|$|R
30|$|Further, the {{ammonium}} ion was ascertained in the efflorescence samples. Besides the normal mode vibration frequencies of ammonium (3040 (ν 1), 1680 (ν 2), 3145 (ν 3), and 1400 (ν 4) cm− 1 [22]), {{a series of}} lattice modes and combination bands appear in spectra of common salts such as ammonium chloride [31]. By analogy, the series of four shoulders between 3000 and 3200  cm− 1 in Fig.  3 can be ascribed to the {{ammonium ion}}. Within this interval, the ν 3 mode as well as three distinct combination bands occur in ammonium chloride [31] but are hardly visible in the sample spectrum due to overlapping by the water band at 3350  cm− 1. A more consistent identification of ammonium ion {{can be done by}} bands in the region of ν 4 (asymmetric bending mode) where three bands at 1398, 1431, and 1470  cm− 1 can be clearly distinguished in the sample spectrum. The first two appear at similar frequency in ammonium chloride spectrum [31]. All of the above three bands can be retrieved in the spectra of ammonium-containing Tutton’s salts such as (NH 4) 2 Mg(SO 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O [28] and (NH 4) 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O [29] but are missing in the spectrum of an ammonium-less Tutton’s salt such as K 2 Mg(SO 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O [28].

Therefore, besides the metals detected by XRF, the ammonium ion is present in the efflorescence.

Besides, characteristic bands of nitrate and carbonate ions were not found in efflorescence spectra.|$|R

40|$|International audienceLong term {{changes in}} the water quality of rainfall, cloud water and stream waters {{draining}} acidic and acid sensitive moorland and forested catchments at Plynlimon, mid-Wales, are examined for the period 1983 to 2001. Atmospheric inputs of chloride and sulphate {{are influenced by the}} relative inputs of clean maritime and polluted land based air masses. There is no systematic increase or decrease over time for chloride and non-sea-salt sulphate. Rather, there is a decadal scale process possibly representative of the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation that affects the maritime and pollution climate of the Atlantic seaboard of the UK. Over 17 years of study, there may be a small decrease in non-sea-salt sulphate of about 10 ?eq l - 1 and a small improvement in acid neutralising capacity of about 20 to 30 ?eq l - 1 in rainfall. There is a clear improvement in cloud water chemistry with respect to pollutant components (ammonium, nitrate, non-sea-salt sulphate) and acidity (acid neutralising capacity improved by about 300 ?eq l - 1) through the study period. Many of the changes in cloud water chemistry are similar to rainfall over the same period except the magnitude of change is larger for the cloud water. Within the streams, there is some evidence for reductions in acidity as reflected by acid neutralising capacity becoming less negative. For one stream, deforestation occurred during the sampling period and this led to large increases in nitrate and smaller increases in aluminium midway through the study period. However, the climate and hydrological variability largely masked out other changes. The current analysis provides only a start to identifying trends for such a complex and variable environmental system. The need for strong statistical tools is emphasised to resolve issues of: (a) hydrological induced water quality variability, (b) changing soil and groundwater "endmember" chemistry contribution to the stream and (c) the non-linear patterns of change. Nonetheless, the analysis is enhanced by examining trends in chemistry for yearly averages and yearly average low catch and high catch rainfall and cloud water events as well as low and high flow stream chemistry. This approach allows trends to be examined within the context of endmember mixing.

40|$|The study {{reports the}} {{variation}} in acoustic emission signals acquired during combustion of typical propellants with varying <b>aluminium</b> and <b>ammonium</b> perchlorate content. It was observed that when propellant strands having the same composition undergo combustion under similar conditions, they produce consistent acoustic emission signals. To study the effect of variation of aluminium content in the propellant composition on the acoustic emission produced during combustion, the aluminium content was varied from 6 per cent to 18 per cent in a HTPB-based composite propellant with 86 per cent solid loading. Experiments were carried out with propellant strands under the same conditions for a comparative study. Acoustic emission parameters, such as peak amplitude, ring-down counts, average frequency, hits and energy were studied as functions of time. Among these parameters, only energy ring-down counts and frequency varied significantly with aluminium content. The effect of cumulative values of energy, frequency and ring-down counts, the effect of burn rate and theoretical specific impulse against the aluminium percentage variation, and the variation of specific impulse against acoustic energy can all be correlated. The clear trend is indicative of possible prediction of propellant performance parameter like specific impulse from acoustic emission parameters. </span...|$|R
