5|$|For {{self-governance}} purposes, {{the city}} is divided into 17 boroughs, {{each of which has}} its own mayor (starosta) and council. The number of councillors in each depends on the size and population of the borough. Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 cadastral areas, except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters <b>and</b> <b>localities.</b>|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to balance the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E

40|$|Software {{prefetching}} <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> optimizations are {{techniques for}} overcoming {{the gap between}} processor and memory speeds. Using the SimpleScalar simulator, we evaluate the impact of memory bandwidth and latency {{on the effectiveness of}} software prefetching <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> optimizations on three types of applications: regular scientific codes, irregular scientific codes, and pointer-based codes. We find software prefetching hides memory costs but increases instruction count and requires greater memory bandwidth. Locality optimizations change the computation order and data layout at compile or run time to eliminate cache misses, reducing memory costs without requiring more memory bandwidth. Combining prefetching <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> optimizations can improve performance, but interactions can also nullify the benefits of prefetching. We propose several algorithms to better integrate software prefetching <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> optimizations. (Also cross-referenced as UMIACS-TR- 2000 - 57...|$|R

5|$|As {{the first}} Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to {{establish}} the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, {{just over a year}} after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, he remains Pakistan's greatest leader.|$|E

Fairfax County also sponsors Celebrate Fairfax! with popular and traditional music performances. The Virginia Lake Festival is held during the third weekend in July in Clarksville. Wolf Trap hosts the Wolf Trap Opera Company, which produces an opera festival every summer. Each September, Bay Days celebrates the Chesapeake Bay as well as Hampton's 400-year history since 1610, and Isle of Wight County holds a County Fair on {{the second week of}} September as well. Both feature live music performances, and other unique events.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Shishman is {{the most}} {{prominent}} medieval ruler in Bulgarian folklore. His name is heard {{in a number of}} legends, myths, tales and songs. He is represented as a heroic ruler who fought and died for his country, facing overwhelming enemy forces. There are a number of places throughout Bulgaria named after the him, ranging from castles and ruins to rocks, caves <b>and</b> <b>localities.</b> That legendary “geography” is mainly concentrated in the region of Sofia, Ihtiman and Samokov, though it extends to the Rhodope Mountains, Sredna Gora, Vratsa, Pleven, Prilep, Varna, etc. Near Samokov are the ruins of “Shishman's Fortress” with the emperor's wells, which reputedly spouted from the ruler's seven wounds. Further north, along the cliffs and heights of the Iskar Gorge, are “Shishman's Holes”, the caves where he hid while fighting the Ottomans for seven years. Other related toponyms usually associated with the emperor's last stand are Kokalyane (derived from kokal, meaning “bone”), Cherepish (from cherep, “skull”) and Lyutibrod (“Fierce Ford”), all thought to be hinting at the fate of the perished Bulgarian troops.|$|E
