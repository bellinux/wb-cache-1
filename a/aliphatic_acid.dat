40|$|Abstract. In orlder to {{find out}} the law between {{conductivity}} of polyglycol <b>aliphatic</b> <b>acid</b> ester and concentration and polymerization degree, the relationship between conductivity of polyglycol <b>aliphatic</b> <b>acid</b> ester and concentration and polymerization degree was teated by using DDS-II conductivity experimen instrument, by taking a typical polyethylene glycol 200 (400, 600) dilaurate as the research object. Firstly, the conductivities at the water content from 10 % to 90 % were tested in the room temperatrure. The results showed that conductivity of the same emulsion increases with increasing the water content, then decreases with increasing the water content. This is because that the emulsion is the O/W emulsion, conductivity increases with increasing the water content. Then the liquid crystal is generated in the emulsion leading to the increase trend of conductivity slowing down. The emulsion changs into the W/O emulsion at last resulting in conductivity decreases with increasing the water content. Secondly, the relationship between conductivity of emulsion and polymerization degree were tested. The results of the experiment show that: the higher the polymerization degree, the smaller the conductivity o f the emulsion is. The reason is the higher the polymerization degree, the less the conductible ions of the emulsion is, finally cause the conductivity changs smaller and smaller...|$|E
40|$|Four <b>aliphatic</b> <b>acid</b> {{side-chain}} polymers {{have been}} synthesized and evaluated, based upon two different polysiloxane backbones, namely poly(methylsiloxane) and poly(methylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane). A study of their behaviour at the water/air interface {{has shown that}} stable, fluid molecular films are formed that can be transferred as monolayers onto hydrophilic substrates. Their surface pressure-area isotherms indicate that bunching of the polysiloxane backbones may occur at relatively high surface pressures. The alternate layer deposition process has been used, in which the polysiloxane is co-deposited with a monomeric aliphatic amine (icosylamine). This ABABA [...] . sequential transfer has been monitored using the piezoelectric quartz crystal microgravimetric technique in which the alternate layer is assembled {{on top of a}} bulk quartz crystal, the oscillation frequency of which is measured precisely. The relationship between the frequency change and the number of transferred polysiloxane/monomer icosylamine bilayers is linear for the three materials that could be deposited, indicating that the deposition process is highly reproducible. The pyroelectric effect in these films has been studied. These data indicate that the level of activity is not simply related to the fraction of the silicon units along the backbones which are substituted with <b>aliphatic</b> <b>acid</b> chains.
