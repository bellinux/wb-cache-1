The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country not already involved {{in conflict with the}} signatory; this implicitly meant the U.S. By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores—with Germany and Italy on the Atlantic, and with Japan on the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration would not be dissuaded; believing the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> would be endangered if Europe and the Far East fell under military dictatorship, it committed to help the British and Chinese through loans of money and materiel, and pledged sufficient continuing aid to ensure their survival. Thus, the United States slowly moved from being a neutral power to one preparing for war.|$|E

As the decades progressed, the combined {{effects of the}} second Red Scare, McCarthyism, Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 Secret Speech denouncing the previous decades of Joseph Stalin's rule and the adversities of the continued Cold War mentality, steadily weakened the party's internal structure and confidence. The party's membership in the Comintern and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union made the party appear to most Americans as not only a threatening, subversive domestic entity, {{but also as a}} foreign agent fundamentally alien to the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Internal and external crises swirled together, to the point where members who did not end up in prison for party activities tended either to disappear quietly from its ranks or to adopt more moderate political positions at odds with the Communists' party line.

In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the age of}} {{manifest}} destiny, this idea, {{which came}} to be known as [...] "Indian removal", gained ground. Humanitarian advocates of removal believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from whites. As historian Reginald Horsman argued in his influential study Race and Manifest Destiny, racial rhetoric increased during the era of manifest destiny. Americans increasingly believed that Native <b>American</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> would [...] "fade away" [...] as the United States expanded. As an example, this idea was reflected in the work of one of America's first great historians, Francis Parkman, whose landmark book The Conspiracy of Pontiac was published in 1851. Parkman wrote that after the British conquest of Canada in 1760, Indians were [...] "destined to melt and vanish before the advancing waves of Anglo-American power, which now rolled westward unchecked and unopposed". Parkman emphasized that the collapse of Indian power in the late 18th century had been swift and was a past event.|$|R

50|$|Mexican {{migration}} to the United States followed {{some of the same}} patterns as Italian immigration. The history of Mexican migrant labor in America and return {{migration to}} Mexico produced a network that allowed for chain migration once more restrictive legislation was passed hardening the border between the two nations. Chain migration based on the knowledge gained from migrant labor experience and relationships with American residents or citizens again provided some ease of immigration. From 1942 to 1964, the American government sanctioned Bracero Program allowed hundred of thousands of Mexican migrant workers to “familiarize themselves with U.S. employment practices, become comfortable with U.S. job routines, master <b>American</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and learn English,” thereby creating social and human capital. After the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 disbanded the Bracero Program, the incentives and effects of chain migration perpetuated undocumented im{{migration to the}} United States. Absent any of the economic incentives, the Mexican American immigration relationship has a longstanding history and the effects of chain migration are pervasive when considering the number of Mexican American citizens, legal residents, and undocumented residents. Social capital provided by chain migration has helped perpetuate Mexican migration, whether it is undocumented or legal.|$|R

The act forces tribes to depend on both federal and state governments. Many Native Americans give up rights in order to receive government financial assistance. [...] "The federal entitlement of Native Americans to game on tribal lands does not implicate economic development policy and wealth distribution alone. By redistributing culture and sovereignty, the IGRA has fueled the tribe's long battle from cultural survival and political autonomy." ...|$|R

50|$|As an author, Stewart's output {{was at once}} diverse, original, and important. Ordeal by Hunger, Pickett's Charge, {{and other}} works are {{examinations}} of American history, but are unusual in their probing of the interaction of human beings with their physical and social environments. His greatest achievement as a novelist, Earth Abides, takes somewhat the same perspective, but {{in the context of}} a collapse of civilization, in which everything formerly taken for granted about civilization and the situation of human beings in their environment can no longer be assumed. This radically altered circumstance permits Stewart to raise and examine issues rarely, if ever, tackled by other novelists. East of Giants is historical fiction. Man, An Autobiography is one of the very few works of speculative anthropology, in which he attempts to deduce how key developments in prehistorical civilization must have unfolded, and also offers a wealth of original and interesting insights into the character of early civilization. Good Lives provides a series of biographical sketches with the end in view of determining what it is that makes for a good life, an undertaking having much in common with, say, Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics. Not So Rich as You Think (1968) was a prescient early essay in environmentalism (Rachel Carson's Silent Spring had been published only a few years earlier, in 1962, and had a much narrower focus). Storm takes an immense storm as its protagonist, an extraordinary departure in itself, and again teases out the consequences for human beings of this large-scale environmental disruption. Other works, such as Names on the Land and <b>American</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> offer other unique insights and perspectives not found anywhere else.|$|R

At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with just about a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Possible {{reasons are}} firstly, {{the fact the}} English taught to Filipinos was the “egalitarian” English of the New World, and that the Americans who colonized the Philippines {{encountered}} lowland societies that already used Iberian linguistic class markers like [...] "Don" [...] and [...] "Doña." [...] Secondly, the fundamental contradiction of the American colonial project. The Americans who occupied the Philippines justified their actions through the rhetoric of [...] "benevolent assimilation". In other words, they were only subjugating Filipinos to teach them values like American egalitarianism, which {{is the opposite of}} colonial anti-equality. Thirdly, the power of American colonialism lays in its emphasis on education – an education that supposedly exposed Filipinos to the [...] "wonders" [...] of the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Through education, the American colonial state bred a new elite of Filipinos trained in a new, more [...] "modern", American system.

Their prestige, as such, not only rested on their purported intelligence, but also their mastery of the colonizer’s way of life. This, Lisandro Claudio suspects, {{is the source of the}} magical and superstitious attachment Filipinos have to attorneys, architects and engineers. The language they use is still haunted by their colonial experience. They linguistically privilege professionals because their colonizers made us value a certain kind of white-collar work. Again, even expatriate professionals in the Philippines were affected by these reasons when they resided and married a Filipino or were naturalized so it's not unusual for them to be addressed Filipino style.|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} how French and American magazines’ comparisons of American and French women, respectively, worked through U. S. -French relations after World War II into the 1960 s (1945 - 1965). Drawing from over 2, 500 primary source documents collected {{over two years}} from company, library, and personal archives in the U. S. and France, this project takes a grounded theory approach to analyze articles, covers, images, advertisements, and readers’ letters for emergent themes. The overall analysis reveals national social comparison at work, which, in this case, is the constant comparison between two closely related nations to sort out who is better. On the one hand, French and American magazines used American and French women to show the countries’ mutual fascination and desire to be like one other. On the other hand, magazines critiqued women as a strategy to maintain national superiority and to compare French and <b>American</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and how to move forward in the postwar world: the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> rooted in consumerism and technology; and the French way steeped in tradition above efficient materialism. Key periods of postwar Franco-American relations and their accompanying themes structure the dissertation: Apprehensive Admiration (1945 - 1952); Mutual Fascination and Liberation (1952 - 1960); and Troubles in Adulation (1960 - 1965). This dissertation makes four contributions to media studies, history, and gender studies. First, it shows how international relations and understanding are managed through popular media. Second, it evidences print magazines’ important place after World War II to work within and between imagined national communities. In particular, it moves beyond typical single-nation studies of magazines by comparatively historicizing magazines’ international nature and impact. Third, despite having been used in well-written histories of the Franco-American experience, magazines have been understudied and under appreciated. This dissertation adds to the growing, much-needed mediated history of Franco-American relations preceding the digital age. Lastly, the project details how representations of women, who come to embody and stand in for the nation, mediate symbolic battles between nations. Namely, one sees how representations of women sort out how nations see themselves, how nations compare themselves to other nations, and how nations envision {{their place in the}} world...|$|R
