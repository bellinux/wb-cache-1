The effect of the <b>alloying</b> <b>temperature</b> on the characteristic of the alloyed layer was investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), glow dis-charge spectrum (GDS) and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS).

The results indicate that all the Pt alloys show enhanced ORR activities relative to a W C electrocatalyst. However, the electrocatalytic activity and activation energy for ORR {{in the case of}} Pt/Ni and Pt/Co alloys show marked effect due to different alloying conditions. This was in contrast to W C r alloy, where both parameters remained unchanged over the range of alloying conditions. Those electrochemical results were correlated with those obtained from in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) investigations, which provided information on the electronic (Pt 5 d-orbital vacancy, from the X-ray absorption near-edge structure) and geometric (Pt-Pt bond distances, from the extended X-ray absorption fine structure) factors. In-situ XAS results indicate that the supported alloys possess higher Pt Sd-orbital vacancies and shorter Pt-Pt bond distances. In addition, the XAS results showed that alloying inhibited chemisorption of oxygenated species (OH) on the Pt at potentials above 0. 8 V vs RHE. Correlation of electrocatalytic activities and activation energies for ORR with parameters obtained from in-situ XAS studies indicates that, in the case of mi and Pt/Co alloys, higher <b>alloying</b> <b>temperature</b> and longer annealing periods result in higher Pt 5 d-orbital vacancies with th...|$|E

In order to analyze the influencing factors for the liquid phase segregation of the semi-solid die forging, in this paper, the sample of semi-solid 7075 alloy is prepared by hand stirring method. The casting-forging forming of the sample is made by means of press machine and cup mould to research the influence of <b>alloy</b> <b>temperature,</b> head preheating temperature, hold time and other process parameters on the uniformity of the microstructure. The results show that the semi-solid casting-forging process is feasible within a set of mold. Under the conditions of head temperature of 400 ℃, hold time of 2 s and the forming pressure of 50 MPa, the liquid phase segregation degree of cup sample increases, the uniformity of the microstructure becomes worse with increasing of <b>alloy</b> <b>temperature.</b> The segregation degree is up to 14. 02 % when the <b>alloy</b> <b>temperature</b> is 628 ℃.

Systematic experiments indicate that substrate pretreatment, pregrowth <b>alloying</b> <b>temperature,</b> and growth temperature are all crucial to vertical epitaxial growth. Nanowire growth rate and morphology can be well controlled by the growth temperature, the metal-organic precursor molar fraction, and the molar V/III ratio.

40|$|Nowadays {{bimetallic}} nanoparticles (NPs) {{have emerged}} as key materials for important modern applications in nanoplasmonics, catalysis, biodiagnostics, and nanomagnetics. Consequently the control of bimetallic structural motifs with specific shapes provides increasing functionality and selectivity for related applications. However, producing bimetallic NPs with well controlled structural motifs still remains a formidable challenge. Hence, we present here a general methodology for gas phase synthesis of bimetallic NPs with distinctively different structural motifs ranging at a single particle level from a fully mixed alloy to core-shell, to onion (multi-shell), and finally to a Janus/dumbbell, with the same overall particle composition. These concepts are illustrated for Mo-Cu NPs, where the precise control of the bimetallic NPs with various degrees of chemical ordering, including different shapes from spherical to cube, is achieved by tailoring the energy and thermal environment that the NPs experience during their production. The initial state of NP growth, either in the liquid or in the solid state phase, {{has important implications for}} the different structural motifs and shapes of synthesized NPs. Finally we demonstrate that we are able to tune the alloying regime, for the otherwise bulk immiscible Mo-Cu, by achieving an increase of the critical size, below which alloying occurs, closely up to an order of magnitude. It is discovered that the critical size of the NP alloy is not only affected by controlled tuning of the <b>alloying</b> <b>temperature</b> but also by the particle shape. ...|$|E
40|$|Gold {{supported}} titania nano-particle surfaces {{have been}} synthesised {{in order to}} understand supported electrochemical mechanisms through an inverse catalyst. The catalyst process investigated was the electro-oxidation of CO which is known to be promoted on Au nano-particles on a titania support. Synthesis proceeded via physical vapour deposition (PVD) of titanium onto a gold surface (both polycrystalline and 111 crystal), followed by alloying and oxidation to form discrete particles of titania on the surface, with variations in density of particles achieved by control of the initial titanium coverages. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicate these particles develop with consistent triangular and hexagonal shapes, with average diameters of 11. 5 and 20 nm observed depending on <b>alloying</b> <b>temperature.</b> The procession of titanium deposition on the gold surface and subsequent alloy formation was followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, with the formation of pure TiO 2 revealed once synthesis was complete, with minimal modification to the final electronic state of the underlying gold. Electrochemical testing in an acidic environment provides evidence for alteration of the electrooxidation of CO on these modified gold surfaces. A deactivation of the CO oxidation is observed with initial addition of titania, explained by the blocking of CO adsorption on the surface. This is followed by significant subsequent increases in activity with increasing densities of titania particles, with decreasing over-potential and increasing current density observed as the titania coverage increases. This observed effect on CO oxidation activity with titania coverage in the inverse system provides significant evidence for the action of either reactant spill-over or Ti-Au interface sites as being responsible for the changes in activity observed for titania modified gold systems, whether in the inverse or standard form...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to understand and improve optical and electrical confinement to achieve cost-effective high-efficiency thin p-type Si solar cells. Optical confinement is achieved by front surface texturing in conjunction with an internal reflective layer on the back surface. Electrical confinement is obtained {{through the use of}} a high-lifetime material coupled with high-quality passivation on both surfaces. This research is divided into five tasks. In the first task, Ga-doped Cz Si was investigated to achieve a high and stable lifetime. It was found that for 1 ohm-cm nominal-resistivity screen-printed Al-back surface filed (BSF) cells, the Ga-doped ingot gave ~ 1. 5 % higher absolute efficiency after light-soaking relative to the B-doped counterpart. The benefit of using Ga is therefore quite explicit. In the second task, the screen-printed Al-BSF was investigated to explore its potential and limitations for achieving high-efficiency cells. It was found that there exists a critical <b>alloying</b> <b>temperature</b> for a given Al-thickness, above which the Al-BSF becomes non-uniform and cell performance starts to degrade. This puts a limit on the quality of the Al-BSF that can be achieved. An alternative way of back passivation involving dielectric/metal layers was therefore explored. In Task three, two key requirements for achieving high-efficiency dielectric back-passivated cells were established through device modeling. These are (1) a formation of a high-quality BSF underneath the local back contact through vias in the dielectric and (2) a high-quality dielectric passivation with either a moderate positive charge density or a high negative charge density. Task four involved the development of a metallization technique through vias in the dielectric to achieve a high-quality contact and an efficient internal reflector in conjunction with a high-quality local BSF. Further, a novel dielectric system composed of a spin-on SiO 2 layer capped with SiN x was developed that exhibited excellent passivation and a moderate positive charge density. The final task involved fabrication and analysis of dielectric back-passivated cells. The new dielectric and process sequence developed in this thesis resulted in screen-printed solar cells with efficiency as high as 19 % with the potential for 20 % efficient cells on 100 -µm thick Si substrates.
