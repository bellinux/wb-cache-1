500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with many {{commenting on the}} episode's reliance on humor. In a review of part one, a critic from the Knight Ridder wrote, [...] "As disorienting as this body transfer had to be for Mulder, the experience provided amusing television. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be a problem}} for some X-Files fans. Knowing that the human population's survival is imperiled by the colonization plans of a fierce extraterrestrial race, a large number of X-Philes want the show to focus on our heroes' efforts to come to the rescue". The newspaper's review of Part 2 was much more negative, with the article saying [...] "by the end of the latest X-Files episode, we were wishing we could push a reset button on Dreamland II, just to forget some of the silly stuff that transpired in this show". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and noted that the episode lacked [...] "structure and point". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave both episodes mixed reviews, awarding the first part two-and-a-half stars out of four, and the second part two stars. Vitaris was unhappy with the amount of comedy used in the episode, noting that once Mulder visited Fletcher's house, [...] "the comedy turns sour": she argued that the members of Fletcher's family were examples of caricatures. Despite this, she praised the scene featuring the murder of the gas station attendant, claiming that [...] "for a moment, this episode really clicks". Vitaris, in her review for part two, called the episode [...] "purely illogical", although she noted it did feature [...] "minor fun", pointing out the scene wherein Scully catches Fletcher by handcuffing him.|$|E
2500|$|On October 7, 2007, the Catholic League {{called for}} a boycott of the film. League {{president}} William A. Donohue {{said he would not}} ordinarily object to the film, but that while the religious elements are diluted from the source material, the film will encourage children to read the novels, which he says denigrate Christianity and promote atheism for children. He cited Pullman telling the Washington Post in 2001 that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief. The League hoped that [...] "the film [...] to meet box office expectations and that [...] books attract few buyers", declaring the boycott campaign a success after a North American opening weekend which was lower than anticipated. One week after the film's release, Roger Ebert said of the campaign, [...] "any bad buzz on a family film can be mortal, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to have been the case this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why then," [...] said I, [...] "the {{only hope}} lies in {{abstracting}} that letter {{in such a}} manner that he shall not suspect the loss; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> a very desperate hope." ...|$|E

60|$|At length Habogi drew rein {{before a}} small house, very ugly <b>and</b> mean-looking, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> {{on the point}} of {{tumbling}} to pieces.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Kennedy {{has just}} been saying that not a single {{available}} vote has been missed on our side. He has just come from Brooks's, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to be what they say there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He says," [...] {{answered}} Barré, [...] "that {{you have}} not visited that banking house since you came to Paris, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> strange also. Every traveller goes to his banker {{as soon as he}} arrives." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{the matter}} were quite open, I should incline to {{disapprove}} the intermarriage of first cousins; but {{the church has}} decided otherwise on the authority of Augustine, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> enough upon such a point.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could hear}} them all," [...] said Alice, with sincerity that made Mrs. Mavering laugh as light-heartedly as Dan himself, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to suggest the nest thing to her.|$|R
60|$|It {{struck the}} doctor that Herbert was not displeased with the information; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> strange, {{considering}} <b>that</b> {{he was a}} busy, energetic man. He lay silent a while with an undisturbed expression.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> {{like the}} end of her life. But she was too hopeless to rage. Wisely, economizing what was left of Ursula's love, she went away to London, leaving the beloved girl alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{the most}} {{troublesome}} fellow on the line once, although he was the biggest worker," [...] the boss replied. [...] "He got {{five years in the}} penitentiary <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to have taken the spirit out of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|MAYOR. I see. A--a {{domestic}} disagreement. Very well, {{that charge}} is withdrawn. You {{do not appear}} to have been hurt, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to me quite proper. Now, tell me what you know of the assault on the constable. Is his account correct? ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh! There was an {{earthquake}} here in England the other night, {{while you were}} asleep; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to you too near to be pleasant. Will there ever be earthquakes in England which will throw houses down, and bury people in the ruins? ...|$|E
60|$|His {{emaciated}} hand {{played with}} the strap of the window for a time. I prepared to resume reading, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to precipitate his next remark. He leant forward almost as though he would touch me.|$|R

6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] Maraton replied calmly, [...] "I {{did not see the}} faintest reason why I should shorten my visit to Mr. Foley. We had {{arranged}} to meet here to-day <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to me to be quite sufficient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the story," [...] he said, concluding. [...] "I love her, though I've {{never told}} her. If I did tell her I'd {{be ready to}} marry her, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> {{impossible}} in this country. I'd be afraid to risk taking her anywhere. So I intend {{to do the best}} I can for her here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear girl, I've got no business. I'm {{making up}} my mind, you see, {{and do the}} {{ornamental}} while I'm deciding. There always ought to be one gentleman in a family, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to be rather my line," [...] answered Charlie, posing for the character with an assumption of languid elegance {{which would have been}} very effective if his twinkling eyes had not spoilt it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] said I, [...] "paper me, if you please, paper Alan, paper King George! We're {{all three}} innocent, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to be what's wanted. But at least, sir," [...] said I to James, {{recovering}} from my little fit of annoyance, [...] "I am Alan's friend, and if I {{can be helpful}} to friends of his I will not stumble at the risk." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{treatment}} of dancers was sometimes caustic. Choreographer Hermes Pan recalled in 1972 interview that Prinz [...] "would make some girls hysterical. He {{loved to have}} them in tears. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to be the thing, to swear at the girls and be nasty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} really to know, then--can't you see <b>that</b> your remorse <b>seemed</b> to me {{connected}} {{in a certain}} way with your affection; a sort of guarantee of it? You thought you had injured some one or other, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to be mixed up with your loving me, and therefore I let it alone." ...|$|R

She said {{a week or}} two {{ago that}} he had give up trying to paint that Maybough girl, and that she guessed she had got the last of her lessons from him; but she didn't seem much troubled about it. But I guess by her not wantin' to tell, it's him. What do you suppose he did to provoke her?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{loneliness}} {{of the man}} is slowly being borne in upon me. There {{is not a man}} aboard but hates or fears him, nor is there a man whom he does not despise. He seems consuming with the tremendous power that is in him <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> never to have found adequate expression in works. He is as Lucifer would be, were that proud spirit banished to a society of soulless, Tomlinsonian ghosts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Katharine," [...] she said, lifting {{it in the}} air, [...] "I've {{just made}} out such a queer, strange thing about your grandfather. I'm three years and six months older than {{he was when he}} died. I couldn't very well have been his mother, but I might have been his elder sister, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to me such a {{pleasant}} fancy. I'm going to start quite fresh this morning, and get a lot done." ...|$|E
60|$|Ken's dull, gloom-steeped mind {{underwent}} a change, {{but he could}} not speak. He sat up in bed, clutching the paper, and gazing from it to the coach. Raymond came in, followed by Homans, and, last, Reddy Ray, who sat down upon the bed. They were all smiling, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> horrible to Ken.|$|R
60|$|Then there was, for {{a minute}} or two, a silence that both found almost {{intolerable}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> emphasized by the snapping of the fire. There was before the girl a task from which she shrank, but it was clear to her that, since she could not let him go, one of them must speak.|$|R
5000|$|... "They {{were just}} rough demos {{and a few}} weeks later Bon went off to join AC/DC <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to be it ... The fun of {{finishing}} off something first started 22 years ago really appealed to me", explained Head. In the case of [...] "Carey Gulley", Woodhall had only a cassette dub. It was well received.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Westlock, we {{have met}} only once before, but you have known Tom a long while, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to render you {{familiar}} to me. I cannot talk freely with you on any subject unless I relieve my mind of what oppresses it just now. I see with pain that you so far mistrust me that you think me likely to impose on Tom's regardlessness of himself, or on his kind nature, or some of his good qualities.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very glad," [...] she replied, simply. [...] "Sometimes I get discouraged. I {{speak and}} people applaud, and I go away, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be all}} there is to it. I never hear a word afterwards; but once in a while, some one comes to me or writes to me, as you have done, and that gives me courage to go on; {{otherwise}} I'd think people came to hear me simply to be amused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You take {{advantage}} of a hasty word of mine,' said Bella with a little sting of self-reproach, 'to make me seem--I don't know what. I spoke without consideration when I used it. If that was bad, I am sorry; but you repeat it after consideration, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to me to be at least no better. For the rest, I beg it may be understood, Mr Rokesmith, that there is an end of this between us, now and for ever.' ...|$|E
60|$|He turned away, and Ruth pondered {{what she}} had heard. It was plain that her father shrank from {{offending}} Clay; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to confirm the vague but unpleasant suspicions she had entertained about their business relations. Somehow she felt that not yet had she got {{at the bottom of}} her father’s dealings with that man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hadn't the nerve. You {{always seemed}} so--I don't {{know how to}} put it--I always seemed such a worm. I was just trying to get the courage to propose when I caught the mumps, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> to me to finish it. No girl could love a man with three times the proper amount of face." ...|$|R
