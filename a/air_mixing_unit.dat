40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fans on <b>air</b> temperature and humidity distribution in an arched roof greenhouse. The greenhouse was occupied by a tomato crop and equipped with two side roll-up openings for ventilation, a PVC pipe heating system and a fan coil heater. Furthermore, for <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> purposes, an <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. Air temperature and relative humidity was simultaneously recorded in 17 positions equally distributed inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effects of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan on microclimate distribution, {{it was found that}} the mixing fan increased microclimate homogeneity. On the other hand, the use of fan-coil heater was found to increase microclimate heterogeneity. The maximum absolute air temperature and relative humidity difference (observed above the crop) between the centre of the greenhouse and the different measuring positions at the same level, was about 1 °C and 4 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was not used and about 0. 4 °C and 1 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. The use of a fan-coil heater increased the above mentioned differences to the level of about 1. 7 °C and 6 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was not used and about 1 °C and 3 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. Finally, it was observed that the use of an <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan and/or a fan-coil heater reduced the greenhouse air relative humidity...|$|R

2500|$|Benito Mussolini had {{no plans}} to invade Egypt, {{intending}} to remain on the defensive in Libya if war came. After the fall of France in 1940, the 5th Army could send reinforcements east and on 7 August, Mussolini ordered an invasion, to occupy Egypt and establish a land connexion with Italian East Africa. In August a lull fell on the frontier, most of the British armoured units had been withdrawn from the frontier to Mersa Matruh, to conserve their ability to defend the port and the 7th Support Group took over, to establish observation posts from Sollum to Fort Maddalena, ready to delay an Italian offensive; Hussars reconnoitred further into Libya. The Libyan divisions lacked the transport necessary to operate with the Maletti Group, which had a medium, two mixed and four light tank battalions, on the escarpment and were redeployed to the coast road. On 9 September, the Maletti Group got lost en route to Sidi Omar and Graziani cancelled a flanking move and concentrated on the coast road, with five divisions and the Maletti Group; the 4th Blackshirt and 64th Catanzaro divisions stayed in reserve at Tobruk. The 5th [...] a <b>mixed</b> <b>air</b> <b>unit</b> with about [...] aircraft, airfield equipment and transport, stood by to support the advance and occupy airfields.|$|R

We pose a conjecture concerning characterizations of such <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs, verify parts of it in general, and prove it completely for diamond-free graphs. In particular, we characterize diamond-free <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs {{by means of an}} infinite family of forbidden induced subgraphs, and we show that a diamond-free graph is <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval if and only if it has intersection representations using unit intervals such that all ends of the intervals are integral...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the missing {{class of the}} hierarchy of <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs, generated by the intersection graphs of closed, open and one type of half-open intervals of the real line. This class lies strictly between unit interval graphs and <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs. We give a complete characterization of this new class, as well as quadratic-time algorithms that recognize graphs from this class and produce a corresponding interval representation if one exists. We also mention that the work in arXiv: 1405. 4247 directly extends to provide a quadratic-time algorithm to recognize the class of <b>mixed</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs.

40|$|Liquid {{desiccant}} is an energy-saving, {{environmentally friendly}} and healthy means of air dehumidification. A liquid desiccant-based all-air {{air conditioning system}} is studied by simulation. Two different modes of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> between the return air and the fresh air are compared, that is mixing before and mixing after the liquid desiccant dehumidifier, respectively. System performance and total energy consumption of the two modes under different operation conditions are obtained. The results show that <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> after dehumidification consumes less energy than <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> before dehumidification. Coefficient of performance (COP) of the all-air system with <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> after dehumidification is higher. The differences of COP and energy consumption between the two <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> modes increase when the outdoor air temperature and relative humidity increase. Practical application: Liquid desiccant based all-air system is quite suitable for museums, libraries and computer centres where water {{is not allowed to}} enter the space for property safety and strict thermal-hygrometric control is necessary. The results of this paper provide guidelines on the selection of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> modes in liquid desiccant-based all-air systems, considering energy consumption and system COP.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of spray position on fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> quality, three-dimensional numerical simulation of the working process of a heavy-duty diesel was conducted. To quantitatively study the mechanism {{of the effect of}} spray position on fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> process, the deviation of spray centroid was introduced to describe the spray position change in combustion chamber. The results show that the gas intake swirl can affect the spatial distribution of spray in combustion chamber under three directions in cylindrical coordinate, in which the circumferential distribution is affected most. It then can be concluded that the spray can be limited to the vicinity of the combustion chamber axis. Better spray position, which is more helpful for the process of fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> and combustion, can be achieved by using optimal swirl, so that the power performance will be improved...|$|R

25|$|Vertical <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> {{was invented}} by Erik Uppstu. His idea is to turn {{traditional}} vertical mixing to horizontal mixing. Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by secondary air. By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved <b>mixing</b> results. Vertical <b>air</b> has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions. In vertical <b>air</b> <b>mixing,</b> primary <b>air</b> supply is arranged conventionally. Rest of the air ports are placed on interlacing 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement.|$|R
40|$|The {{transceiver}} (TR) module of {{a middle}} and upper atmospheric radar is described. The TR module used in the radar is mainly composed of two units: a mixer (<b>MIX</b> <b>unit)</b> and a power amplifier (PA unit). The former generates the RF wave for transmission and converts the received echo to the IF signal. A 41. 5 -MHz local signal fed to mixers passes through a digitally controlled 8 -bit phase shifter which can change its value up to 1, 000 times in a second, so that the MU radar {{has the ability to}} steer its antenna direction quickly and flexibly. The <b>MIX</b> <b>unit</b> also contains a buffer amplifier and a gate for the transmitting signal and preamplifier for the received one whose noise figure is less than 5 dB. The PA unit amplifies the RF signal supplied from the <b>MIX</b> <b>unit</b> up to 63. 7 dBm (2350 W), and feeds it to the crossed Yagi antenna...|$|R
