5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} <b>and</b> <b>respected</b> for {{the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics.

40|$|More than a {{third of}} an employee’s time is often spent in a {{stressful}} environment – the workplace. The stress can be alleviated when employees treat each other with trust <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> when friendships are forged. Relationships are necessary for effective teamwork in organisations and will not develop without mutual trust <b>and</b> <b>respect.</b> The purpose of this research was to explore the employees’ experiences regarding relationships, trust <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> related to participation in organisational team sport. Improved relationships, trust <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> among employees should enhance the competence in the organisation because the organisation works towards mutual goals. Once the goals of the organisation are aligned, the organisation can move forward through strong leadership. The qualitative exploration study was conducted among 26 employees of two financial organisations that engage in organisational team sport. The data were collected by means of focus group interviews. The results indicated that a strong bond was established between employees in the organisation during organisational team sport. Organisational team sport should be considered as a vehicle for improving cohesion and increasing trust <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> in a workforce, since it enhances friendships among employees. The contributions that organisational team sport makes to an organisation are all requirements for an effective workforce. The findings contribute valuable new knowledge to the literature on the influence of organisational team sport on relationships, trust <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> between employees. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs <b>and</b> <b>respected</b> the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
