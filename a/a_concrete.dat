5|$|Another {{innovation}} was {{a mobile}} pillbox {{that could be}} driven out onto the airfield. This {{was known as the}} Bison and consisted of a lorry with <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> armoured cabin and a small concrete pillbox on the flat bed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> and steel base, <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} of the island are the remains of a 19th-century wharf {{including}} concrete tracks, rock cutting and iron fixings (several brackets and stumps). <b>A</b> <b>concrete</b> helipad west of the lighthouse was constructed in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The first {{railway bridge}} was {{destroyed}} by flood in 1887. <b>A</b> new <b>concrete,</b> steel and timber bridge lasted until 1972 when it was replaced by <b>a</b> pre-stressed <b>concrete</b> bridge.|$|R

5|$|Burnham {{was seriously}} {{affected}} by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, and various flood defences have been installed since then.

50|$|Between 1960 and 1962, Ganley {{competed in}} many events {{throughout}} New Zealand driving a Lotus Eleven. Throughout this period, he was {{earning a living}} by working as a foreman for <b>a</b> <b>concreting</b> company.|$|R
5|$|St. Peter and St. Paul Counterguard – a two-tiered counterguard {{built in}} 1640 near St. Peter and St. Paul Bastion. Its salient angle {{contains}} an echaugette, {{and it also}} contains a gunpowder magazine and <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> observation platform.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> mobile <b>{{concrete}}</b> mixer, or mobile concrete dispenser as it {{is sometimes}} also called, is <b>an</b> on-demand <b>concrete</b> production solution. <b>A</b> mobile <b>concrete</b> mixer is <b>a</b> batch plant mounted on a chassis-usually a truck or trailer-and carries unmixed material (sand, cement, coarse aggregates, water and any other materials or chemicals needed for more specialty applications) to a job site and mixed on a continuous or intermittent basis as required for fresh maximum strength concrete.|$|R
5000|$|Originally it was {{a stadium}} with <b>a</b> single <b>concrete</b> stand and grass {{terraces}} on the other sides. <b>A</b> new <b>concrete</b> stand was built opposite the main stand and opened for the 2011 season. The stadium's capacity is 18,025 people.|$|R
5|$|A seven-mile (11km) journey over {{increasingly}} {{rolling and}} open terrain takes the two highways {{into the town}} of North East and towards Millerton. Just south of the village, NY199 reaches its eastern terminus. The road enters Millerton on South Elm Street, making a sharp turn north that necessitates <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> barrier and a lower speed limit just south of downtown.|$|E
5|$|A stable {{was also}} {{constructed}} at the premises {{from the same}} concrete blocks with Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles. In 1960, as the stables were being converted to a garage, the roof tiles were replaced with <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> tiles. Three timber doors to the former stable, tack and carriage rooms remain.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, the cathedral underwent a series of renovations. The roof—which was previously made of timber—was replaced with <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> one in 1952 due to damage from termites. The reordering of the sanctuary took place in 1969 after the Second Vatican Council, in which the main altar was moved to the cathedral's crossing. In 1988, air conditioning was installed and the roof underwent reparation.|$|E
500|$|Numerous bridges {{have been}} built across Leggetts Creek. A masonry arch bridge with a length of [...] carries North Main Street over the creek. <b>A</b> 36.1-foot-long <b>concrete</b> tee beam bridge was built in 1905 and carries Rockwell Avenue across the creek. <b>A</b> 38.1-foot-long <b>concrete</b> tee beam bridge was built in 1936 and carries US Route 11 across the creek. In 1941, <b>a</b> 26.9-foot-long <b>concrete</b> culvert bridge that carries State Route 6006 was {{constructed}} over the creek. In 1961, a 32.2-foot-long two-span steel culvert bridge that carries an Interstate 81 ramp was constructed over the creek. <b>A</b> 23.0-foot-long <b>concrete</b> culvert bridge {{was built in the}} same year and carries Interstate 81 over the creek.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the concept in Naruto. He further asserted that it was a term to apply <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> definition to the ninjas' ability to use jutsu in the series and is comparable to the Force in Star Wars or to magic points in role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} the collapse of <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in {{the rubble of the}} hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5000|$|The dam is 45 feet high, 1339 {{feet long}} at its crest, and {{consists}} of <b>a</b> 450-foot <b>concrete</b> spillway, <b>a</b> 125-foot-long <b>concrete</b> section containing five 20-foot-wide Tainter gates, <b>a</b> 70-foot-long <b>concrete</b> section containing two Broome gates, a fishway, and a log sluice, and a 694-foot-long earthen dike. [...] The dam is {{owned and operated by}} NextEra Energy, but no electricity is generated here. The dam is operated to regulate and augment flows that are used by eight downstream mainstem Kennebec River hydropower projects, and to control flooding.|$|R
