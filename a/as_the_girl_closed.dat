6000|$|... "My ain sister's child!" [...] cried Bishopriggs, lying {{with his}} {{customary}} readiness. [...] "Go yer ways, Maggie. The bonny lassie's my ain kith and kin. The tongue o' scandal, I trow, has naething to say against that.--Lord save us and guide us!" [...] he added In another tone, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>closed</b> {{the door on}} them, [...] "what brings ye here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary Brady, if {{you wish}} to change the ugly name that's on you this night, will you come here?" [...] and he seized hold of the young woman's arm and dragged her round; [...] "and who's wanting you, Biddy?" [...] <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> {{followed}} <b>close</b> behind her principal.|$|R
60|$|But Stoutenburg was far {{too deeply}} engrossed in his own affairs to take much note of his surroundings; <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> door behind her, he called her roughly to him and she--frightened and obedient--came forward without a word, {{standing}} now before him, with hanging arms and bowed head, whilst a slight shiver shook her girlish form from time to time.|$|R
5000|$|Tami Oyoki is {{referred}} to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> who came <b>close</b> to having a relationship with Hiro in the past. She was Kimiko's best friend and was only nice to Hiro because he was [...] "her friend's geeky little brother".|$|R
50|$|Louis was a {{prime suspect}} in the disappearances in the Yonne Département of seven young women with mild mental {{deficiencies}} between 1975 and 1980. The disappearances initially did not attract much attention, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> had no <b>close</b> relatives and lived in homes for the handicapped; {{it was assumed that}} they had simply run away. A local detective, Christian Jambert, looked into <b>the</b> possible crimes <b>as</b> early as 1981. However, his reports were ignored, and he later died under mysterious circumstances.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the veranda}} of the ranchhouse Barbara Harding {{came to a}} sudden halt. Her entire manner {{indicated}} final decision, and determination. A moment she stood in thought and then ran quickly {{down the steps and}} {{in the direction of the}} office. Here she found Eddie dozing at his post. She did not disturb him. A glance through the window satisfied her that he was alone with the prisoner. From the office building Barbara passed on to the corral. A few horses stood within the enclosure, their heads drooping dejectedly. As she entered they raised their muzzles and sniffed suspiciously, ears a-cock, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> approached <b>closer</b> to them they moved warily away, snorting, and passed around her to the opposite side of the corral. As they moved by her she scrutinized them and her heart dropped, for Brazos was not among them. He must have been turned out into the pasture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{for the title}} track was {{directed}} by maxilla. The video begins showing vocalist Taka starting to sing melancholy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> camera zooms out while giving glimpses of the other members playing their instruments. It then focuses on a young man holding {{what appears to be}} a diamond, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> song takes an intense drop while showing key frames of the phrases 'Take my hand' & 'And bring me back". The band starts playing inside an extant empty dark room, a young woman then is shown briefly waiting in a desolated beach while the man starts walking slowly. The whole video is recorded with a gloomy filter and bright brief gleams. Vocalist Taka passionately keeps on singing while drummer Tomoya is often shown from a back perspective with the camera occasionally focusing on guitarist Toru and bassist Ryota. All the band members move in slow motion at first showing they are in sync with their movements while performing. Eventually the phrases 'Stand up stand up', 'Wake up wake up', 'Never give up' and 'Just tell me why baby' take over the screen and then leave a wide perspective of the band playing with quick focuses on Taka and the unnamed young man who keeps walking while limping. The room where the band is playing keeps getting darker and somehow foggy. When the man finally shows up in the beach the songs reaches its climax and most intense and heavy part with the guitar and bass getting louder as a countdown begins, the young man then gives the diamond to <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> and then blacks out. The song reaches its lowest part right after this and the man seems to have died <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> softly <b>closes</b> his eyes while crying then walks away, with Taka singing softly and saddening the moment more. <b>The</b> <b>girl</b> walks away and then the band enters the last chorus while headbanging to the melancholic melody accompanied by a subtle piano beat that indicates the close end then Taka sings out 'It finally begins' <b>as</b> <b>the</b> end, the noise of the guitar fades out and the band members stand still looking down while the image fades out. The song title 'The Beginning' is shown at the end sparkling then fading out too. 'The Beginning' won two awards at the VMAJ 2013 and an award at the Space Shower Music Awards ...|$|R
60|$|The {{steamboat}} swung around, but {{the run of}} {{the water}} washed <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>closer</b> and closer to the paddle wheel.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>girl</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> door smartly, and, {{turning the}} key, opened it again without any difficulty. To satisfy herself—on more points than one—she {{repeated}} the performance.|$|R
6000|$|They {{looked at}} each other with a long, deep gaze. Then, as Mrs. Gereth seemed again about to speak, <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>closing</b> her eyes, made a gesture of strong prohibition. [...] "Don't tell me!" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. The woman {{found it}} hard to know what to say. Somewhere down along the white, dusty road a man was {{grinding}} the music of a threadbare waltz from an ancient barrel-organ. <b>The</b> <b>girl</b> <b>closed</b> her eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Summer Sisters is a coming-of-age {{novel about}} two friends, Caitlin Somers and Victoria [...] "Vix" [...] Leonard, who spend every summer {{together}} <b>as</b> teenagers. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> are polar opposites, Caitlin being beautiful, lively and popular while Vix is a shy but intellectual wallflower.

6000|$|... "Where {{on earth}} are you?" [...] {{continued}} the first voice, which now appeared {{to come from the}} other side of the willows on the path by which <b>the</b> young <b>girl</b> had approached. [...] "Here, aunty," [...] replied <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>closing</b> her sketch-book with a snap and starting to her feet.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>girls</b> get <b>closer</b> {{to finding}} Grace. A guest brings chaos to the Hartmann Payne party.|$|R
60|$|This {{he folded}} up and {{addressed}} to his partner. In another minute <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> was flying down the tenement stairs, two steps at a time, <b>the</b> other <b>girl</b> <b>close</b> behind her.|$|R
60|$|The clang of {{the distant}} bell chased away Elsa's last {{hovering}} dreams. Andor did not hear it; he was pressing <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>closer</b> and closer to him, unmindful of his surroundings, unmindful {{that he was on}} the high road, and that frequently ox-carts went by laden with people, and that passers-by were hurrying now toward the railway station.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hilda, my {{religious}} Hilda," [...] whispered Miriam, suddenly drawing <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>close</b> to her, [...] "do {{you know}} how it is with me? I would give all I have or hope--my life, O how freely--for one instant of your trust in God! You little guess my need of it. You really think, then, that He sees and cares for us?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>girls</b> hung <b>close</b> to <b>the</b> arms of {{the young}} men and they went down to the tent and looked in.|$|R
60|$|Billy Byrne {{opened his}} eyes a little wider, turning them until they rested on the {{beautiful}} face of <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> so <b>close</b> to his.|$|R
60|$|I pressed <b>the</b> dying <b>girl</b> <b>closer</b> to my heart, {{a species}} of {{involuntary}} declaration of the difficulty I experienced in regarding her loss with the religious philosophy she was inculcating.|$|R
60|$|But no animal being decoyed {{by these}} blandishments, <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> slowly <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> door, and re-fastened it; leaving Mr. Pickwick drawn up {{straight}} against the wall.|$|R
60|$|Helen watched Mrs. Zane <b>as</b> if fascinated. <b>The</b> colonel's wife {{continued}} to talk while with deft fingers she forced {{a few drops}} of brandy between <b>the</b> <b>girl's</b> <b>closed</b> teeth. Then with the adroitness of a skilled surgeon, she made the examination. Helen had heard of this pioneer woman's skill in setting broken bones and treating injuries, and when she looked from the calm face to the steady fingers, she had no doubt <b>as</b> to <b>the</b> truth of what had been told.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>girl</b> came <b>close</b> to him, {{looking up}} with {{pleading}} eyes. Somehow {{she could not}} {{bear the thought of}} his going back into the terrible jungle alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a big price, Ronnie," [...] he said, [...] "but you'll {{have to pay}} it. The {{sooner you}} marry <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> and <b>close</b> her mouth, the better." ...|$|R
60|$|When Betty said that, the Queen put out {{her hand}} and drew <b>the</b> little <b>girl</b> <b>closer,</b> <b>as</b> if her tender heart pitied the motherless child and longed to help if she only knew how.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for several moments. <b>The</b> <b>girl's</b> fingers <b>closed</b> upon <b>the</b> packet. She turned round and faced them all. She faced them all, but she {{addressed}} more particularly Wrayson.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Baby is gone {{quietly to}} sleep,' began Albinia {{in a low}} voice, {{beginning}} in displeasure; but <b>as</b> she spoke, <b>the</b> harshness of Sophy's face gave way, she sank down on the floor, and fell into the most overpowering fit of weeping that Albinia had ever witnessed. Kneeling beside her, she would have drawn <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>close</b> to her, but a sharp cry of pain startled her, and she found the right arm, from elbow to wrist, all one purple bruise, the skin grazed, and the blood starting.|$|R
6000|$|Dale {{did not pay}} {{any more}} {{attention}} to him. Gathering up Helen's baggage, he said, [...] "Come on," [...] and shouldered a lane through the gaping crowd. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> followed <b>close</b> at his heels.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} of his entry the maniac looked up, and as he saw at first only a man in the uniform of his father's soldiers, he shrieked forth an angry order, but at the second glance, which {{revealed}} the face of the newcomer, the madman leaped from the prostrate form of his victim and, apparently forgetful of the saber which he had dropped upon the floor beside <b>the</b> couch <b>as</b> he leaped to grapple with <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>closed</b> with bare hands upon his antagonist, his sharp-filed teeth searching for the other's throat.|$|R
60|$|Behind <b>the</b> panel, <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> stood {{shrinking}} <b>close</b> to De Conde, {{her hand}} still in his.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> two <b>girls</b> sat <b>close</b> together, {{their eyes}} fixed upon the {{apparently}} lifeless {{head of the}} bovine infant.|$|R
50|$|Students at the school: <b>The</b> other <b>girls</b> {{who attend}} <b>the</b> {{boarding}} school with Madeline. Most of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> were initially nameless {{in the book}} series, while some were given names in the animated television series. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> are <b>close</b> {{to one another and}} treat each other as family.|$|R
6000|$|Bradley {{felt his}} blood boil at {{sight of the}} cowardly indignities being heaped upon his men, and in the brief span of time {{occupied}} by the column to come abreast of where he lay hidden he made his plans, foolhardy though he knew them. Then he drew <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>close</b> to him. [...] "Stay here," [...] he whispered. [...] "I am going out to fight those beasts; but I shall be killed. Do not let them see you. Do not let them take you alive. They are more cruel, more cowardly, more bestial than the Wieroos." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{came back in}} a few minutes, and by that time there were a few plates upon the table. He sat down, and then stood up once more when he saw <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> {{standing}} <b>close</b> by with a tray.|$|R
60|$|The fright of {{the noises}} {{in the dark}} chamber had but served to again bring <b>the</b> <b>girl's</b> face <b>close</b> to his so that he felt her hot, sweet breath upon his cheek, and thus another link was forged to bind him to her.|$|R
60|$|He {{could feel}} the body of <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> pressed <b>close</b> to his tremble as her eyes rested upon the inmates of the room, and involuntarily his arm encircled her {{shoulders}} as though {{to protect her from}} some danger which he sensed without recognizing.|$|R
