500|$|In a press release, Jared Leto {{explained}} the meaning behind the music video: City of Angels' {{is a short}} film about this wild, weird, and wonderful land, Los Angeles, California. A place that has left its mark on the world's imagination and a place where dreams can actually come true. I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs. It's {{not so much about}} this particular city but more about the people who inhabit it." [...] He further said, [...] "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it takes to become who you really want to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Hausmann {{says the}} film [...] "explicitly affirms the {{importance}} of upholding the prohibition against incest"; a recurring theme of Ball's work is his comparison of the taboos against incest and homosexuality. Instead of making an overt distinction, American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence. Col. Fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester. Ball said, [...] "The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> [...] can do." [...] The film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires: Lester's pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter, while Col. Fitts' repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which he controls Ricky. Consequently, Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual, while Angela's vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities {{and the limits of}} his fantasy. Col. Fitts represents Ball's father, whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness. Ball rewrote Col. Fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual, which Munt reads as a possible [...] "deferment of Ball's own patriarchal-incest fantasies".|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Achy Obejas {{called the}} {{recording}} a fragmentary work {{and said it}} is [...] "Selena's past <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> might have been". Obejas called the record [...] "full of promise and flaws", and said its intentional bilingual nature was done by [...] "necessity rather than design". She also said the album is a Latino crossover nix, citing Gloria Estefan's earlier mainstream work as the primitive Latino crossover; although Selena [...] "didn't get {{to take the next}} step" [...] as did Estefan. Objeas also wrote that the album is the opposite of a [...] "masterpiece, or definitive, or even a testament to Selena's talents", but is more of a [...] "smorgasbord". Objeas praised Selena's [...] "complete ease on the R tunes" [...] and thought she was [...] "getting funky and pretty soulful". Enrique Lopetegui of The Los Angeles Times said Dreaming of You is Selena's [...] "most electric and satisfying album", and said it was an applicable [...] "epitaph" [...] for her. Lopetegui called the songs on the album [...] "radio-friendly pop tunes" [...] but said the album [...] "lacks cohesion" [...] and that he finds the bilingual album [...] "even more interesting than the original idea". According to Lopetegui, Selena [...] "blossoms into a full-fledged soul singer, with an aggressiveness seldom show before" [...] on her English-language tracks but finds the rancheras [...] "Tú Sólo Tú" [...] and [...] "El Toro Relajo" [...] the [...] "most impressive" [...] and saying Selena was inexperienced with that style. Christopher John Farley of Time magazine said Dreaming of You elevated Selena's music [...] "to a far wider audience than she ever had when she was alive". He said the album incorporates her [...] "finest, most enjoyable work" [...] and called it [...] "a commendable but sorrowful accomplishment". Contrasting her Tejano and English-language songs, Farley wrote that Selena's Tejano recordings was sometimes clumsy, whereas her English pop songs were [...] "sweet, pure and clear, and on the mariachi numbers, Selena shows off a voice that is sexy, strong and gracefully maturing".|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Kevin Williamson {{had little}} {{interest}} in developing the series, finding the premise too similar to other vampire tales. However, at the urging of Julie Plec, he began to read the novels and started to become intrigued by the story: [...] "I began to realize that it was a story about a small town, about that town's underbelly <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> lurks under the surface." [...] Williamson has stated the town's story will be the main focus of the series rather than high school.|$|E
2500|$|A short {{distance}} {{farther up the}} James, in 1611, Thomas Dale began {{the construction of a}} progressive development at Henricus on <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was later known as Farrars Island. Henricus was envisioned as possible replacement capital for Jamestown, and was to have the first college in Virginia. (The ill-fated Henricus was destroyed during the Indian Massacre of 1622). In addition to creating the new settlement at Henricus, Dale also established the port town of Bermuda Hundred, as well as [...] "Bermuda Cittie" [...] (sic) in 1613, now part of Hopewell, Virginia. He began the excavation work at Dutch Gap, using methods he had learned while serving in Holland.|$|E

2500|$|As it was, Twain {{was glad}} to welcome Kipling and had a two-hour {{conversation}} with him on trends in Anglo-American literature <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Twain was going to write in a sequel to Tom Sawyer, with Twain assuring Kipling that a sequel was coming; {{but he had not}} decided upon the ending: either Sawyer would be elected to Congress or would be hanged. Twain also passed along the literary advice that an author should: [...] "Get your facts first and then you can distort 'em as much as you please." [...] Twain, who rather liked Kipling, later wrote about their meeting: [...] "Between us, we cover all knowledge; he covers all that can be known and I cover the rest". Kipling then crossed the Atlantic and reached Liverpool in October 1889. He soon made his début in the London literary world—to great acclaim.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Frazier's {{testimony}} [...] adds, [...] "Just as I said in {{the case}} of Mr. Curly, my initial feeling was, when I first heard about this, that the facts had not been established and we needed to be careful to make sure we understood the facts. As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was {{said in the}} presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sir Reginald Johnston {{arrived in}} the Forbidden City as Puyi's English tutor on 3 March 1919. Puyi had never met a {{foreigner}} prior to this, recalling: [...] "I have never seen foreign men. From the magazines, I noticed they had big mustaches. The eunuchs said the mustaches were very hard and a lantern could be hung at its ends". President Xu Shichang believed that the monarchy {{was going to be}} restored in China sooner or later, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi [...] "subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English". Johnston was allowed only five texts in English to give Puyi to read, namely Alice in Wonderland and translations into English of the [...] "Four Great Books" [...] of Confucianism; the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean. However, Johnston disregarded the rules, and taught Puyi about world history with a special focus on British history. Johnston also told Puyi so much about his native Scotland that Puyi eventually expressed the desire to visit the [...] "Scotland the Brave" [...] that his tutor spoke of with such pride and love. Besides history, Johnston taught Puyi philosophy <b>and</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he saw as the superiority of monarchies over republics. Puyi remembered that the piecing blue eyes of his tutor [...] "made me feel uneasy ... I found him very intimidating and studied English with him like a good boy, not daring to talk about other things when I got bored ... as I did with my other Chinese tutors".|$|E
