5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project.

5|$|The nuclear {{reactors}} were decommissioned {{at the end}} of the Cold War, and the Hanford site is the focus of one of the world's largest environmental cleanup, managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the Washington Department of Ecology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency. Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270billionUSgallons (1billionm3) of groundwater contaminated by high-level nuclear waste that has leaked out of Hanford's underground storage tanks. , 1millionUSgallons (3,785m3) of highly radioactive waste is traveling through groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the egg mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E

5|$|Pitt has a {{sustained}} interest in architecture, even taking {{time away from}} film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry. He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award {{in recognition of the}} project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated.
