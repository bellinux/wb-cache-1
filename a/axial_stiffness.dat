The objective {{of this study was}} to assess whether <b>axial</b> trunk <b>stiffness</b> is increased in gait in CLBP patients. 15 CLBP patients and 15 healthy controls walked on a treadmill that imposed rotational perturbations in the transverse plane. The effect of these perturbations on transverse pelvis, thorax and trunk (thorax relative to pelvis) rotations was evaluated in terms of residual rotations, i. e., the deviation of these movements from the unperturbed patterns. In view of the heterogeneity of the CLBP group, we additionally performed a subgroup comparison between seven patients and seven controls with maximal between-group contrast for timing of thorax rotations. Rotations of the walking surface had a clear effect on transverse pelvis, thorax and trunk rotations in all groups. No significant between-group differences on residual transverse pelvis, thorax and trunk rotations were observed. <b>Axial</b> trunk <b>stiffness</b> in gait does not appear to be increased in CLBP.

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] and Kraincanic recently developed two somewhat different theoretical models for analysing large-diameter wire ropes with either an independent wire rope core (IWRC) or a fibre core. Most importantly, unlike all of the previously available theories (with their often very lengthy mathematical formulations), very encouraging correlations have been found between Raoof and Kraincanic's theoretical predictions of wire rope <b>axial</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> and a fairly large body of experimental data from other sources, hence providing ample support for the reliability of both theoretical models. Raoof and Kraincanic's original models were, however, computer based and involved certain iterative procedures. This potential drawback for practical applications (in an area where, by tradition, {{the rule of thumb}} reigns supreme) is overcome in the present paper, which reports details of some simplified (but still accurate) procedures for predicting the no-slip and/or full-slip <b>axial</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of wire ropes with either an independent wire rope core or a fibre core, with the proposed formulations being amenable to simple hand calculations using a pocket calculator, which is of value to busy practising engineers...|$|R

Elastic modulus is a property of the constituent material; stiffness is a property of a structure or component of a structure, and hence it is dependent upon various physical dimensions that describe that component.

50|$|The {{platform}} is permanently moored {{by means of}} tethers or tendons grouped {{at each of the}} structure's corners. A group of tethers is called a tension leg. A feature of the design of the tethers is that they have relatively high <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> (low elasticity), such that virtually all vertical motion of the {{platform is}} eliminated. This allows the platform to have the production wellheads on deck (connected directly to the subsea wells by rigid risers), instead of on the seafloor. This allows a simpler well completion and gives better control over the production from the oil or gas reservoir, and easier access for downhole intervention operations.|$|E
5000|$|A coned disc also becomes stiff against axial loads, as the web is {{no longer}} purely {{perpendicular}} to the axis of the wheel. Unlike a flat disc, there is no direction where the whole of a coned disc would be perpendicular (and thus flexible) to it. A drawback of a simple cone is that the wheel now becomes wider, along the axis. The wobbly web effectively [...] "folds" [...] a coned disc wheel into pleats, making it narrower again, but retaining the <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness.</b> This pleated disc is also stiffer against nutating forces. A similar feature, a 'sine wave wall', is sometimes encountered in architecture where a straight wall is made stronger against sideways forces by corrugating it.|$|E

40|$|A {{combination}} of uniaxial compression tests and Strip Model and Finite Element analyses of laminates artificially delaminated to create circular [±θ] sublaminates {{is used to}} assess the influence of fibre angle on the compressive strength of composite laminates. Sublaminates with 0 ° < θ < 40 ° are found to fail by sublaminate-buckling-driven delamination propagation and provide poor tolerance of delamination. This is a consequence of their relatively high <b>axial</b> <b>stiffnesses,</b> low sublaminate buckling strains, Poisson’s ratio induced compressive transverse strains and extension-twist coupling which produces unexpected sublaminate buckling mode shapes. Sublaminates with 40 ° < θ < 60 ° are most tolerant to delamination; <b>axial</b> and transverse <b>stiffnesses</b> are minimal, formation of sublaminate buckles is resisted, high laminate buckling strains reduce interaction between laminate and sublaminate buckling mode shapes and extension-twist coupling is minimal. Sublaminates with 60 ° < θ < 90 ° are shown to produce varied tolerance of delamination. Sublaminate buckling is generally prevented owing to transverse tensile strains induced by mismatches between laminate and sublaminate Poisson’s ratios but may occur in laminates with low Poisson’s ratios...|$|R

40|$|PublishedHighly dynamic {{floating}} bodies such as {{wave energy}} convertors (WECs) require mooring lines with particular mechanical properties; the mooring system must achieve adequate station keeping whilst controlling mooring tensions within acceptable limits. Currently, fibre ropes {{are commonly used}} but many mooring designers are seeking alternative solutions that can offer more favourable mechanical properties. The compliance offered by a mooring system will depend largely on the <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the mooring lines. Whilst fibre ropes can offer lower <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> than alternatives such as chain and wire rope, there remains a fundamental conflict which prohibits the free selection of <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> properties. This conflict exists because the <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> is strongly governed by the minimum breaking load (MBL) of the rope. The specified MBL must be sufficient to accommodate the predicted peak tension loads with an appropriate factor of safety (FOS) to cater for uncertainties and degradations. In achieving a sufficient MBL, the designer is often forced to accept a higher <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> than is preferred. A potential benefit of reducing the <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a mooring line is the reduction of peak loads and fatigue loads. This allows a reduction in mass of both the floating body and the mooring system, thus reducing costs and improving system reliability. This work describes the 'Exeter Tether', an innovation in mooring tether design which decouples the <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness</b> properties from the MBL of the tether. Removing this constraint allows a tether to be specified according to both MBL and <b>axial</b> <b>stiffness.</b> The principals behind the novel tether design are introduced along with an outline of 10 prototype tether variants manufactured in collaboration with Lankhorst Ropes. Results from the proof of concept tests at the University of Exeter's Dynamic Marine Component Test Facility (DMaC) are presented together with preliminary findings from sea trials at the South West Moorings Test Facility (SWMTF). The anticipated load mitigation introduced via the mooring tether is investigated and the implications for system design are discussed.

40|$|The {{effects of}} random member length errors {{on the surface}} accuracy, the defocus, and the residual, {{internal}} loads of tetrahedral truss antenna reflectors have been studied analytically. The analytical procedure involves performing multiple, deterministic finite element structural analyses for a particular truss.

A best fit paraboloid analysis is used to determine a {{root mean square error}} and defocus from each analysis. The statistical properties of these quantities as well as the internal loads are calculated from the results of many independent analyses.

40|$|Bending and torsion of {{composite}} beams (torsional-warping {{shear deformation}} theory) Lászlo ́ P Kollár and Aniko ́ Pluzsik In {{the design of}} composite sections, beam theories are used which require {{the knowledge of the}} cross-sectional properties, that is, the bending-, the shear-, the torsional-, warping-, <b>axial</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> and the coupling terms. In the classical analysis, the properties are calculated by assuming kinematical relationships (e. g. cross sections remain plane after the deformation of the beam). These assumptions may lead to inaccurate or contradictory results. In this paper, a new theory is presented in which no kinematical assumption is applied, rather the properties are derived from the accurate (three dimensional) equations of beams using limit transition. The theory includes both the in-plane and the torsional-warping shear deformations. As a result of the analysis, the stiffness matrix of the beam is obtained which is needed for either analytical or numerical finite element (FE) solutions.
