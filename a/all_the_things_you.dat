He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the fact that I might have been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> do when you find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

The song contains the album title lyric [...] "...do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> never dared!" [...] (although the album is actually named after a Vogue magazine cover). Philip Adrian Wright called the song a metaphor for the band's ambition in 1981. The song was remixed and released as a single in 2008 on Hooj Choons label; reaching number 2 on the UK Dance Charts.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Tancredo {{said his}} falling {{out with the}} White House has lasted. [...] "One reason I am persona non grata at the White House is {{not just because of}} immigration... but because I refuse to support him on his trade policy, his {{education}} policy, Medicare and prescription drugs initiatives.... Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence." [...] Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. [...] "I was called into Tom DeLay's office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. He called me and said to me, 'You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.' And I said, 'Tom, out of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can threaten with me that is the least effective because I do not look at this place as a career.'" ...|$|E

[...] In an {{interview}} for British online magazine The Quietus, Del Rey stated that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from her ex-boyfriend, commenting, [...] "I think we came together because we were both outsiders. It was perfect. But I think with that contentment also comes sadness. There was something heavenly about that life– we'd go to work and he'd play his video games– but also it was maybe too regular." [...] The singer also stated that she used lower vocals for [...] "Video Games" [...] because she felt that the public did not see her as a serious artist. Thematically, the lyrics have been labeled as antifeminist. Of the musical composition, MTV lauded the cinematic atmosphere of the song, adoring its feathery violins, echoing electronic thumps, and melancholic crescendos — wound into a dramatic exhibition.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
