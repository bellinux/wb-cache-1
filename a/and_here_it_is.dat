5|$|The games chronicle {{the adventures}} of a new Pokémon trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by {{collecting}} and training Pokémon. Like most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders (Roark, Gardenia, Maylene, Crasher Wake, Fantina, Byron, Candice, and Volkner) serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym Badges, key {{to the advancement of}} the plot. As all core games, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate (<b>and</b> <b>here,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Team Galactic), who plans to use Pokémon to create a new universe just for themselves, while destroying the current one.|$|E
2500|$|Kyle Patrick for GTPlanet, however, {{was more}} positive, praising {{the quality of}} driving by all participants: [...] "Real drivers showed they could hang with the gamers on their own turf, {{which can only be}} a good thing for both sides moving forward." [...] Lukáš Redl of Medium wrote that it was {{possible}} to construct an audience around the concept of a virtual motor race and noted people approved of it. He wrote that the sim racing industry needed to adapt to a new strategy and put their focus on eSports, [...] "It is actually quite a rare example in eSports as most disciplines are not based on making things as real as possible. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessary." [...] Writing for Alphr, Curtis Moldrich echoed similar statements and believed the positive consequence of the Vegas eRace was a testament on how Formula E is forward-looking. He felt Formula One would not be able to negotiate all of their drivers into undertaking a similar event. Autosport's Scott Mitchell called the event [...] " an enormous middle finger to the traditionalists", and although he believed another eRace was unlikely to be repeated on a large scale, he wrote it was [...] "huge for a hidden part of motorsport that Formula E has taken that chance" ...|$|E
2500|$|In all the {{instances}} above {{quoted in}} Sumer and Egypt the bricks, whether burnt or sun-dried, {{were of the}} description to which the term [...] "tile" [...] would now be given; the dimensions varied from [...] to [...] being generally square and about [...] to [...] thick, {{and they were not}} shaped as voussoirs, the connecting medium being thicker at the top than at the bottom. The earliest Egyptian examples of regular voussoirs in stone belong to the XXVIth Dynasty (ca. 650 B.C.) in the additions made then to the temple of Medinet Habu, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> probable that centering of some kind was provided, as the vaults are built in rings, so that the same centering could be shifted on after the completion of each ring. The earliest example of regularly shaped voussoirs, and of about the same date, is found in the cloaca at Graviscae in Etruria, with a span of about , the voussoirs of which are from 5 to [...] long. The cloaca maxima in Rome, built by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (603 B.C.) to drain the marshy ground between the Palatine and the Capitoline Hills, was according to Commendatore Boni vaulted over in the 1st century B.C., the vault being over [...] long, [...] in span, with three concentric rings of voussoirs.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Harold Quaritch {{once more}} beheld the face which had haunted his memory {{for so many}} months.|$|R
60|$|Yes! By Jupiter, there <b>was</b> something, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> in an {{unexpected}} shape. Tom appeared. She changed {{as the door}} opened, and broke into a beaming smile.|$|R
60|$|In such caves as these--so has the obstinate legend run for centuries--there still dwell cave-men, {{the dwindling}} remnant of their race. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that I came across him.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{fit that}} we should {{follow the example of}} the three sisters, and retire also.|$|E
60|$|MACAIRE. O, yes, I remember. I {{heard it}} drop. (Drops key.) <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> before my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "That reminds me! We {{promised to}} do the 'Observer' this week, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Tuesday and I haven't done a thing: have you?" [...] asked Frank.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> I {{found out}} that my Lunar Philosopher was only so in Disguise, {{and that he was}} no Philosopher, but the very Man I have been talking of.|$|R
60|$|A {{small spring}} bubbled {{out of the}} ground beneath a huge logwood tree, giving rise to what would {{probably}} be a large stream by the time it reached the coast, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> proposed to spend the night.|$|R
60|$|With {{this little}} fortune Lady Castlewood was enabled, when her daughter's turn at Court came, {{to come to}} London, where she took a small genteel house at Kensington, in the {{neighborhood}} of the Court, bringing her children with her, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Esmond found his friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} whether this legend has the {{character}} you mean," [...] said Sibyl, [...] "but it has lived {{much more than a}} century; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
60|$|Of course Peter promised. He {{wanted that}} story {{so much that}} he would have promised anything. So Honker told the story, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just as Peter heard it.|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Zapp was {{too well}} started. [...] "If you think Ah'm {{going to stand}} for a lazy sneaking little {{drunkard}} keeping the whole street awake, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> prett' nearly midnight--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had laid}} {{in a stock}} of writing-materials before I went up on the mountain, and I now went to work with great enthusiasm to set down what I knew of the {{expedition}} of Xerxes, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that I made the notes which were afterward so useful to Herodotus.|$|R
5000|$|... "Lon Morris, Billy Morris, {{and other}} famous minstrels {{of the day}} were in the company, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that P.S. Gilmore, the {{well-known}} band-master, began his professional career by playing on the tambourine as an end-man." [...] In 1858, E. Kelly worked as musical director, and James McGee as business manager of the hall.|$|R
60|$|I {{wish you}} could have seen how the wardens and the sidesmen and Mullins, the {{chairman}} of the vestry, smiled and chuckled at the thought of it. Hadn't they said all along that all that was needed was a little faith <b>and</b> effort? <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> just as they said, and they'd been right after all.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{been out}} three hours," [...] said Holmes; [...] "started at half-past six, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> back again. That gives a radius of {{ten or twelve}} miles, and he does it once, or {{sometimes}} twice, a day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It is a {{good thing}} to keep one’s eyes open,” Dimchurch remarked. “Now if I had seen that piece of stone I should not have given it a thought, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to give us a hot dinner!” ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} day after breakfast she did write her letter, though when she sat down to her task she had not clearly {{made up her mind}} what she would say. But she did get it written, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
60|$|The King of the Romans {{took refuge}} within an old mill, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Norman of Torn found him barricaded. When {{the door was}} broken down, the outlaw entered and dragged the monarch forth with his own hand to the feet of De Montfort, and would have put him to death had not the Earl intervened.|$|R
60|$|Now {{they had}} {{leaped into the}} foaming river, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> well that the Lily could swim, else both had been lost. But they won through and passed forward to the mountain's flank. Here they walked on among the trees till the forest was almost passed, and at length Umslopogaas heard the howling of a wolf.|$|R
60|$|Once on shore, the old tar said {{he remembered}} the {{locality}} well, {{and he did not}} hesitate in pushing forward, across the path taken by the three Rover boys, and then to a trail which the Rovers had missed. They had to climb a small hill, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Bahama Bill showed the first signs of perplexity.|$|R
60|$|Once {{clear of}} the never-to-be-forgotten-or-forgiven {{pavement}} which surrounds Paris, {{the first three days}} of travelling towards Marseilles are quiet and monotonous enough. To Sens. To Avallon. To Chalons. A sketch of one day's proceedings is a sketch of all three; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{ought to}} have gone long ago. I told Myra we should have trouble somewhere as soon as I saw what a good-looking {{creature}} she was, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> as bad as can be. Dear, dear! Why can't young people have a little prudence?" ...|$|E
60|$|Young Mr. Dunboyne--here for a holiday--lives {{with his}} father at Fairmount, in Ireland. I have said that to myself fifty times over. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> saying itself for the fifty-first time in my Journal. I must indeed be a simpleton, as Helena says. I had better go to bed again.|$|E
5000|$|Short-eared owls <b>are</b> living <b>and</b> {{foraging}} <b>here.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> endangered (EN) <b>and</b> {{relatively rare}} in Denmark.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> {{necessary}} {{to say a}} few words on the stage and on stage-illusion.|$|R
50|$|On 15 October 1877, Károly Schwarz and Maria Habetler got a daughter, {{which they}} named Gizella. The {{baby was born}} in Körmend, Hungary, where Gizella spent her childhood.

60|$|In a {{small room}} in the {{vicinity}} of the stableyard, betimes in the morning, which was ushered in by Mr. Pickwick's adventure with the middle--aged lady in the yellow curl-papers, sat Mr. Weller, senior, preparing himself for his journey to London. He was sitting in an excellent attitude for having his portrait taken; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
60|$|All being ready, {{the first}} group are handed on. That member of the party who is {{entrusted}} with the passenger-ticket for the whole, has been warned {{by one of the}} agents to have it ready, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in his hand. In every instance through the whole eight hundred, without an exception, this paper is always ready.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} one of the {{standard}} island platform design typical of the London Extension, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the more common [...] "cutting" [...] type reached from a roadway (the Banbury to Daventry road, now classified A361, formerly the B4036), that crossed the line. Just to the south were Charwelton Watertroughs, while to the north is the 2997 yd Catesby Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The Pentagram <b>is</b> written <b>and</b> {{produced}} <b>here.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{a weekly}} newspaper that is {{delivered to the}} joint base and the Pentagon.|$|R
60|$|Here the way being now opened, and {{our success}} {{answering}} our expectation, several bodies of foot {{came in to}} us from Westmoreland and from Cumberland; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that the prince found means to surprise the town of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which was recovered for the king by {{the management of the}} mayor of the town, and some loyal gentlemen of the county, and a garrison placed there again for the king.|$|R
