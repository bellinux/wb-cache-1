5|$|The town {{came into}} being as <b>a</b> <b>spa</b> in the Restoration and had its heyday as a tourist resort under Beau Nash when the Pantiles and its chalybeate spring {{attracted}} visitors who wished to take the waters.

40|$|Purpose: A laparoscopic {{appendectomy}} is now commonly performed. The push {{in recent}} years toward reducing the num-ber of ports required to perform this surgery {{has led to the}} development of a single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (SPA). We compared postoperative pain after <b>an</b> <b>SPA</b> using <b>a</b> glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device (group 1) with that of <b>an</b> <b>SPA</b> using <b>a</b> commercially-available multichannel single-port device (group 2). Methods: Between March 2010 and July 2011, a retrospective study was conducted of a total of 77 patients who underwent <b>an</b> <b>SPA</b> by three surgeons at department of surgery, Kangbuk Samsung Medical Center. Thirty-eight patients received <b>an</b> <b>SPA</b> using <b>a</b> glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device. The other 39 patients received <b>an</b> <b>SPA</b> using <b>a</b> commer-cially-available multichannel single port (Octo-Port or SILS Port). Operative details and postoperative outcomes were col-lected and evaluated. Results: There were no differences in the mean operative times, times to pass gas, postoperative hospital stays, or cosmetic satisfaction scores between the two groups. The pain score in the first 24 hours after surgery was higher in group 2 than group 1 patients (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, the trocar used in group 2 was more expensive than that used in group 1. Conclusion: An <b>SPA</b> using <b>a</b> glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device was associated with a lower pain score during the first 24 hours after surgery because of the shorter fascia incision length and a cheaper cost than <b>an</b> <b>SPA</b> using <b>a</b> commercially-available multichannel single-port device...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> day <b>spa</b> is <b>a</b> {{business}} {{that provides a}} variety of services {{for the purpose of}} improving health, beauty and relaxation through personal care treatments such as hair, massages and facials. <b>A</b> day <b>spa</b> is different from a beauty salon in that it contains facilities such as a sauna, pool, steam room, or whirlpool that guests may use in addition to their treatment. <b>A</b> day <b>spa</b> is different from <b>a</b> destination <b>spa</b> as no overnight accommodation is provided. [...] In contrast, <b>a</b> destination <b>spa</b> offers similar services integrated into packages which include diet, exercise programs, instruction on wellness, life coaching, yoga, Tai Chi and accommodations where participants reside for the duration of their stay. A resort-spa may also function as <b>a</b> day <b>spa,</b> if they allow access to patrons who are not guests of the hotel.|$|R

5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild it {{on a smaller}} scale in 1500. The new church was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as <b>a</b> <b>spa.</b> The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{education}} {{is provided by}} thirteen primary schools in the town and its suburbs including eight Church of England, one Roman Catholic, and four non-denominational state schools. With the exception of The Grove (1962), Poolbrook Primary School (1977), and Northleigh (1991) that replaced the Cowleigh C of E school destroyed by arson in 1989, all the Malvern primary schools were established between 1836 and 1916, during and shortly after the town's rapid development as <b>a</b> <b>spa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as <b>a</b> <b>spa</b> {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, when Jacques van Marken was in France at <b>a</b> <b>spa,</b> Agneta Matthes found {{a letter}} from Maria Eringaard {{requesting}} the child support that he owed for their children, which led to Matthes discovering {{that her husband had}} begun a relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15, and that he had four children by her. Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly. She did not tell van Markem that she knew about the affair until 1889, when Eringaard died of tuberculosis, as had two of her children.|$|E

5|$|Bath Abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and became a {{religious}} centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties {{of water from the}} springs, and Bath became popular as <b>a</b> <b>spa</b> town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II.|$|E

5|$|In the Georgian period Bath {{had grown}} in {{popularity}} as <b>a</b> <b>spa</b> town. The opening of Pulteney Bridge enabled {{the development of}} Bathwick and land {{to the east of}} the River Avon. The pools were built next to the river on the site of old marl pits. The developers went bankrupt ten years after opening the pools but they were sold had operated privately until they were taken over by the local corporation in the 1890s. They then operated as a public swimming baths until the 1970s. The pool closed in 1984 and was used for a short time as a trout farm before closure and falling into disrepair.

5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Glowery, {{a bitter}} New York City {{journalist}} and writer {{who believes that}} a rival author is sabotaging his literary career, arrives in Tyburn where he is to speak at a fiction workshop being held at the Admiral Benbow Inn. He is immediately tasered by one of Castro's detectives, who mistakenly confuses him for Picasso. Back at the Admiral Benbow Inn, the innkeeper, George Hawthorne, worries about Mr. Briscoe, a cross-dressing contract worker who is stranded in the abandoned lighthouse just off the coast because of the raging nor'easter, while his unhappy wife, Magdalene Hawthorne, threatens to leave him. The next morning, Mr. Glowery is stuck in a restaurant where he is being coerced by a psychotic cook to peddle his novel {{in order to pay}} off a debt he incurred during the night. When Professor Eggman, the director of the fiction workshop, comes across Mr. Glowery, he rescues him and brings him back to the inn. However, few people show up for the fiction workshop because of the storm. Hawthorne's wife returns from <b>a</b> <b>spa</b> with Picasso; Mr. Hawthorne informs her that he is trying to procure a prostitute for his new arrival, Jesus Castro, who has registered under the false name of Mr. Wassermann.
