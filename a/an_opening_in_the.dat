5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} by creating <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body using a sharp object {{through the area}} to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually a hollow medical needle) or scalpel or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve arises {{as a number}} of small rootlets {{from the front of the}} medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> occipital bone of the skull.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (<b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (<b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, there is <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal heart {{known as the}} foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in {{the surface of the}} right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E

She started a solo career under the name Doro, {{in order to avoid}} legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, James Baker {{died at the}} age of 41, leaving <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> GCC. On this {{occasion}} Watts Morgan was permitted to advance as a Labour candidate and was returned unopposed. By 1903 he was being talked of as a possible candidate for a south Wales parliamentary constituency. He joined the South Wales Miners' Federation at its inception and by 1902 he was pushing for a greater political role for the organisation. By 1908 the Federation was making great headway in the Rhondda and was substantially improving conditions for the miners. At this time Watts Morgan was Agent and District Secretary at No.1 Rhondda District under William Abraham.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (<b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bone) is located relatively high {{and before the}} p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel {{along the length of}} the tooth.|$|E

However, Kevin's mother, hurt by Gates, runs the car into a ditch, dying as a result. Scully tells Kevin she'll protect him. They bring him to a hotel where Scully notices an additional wound on Kevin's side. Scully becomes upset at Mulder for his unwillingness to accept {{the possibility of a}} miracle.

5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of}} the front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E
5|$|The false potto {{generally}} {{resembles a}} small potto, {{but according to}} Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail, shorter spines on its neck and chest vertebrae, a smaller, less complex spine on the second neck vertebra, an entepicondylar foramen (<b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> humerus, or upper arm bone), a lacrimal fossa (a depression in the skull) that is located inside the eye socket, a smaller upper third premolar and molar, and higher-crowned cheekteeth, among other traits. However, many of these traits are variable among pottos; for example, one researcher found entepicondylar foramina in {{almost half of the}} specimens in his sample of pottos.|$|E
5|$|The pilot lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing.

5|$|In {{the belief}} {{that it would be}} {{operated}} by smokeless locomotives, the line had been built with little ventilation and a long tunnel between Edgware Road and King's Cross. Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers and the ventilation was later improved by making <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel between Gower Street and King's Cross and removing glazing in the station roofs. With the problem continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values. This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report, which reported that a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the line was electrified before these were built.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1902 (the {{day of his}} death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to {{the monastery}} at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the {{philosophy}} of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (<b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy {{that he would not}} live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre {{on the bank of the}} Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
