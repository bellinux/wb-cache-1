25|$|Charles {{had been}} {{preparing}} for this confrontation since the Battle of Toulouse a decade earlier. Gibbon believes, as do most historians, that Charles had made the best of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation.</b> Though allegedly outnumbered and without any heavy cavalry, Charles had tough, battle-hardened infantrymen who believed in him implicitly. Moreover, as Davis points out, these infantrymen were heavily armed, each man carrying up to perhaps 75 pounds (34kg) of armour into battle.|$|E
25|$|Between the French and the Austrians, Bavaria {{was now in}} <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation.</b> Even {{before the}} death of Charles Theodore on 16 February 1799 the Austrians had again {{occupied}} the country, in preparation for renewing the war with France. Maximilian IV Joseph (of Zweibrücken) the new elector succeeded to a difficult inheritance. Though both he and his all-powerful minister, Maximilian von Montgelas sympathized more with France than Austria, {{the state of the}} Bavarian finances {{and the fact that the}} Bavarian troops were scattered and disorganized placed him helpless in the hands of Austria. On 2 December 1800, the Bavarian armies were involved in the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, and Moreau once more occupied Munich. By the Treaty of Lunéville (9 February 1801) Bavaria lost the Palatinate and the duchies of Zweibrücken and Jülich.|$|E
25|$|Only 27 intrepid French {{settlers}} {{were able}} to make the final leg of the trip from the farm designated as a resting place to their new Texan utopia, a site located in today's Denton County in Texas (northwest of Dallas). The small group arrived June 2, 1848, and immediately began a frenzied effort to construct dwellings in order to stake their land claims, attempting {{at the same time to}} plow and farm the prairie. Virtually no time remained to meet the terms of the land concession. The hot summer sun began to bake the ground. Poorly fed, poorly housed, overworked and exhausted, the Icarian colonists next fell victim to an outbreaks of cholera and malaria, illnesses which killed four and sickened the rest. Making <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation</b> still worse, the one medical doctor in the company broke down into a state of insanity and deserted his fellows.|$|E

25|$|According to {{accounts}} of the following event reported by Glenn Boyer in I Married Wyatt Earp, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys—accompanied by another two dozen men—rode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through the front door, and before he could react, {{a large number of}} cowboys were pointing their guns at him. In another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards {{in the back of the}} room and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation.</b> No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends.|$|E
25|$|On 30 December 1777, the Bavarian {{line of the}} Wittelsbachs became extinct, and the {{succession}} on the Electorate of Bavaria passed to Charles Theodore, the Elector Palatine. After a separation of {{four and a half}} centuries, the Palatinate, to which the duchies of Jülich and Berg had been added, was thus reunited with Bavaria. In 1792 French revolutionary armies overran the Palatinate; in 1795 the French, under Moreau, invaded Bavaria itself, advanced to Munich—where they were received with joy by the long-suppressed Liberals—and laid siege to Ingolstadt. Charles Theodore, who had done nothing to prevent wars or to resist the invasion, fled to Saxony, leaving a regency, the members of which signed a convention with Moreau, by which he granted an armistice in return for a heavy contribution (7 September 1796). Between the French and the Austrians, Bavaria was now in <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation.</b> Before the death of Charles Theodore (16 February 1799) the Austrians had again occupied the country, in preparation for renewing the war with France.|$|E
25|$|The transit {{strike was}} the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 in an attempt to decentralize the city's school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city {{complete}} control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities to have more of a say in their schools. The city's teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, however, saw the breakup as a way of union busting, as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result, in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, one of the neighborhoods where the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community-run school board. The UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, citing that the teachers had been fired without due process. When their demands were ignored, the UFT called the first of three strikes, leading ultimately to a protracted citywide teachers' strike that stretched over a seven-month period between May and November. The strike was tinged with racial and anti-Semitic overtones, pitting black and Puerto Rican parents against Jewish teachers and supervisors. Many thought the mayor had made <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation</b> worse by taking sides against the teachers. The episode left a legacy of tensions between blacks and Jews that went on for years, and Lindsay called it his greatest regret.|$|E

2500|$|The {{human rights}} record of Transnistria has been criticised by several governments and {{international}} organisations.

500|$|During the 2010 debates, Sylvia Lim, {{then the}} sole NCMP in Parliament, commented that having NCMPs [...] "make <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation</b> better, but {{increasing}} NCMPs {{is not the}} solution towards a more robust political system". She identified an NCMP's lack of any official capacity to represent the people or write letters on their behalf as a drawback of the scheme. Moreover, an NCMP has no physical base to organize activities or dialogues with the people. In her view, {{it would be better}} for politics in Singapore if the NCMP scheme was regarded merely as a [...] "stop-gap measure" [...] to deal with the lack of alternative voices in Parliament as a result of the ruling party's alleged abuse of the GRC system and gerrymandering.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{operations}} orders {{called for}} the task groups to refuel on this date. Given the torpedoing of Houston and Canberra, however, only TGs38.2 and 38.3 departed for refueling. TG38.4 was reassigned strikes on Luzon to keep attacking planes at bay while TG38.1 continued to function as escort for the group of damaged ships now nicknamed [...] "Crippled Division1". Faced with the decision to either scuttle or protect the damaged cruisers, advisers to Admiral William Halsey Jr., {{the commander of the}} U.S. 3rd Fleet, convinced him to turn <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation</b> into an opportunity. Unofficially dubbed [...] "Bait Division", the slow-moving ships and their escorts were used as a lure to draw out the Japanese fleet. Urgent radio transmissions were broadcast on open channels in the hopes of enemy interception. It appeared based on sighting reports that the plan might work: in the morning and evening, cruiser and battleship forces were reported heading south from Japan and southeast from Formosa.|$|E
500|$|During the Brezhnev era, {{there were}} {{material}} improvements for the Soviet citizen, but the Politburo was given no credit for this; the material {{improvements in the}} 1970s, i.e. the cheap provision of [...] consumer goods, food, shelter, clothing, sanitation, health care and transport, were taken for granted by the common Soviet citizen. The common citizen associated Brezhnev's rule more with its limitation than its actual progress: as a result, Brezhnev earned neither affection nor respect. Most Soviet citizens had no power to change the existing system, so most of them {{tried to make the}} best of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation.</b> Rates of alcoholism, mental illness, divorce and suicide rose inexorably during the Brezhnev era. Among ethnic Russians, the divorce rate by the late 70s was alarmingly high and 1 in 4 adults lived alone. Women lived particularly difficult lives as they performed most shopping, which could be an arduous task waiting in line for hours. Birthrates by 1982 were nearly flatline, with Muslims in the Central Asian republics being the only group in the nation with above-replacement fertility.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the running}} {{narrative}} themes for the main series is Immorality, which also became the key character theme and was expressed through their personalities and actions. The second game also focused on themes of war and death. The theme for the world of Drakengard 3, as described by composer Keiichi Okabe, is [...] "the sense of contrast". Multiple anime series have influenced the series' characters over the years, including Neon Genesis Evangelion, Sister Princess and Puella Magi Madoka Magica. The series writer, Sawako Natori, drew inspiration for her writing from shōnen manga. The original game world was designed around Celtic and Norse myths, together with Japanese-style revisionism. The team for the original game were influenced by Asian epic movies and western action-adventure films such as the 1999 remake of The Mummy and Dragonheart. While developing Nier, the team drew inspiration from the God of War series, while the narrative structure {{was inspired by the}} September 11 attacks and the War on Terror. The central theme of Nier: Automata is struggling out of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation,</b> defined by the game's staff using the Japanese word [...] "agaku".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{an often}} laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is {{described}} in the novel Liberty's Crusade as a decent and honorable man that is well liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is always {{willing to do the}} right thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series' main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy's eyes makes Raynor a [...] "true hero in the purest sense of the word". He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation.</b> Raynor himself acknowledges that he is not the most intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{music for}} Eternal Punishment was composed by Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya and Masaki Kurokawa, the composers for Innocent Sin. As with Innocent Sin, Tsuchiya found {{the writing process}} difficult {{for a number of}} reasons. Tsuchiya's favorite piece for the score, which was carried over from Innocent Sin, was [...] "Maya's Theme". The tune has remained popular with the Persona fan base: Tsuchiya has attributed its popularity to the enduring nature of the Persona series as a whole, and compared it to a fashionable item of the time that now requires a [...] "certain courage" [...] to wear in later times. The game's theme song, [...] "Change your Way", was written and sung by British singer-songwriter Elisha La'Verne, and the music was composed by T.Kura. La'Verne wrote the song with the premise of Eternal Punishment in mind, and so she wanted the song to sound positive. For inspiration, she drew on her experiences of walking round London and seeing homeless people who appeared unable to improve their status: the song's theme is that there is always a way out of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation</b> and you can change that situation for the better. The title also stemmed from this concept. Together with Innocent Sin, Eternal Punishment is the one of the first entries in the Megami Tensei series to feature voice acting.|$|E
50|$|The first {{trolleybus}} line in BASSR was {{put into}} operation in Sterlitamak in 1961. The main reason for this decision was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> environmental <b>situation</b> in the 1980s.

500|$|The BX {{arrived in}} South Fort George on June 24, to {{a warm welcome}} from the local populace. The steamer landing on the Fraser had been there since 1909 and was already used by the Charlotte, Chilco and Quesnel. Nevertheless, local {{residents}} had been anticipating {{the day of the}} BX's arrival to see where the company would choose to have its landing and where it would build its office and warehouse. Many local business decisions were going to be based on this, as it was widely and correctly assumed that the BX would be bringing up the bulk of the passengers and landseekers from the south. One businessman, hotelier Al Johnson, was waiting for this information so he would know where to build Fort George's first licensed hotel, the Hotel Northern. [...] The promoters of South Fort George were well aware of the huge benefit it would be to have the landing at their town-site, so the day after the BX arrived they offered the BC Express Company free lots of their choice in South Fort George. The company accepted the offer and construction on the facilities was begun. This would be a huge disappointment to South Fort George's rival town-site, Central Fort George on the Nechako River, which had hoped for the BC Express's landing and offices for itself. George Hammond, the promoter for Central, made the best he could out of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation</b> and hired a representative for the Central town-site and had him travel on the BX and promote Central to the passengers before they arrived in South Fort George.|$|E

Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>situation.</b> Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.|$|E
