His studies of peripheral neuritis were published in Volume XXXVI of Gilbert and Carnot's [...] "Nouveau traité de médeine et de thérapeutique". With Leo Testut (1849-1925), he was co-author of [...] "Les nerfs en schémas, anatomie et physiopathologie" [...] (1925).|$|E
50|$|Maintaining {{his support}} for the {{corporations}} as a mean to organise the working class, Alexandru Ionescu succeeded in being elected vice-president of the Bucharest Graphical Arts Corporation in 1902. His attempts to introduce into the corporation's charter some guarantees for workers' welfare, such as minimum wage or fixed working time, failed, as they met the resistance of the employers. In March 1903 Ionescu was also elected in the Trade Chamber of the Bucharest Chamber of Commerce and Industry, however his election was invalidated on the intervention of the agriculture minister, who feared Ionescu would be able to introduce socialist ideas on the agenda of the organisation. In July 1903 Ionescu suffered a temporal lobe abscess, and, although he quickly underwent surgery, he was left with <b>amnesic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> forcing him out of all public positions. Only {{in the second half of}} 1904 he was able to retake his position in the corporation, also starting to work in the typography he owned. He maintained his post in the leadership of the corporation until the end of the decade, at times supporting positions that came into clear contradiction with the socialist ideas he had championed around the turn of the century. Resigning from the corporation in April 1909, Ionescu expressed in a România Muncitoare article his disenchantment with this employer-controlled form of workers' organisation, and recognised that trade unions were better fitted to represent the interests of the proletarians. However, he did not join the socialist movement.|$|E
40|$|Five {{patients}} with predominantly dominant cerebral hemisphere lesions due to {{herpes simplex encephalitis}} are described. Verbal amnesia was the main deficit but <b>amnesic</b> <b>aphasia</b> sometimes associated with impairment of remote memory also occurred. Semantic and episodic memory deficits were also explored in one case {{and the role of}} the right cerebral hemisphere in facilitating recovery of learning is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Relato de caso de doença de Parry-Romberg, com hemi-hipotrofia esquerda de predomínio facial, epilepsia, afasia amnéstica, rebaixamento intelectual, hemiparesia e hemianestesia direitas e sindrome cerebelar. É enfatizada a raridade da atrofia cerebelar (apenas um caso na {{bibliografia}} consultada) e a correlação entre as anormalidades clínicas e a tomografia axial computadorizada de crânio. The authors {{report a}} case of Parry-Romberg disease with predominantly facial left atrophy, seizures, <b>amnesic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> mental retardation, right hemiplegia and hemianesthesia, and cerebellar syndrome. The rarity of cerebellar atrophy (only one case thus far {{reported in the literature}} surveyed) is emphasized, as well as the correlation between the clinical abnormalities and the computerized axial tomography of the skull...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} {{a case of}} a 74 -year-old, right-handed woman who had progressive aphasia for more than 2 years. Her intelligence and memory function were preserved. As for verbal symptom, her spontaneous speech was fluent, and repetitions and verbal comprehension were intact. She made phonemic errors in spontaneous speech, naming and writing, but she was almost able to correct them by conduite d 2 ̆ 7 approche. She also she had acalculia and slightly executive dysfunction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed left, dominantly fronto-temporo-parietal atrophy, and in Tc- 99 m ECD single photon emission computed tomography, the uptake in the left ventral parietal lobe was reduced. We then thought that this was a case of slowly progressive aphasia proposed by Mesulam. The aphasic patterns of fluent progressive aphasia were often {{reported a}}s <b>amnesic</b> <b>aphasia</b> and transcortical aphasia including word meaning (Gogi) aphasia, but this case was different from them, and thus rare. There are some cases that are first diagnosed as being slowly progressive aphasia, and later by their symptoms or by autopsy they are revealed to be Pick 2 ̆ 7 s disease, Alzheimer disease or corticobasal degeneration. This patient has acalculia and slight excusive dysfunction, so she might also have symptoms of Pick 2 ̆ 7 s disease or Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease...|$|E
