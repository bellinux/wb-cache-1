5|$|<b>Athetosis</b> – <b>Athetosis</b> is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g. cerebral palsy, choreoathetosis).|$|E
25|$|Chorea {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia. Similar to <b>athetosis,</b> it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity {{at the level of}} the striatum. Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, it comes as no surprise that chorea and <b>athetosis</b> can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis.|$|E
25|$|Most {{instances}} {{of drug use}} where the symptoms seem to be lessened tend to be in more mild cases of <b>athetosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Athetosis</b> {{can vary}} from mild to severe motor dysfunction; it is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements of muscle and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture. The associated motor dysfunction can be restricted to a part of body or present throughout the body, depending on {{the individual and the}} severity of the symptom. One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular, as the writhing, convoluted movement of the digits. <b>Athetosis</b> can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding, hypotonia, spasm, and involuntary writhing movements of the hands, feet, and face, which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress. <b>Athetosis</b> is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus and the motor thalamus, as well as the corpus striatum; therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from cognitive deficits such as speech impairment, hearing loss, and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the basal ganglia system was first associated with motor functions, as lesions of these areas would often result in disordered movement in humans (chorea, <b>athetosis,</b> Parkinson's disease).|$|E
25|$|Two {{trials of}} {{primidone}} for <b>athetosis</b> have been published. In one, small doses of primidone successfully treated eighteen out of thirty-one children. In a subsequent pilot trial {{in which children}} who experienced improvement were switched to placebo, the results were much more disappointing, with the two subjects who experienced subjective improvement also experiencing this on placebo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Athetosis</b> is {{a symptom}} {{primarily}} caused by the marbling, or degeneration of the basal ganglia. This degeneration is most commonly caused by complications at birth or by Huntington's disease, in addition to rare {{cases in which the}} damage may also arise later in life due to stroke or trauma. The two complications of particular interest are intranatal asphyxia and neonatal jaundice.|$|E
25|$|Primidone {{has been}} used in {{cerebral}} palsy. In 1953, Plum and Sparup found that out of thirty-three patients, twenty had a favorable or moderate response. Thorn reported in 1962 that sixteen patients responded favorably to both primidone and chlordiazepoxide and four to only primidone. Nine patients responded only to chlordiazepoxide and four responded to neither drug. The best results were obtained in <b>athetosis</b> and rigidity.|$|E
25|$|Speech and {{language}} disorders {{are common in}} people with cerebral palsy. The incidence of dysarthria is estimated to range from 31% to 88%, and around a quarter of people with CP are non-verbal. Speech problems are associated with poor respiratory control, laryngeal and velopharyngeal dysfunction, and oral articulation disorders that are due to restricted movement in the oral-facial muscles. There are three major types of dysarthria in cerebral palsy: spastic, dyskinetic (<b>athetosis),</b> and ataxic.|$|E
25|$|Deficiency of {{magnesium}} can cause tiredness, generalized weakness, muscle cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, increased irritability {{of the nervous}} system with tremors, paresthesias, palpitations, hypokalemia, hypoparathyroidism which might result in hypocalcemia, chondrocalcinosis, spasticity and tetany, epileptic seizures, basal ganglia calcifications and in extreme and prolonged cases coma, intellectual disability or death. Other symptoms that have been suggested to be associated with hypomagnesemia are <b>athetosis,</b> jerking, nystagmus, and an extensor plantar reflex, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, depression, hypertension and fast heart rate.|$|E
25|$|In children, primary {{dystonia}} {{is usually}} inherited genetically. Secondary dystonia, however, is most commonly caused by dyskinetic cerebral palsy, due to hypoxic or ischemic {{injury to the}} basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus during the prenatal or infantile stages of development. Chorea and ballism {{can be caused by}} damage to the subthalamic nucleus. Chorea can be secondary to hyperthyroidism. <b>Athetosis</b> can be secondary to sensory loss in the distal limbs; this is called pseudoathetosis in adults but is not yet proven in children.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Vogt-Mugnier rediscovered the {{so-called}} ‘status marmoratus’ of the corpus striatum, characterized by slow, writhing, purposeless movements mainly affecting {{the hands and}} face. This syndrome had already been described by Gabriel Anton in 1896, however his paper attracted little attention whereas Vogt-Mugnier's report {{brought it to the}} forefront of research in basal ganglia pathology. Vogt-Mugnier continued to lead the pioneering work on the neuroanatomy of the thalamus and together with Hermann Oppenheim published their findings on hereditary palsy and double <b>athetosis,</b> in which she noted the mottled appearance of the striatum.|$|E
25|$|Asphyxia {{directly}} causes {{basal ganglia}} damage {{due to lack}} of oxygen and therefore, insufficient nutrient supply. The lesions caused by asphyxia are most prominent on the caudate nucleus and the putamen. However, a less-studied consequence of the resulting hypoxia is its effect on the concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the synapses of neurons in the basal ganglia. Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with <b>athetosis</b> deal with the over-activity of synapses within the basal ganglia.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} done with {{electromyography}} to trace skeletal muscle activity in some hyperkinetic disorders. The electromyogram (EMG) of dystonia sometimes shows rapid rhythmic bursts, but these patterns can almost always be produced intentionally. In the myoclonus EMG, there are typically brief, and sometimes rhythmic, bursts or pauses in the recording pattern. When the bursts last for 50 milliseconds or less they are indicative of cortical myoclonus, but when they last up to 200 milliseconds, they are indicative of spinal or brainstem myoclonus. Such bursts can occur in multiple muscles simultaneously quite quickly, but high time resolution must {{be used in the}} EMG trace to clearly record them. The bursts recorded for tremor tend to be longer in duration than those of myoclonus, although some types can last for durations within the range for those of myoclonus. Future studies would have to examine the EMGs for tics, <b>athetosis,</b> stereotypies and chorea as there are minimal recordings done for those movements. However, it may be predicted that the EMG for chorea would include bursts varying in duration, timing, and amplitude, while that for tics and stereotypies would take on patterns of voluntary movements.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during the toddler years. Children start walking at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet that look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (<b>athetosis),</b> adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E
500|$|Given {{the wide}} variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have, there are several {{categories}} in which the athletes compete. [...] The allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types. [...] The categories are impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, [...] limb deficiency, [...] leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, [...] ataxia, <b>athetosis,</b> vision impairment and [...] intellectual impairment. These categories are further broken down into classifications, which vary from sport to sport.|$|E
500|$|The Paralympic Games {{is a major}} {{international}} multi-sport event involving athletes {{with a range of}} disabilities, including impaired muscle power (e.g. paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, [...] limb deficiency (e.g. amputation or dysmelia), [...] leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, [...] ataxia, <b>athetosis,</b> vision impairment and [...] intellectual impairment. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Athetosis</b> is a {{commonly}} occurring symptom in the disease cerebral palsy. [...] Of all {{people with the}} disease, between 16% and 25% of them actually exhibit the symptom of <b>athetosis.</b> [...] A component {{of this is the}} finding that most often the symptoms that involve <b>athetosis</b> occur as a part of choreoathetosis as opposed to <b>athetosis</b> alone.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoathetosis is a {{movement}} disorder, very similar to <b>athetosis,</b> in which the symptoms are not differentiable from those of actual <b>athetosis,</b> however the underlying cause is different. [...] While actual <b>athetosis</b> is caused by damage to the brain, specifically in the basal ganglia, pseudoathetosis {{is caused by the}} loss of proprioception. [...] The loss in proprioception is caused by damage to the area between the primary somatosensory cortex and the muscle spindles and joint receptors. [...] Additionally, when observing an MRI, {{it can be seen that}} in the brain of a pseudoathetoid patient, lesions on the brain are not seen in the basal ganglia, the area that is oftentimes the cause of <b>athetosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Athetosis</b> is {{a symptom}} {{characterized}} by slow, involuntary, convoluted, writhing movements of the fingers, hands, toes, and feet and in some cases, arms, legs, neck and tongue. Movements typical of <b>athetosis</b> are sometimes called athetoid movements. Lesions to the brain are most often the direct cause of the symptoms, particularly to the ...|$|E
2500|$|Treatment by {{surgical}} intervention can {{obviously have}} the most immediate impact, again however, {{it is not a}} cure-all. [...] In patients that have cerebral palsy as the cause of their <b>athetosis,</b> it has been demonstrated that a subthalamotomy tends to help relieve the extent of <b>athetosis</b> in approximately half of patients. [...] Additionally, late 19th and early 20th century surgical accounts state that <b>athetosis</b> can be relieved by the removal of a part of the cerebral motor cortex or by cutting a part of the posterior spinal roots. [...] Patients who undergo surgical treatment to relieve the <b>athetosis</b> often see significant improvement in the control of their limbs and digits. [...] While surgery is often very beneficial in the short term and can produce near immediate results, in the long term it has been seen that its effects are not incredibly long lasting.|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{noteworthy}} {{that the presence}} of <b>athetosis</b> in cerebral palsy (as well as other conditions) causes a significant increase in a person’s basal resting metabolic rate. [...] It has been observed that those who have cerebral palsy with <b>athetosis</b> require approximately 500 more Calories per day than their non-cerebral palsy non-athetoid counterpart.|$|E

2500|$|As <b>athetosis</b> is {{relatively}} difficult to treat, efforts {{are being made}} to help those with the condition live and perform tasks more effectively and more efficiently. [...] One such example of work that has been recently undertaken is a project to help those affected with <b>athetosis</b> to use a computer with more ease. [...] Software for {{the control of the}} computer uses joysticks that perform linear filtering to aid in control.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} treatment approaches {{to dealing with}} <b>athetosis.</b> [...] The most common methods are the use of drugs, surgical intervention, and retraining movements of the afflicted person. [...] It is suggested that training a person to relearn movements {{can be helpful in}} select situations. [...] Though, generally, this type of treatment will not work, in certain cases it can be found to be very helpful in treating the symptom of <b>athetosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Athetosis</b> {{is defined}} as a slow, continuous, {{involuntary}} writhing movement that prevents the individual from maintaining a stable posture. These are smooth, nonrhythmic movements that appear random and are not composed of any recognizable sub-movements. They mainly involve the distal extremities, but can also involve the face, neck, and trunk. <b>Athetosis</b> can occur in the resting state, as well as in conjunction with chorea and dystonia. When combined with chorea, as in cerebral palsy, the term [...] "choreoathetosis" [...] is frequently used.|$|E
2500|$|The first noted case of <b>athetosis</b> was {{discovered}} by W. A. Hammond and described in his book Diseases of the Nervous System in 1871. [...] Hammond was also the person who created the term [...] "athetosis", Greek for [...] "without fixed position". [...] In his initial description of <b>athetosis,</b> {{the extent of the}} uncontrolled movement was limited to the fingers and toes. [...] In association with this, he noted that the patients' calves and forearms were oftentimes flexed and that movements were generally slow. [...] Over the period of time leading into the late 20th century, the definition of <b>athetosis</b> was expanded to include movements of the neck, tongue, face, and even the trunk. [...] Along with the expansion of the symptoms came the recognition that it was a part of many medical conditions, including cerebral palsy and stroke.|$|E
2500|$|Hammond's disease, {{a form of}} <b>athetosis,</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Hammond (in the Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous System) and now bears his name. He also coined the word [...] "athetosis".|$|E
2500|$|Drugs {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of <b>athetosis,</b> however their collective effectiveness is not very convincing. [...] There is not a single drug that is a standard among treatment. [...] Many different medicines can be used, including: ...|$|E
2500|$|... corpus striatum. [...] This symptom {{does not}} occur alone and is often {{accompanied}} by the symptoms of cerebral palsy, as it is often {{a result of this}} disease. [...] Treatments for <b>athetosis</b> are not very effective, and in most cases are simply aimed at the uncontrollable movement, rather than the cause itself.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Athetosis</b> is {{characterized}} as a symptom that is present in many forms of {{central nervous system disorders}} that affect the body movement coordination, such as cerebral palsy. [...] Children may struggle to engage in social communication, since the poor coordination of the tongue and mouth muscles can reduce their speech ability and hinder their social interaction to a greater degree. The caregivers of the affected children are encouraged to closely monitor their nutrition and growth and to provide them with hearing aids in order to relieve their symptoms as well as support their academic plans. A growing number of patients is shown to benefit from communication devices such as shorthand typing programs and computer speech devices, as well as simple picture boards.|$|E
2500|$|A {{multitude}} of movement disorders {{have been observed}} after either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. [...] Some examples include <b>athetosis,</b> chorea with or without hemiballismus, tremor, dystonia, and segmental or focal myoclonus, although the prevalence of these manifestations after stroke is quite low. [...] The {{amount of time that}} passes between stroke event and presentation of hyperkinesia depends on the type of hyperkinetic movement since their pathologies slightly differ. [...] Chorea tends to affect older stroke victims while dystonia tends to affect younger ones. [...] Men and women have an equal chance of developing the hyperkinetic movements after stroke. [...] Strokes causing small, deep lesions in the basal ganglia, brain stem and thalamus are those most likely to be associated with post-stroke hyperkinesia.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study was}} done where {{the onset of}} athetoid {{movement}} followed a thalamic stroke. The thalamus {{is part of a}} pathway that is involved with the cortical feedback loop in which signals from the cortex are relayed through the striatum, pallidus and thalamus before making it back to the cortex. The striatum receives excitatory inputs from the cortex and inhibits the pallidum. By doing so it frees the thalamus from pallidal inhibition allowing the thalamus to send excitatory outputs to the cortex. Therefore, the lesions to the thalamus or any other part of this feedback loop can result in movement disorders as they can alter the reactivity of one towards the other. [...] Also, in a case of people with thalamic stroke, a majority suffered severe sensory deficits and ataxia. It is proposed that this loss of proprioception and the ensuing loss of synergic stabilization may also lead to abnormal movements, such as those dealt with in <b>athetosis.</b>|$|E
