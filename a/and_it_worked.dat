5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{first school}} in the city, a Greek {{language}} school, was erected in the city in 1663. It was sponsored by local merchants and functioned {{under the supervision of}} the local bishop. In 1821, when the Greek War of Independence broke out, it was destroyed, but it was reopened in 1830. In 1727 a madrasa started to function in the city, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> uninterruptedly for 240 years until 1967, when it was closed due to the Cultural Revolution applied in communist Albania. In 1861–1862 a Greek language school for girls was founded, financially supported by the local Greek benefactor Christakis Zografos. The first Albanian school in Gjirokastër was opened in 1886. Today Gjirokastër has seven grammar schools, two general high schools (of which one is the Gjirokastër Gymnasium), and two professional ones.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe was paralysed in {{the second}} half of December. The weather, {{recorded}} as −42°C (–44°F), was a meteorological record. Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the Luftwaffe had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the Red Air Force, operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger. On 4 January, the skies cleared. The Luftwaffe was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would save the situation. The Kampfgruppen (Bomber Groups) II./KG 4 and II./KG 30 arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four Transportgruppen (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 Junkers Ju 52 transports were deployed from Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked.</b> The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the Luftwaffe had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Center. Between 17 and 22 December the Luftwaffe destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.|$|E

25|$|Amphorae, or amphoras, {{were used}} during Roman times to {{transport}} food on {{long and short}} distances. The content was generally liquid, olive oil or wine in most cases, but also , the popular fish sauce, and fruit sauce. As a container, an amphora {{was supposed to be}} strong, not too heavy, shaped in a way suitable for easy storage in the ship, and, at the same time, convenient for handling once arrived to its final destination. Usually, amphorae are two-handled terracotta containers with a globular/cylindrical body, a rim of various shapes, and a spiked or, less commonly, flat base.

500|$|The Doors had {{achieved}} commercial and critical success by 1969, but {{for much of}} that year, they were blacklisted from radio playlists and their concert bookings dwindled, after singer Jim Morrison {{had been charged with}} profanity and indecent exposure stemming from a concert in Miami, Florida, on March 1. Promoters feared another episode like this. Morrison, who craved recognition as a serious poet and had also begun dabbling in film, had mentioned leaving the group at the end of 1968, only to be convinced by keyboardist Ray Manzarek to stay on another six months. On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted for the Miami incident. In a 1971 interview with Ben Fong-Torres, Morrison said of Miami, [...] "I think subconsciously I was trying to get across in that concert, I was trying to reduce it to absurdity. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> too well." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} before the 15 January 1987 {{deadline}} set by Island Records to complete the record, the band and the crew completed mixing. As they worked at Melbeach, Lillywhite's wife, singer Kirsty MacColl, volunteered to set the running order for the album. The band told her to put [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] first and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] last, with the rest sequenced according to her preference. Bono said of MacColl's contribution, [...] "Your hope for your album is that it will always be greater {{than the sum of its}} parts. It wasn't happening for The Joshua Tree and she came in and she organized it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> as an old-fashioned album: a beginning, middle and end." [...] Around 2 AM, just seven hours before the album was due to Island for mastering, the Edge tried to convince Lillywhite to allow him to add backing vocals to [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", but he was refused. In the morning, Meegan and Lillywhite flew with the album's tapes to Island's offices in Hammersmith, London.|$|E
500|$|The game's plot, as {{described}} by Dave Grossman: [...] "It's a story about this young man who comes to an island {{in search of his}} life's dream. He's pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You’re laughing, but there's actually something deeper going on as well." [...] When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer's and Grossman's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman's was [...] "very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor" [...] and Schafer's was [...] "just a little more in your face". In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer [...] "were all funny in slightly different ways, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> well together". Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line [...] "I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.|$|E
500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011. He was later {{selected}} by the Halifax Rainmen as the 13th overall pick {{in the second round of}} the 2011 NBL Canada draft. He made his professional debut with the Rainmen on November 3, 2011, scoring 6 points and recording 4 rebounds in a loss to the London Lightning. Through the next seven games, he saw very limited playing time, spending over 10 minutes on the court in just three contests. After averaging three points per game, Oppong was released by Halifax in early December 2011. Nevertheless, he still drew the attention of Gary Durrant, the director of basketball operations for the Oshawa Power, who pursued Oppong in the draft combine itself. Oppong said, [...] "Gary actually called my agent and said they wanted me to come back to take another look at me. They liked me <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> out." [...] He was pleased at the idea of joining the Power because of it was located very close to his hometown as well. Oppong made his first appearance for Oshawa on January 12, 2012, but was scoreless with 3 personal fouls vs the Summerside Storm. He scored a season-best 10 points on January 29, lifting his team to a victory over the Moncton Miracles.|$|E

We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic.
