5|$|An angular {{unconformity}} truncates progressively older (lower) {{parts of the}} underlying Pahrump Group starting {{in the southern part}} of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (<b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> exposed) than the rest of the formation.|$|E

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick. In such a situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to cover the relatively sicker <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> expensive policies, which could create a vicious cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (<b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs. Experience in New Jersey and Massachusetts offered divergent outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> women {{participating in the}} workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 {{is a star}} {{located in}} the {{constellation}} Lyra {{in the field of}} view of the Kepler Mission, a NASA-led operation tasked with discovering terrestrial planets. The star, which is slightly hotter, larger, and more massive than the Sun, has one gas giant in its orbit, Kepler-8b. This gas giant is larger than Jupiter, but is less massive, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> diffuse. The planet's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 along with four other planets. As the fifth confirmed planetary system verified by Kepler, it helped demonstrate the capabilities of the Kepler spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} two extinct lemur species were {{previously}} classified under the genus Varecia. Found at sites {{in central and}} southwestern Madagascar, Varecia insignis and V. jullyi were very similar to modern ruffed lemurs, but more robust and assumed to be more terrestrial, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> prone to predation by early human settlers. More {{recent studies have shown}} that these extinct species had a diet similar to that of modern ruffed lemurs, and that they were also arboreal in nature. Enough differences were demonstrated to merit a separate genus, Pachylemur. These close relatives of ruffed lemurs are now named Pachylemur insignis and P. jullyi.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} is {{a fairly}} inactive species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried motionless in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E
5|$|The electron's {{charge was}} more {{carefully}} {{measured by the}} American physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil-drop experiment of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling {{as a result of}} gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team, using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913. However, oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time.|$|E

5|$|The first {{studies and}} propositions {{to clean up}} the river date back to 1859, and during the {{following}} years, many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions. Dozens of different ideas were submitted, many of which were completely unfeasible. Several of them proposed diverting large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute the Senne, while greatly improving the drainage system in the city. Other proposals involved diverting the main course of the Senne completely to the Lesser Senne, which would then be enlarged <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> useful for boat traffic and mills. Others considered any sort of sanitization impossible, and proposed covering the Senne without greatly changing its course. Among these was a proposal to double the size of the underground drainage tunnels, creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel. The idea was ahead of its time, but would be implemented a century later with the North–South connection.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} grains were rye, barley, buckwheat, millet and oats. Rice {{remained}} a fairly expensive import {{for most of}} the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only {{towards the end of the}} period. Wheat was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most nutritious of all grains, but was more prestigious <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> expensive. The finely sifted white flour that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes. As one descended the social ladder, bread became coarser, darker, and its bran content increased. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts, dried legumes, acorns, ferns, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>more</b> portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
