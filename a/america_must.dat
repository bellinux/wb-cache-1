25|$|Carnival of Chaos {{would be}} the last album with Pete Lee on guitar, being {{replaced}} by Tim Harriss who had previously been in the band around 1986 and was featured as a guest guitarist on <b>America</b> <b>Must</b> Be Destroyed. For the recording of We Kill Everything between late 1998 and early 1999, Michael Bishop would temporarily rejoin the band as the bassist during the absence of Casey Orr. The record, largely influenced by punk rock, is the band's least favorite album and thus its songs are rarely played live.|$|E

25|$|The {{long-range}} {{interests of}} the United States are served by communicating directly with {{the peoples of the}} world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of <b>America</b> <b>must</b> win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts. 1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive. 2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions. 3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.|$|E
500|$|The {{practice}} in <b>America</b> <b>must</b> {{be entitled to}} much more respect. [...] In every state, probably, in the Union, the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men, of every description, {{which has not been}} confined to the strict limits of the common law.|$|E
500|$|He guarded his {{language}} in public {{to avoid being}} linked to communism by his enemies, but in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism. In a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, he said: [...] "I imagine {{you already know that}} I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic..." [...] In one speech, he stated that [...] "something is wrong with capitalism" [...] and claimed, [...] "There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe <b>America</b> <b>must</b> move toward a democratic socialism." ...|$|E

He participated in the August 7 AFL-CIO Debate and the August 19 Iowa debate featured on ABC. On August 20 Biden aired his first campaign advertisement in the first caucus state of Iowa. In the 30-second ad a voiceover states that Biden has a plan to end the Iraq War, and that [...] "We (<b>America)</b> <b>must</b> end this war in a way that doesn't require us to send their (soldiers) grandchild back." [...] It continues by declaring, [...] "Joe Biden is the only candidate with a plan {{to get us out of}} Iraq and keep us out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Senator John Warner of Virginia, {{the senior}} Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated, [...] "General Cartwright has an {{extraordinary}} grasp {{and understanding of}} the global posture that <b>America</b> <b>must</b> maintain in this era of new and ever-changing threats".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{suffered}} further line-up {{changes during}} this period, with Dewey Rowell leaving the band in 1991 {{and not being}} replaced until 1992 by Pete Lee, after the recording of <b>America</b> <b>Must</b> Be Destroyed. During this period, Gwar was (temporarily) banned in North Carolina because Brockie was wearing his [...] "Cuttlefish of Cthulhu" [...] codpiece, which led to his arrest; this incident was the inspiration for Gwar's third album, <b>America</b> <b>Must</b> Be Destroyed, released in 1992. The album was accompanied by the movie Phallus in Wonderland, which documented the main concept and contained music videos for the album. Phallus in Wonderland {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 1993. After recording for This Toilet Earth was completed, bassist Mike Bishop left the band. He was replaced by Casey Orr, from the band Rigor Mortis.|$|E
2500|$|The Ligonier {{meeting of}} the Orthodox bishops in North America was a {{milestone}} {{in the history of}} Orthodoxy in America. The vision of Orthodoxy that was seen at that meeting is still relevant today, but has yet to be realized. [...] Orthodox jurisdictional unity in North <b>America</b> <b>must</b> be our continued vision; any deviation from this is a contradiction to the order and canons of the Orthodox Church. Let us fervently pray that the Holy Spirit will guide us in making this vision a reality.|$|E

5000|$|On June 21, 2011, Manchin {{delivered}} {{a speech on}} the Senate floor calling for a [...] "substantial and responsible reduction in the United States' military presence in Afghanistan."

2500|$|It {{has taken}} President Obama {{far too long}} to speak out forcefully against Assad and his vicious {{crackdown}} in Syria. In {{the early stages of}} this crisis, the Obama Administration referred to Assad as a [...] "reformer," [...] which had the effect of emboldening Assad and discouraging the dissidents. <b>America</b> <b>must</b> show leadership on the world stage and work to move these developing nations toward modernity. This means using the bullhorn of the presidency and not remaining silent for too long while voices of freedom and dissent are under attack.|$|E
2500|$|During his Senate hearing opening {{statement}} Hagel {{said that he}} endorsed use of American military power, supported Israel and supported using special operations forces and unmanned combat aerial vehicles ("drones") on terrorist groups in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa. He stated [...] "I believe, and always have, that <b>America</b> <b>must</b> engage—not retreat—in the world". During the hearing he explained his 2001 and 2002 votes against unilateral American sanctions on Iran as being for strategic reasons. He said he supported President Obama's drawing down troops in Afghanistan {{and said he would}} do [...] "everything possible under current law" [...] to support gay and women service members equal benefits and combat roles.|$|E
2500|$|A graphic mural in {{the upper}} level {{displays}} a collage of portraits depicting over 250 {{members of the community}} and an inspirational quote from President Barack Obama’s inaugural address which reads, “We know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that <b>America</b> <b>must</b> play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Where a {{signalling}} message travels from North America {{to the rest}} of the world or from the rest of the world to North <b>America,</b> there <b>must</b> be a conversion done from E.212 based global title to E.214 based global title. This conversion is reasonably simple, well defined and fully reversible.|$|R
2500|$|Kramer {{directly}} and deliberately defines AIDS as a holocaust {{because he believes}} the United States' government failed to respond quickly and expend the necessary resources to cure AIDS, largely because AIDS initially infected gay men, and, quite soon after, predominantly poor and politically powerless minorities. [...] Through speeches, editorials, and personal, sometimes publicized, letters to figures such as politician Gary Bauer, former New York Mayor Ed Koch, several New York Times reporters, {{and head of the}} National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, Kramer personally advocates for a more significant response to AIDS. [...] He implores the government to conduct research based on commonly accepted scientific standards and to allocate funds and personnel to AIDS research. [...] Kramer ultimately states that the response to AIDS in <b>America</b> <b>must</b> be defined as a holocaust because of the large number deaths that resulted from the negligence and apathy that surrounded AIDS in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and early Bill Clinton presidencies.|$|E
2500|$|After vehement {{objection}} by Eisenhower, {{who wrote}} [...] "the women of <b>America</b> <b>must</b> share {{the responsibility for}} the security of their country in a future emergency as the women of England did in World War II"; the personal testimony of Secretary of Defense James Forrestal; and support from every major military commander including the Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and MacArthur, the Commander of the U.S. Army Forces, Far East, who wrote, [...] "we cannot ask these women to remain on duty, nor can we ask qualified personnel to volunteer, if we cannot offer them permanent status"; supporting articles in The New York Times and Christian Science Monitor, and the support of Senator and future President Lyndon B. Johnson and Representative Edith Rogers, the amended bill passed in the House but was rejected in the Senate. A compromise restored the original wording but limited the total number of women allowed to serve for the first few years, which then passed unanimously in the Senate, and 206 to 133 in the House. On June 12, 1948 President Harry Truman signed the [...] "Women's Armed Services Integration Act", making it Public Law 80-625.|$|E
2500|$|Orthodox Christians {{working out}} their {{salvation}} in Canada and the United States of <b>America</b> <b>must</b> separately be united into two local Autocephalous Churches, each pastored by hierarchs synergetically working in two unique Holy Synods, each one headed {{by its own}} Patriarch. The long-term goal of one hierarch shepherding one metropolis will, in time, manifest itself through {{the will of the}} Holy Spirit inspiring the entire Church. Inasmuch as each [...] "jurisdiction" [...] serves both an ethnic and indigenous flock, it should continue its ministry uninterrupted. Present imperfect [...] "Eucharistic unity" [...] will be perfected because of administrative unity. [...] Temporarily, administrative unity means each jurisdiction will keep its own administrative structures which, nonetheless, are brought into a national unity through representation by each hierarch in his national, Canadian or American, Holy Synod. Each Autocephalous Church must create a single Constitution and By-laws/Statutes to best serve the needs of the native-born and the immigrant. The unity of the hierarchs, in Synodia, would manifest itself in unity of purpose of internal and external evangelization as outlined ten years ago in the two documents born of the Ligonier meeting. This to be achieved through [...] the [...] movement of the Holy Spirit empowering these Orthodox Christians through fasting, prayer and almsgiving to act creatively.|$|E

60|$|In the {{new state}} of society which {{we are trying to}} found in <b>America,</b> it <b>must</b> be our effort to hasten the consummation.
