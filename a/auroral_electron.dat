The average, large scale, return current densities, which are a few microamps/sq m, are too small to affect <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> temperatures.

The results confirm all previous demonstrations of the validity of Evan's (1974, 1975, 1976) hypothesis concerning the origin of low energy <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> from collisional interactions of the auroral primaries with the atmosphere.

40|$|Jupiter's auroral {{parameters}} are estimated from observations by a spectrometer EXCEED (Extreme Ultraviolet Spectroscope for Exospheric Dynamics) onboard JAXA's Earth-orbiting planetary space telescope Hisaki. EXCEED provides continuous auroral spectra covering the wavelength range over 80 – 148 nm {{from the whole}} northern polar region. The <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> energy is estimated using a hydrocarbon color ratio adopted for the wavelength range of EXCEED, and the emission power in the long wavelength range 138. 5 – 144. 8 nm is used {{as an indicator of}} total emitted power before hydrocarbon absorption and <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> energy flux. The quasi-continuous observations by Hisaki provide the <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> parameters and their relation under different auroral activity levels. Short- (within one planetary rotation) enhancements of auroral power accompany increases of the electron number flux rather than the electron energy variations. The relationships between the <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> energy (~ 70 – 400 keV) and flux (1026 – 1027 /s, 0. 08 – 0. 9 μA/m 2) estimated from the observations over a 40 -day interval are in agreement with field-aligned acceleration theory when incorporating probable magnetospheric parameters. Applying the electron acceleration theory to each observation point, we explore the magnetospheric source plasma variation during these power-enhanced events. Possible scenarios to explain the derived variations are (i) an adiabatic variation of the magnetospheric plasma under a magnetospheric compression and/or plasma injection, and (ii) a change of the dominant auroral component from the main emission (main aurora) to the emission at the open-closed boundary...|$|E

As {{can be seen from}} the moving satellite, the anisotropies are of short duration and are most likely to occur when particle fluxes are high. Field-aligned 2. 3 -keV electron precipitation is found in an oval-shaped region primarily in the nighttime hours; maximum probability is at about 70 deg invariant latitude near midnight, congruent to and poleward of the auroral optical emissions in these hours. This precipitation is found to be associated with the high-latitude boundary of <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> precipitation during substorm expansion and is characterized by a slightly harder and considerably more intense energy spectrum than typical isotropic precipitation. ...|$|E

This second part presents an analysis of measurements of <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> onboard the CRRES satellite. It is demonstrated that enhancements of the electron flux (injections) during large-scale and local dipolarizations of the magnetic field are determined by a combination of field-aligned, induction, and betatron mechanisms of acceleration with an effect of displacement of the drift shells of particles. The relative contributions of these mechanisms in relation to the energy of <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> are determined...|$|R
40|$|Rocket {{observations}} of <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> are {{compared with the}} predictions {{of a number of}} theoretical acceleration mechanisms that involve an electric field parallel to the earth's magnetic field. The theoretical models are discussed in terms of required plasma sources, the location of the acceleration region, and properties of necessary wave-particle scattering mechanisms. We have been unable to find any steady state scatter-free electric field configuration that predicts electron flux distributions in agreement with the observations. The addition of a fluctuating electric field or wave-particle scattering several thousand kilometers above the rocket can modify the theoretical flux distributions so that they agree with measurements. The presence of very narrow energy peaks in the flux contours implies a characteristic temperature of several tens of electron volts or less for the source of field-aligned <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> and a temperature of several hundred electron volts or less for the relatively isotropic 'monoenergetic' <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons.</b> The temperature of the field-aligned electrons is more representative of the magnetosheath or possibly the ionosphere as a source region than of the plasma sheet...|$|R

By seeding the ionosphere with Langmuir or ion acoustic waves during appropriate conditions of <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> precipitation, energy might be channeled into the plasma waves, which might open up for studying new non-linear regimes of plasma turbulence. Further, in such experiments, possible feedback of the ionospheric plasma turbulence on the larger scale system supplying the precipitation might be studied. Interferometric measurements are important to study the self-organisation of the turbulence in the pump-plasma interaction region, including the possibility of filamentation, which has been predicted theoretically for a long time.|$|E

40|$|A {{generation}} {{mechanism for}} radio {{waves in the}} frequency range 150 - 700 kHz observed by ground facilities is suggested {{in terms of an}} electromagnetic electron cyclotron instability driven by <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons.</b> The excited waves can propagate downward along the ambient magnetic field lines and are thus observable with ground facilities. The trapped <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> are supposed {{to play an important role}} in the generation process, because they give rise to a thermal anisotropy which consequently leads to the instability. The present work is a natural extension of the theory proposed earlier by Wu et al. (1983) which was discussed in a different context but may be used to explain the observed waves originated at low altitudes. This paper presents a possible wave generation mechanism valid in the entire auroral field-line region of interest...|$|R

The corresponding ratio for photoelectron production is 0. 05, which makes photoelectron production of N(+) negligible compared to photodissociative production. The ratio of 3914 -A to total ion production is found to be 0. 07 for <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> and a similar 0. 06 for photoelectrons. The 3371 -A ratio to total N 2 ion production is 0. 09. This calculation also reveals that the secondary electrons in auroras, with energies less than 100 eV, produce only about one third {{of the total number of}} ions produced.

We focused on small potential drops, for which the estimation of plasma density and temperature from LP is available. The floating potential varied according to the variations of plasma density and temperature, similar to the previously reported observations. Most of the potential drops occurred around the nightside auroral region. However, unlike the previous studies where large potential drops were observed with the precipitation of <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons,</b> the potential drops occurred {{before or after the}} precipitation of <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons.</b> Statistical analysis shows that the potential drops have good correlation with the temperature increase of cold electrons, which suggests the small potential drops be mainly controlled by the cold ionospheric plasmas...|$|R

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{has been}} developed for observing the high frequency modulations or fluctuations (upto several megahertzs) of the <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> flux. The instrument utilizes an on-board processing hardware for calculating autocorrelation functions of particle flux measured by any type of particle detector which output a series of pulses. Two rocket observations by using the instrument were carried out {{as a part of}} low energy <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> experiments on board the S- 310 JA- 11 and - 12 rockets which were launched into the Antarctic auroral ionosphere. The instrument is capable of measuring the flux modulations in three frequency ranges, i. e. 1. 5 - 100 Hz, 0. 1 - 8 kHz and 0. 1 - 4 MHz, respectively. Results from one rocket experiment launched under relatively quiet conditions indicate that the auroral electrons are almost uniform in the high frequency range.

40|$|The {{transport}} of <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> through {{the upper atmosphere}} is analyzed. The transport equation is solved using a discrete-ordinate method, including elastic and inelastic scattering of electrons (resulting in changes of pitch angle) and degradation in energy as the electrons penetrate into the atmosphere. The transport equation is solved numerically for the electron intensity {{as a function of}} altitude, pitch angle, and energy. In situ measurements of the pitch angle and energy distribution of precipitating <b>electrons</b> over an <b>auroral</b> arc provide boundary conditions for the calculation. Model calculations were carried out with various different phase functions for elastic and inelastic collisions to attempt changing the angular scattering, but the observed pitch angle distributions remain unexplained. It is suggested that mechanisms other than collisional scattering influence the angular distribution of <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> at or below 300 km altitude in the low-energy domain...|$|R

It consists of a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code for a dipole magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system and a one-dimensional electrostatic plasma particle code for <b>auroral</b> energetic <b>electron</b> production. Results of the holistic auroral simulation indicate that drastic variation in the ionospheric electric field, which is induced by <b>auroral</b> energetic <b>electrons</b> and propagates into the magnetosphere, influences the magnetospheric field-aligned current distribution.

40|$|The {{intensity}} {{ratios of}} auroral emissions at different wavelengths {{are widely used}} for reconstruction of <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> parameters. This method works quite well if the measurements of the auroral emissions are conducted in the magnetic zenith direction. In this study we want to investigate the possibility to use the intensity ratio method in the case where the observations are made in a direction not parallel to the magnetic field. In particular, we want to check {{the possibility of using}} auroral data for deducing the 2 D distribution of the <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> precipitation. We use ALIS multi-station measurements of the auroral red and green line emissions (6300 Å and 5577 Å) to get data in zenith and non-zenith directions. We also take into account that the red line emission peak and the green line emission peak are at different altitudes.

With {{regard to the}} polar wind, {{it was found that}} hot magnetospheric electrons have a pronounced effect on the polar wind. In addition, there is no O(+) charge exchange barrier and substantial fluxes of O(+) ions can escape with the polar wind. In the auroral plasma physics area, the excitation of electrostatic waves by field aligned <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> beams was examined. It was demonstrated that the auroral field aligned current density can be large enough to excite Buneman double layers. For situations that lead to strong double layers, it was shown that the temporal evolution of the potential profile is controlled by current fluctuations. Two dimensional particle in cell simulations were conducted, and the high frequency wave turbulence excited by an <b>auroral</b> <b>electron</b> beam of finite width perpendicular to an ambient magnetic field was investigated. The formation of V shaped auroral potential structures was studied, and numerical simulations of double layers and auroral electric fields were reviewed...|$|E

40|$|Instabilities {{operating}} {{in both the}} ionosphere and magnetosphere will produce an exponential growth of plasma waves. These waves could then act in resonance with precipitating <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> at their local plasma and cyclotron frequencies (. 5 - 10 MHz) to produce a modulation of the electron flux. The design of a rocket-borne experiment to measure flux modulation of 4 - 8 keV <b>auroral</b> <b>electrons</b> in the previously unexplored frequency range of 10 kHz- 10 MHz is described. The detector proposed for the experiment is a Johnston Laboratory MM- 1 Electron Multiplier. A hemispherical electrostatic deflection system is used to provide large count-rates of the appropriate electrons, and to reduce the apparent modulation in the flux due to the spin stabilization of the rocket. An on-board spectral analysis of the signal is performed, and the frequency spectrum is telemetered to the receiving station. Since the experiment is exploratory, the instrument is designed to measure only the amount and frequency of the occurring modulation...|$|R
