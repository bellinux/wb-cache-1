5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. Cattle, hogs and sheep were shipped cheaper by truck than by trains. In 1919 27% of {{livestock}} at the Stockyards was shipped by truck; by 1940's it rose to over 75%. In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the cattle was shipped by truck.|$|E

5|$|After being {{concentrated}} at Yagodnik, {{the attack}} force was readied to strike Kaafjord. The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, {{but the process}} of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Suleiman {{went to war}} for {{the last}} time. The siege of Szigetvár was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle—Zrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes. More than 20,000 Turks had fallen during the attacks <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Zrinski's 2,300 man garrison was killed, {{with most of the}} final 600 men killed on the last day. Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683.|$|E

5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 {{of those are}} known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo {{is one of the}} very few naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{surface of}} the Sun, the {{photosphere}}, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity {{is due to the}} decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

5|$|In 1678 the Manche Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child under six years old <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch'ol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to losing {{all of its}} Torah scrolls, Beth Israel lost all its furniture, and over 3,000 siddurs and mahzors, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its members' homes were flooded, forcing them to move. The congregation did, however, receive assistance in replacing some of its assets; the Orthodox Union immediately sent Beth Israel 50 ArtScroll siddurs, and Brith Shalom Beth Israel Congregation of Charleston, South Carolina, and Congregation Shaare Zedek Sons of Abraham of Providence, Rhode Island each donated Torahs. Hayley Fields, a 14-year-old from Los Angeles, heard of Beth Israel's difficult circumstances, and {{with the support of}} her mother, spearheaded a fund-raising drive, selling 3,500 watches. $18,000 was ultimately raised to buy a Torah, which was dedicated in August, 2006, two days before {{the first anniversary of the}} hurricane. At that ceremony the National Council of Young Israel also donated 150 new Artscoll mahzors, in time for the High Holy Days.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining a close line of battle, Hoste forced Dubourdieu {{to attack}} him directly, Dubourdieu {{attempting}} to personally board Hoste's Amphion {{at the head}} of the Italian soldiers carried aboard his flagship. Hoste responded to the attempt with fire at point blank range from a carronade containing over 750 musket balls. The first shot killed Dubourdieu <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his officers, creating confusion in the French squadron that resulted in Favorite being wrecked on Lissa's coastline. Hoste then engaged the following Flore and Bellone, forcing them both to surrender. The head of the British line, led by the HMS Volage engaged the three remaining French and Italian ships, driving off Danaé and Carolina and capturing Corona. Flore too later escaped to the safety of French batteries off Lesina.|$|E

5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the sets had {{some form of}} digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, {{which had to be}} digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} force rapidly {{spread across}} the island, meeting no resistance as the entire Neapolitan portion <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the Tuscan region surrendered before them. Soon, all that remained in Tuscan hands was the fortress port town of Porto Ferrajo on the northern coast. This was a powerful defensive position, and the Tuscan commander Carlo de Fisson rejected Tharreau's demands that he surrender. The presence of two British frigates, HMS Phoenix and HMS Mermaid, off the port, buttressed de Fisson's position. Tharreau responded by laying siege to the fortress. The sudden departure of the two frigates {{in the face of}} Ganteaume's squadron, which bombarded the town on 6 May before being forced to retire following the outbreak of typhus on board the squadron, encouraged Tharreau. The small French frigate Badine subsequently blockaded Porto Ferrajo, with the intention of starving the defenders into surrender. Three more frigates Carrère, Bravoure and Succès, under the overall command of Captain Jacques-François-Ignace Bretel, soon arrived to augment Badines blockade.|$|E
