50|$|BR.20 {{was a good}} overall design, but it {{soon became}} obsolete, <b>and</b> the <b>lack</b> of {{improved}} versions condemned it {{to be only a}} second-line machine, underpowered <b>and</b> <b>lacking</b> in defensive firepower.|$|R

5|$|The smaller white-winged chough {{has similar}} plumage but has red eyes and is found {{mainly on the}} ground. Australian crow and raven species have white eyes <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> the white rump, and the similar-sized Australian magpie has red eyes and {{prominent}} black and white plumage. The larger grey currawong is readily distinguished by its lighter grey overall plumage <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> of white feathers {{at the base of}} the tail. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies melanoptera of the grey) does have a darker plumage than other grey subspecies, but its wings lack the white primaries of the pied currawong.|$|E

5|$|A long bar of Danish territories in {{the south}} <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> of {{sufficient}} year-round ice-free ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron and most notably copper, coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland. Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but {{the intervention of the}} Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|A {{tapestry}} copy of Picasso's Guernica {{depicting a}} massacre of innocent {{women and children}} during the Spanish civil war is displayed {{on the wall of}} the United Nations building in New York City, at the entrance to the Security Council room, demonstrably as a spur to the conscience of representatives from the nation states.

5|$|Additional key {{threatening}} {{processes that}} are considered likely to impact the bristle-faced free-tailed bat include the alteration to natural flow regimes, competition from introduced western honey bees (Apis mellifera) for tree hollows, inappropriate fire regimes, reduction of invertebrate prey related to pesticide drift <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> of tree regeneration due to overgrazing and weeds.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War, Jerusalem's {{municipal}} borders were {{expanded to}} include the Old City and beyond. Barricades that had lined the border were torn down. Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from the fighting <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was the Stern House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit. However, popular outcry brought Supreme Court involvement {{which led to the}} temporary dismantling and reassembly nearby of this historical landmark.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{finished}} second in the 1972–73 Football League but did not play in the UEFA Cup 1973–74, because the Football League continued to apply the one-team-per-city rule from the old Fairs Cup, and Tottenham Hotspur qualified as League cup winners. In subsequent seasons, the departure of Mee <b>and</b> <b>lack</b> of domestic honours meant that the club did not contest in European football.|$|E
