25|$|After leaving Capitol, Davis {{focused on}} {{different}} music styles and recorded songs for several film soundtracks but it appeared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> music career was winding down. In the early 1990s she began performing occasional surprise gigs which found her experimenting with new songs {{that she had}} written.|$|E
25|$|Sturt's health {{had been}} very {{variable}} and on 16 June 1869 he died suddenly. He was survived by his widow, two sons, Colonel Napier George Sturt, R.E. and Major-General Charles Sheppey Sturt, and daughter Charlotte. Mrs Sturt was granted a civil list pension of £80 a year, and the queen granted her the title of Lady Sturt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> husband's nomination to a knighthood {{of the order of}} St Michael and St George had been gazetted. Reproductions of portraits by Crossland and Koberwein will be found in Mrs N. G. Sturt's Life, which suggest the charm and refinement of Sturt's character.|$|E

25|$|February Shadows can be {{categorized}} as a psychological novel. The entire narration is told through first person stream of consciousness, and the plot builds through the unearthing of new memories as they emerge in Hilde's mind. The story is told in a mix {{of past and present}} and the narration switches fluidly {{back and forth between the}} two. The manner of the flashbacks and the inner comments Hilde makes about each informs the reader that she wishes to repress the horrific memories of 2 February 1945. Hilde constantly reminds herself to forget the past <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> survival and sanity depended on doing so.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Erika {{calls her}} mother, stating {{that she will}} be coming to visit. Erika also grieves her father's death. Hilde becomes {{impatient}} with Erika, hinting at the contradictory nature of their relationship. Hilde wants to be with her daughter, yet she feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> daughter is a total stranger. Erika acts boldly and actively pursues her career as a writer. Hilde believes the only reason Erika wishes to come home is to get information for her book, which is true. Hilde is angry at her daughter for forcing her to relive her past experiences; her childhood was full of poverty, loneliness, and shame. Anton had been her way out of the past, and she only wants to move forward.|$|E
25|$|Yuma is {{the main}} protagonist of the story, and is in her second {{year of high school}} along with her best friend Hotaru. When she finds her first boyfriend (Takeda) she is not sure how to react so she asks Hotaru for advice. Yuma is {{surprised}} though when it appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> friend is flirting with her. She cannot explain the good feeling she gets when she French kisses Hotaru or when she gets fondled, and worries that Takeda will catch her in the act. In the second volume he decides that the two should take some space apart, and Yuma comes to terms that she is in fact cheating with Hotaru. Her feelings still remain conflicted though as she does not want to hurt him so she remains as a friend. Yuma finally confesses to Hotaru in the fifth manga volume that she has feelings towards her but is rejected. She then turns to Takeda after feeling like she had been used the entire time by her.|$|E

500|$|According to the New York Post critic, Elisabeth Vincentelli, {{the show}} {{improved}} with its transfer from Off-Broadway to Broadway, especially Weaver's performance, which Vincentelli deemed the weakest. Weaver portrayed {{a movie star}} who was [...] "overindulgent, self-centered, and unaware she’s on the decline." [...] Mark Kennedy of The Washington Post suggested Durang, with whom Weaver graduated from the Yale School of Drama in 1974, may have written the role for her. Both Hyde Pierce and Nielsen exhibited mastery of their monologues, according to Vincentelli: [...] " [...] Hyde Pierce {{is a master of}} the slow burn, while Nielsen’s wild-eyed Sonia often looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> train of thought has a loose caboose." [...] Vincentelli also noted that Weaver's character had [...] "turned her life into a performance." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} noted that Lewis' [...] "delicately seductive vocals are more versatile", with the Detroit Free Press stating that her voice [...] "smoothly mixes classic country with pop and indie-rock, Lewis is as adept on the ballads as {{she is on the}} rave-ups." [...] The Times {{considered}} Lewis' songwriting [...] "leagues ahead of anything that she has done in the past" [...] and her vocals sound [...] "as though she means it". DeRogatis pointed out that [...] "Lewis' impressive strength as both a singer and a songwriter is that she makes every listener feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> music was crafted just for them." [...] However, Angela Zimmerman of Crawdaddy! felt that Lewis often used a [...] "pervasive soprano that she can't quite execute" [...] on tracks like [...] "Black Sand", [...] "Pretty Bird", [...] "Trying My Best to Love You", and [...] "Jack Killed Mom".|$|E
500|$|When Willow and Tara {{first met}} in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the {{relationship}} to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made to feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world". Tropiano calls it [...] "A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Disturbia" [...] begins in a surrealistic, circus-like torture chamber where Rihanna is seen dressed in black, wearing dark make-up and having long black nails while she presses the keys {{of a big}} dark piano and looks into the camera. As the song starts {{different}} images of Rihanna are shown. In one of the scenes she is seen imprisoned wearing lenses that make look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> eyes have rolled {{into the back of}} her head. Rihanna stays in the prison with two men watching on her from the both sides. Other scenes include Rihanna sitting on a throne chair and singing the song, while two strange women (one is played by American drag queen Detox Icunt) are around her. Then, multiple people around her are holding her in front of a gas chamber. As the chorus starts Rihanna is seen tied up in a bed from which she can't get out. At the bridge of the song Rihanna and her dancers are performing a Thriller-esque dance routine. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is seen holding a column and fire is around her. As the song continues, Rihanna drags a man doll around a metal web. In the second chorus she wears a metal spines corset while one tarantula is upon her arm. In the later scene, Rihanna is in a very tiny room, with her hands and legs been tied up. The video ends with Rihanna turning around on her chair.|$|E
2500|$|Stinnett was {{discovered}} by her mother, Becky Harper, {{in a pool of}} blood about an hour after the assault. Harper immediately called 911, describing the wounds inflicted upon her daughter as appearing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> [...] "stomach had exploded". Attempts by paramedics to revive Stinnett were unsuccessful, and she was pronounced dead at St. Francis Hospital in Maryville, Missouri.|$|E
2500|$|Although Dorothy and Ezra {{planned to}} honeymoon in Spain that September, the {{outbreak}} of World War I forced them to postpone. Instead they lived with W.B. Yeats at Stone Cottage for the winter, where Pound worked on proofs for the second issue of BLAST magazine. Of Dorothy, Yeats wrote, [...] "she looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> face were made out of Dresden china. I look at her in perpetual wonder. It {{is hard to believe}} she is real; yet she spends all her daylight hours drawing the most monstrous cubist pictures." [...] Poet Iris Barry, writing in the 1930s about the Pounds during this period, describes Dorothy as, [...] "With [...] came Mrs. Pound, carrying herself delicately with the air, always of a young Victorian lady out skating, and a profile as clear and lovely as that as a porcelain Kuan-yin".|$|E

2500|$|Having {{walked back}} home from Richard's, Clarissa Vaughan enters her apartment. Her partner Sally, a TV producer, {{is on her}} way out the door to a lunch meeting with a film star. Suddenly, left alone, Clarissa feels unmoored. She feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> home and its comforts are trivial in light of the {{impending}} death of her closest friend Richard; compared to a time when she felt most alive and had everything to hope for. Her apartment is just as much a [...] "realm of the dead" [...] as Richard's. Like the other characters in Cunningham's novel she questions the value of her present life and whether it isn't a negation via triviality of the life she could lead. Then the feeling moves on. Clarissa is disappointed but relieved to find her life is her own and that she wants no other. She holds onto the prospect of preparing Richard's party as affirmation and begins arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|Being a yōkai, Himari {{finds herself}} torn between {{her desire to}} protect Yuto, and her nature as a bloodthirsty demon cat. Through research, Shizuku informs Yuto that Himari's {{ancestors}} were the type of evil yōkai that killed and ate humans, saying that Himari takes pleasure in the hunt and loses herself to the bloodlust. Initially, Himari does not realize when she loses control, describing it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> heart was swallowed up into a black pool. Himari eventually acknowledges {{that she is a}} beast after a fight with Kuesu, but she is tended to by Yuta. In response Himari kisses him, saying that it is a [...] "gift of mercy" [...] for letting her stay by his side. Towards the end of the series in the fight against Tamamo-no-Mae, Himari bites her, absorbing most of her demonic powers. This results in Himari losing control with her darker demonic half, which eventually becomes visible to those around her. The series ends when Yuto enters into Himari's subconscious, and saves her before her darker half takes full control of her heart.|$|E
2500|$|Shakira {{included}} the {{song on the}} setlist of her The Sun Comes Out World Tour (2010–11), where she performed it as a medley with [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] (1992), by American band Metallica. For the performance she was dressed with a crop top and a red skirt. Jon Pareles from The New York Times praised her performance in New York, saying that [...] "she used her body, with a girlish grin and dance moves of finely calibrated sensuality: angular hip twitches and smooth slow-motion swivels, chest thrusts and sinuous wrist turns, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> every joint rotates 360 degrees". A writer of Sprinning Platters praised {{the performance of the}} song, calling it a [...] "seductive dance number in which she managed to test the skill and professionalism of her drummer by incorporating him into her moves", further dubbing it a [...] "'you had to be here' moment". The live performance of [...] "Despedida" [...] was included on her album Live from Paris (2011) which was filmed during the concerts held on June 13 and 14 at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. It was also made available for purchase on the iTunes Store and released to the singer's official Vevo account on January 11, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times {{said that}} the album [...] "mastered R songs over space-age beats," [...] noting the track [...] "Ditto" [...] as a standout. AllMusic editor Andy Kellman commented that [...] "As a vocalist, Cassie has enough {{character}} and ability to sell her material without fail. And there will never not {{be a need for}} a vocalist who doesn't handle each stage of a relationship <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> life depends on it." [...] Blenders Dorian Lynskey wrote, [...] "Even the 35-minute running time indicates a rare self-control that makes this the most consistently arresting R debut since Kelis's." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today felt despite vocal limitations, Cassie is [...] "engaging enough to keep things interesting." [...] Clover Hope from Billboard stated the album [...] "offers sexy, laid-back tunes, dainty ballads and midtempo dance jams" [...] and its [...] "whispery piano runs and simple basslines create a fresh listening experience." [...] In an editorial review on Amazon.com, Tammy La Gorce opined that, other than the singles, [...] "this brief disc bumps along on the greatness of its beats. Credit Cassie, though, for concocting a whole lotta 'tude," [...] calling her [...] "a master of sass, a guru of guile." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E

60|$|He {{seemed to}} take but little notice of her, {{although}} at times his dark, keen eyes would seek hers, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> challenging <b>her</b> for a reply.|$|R
60|$|There was an {{interval}} of silence. She never moved; she still looked into fire--looked, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>her</b> past life was pictured {{there in the}} burning coals.|$|R
60|$|She leaned nearer, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> incredulous, <b>her</b> face <b>as</b> {{tranquil}} in its absorption as {{the planet}} {{that hung in}} the russet-black sky in a rift of the leaves.|$|R
