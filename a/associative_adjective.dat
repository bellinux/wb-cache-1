In accordance with the right-handed rule, it is the head, that decides the most semantic and morphologic properties of the compound in a compound structure, so the adjectival components only get the lexical meaning and semantic realization with the heads. The interpretation can be various according to different kinds of adjective plus noun compound (ascriptive and associative). Although the <b>associative</b> <b>adjective</b> looks like noun morph-syntactically, it is an adjective semantically. This {{makes it possible to}} interpret associative adjectives as ascriptive ones under the same rule...|$|E

While in many cases such constructions are unambiguously and for identifiable reasons located on one or {{the other side of the}} lexicon–syntax ‘divide’, variation being possible only among speakers, a range of associative AdjNs is identified which must be simultaneously, and for the same speakers, of both lexical and syntactic provenance. There is therefore no lexicon–syntax ‘divide’: the two modules overlap. 2 1...|$|R
