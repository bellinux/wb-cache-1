5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly <b>after</b> <b>take-off,</b> and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} multi-country theory of {{economic}} growth in which countries are connected by a network of mutual knowledge exchange. Growth is generated through human capital accumulation and knowledge externalities. The available knowledge in any country depends on its connections {{to the rest of}} the world and on the human capital of the countries it is exchanging knowledge with. We show how the diffusion of knowledge through the world explains the evolution of global income inequality. It generates a 'Great Divergence', that is increasing world inequality <b>after</b> the <b>take-off</b> of the forerunners of the industrial revolution, followed by a 'Great Convergence', that is decreasing world inequality <b>after</b> the <b>take-off</b> of the latecomers of the industrial revolution. Knowledge diffusion through a Small World network produces an extraordinary diversity of individual growth e xperiences of initially identical countries including differentiated take-offs to growth as well as overtaking and falling behind in the course of world development...|$|R

50|$|In the report, {{the pilots}} {{are said to}} be usually well-behaved and sane, without any {{previous}} case of drug abuse or psychological stress. Nevertheless, on 24 January, they had received a formal warning for flying too low <b>after</b> a training <b>take-off.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Sutton Wick air crash {{occurred}} on 5 March 1957 when a Blackburn Beverley C Mk 1 heavy transport aircraft, serial number XH117, of 53 Squadron Royal Air Force crashed at Sutton Wick, Drayton, Berkshire, England, following a shut-down of one engine and partial {{loss of power}} on another. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>take-off,</b> No. 1 engine was shut down as a precautionary measure then whilst on final approach back to RAF Abingdon, No. 2 engine {{failed to respond to}} throttle inputs. The aeroplane struck cables and trees 18minutes after lifting off.|$|E
5|$|Antonov {{subsequently}} {{converted the}} static-test prototype into a flying prototype {{equipped with a}} modified flight-control system. The second airframe was rolled out in December 1996 in Kiev, before making its first flight on 24 April 1997 from Svyatoshino Airfield, during which the aircraft was airborne for 31 minutes; according to Jane's, however, the aircraft had taken off from Gostomel for a 26-minute flight. By this time, more than US$2.5 billion had been spent on the programme, with a further $200 million to be spent to prepare the aircraft for production, which was expected to have started in 1999 with 20–25 aircraft produced annually. The Russian and Ukrainian Air Forces reportedly had long-term plans to procure 500 and 100 aircraft, respectively. The second airframe was severely damaged during cold weather testing on 27 January 2001 in a crash landing <b>after</b> <b>take-off.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} of {{the second}} wave took to the air at 5:25 am. One of 829 Squadron's Barracudas crashed shortly <b>after</b> <b>take-off,</b> resulting {{in the deaths of}} its crew of three, and another aircraft from this squadron was not launched due to engine problems. Only two of the Barracudas in this wave were armed with 1,600-pound bombs. As with the first strike, 40 fighters accompanied the torpedo bombers; these comprised 10 Corsairs from 1834 and 1836 Naval Air Squadrons, all of the 20 Wildcats assigned to 896 and 898 Naval Air Squadrons and 10 Hellcats from 804 Naval Air Squadron. All aircraft were launched by 5:37 am, and the force had an uneventful flight to the Kaafjord area. While the German defences were now alert, the artificial smoke screen being generated around Kaafjord was not yet sufficient to hide Tirpitz from view.|$|E
50|$|In 1877, he {{developed}} an early helicopter {{powered by a}} steam engine. It was the first ofits type that rose to a height of 13 meters, where it remained for some 20 seconds, <b>after</b> a vertical <b>take-off</b> from a park in Milan.|$|R

5|$|On 1 June 1960, an Avro Anson {{aircraft}} suffered {{engine failure}} soon <b>after</b> <b>take-off</b> from Northolt and crash-landed {{on top of}} the nearby Express Dairies plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a Pan Am Boeing 707, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board. A Lufthansa Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as instrument landing systems (ILS) and the global positioning system (GPS) were available, the letters NO (for Northolt) and LH (for Heathrow) were painted on two gasometers on the approach to each airfield, one at Southall for the approach to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors. By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remained in force in 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} <b>after</b> <b>take-off,</b> killing all five on board. The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was the turbulence and high wind speeds around the airport. The airport was immediately closed after the incident; no public flights have taken off from the Airport after Flight 839. Private flights still use the airport on occasion. The Ministry of Transport and Communications decided on 17 January 1992 to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. This made Værøy Airport the civilian airport in Europe to have operated the shortest time. Helikopter Service resumed helicopter flights from Hanna Bakken-jorden on 1 January 1993. Construction of a new heliport started in 1996 and Værøy Heliport opened on 15 February 1997. The old airport was in 2000 bought by a private individual who has converted the terminal building into a private dwelling and uses the control tower for a small-scale chocolate factory.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} SDU {{and ground}} station bias was calculated from 17 signals exchanged between the ground {{station and the}} aircraft during a 30-minute period before take-off, when the aircraft's location was known (at Kuala Lumpur International Airport). To establish the accuracy of their calculations, the bias value was {{used to calculate the}} distance from the aircraft to the satellite during the time it was on the ground at KLIA, with errors of <1 km-8.85 km (<1 mi-5.5 mi). The distance from the satellite to the aircraft was also calculated while the aircraft was in-flight and at a known location shortly <b>after</b> <b>take-off,</b> showing similar accuracy. The distance between the satellite and aircraft could thus be calculated for signals exchanged between 02:25–08:19, after Flight 370 disappeared from radar. However, this could only produce a ring on Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated value, adjusted to account for the aircraft flying at 10,000 m (33,000 ft). The ring could also be reduced to an arc by taking into consideration the maximum range of the aircraft if it flew at its maximum speed.|$|E
5000|$|Paninternational Flight 112 {{took off}} from Hamburg Airport in Hamburg, Germany, on a flight to Málaga Airport in Málaga, Spain, with 115 {{passengers}} and six crew on board. <b>After</b> the <b>take-off,</b> both engines failed and the pilots decided to make an emergency landing on a highway [...] - [...] Bundesautobahn 7 (also part of European route E45) [...] - [...] about 4.5 km from Hamburg Airport. During the landing the aircraft collided with a bridge, causing both wings to shear off; and caught fire. The accident killed twenty-one passengers and one crew member.|$|R
40|$|New {{industries}} are created from the pioneering activities {{of a few}} firms. These firms generally face great uncertainty and risk, but also stand to benefit from early mover advantages due to the preemption of resources. Based on an empirical analysis of a diverse set of consumer and industrial innovations introduced in the US over the past 100 years, we find that entrants during the pre-firm take-off stage (termed Creators) have higher survival rates than later entrants that enter between the firm and sales take-off (termed Anticipators), and both of these entrant types have higher survival rates than firms that enter <b>after</b> the sales <b>take-off</b> (termed Followers). Notably, survival rates for Creators and Anticipators do not depend on entry time within the cohort group, i. e., what matters is whether an entrant enters before or <b>after</b> the <b>take-off,</b> not whether it entered first in its cohort. Our results indicate {{that there is no}} real option value in waiting when one considers survival as a performance measure, which bodes well for firms interested in creating new industries...|$|R
