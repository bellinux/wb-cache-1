5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|E

[...] The band's first review appeared in the NME, accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, [...] "Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos."

The other chassis (where the skirts and such were located) was stiffly sprung. Although the car passed scrutineering <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> races, other teams protested, and it was never allowed to race. The car was never developed further.|$|E

2500|$|The {{creative}} and song-writing force throughout Spacemen 3's history were Peter Kember and Jason Pierce.

[...] Pierce was in a band called Indian Scalp, but he left them {{near the end of}} 1982 in order to collaborate with Kember. The two guitarists recruited drummer Tim Morris, who played with a couple of other bands and had a rehearsal space at his parental home which they used. Shortly afterwards they were joined by an acquaintance, Pete Bain, on bass. Morris and Bain had previously played together in a band called Noise on Independent Street. Pierce handled lead vocal duties. Now a 4-piece, the band originally adopted the name The Spacemen. Their first live performances occurred around winter 1982/83, playing at a party and then <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> gigs they managed to get at a local bar; at the latter their set included a 20-minute version of the one-chord song [...] "O.D.

2500|$|In December 1997, Cohen's {{book was}} {{reviewed}} by Professor Charles W. Ingrao of Purdue University's History Department in Nationalities Papers. Ingrao described {{the book as}} a [...] "well-written, heavily footnoted narration" [...] which [...] "details {{the degree to which}} the Serbs of what is today Rump-Yugoslavia collaborated with the Nazis, both before and immediately after the April 1941 German invasion". He noted that, [...] "It is difficult to refute his contention that it was the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Jews of multiethnic Bosnia and the Krajina that provided the backbone to the anti-fascist war effort at a time when both the Četniks and Nedić regimes of Serbia were pursuing their own agenda of an ethnically pure Greater Serbia". Ingrao observed that while scholars were already familiar with a great deal of the material included in the book, Cohen's exposé on the Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society founded by Slobodan Milošević was new evidence about an organisation that was used to convince the international community of the common bond between Serbs and Jews. Ingrao concluded that, while Cohen overplayed the evidence <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> points in the book, he was impressed by both its factual accuracy and balanced judgements.|$|E
2500|$|Count 1 of {{the charges}} was {{conspiracy}} to commit child abduction, false imprisonment, and extortion. Janet Arvizo claimed {{she and her family}} had been held captive at Neverland as well as <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hotels when traveling with Jackson. She expressed her mistrust of [...] "the Germans," [...] Dieter Weisner and Ron Konitzer. She testified that they pretended to want to protect her, telling her the rebuttal video [...] "would appease the killers," [...] but that [...] "Michael, Ronald, Dieter, Frank, and Vinnie...ended up being the killers." [...] At one point, Janet testified that she'd known what questions she'd be asked in the rebuttal video, that Frank [...] "went over" [...] them with her on the phone beforehand and told her to praise Michael. [...] On another day of her testimony, she claimed [...] "the Germans" [...] had scripted every word of the video, even the hand-holding, laughing, and the outtakes when they appear to think the camera isn't on, and the Germans had [...] "worked with [...] daily, numerous times" [...] to learn it all. House manager Jesus Salas testified that the accuser's mother was at no time held at Neverland against her will and that she had never complained of her children being taken advantage of at Neverland. Other staff testified that the idea that the family were prisoners of Neverland was ludicrous, that there was no fence surrounding the property and that the guards did not carry weapons. [...] During their alleged captivity, the Arvizos took shopping trips into town, billing $3,312.05 worth of purchases to Michael Jackson. They also met with their lawyer and visited a Federal building during this time, making phone calls to various people, though never the police. [...] Janet testified that she was dropping hints [...] "in code" [...] about her kidnapping during the calls, and explained that she never openly asked anyone for help because of the death threats Jackson's co-conspirators allegedly made toward her parents. Janet and Star claimed that Jackson was preventing them from knowing times or dates. When Mesereau pointed out that there were clocks visible [...] "almost everywhere" [...] in Neverland, including a giant [...] "flower clock" [...] on a prominent hill, Star admitted that he was surrounded by clocks but claimed that they had the wrong times. Janet's claims included that she was restricted to [...] "one meal per day," [...] and that Jackson's associates had threatened to make her children [...] "disappear" [...] via hot-air balloon. The Arvizos [...] "escaped" [...] Neverland three times (in Rolls-Royces and limos) but were [...] "convinced" [...] to return each time. When the prosecution presented a complicated chart of phone calls between Jackson's [...] "unindicted co-conspirators" [...] trying to show that they were scheming about the Arvizos' captivity, they accidentally proved that Jackson was not even at Neverland for several of the days during the 2 1/2-week time frame given for the alleged molestation and may have been in Miami the day the molestation and conspiracy were alleged to have started.|$|E
