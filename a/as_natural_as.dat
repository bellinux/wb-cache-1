25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue <b>as</b> <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E

In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it <b>as</b> <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look as real as possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look <b>as</b> <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E

Hawkins stated that [...] "we basically played each of these songs 100 different times, trying every little thing every different way" [...] and that it was the first time since The Colour and the Shape [...] "that Dave had to deal with someone in the room questioning all his ideas", given the more laid-back approach of previous producer Nick Raskulinecz. Grohl claimed the choices were for the [...] "most powerful, dramatic songs", and that there was an effort to [...] "make everything sound <b>as</b> <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> possible – just like on the albums we grew up listening to", citing 1970s artists such as Neil Young and Wings as a major influence.

Here I Stand displayed his vocals as [...] "agile" [...] and [...] "balletic", as well as his ability to [...] "easily drift from wavering tenor to fine-tuned falsetto" [...] that create emotions of urgency and burning according to Clover Hope of The Village Voice. Looking For Myself exemplified his craft and earned him positive acclaim as Gawker's Rick Juzwiak says [...] "his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one" [...] with emphasis on his falsetto being [...] "something that sounds <b>as</b> <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> a speaking voice...he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths [...] His emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other". Regarding [...] "Climax", his performance was lauded as [...] "blistering" [...] by Maura Johnston, and [...] "terrific" [...] by Jody Rosen, as he won Best R Performance in 2013.

2500|$|Dropping the fly {{onto the}} water and its {{subsequent}} movement on or beneath the surface is one of fly fishing's most difficult aspects; the angler is attempting to cast {{in such a way}} that the line lands smoothly on {{the water and}} the fly appears <b>as</b> <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> possible. At a certain point, if a fish does not strike, depending upon the action of the fly in the wind or current, the angler picks up the line to make another presentation. On the other hand, if a fish strikes, the angler pulls in line while raising the rod tip. This [...] "sets" [...] the hook in the fish's mouth. The fish is played either by hand, where the angler continues to hold the fly line in one hand to control the tension applied to the fish, or by reeling up any slack in the line and then using the hand to act as a drag on the reel. Most modern fly reels have an adjustable, mechanical drag system to control line tension during a fish's run.|$|E

The choreographer added that the dance sequence was very distinct in that the audience had never seen Rai doing such steps. He went gaga over the lead actress saying that she danced like a dream. Longinus said in an interview that it [...] ".. did not take her long to learn the dance but it did take her some time to perfect it and to get into the mood of the character". In an interview Sanjay Leela Bhansali said that in the song Udi, [...] "..with such few words Sofia manages to say so much. It was my tribute to Waheeda Rahman's character in Guide."In a sequence from the film, Ethan explains Omar, that the first magic he had performed was for his mother. Bhansali said that it is inspired from his childhood days. He said, [...] "I remember my grandmother selling off the last of her silver and storing chillar in large Johnson baby powder tin. Every afternoon she would count that money and put it back. That kurr-kurr of the coins being bought out, counted and put back had to be heard again. The value of those coins doesn't exist anymore but it was an important part of my growing up." [...] Since Roshan's character, Ethan, plays a magician in the initial portion of the film, a Ukrainian magician was hired for teaching him magic tricks, after a long search for a professional magician.
