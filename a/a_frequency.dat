5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining <b>a</b> <b>frequency</b> of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at <b>a</b> <b>frequency</b> of eight trains an hour.|$|E

5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line.

At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them.

5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at <b>a</b> <b>frequency</b> of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|Blue Streak {{service on}} Route 41 began on September 8, 1970, {{traveling}} on local streets between Sand Point, Lake City and Northgate Mall, and proceeding onto Interstate 5 non-stop to Downtown Seattle.

Buses traveled primarily on 3rd Avenue through Downtown, heading northbound during morning inbound trips and southbound during afternoon outbound trips towards Northgate. Buses ran at <b>a</b> <b>frequency</b> of 7 to 15 minutes from 7a.m. to 7p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays. The trip between Northgate and downtown took an average of 15 minutes, and took near-full busloads on the first day.

5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through <b>a</b> <b>frequency</b> converter at one end.|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in <b>a</b> <b>frequency</b> range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz.

Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
