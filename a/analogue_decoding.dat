5000|$|This SCART feature {{had been}} used for {{connection}} to <b>analogue</b> <b>decoding</b> equipment by pay TV operators in Europe, {{and in the past}} was used for connection to teletext equipment before the decoders became built-in. The outgoing signal could be of the same nature as the incoming signal, or RGB component video, or even an [...] "insert" [...] over the original signal, due to the [...] "fast switching" [...] feature of SCART.|$|E
5000|$|The pay TV station Thai Wave started via {{satellite}} in 1996. At the beginning, the station featured Thai video clips from Thailand, {{as well as}} news and soap operas. The station broadcast daily from 8 pm to 4 am. The program was promoted in Europe by THAI WAVE International Broadcasting Co. Ltd., Hauptstr. 100, 76461 Muggensturm, Germany. The use of Thai Wave <b>analogue</b> <b>Decoding</b> from this period was same as Premiere and Canal +, special was the [...] "white key" [...] {{that had to be}} used in decoders to decode the program. After about a year ago, Thai Wave ended operation due to the low demand. The home of the station was in Phaya Thai, a Khet (district) of Bangkok and it was used the studio and program content from Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Channel 5. Later Thai TV Global Network started operation by digital satellite broadcasting.|$|E
40|$|Protein release factors {{act like}} tRNA <b>analogues</b> in <b>decoding</b> {{translational}} stop signals. Statistical {{analysis of the}} sequences at translational stop sites and functional studies with particular signals indicate this mimicry involves {{an increase in the}} length of the signal in the mRNA. The base following the stop codon (+ 4 base) is of particular interest because it has a strong influence on the competitiveness of the stop signal at recoding sites, suggesting it might form part of the release factor recognition element. Site-directed crosslinking from the + 4 base showed that it is in close proximity to the Escherichia coli release factor- 2 in a termination complex, a prerequisite for the + 4 base being part of the recognition element. Fingerprinting analysis indicates that crosslinking to the release factor occurred from both + 1 and + 4 positions of the stop signal in the same RNA molecule. This provides more evidence that the + 4 base may {{be an integral part of}} the decoding signature in the mRNA during the termination phase of protein biosynthesis...|$|R
