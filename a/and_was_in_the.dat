5|$|Aspinall {{was born}} in Prestatyn, North Wales, after {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the family home in Liverpool because of the air-raids on Liverpool during the Second World War, while Aspinall's father was away at sea with the Royal Navy. Aspinall and his mother returned to Liverpool later in 1942 after the bombing had subsided. Aspinall later attended West Derby School, where he passed his 11-Plus exams.

He was educated at Clemes College Hobart, and began an Engineering Degree at the University of Tasmania. He was a keen rower, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bow for the 1925 winning crew in the inter-varsity eights in Brisbane. Aviation called, however, and he entered RAAF Point Cook for pilot {{training}} in 1926, graduating {{at the end of}} the year.

5|$|Crumley {{was born}} in Dundee in 1890, the son of William Ferguson Crumley, a tinsmith. His older brother, Bob Crumley, also played professionally as a goalkeeper, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dundee team that won the 1910 Scottish Cup Final, {{defeating}} Clyde after two replays. The passenger list when he sailed for America in 1912 listed his occupation as that of blacksmith. During the First World War, Crumley joined the Royal Engineers. By mid-1915, he was a section corporal stationed near Dundee, {{and he went to}} reach the rank of sergeant and served in France. He was twice mentioned in despatches, and was wounded and affected by shell shock.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being born}} in Lagos, Nigeria, Odubade {{grew up in}} East Sussex. He {{attended}} The Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne. He began his football career in England, playing in the Sussex County League for Eastbourne Town in 2002. He scored over 70 times in just two seasons at the East Sussex club in all competitions, before attracting the attention of then–Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season, he subsequently joined the club on a one-year contract in July 2004 after a successful trial. He made his debut as a substitute for the Somerset side in a 4–3 defeat against Torquay United in the Football League Trophy in September 2004. He made his second Yeovil appearance in a 3–1 victory away at Histon in an FA Cup tie, scoring his only goal for the club deep into injury-time. He made a further four appearances for the side, before leaving the club in February 2005 due to personal reasons, and subsequently joined Conference South side Eastbourne Borough two days later. Odubade made his Eastbourne Borough debut in the club's 2–0 victory against Basingstoke Town just three days after signing for the club, playing 45 minutes of the match. In the following game, he scored twice as Eastbourne came from back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2–2 at Cambridge City, scoring both goals within the space of five minutes. Odubade made it five goals in his first three games for Eastbourne, as he scored a hat-trick in the club's 4–0 home victory against Thurrock. He also scored Eastbourne's third goal in a 3–1 win in the following game against Newport County, latching onto a long ball and beating the goalkeeper first time. Throughout March 2005, Odubade scored in four consecutive games, netting against Cambridge City, Havant & Waterlooville, Sutton United, and Hayes to take his tally to ten goals for the club. He also provided the assists for two of Eastbourne's goals in a 3–0 win against Redbridge, and scored two goals in late April 2005 against Bishop's Stortford and Weston-Super-Mare respectively. He scored his last goal of the season in Eastbourne's 3–0 away win against Cambridge City in the play-off, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side that lost 2–1 to Altrincham in the final. Odubade made a total of 17 appearances for Eastbourne during the second half of the 2004–05 campaign, scoring 13 times.|$|E

5|$|Few air units or {{anti-aircraft}} batteries {{were stationed}} in the home islands during {{the early months of}} the Pacific War. The General Defense Command (GDC) had been formed in July 1941 to oversee the defense of the home islands, but all combat units in this area were assigned to the four regional military districts (the Northern, Eastern, Central and Western districts) which reported directly to the Ministry of War. As a result, the GDC's functions were limited to coordinating communications between the Imperial General Headquarters—Japan's highest military decision-making body—and the military districts. In early 1942, forces allocated to the defense of Japan comprised 100 Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) and 200 Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) fighter aircraft, many of which were obsolete, as well as 500 Army-manned and 200 IJN anti-aircraft guns. Most of the IJAAF and IJN formations in the home islands were training units which had only a limited ability to counter Allied attacks. The Army also operated a network of military and civilian observation posts to provide warning of air attack <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of building radar stations. Command and control of the air defenses was fragmented, and the IJAAF and IJN did not coordinate their activities or communicate with each other. As a result, the forces were unable to react to a sudden air attack.|$|E
5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E

5|$|Launched in 1906, SS Havana was a {{passenger}} steamer for the Ward Line on the New York–Havana route from 1907-1917.

5|$|Mansur {{fought off}} two {{attempts}} to reinstall Hamdanid {{rule in the}} city, critically aided each time by the powerful Banu Kilab tribe. In return, Mansur promised the Kilab half of the emirate's revenues, but reneged on the agreement. To rid himself of the Kilab, he set a trap for them by inviting hundreds of their tribesmen to a feast only to ambush them. The tribesmen were either killed or imprisoned in the Citadel of Aleppo between 1012 and 1014. By the latter year, one of the Kilabi chieftains, Salih ibn Mirdas, escaped and went to war with Mansur, who was captured. To gain his freedom, he agreed to release all Kilabi prisoners and accord Salih half of the emirate's revenues. He reneged on the latter stipulation, prompting a renewal of conflict with the Kilab, who effectively besieged Aleppo. In 1016, Mansur's citadel commander, Fath al-Qal'i, rebelled in collaboration with Salih and forced Mansur to flee Aleppo. The Byzantine emperor Basil II gave Mansur asylum in Antioch and a fief near the Byzantine–Arab frontier. Afterward, Mansur became a commander of a Byzantine army unit <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entourage of Emperor Romanos III during the Battle of Azaz against Salih's son and successor, Shibl al-Dawla Nasr, in 1030.|$|E

5|$|On 14 and 15 July 1942, {{during the}} First Battle of El Alamein, the {{battalion}} {{was engaged in}} what would {{be known as the}} Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 4th Brigade was to take the western end of the ridge, with Kippenberger's 5th Brigade tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge. The 5th Indian Brigade was allocated to deal with the eastern end. British tanks, in the form of two armoured brigades, were to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack. However, little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades, nor was a clear chain of command established. This would have implications for the outcome of the battle.|$|E

5|$|The prebendary of New Sleaford or Lafford had {{a seat in}} the Lincoln Cathedral; it is {{not known}} when it was established, but it was {{confirmed}} by the Pope in 1146 and 1163, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patronage of the bishop. Sleaford's tithes paid to the prebendary were valued at £11 19s. 7d. (£11.98) in 1616. After the enclosure of Sleaford's fields, a farm at Holdingham Anna was allotted to the prebendary in place of the tithes. The Prebendal Court of Sleaford had jurisdiction over New and Old Sleaford and Holdingham to grant administration and probate. The parishes of New and Old Sleaford were in the peculiar jurisdiction of the predendary until 1846, when they became part of Aswardhurn and Lafford Rural Deanery. In 1866 they were placed in Aswardhurn and Lafford No. 2 Rural Deanery, from 1884 in the Lafford No. 2 Rural Deanery, the Lafford South Rural Deanery from 1910, and since 1968, the Lafford Rural Deanery.|$|E
5|$|When Sodh was {{twenty-two years}} old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his {{hometown}} and was given the Pāli language monastic name Candasaro. Phra (phra meaning 'monk, venerable') Candasaro studied both under masters of the oral meditation tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced meditation every day, {{from the first day}} following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople to offer them food. This hardship led him to resolve that he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season (third year after monk's ordination), Phra Candasaro traveled far and wide in Thailand to study scriptures and meditation practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range of things, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about meditation at eight centers, among which Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization meditation method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in meditation regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya meditation.|$|E
