5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence <b>and</b> <b>flexibility</b> in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Numerical <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> {{functional}} <b>flexibility</b> are the {{two dimensions}} of human resource flexibility. The mixtures of the two dimensions form four models. They are HH model(high functional <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> high numerical <b>flexibility),</b> LL model (low functional <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> low numerical <b>flexibility),</b> LH model(low functional <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> high numerical <b>flexibility)</b> <b>and</b> HL model (high functional <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> low numerical <b>flexibility).</b> The various mixture models differ from firm performance. Principal Component Analysis is used in this paper to find which model contributes much more to firm performance. It is demonstrated that in Chinese firms HL model is more effective for firm performance than other models...|$|R

5|$|Institute Professor is {{the highest}} title that can be awarded to {{a faculty member at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a {{research}} university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It is analogous to the titles of distinguished professor, university professor, or regents professor used at other universities in recognition of a professor's extraordinary research achievements and dedication to the school. At MIT, Institute Professors are granted a unique level of freedom <b>and</b> <b>flexibility</b> to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities; they report only to the provost. Usually no more than twelve professors hold this title at any one time. The position was created by President James R. Killian in 1951 and John C. Slater was the first to hold the position.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness <b>and</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed <b>and</b> <b>flexibility</b> have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E

5|$|The trailer was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director {{and the director of}} the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom <b>and</b> <b>flexibility</b> in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E
5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower <b>and</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{investigate}} the factors enabling or hindering the simultaneous pursuit of volume <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> mix <b>flexibility</b> within a supply chain {{through the lens of}} a manufacturing plant seeking to implement a build-to-order (BTO) strategy. Design/methodology/approach - To accomplish this empirical investigation, an in-depth case study involving a manufacturing plant and its supply chain was designed. Prior to primary and secondary data collection, this research setting had already decided to implement a BTO strategy and had, moreover, carefully assessed several practices for BTO strategy implementation, as well as their interactions. Findings - The studied case suggests that a number of approaches typically used to increase volume flexibility, actually negatively affect mix <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. The existence of such trade-offs may ultimately inhibit the implementation of a BTO strategy and this {{was the case in the}} studied company. Nevertheless, empirical evidence also suggests that, to some extent, volume <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> mix <b>flexibility</b> may be achieved synergistically, as initiatives such as component standardization or component-process interface standardization would improve both volume <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> mix <b>flexibility.</b> Research limitations/implications - The pursuit of volume <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> mix <b>flexibility</b> in implementing a BTO strategy in a specific setting and from primarily an operations management perspective was investigated. As such, the findings can be complemented by viewing the case study results through the lens of other established general management theories or by replicating the study in different research settings. Originality/value - While past research informs us about how manufacturing firms can successfully achieve mix flexibility or volume flexibility, there are few insights for understanding how volume <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> mix <b>flexibility</b> can both be simultaneously achieved within a manufacturing plant and its supply chain. This research fills this gap in the literature and contributes to the development of a theory of BTO strategy implementation, especially in terms of volume <b>flexibility,</b> mix <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> their interactions...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that mindfulness, psychological <b>flexibility,</b> <b>and</b> addiction are interrelated in decision making. In our study, we investigated {{the relationship of the}} behavioral profile, composed of mindfulness <b>and</b> psychological <b>flexibility,</b> <b>and</b> smoking status on delay and probability discounting. We demonstrated the interaction of the behavioral profile of mindfulness <b>and</b> psychological <b>flexibility</b> (lower or higher) and smoking status on delay discounting. We found that individuals who smoked and displayed higher mindfulness <b>and</b> psychological <b>flexibility</b> devalued rewards at a slower rate, compared to smokers with a lower profile. Importantly, in those with a higher profile, smokers discounted rewards no differently than nonsmokers. Smokers with a lower profile did display, however, increased impulsivity, compared to nonsmokers. These results suggest that behavioral interventions aiming to modify the behavioral profile with regard to mindfulness <b>and</b> psychological <b>flexibility</b> can indeed support the regulation of elevated impulsivity in smokers to equate with that of nonsmokers. In probability discounting, we observed that individuals with a higher profile displayed lower discounting rates, i. e., were less risk-averse, with no other significant main effect or interaction...|$|R
