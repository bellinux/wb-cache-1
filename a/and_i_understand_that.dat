25|$|Everyone who meets me {{wants to}} talk about the culture of fear <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> fine, but what I have to be talking about or I wonâ€™t be {{effective}} in this role, is {{what we can do to}} move forward.|$|E
2500|$|Newkirk has {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} {{that no one is}} being exploited, the women taking part are volunteers, and if sexual attraction advances the cause of animals, she is unapologetic. Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: [...] "Somebody has to push the envelope. If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be embarrassing for them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> Our own members write to us sometimes and say, 'Oh why did you do this? I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|..... I {{was sentenced}} {{for the crime}} of {{collaboration}} with terrorism, and I did collaborate with the MRTA. I have never been a leader, nor a militant. I have never participated in acts of violence nor of bloodshed, nor have I killed anyone. And what I would like to clarify here is that I know that my mere participation, {{even though it was}} secondary in one incident, if it contributed to the violence in society, I am deeply sorry and I regret it ... I was in prison for almost 15 years. I have reflected a great deal over it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> violence did harm to society; I understand it and I regret that I participated in it. I believe that things, a better society, are achieved by building and not by destroying ...|$|E
60|$|Then I escaped {{before the}} blessing, {{desiring}} no benediction at such hands. But the persons who listened {{seemed to enjoy}} themselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had met with a popular preacher.|$|R
6000|$|... "To see me here {{under the}} circumstances," [...] put in Leonard bitterly. [...] "Nor {{would you have}} done so, but Tom <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> it was only to be a three days' sale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How is he guarded?" [...] Pierre asked, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> {{even then}} the dear lad was casting {{about in his}} mind for some plan which might promise success in our efforts to release him.|$|R
2500|$|Boll {{does not}} {{shy away from}} his critics. In the Alone in the Dark DVD commentary, he {{responds}} to criticism that his adaptations make significant changes to the plot and style of the source material: [...] "Fans are always totally flipping out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the fan of a video game has his own agenda {{in his head and}} has his ideas about what is a good movie and what is a bad movie." [...] Referring to House of the Dead, Boll said: [...] "I think I made a perfect House of the Dead movie, because it really shows how the game is. It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action." [...] Boll is especially critical of his Internet detractors. Referring to two Ain't It Cool News critics who negatively reviewed his work, Boll said, [...] "Harry (Knowles) and Quint (Eric Vespe) are retards." [...] Boll later claimed Knowles was being [...] "played" [...] by film studios that [...] "kissed his ass" [...] with set visits and pretend offers to produce large-budget films and suggested to Knowles the reason he did not like him was because, [...] "I never kissed your ass, Harry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Theodore {{is going}} with Mr. Fischer. He was invited {{at the last}} moment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> his {{presence}} was specially requested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must bear}} in mind that we have a {{valuable}} secret; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> he lives somewhere in the country we are going through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything is ready, your honor. The {{draft is}} made, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the canoe which got {{in last night}} brought a message {{to say that the}} party already below is looking out for the relief." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} the helpless, gentle, pompous Louis whom my father had once taken me to visit, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> France, after her convulsions and her sufferings, did indeed require another and a {{stronger}} head.|$|R
60|$|It {{was plain}} enough, {{now that the}} old man had spoken of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> we had a bit of {{dredging}} before us in order to make ready for the more important portion of the work.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said that}} a wind was blowing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the shores are sandy, so I suppose that all {{footprints}} would have been filled in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite sure, sir," [...] was the prompt reply. [...] "I am {{acquainted with}} one of the head waiters here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> two gentlemen are expected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not," [...] Beatrice agreed, vexed {{that he did}} {{not seem}} anxious to make the best impression. [...] "After all, {{breaking}} land on a large scale must be expensive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> your plans are ambitious." ...|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Corney {{strapped}} {{his rifle}} on his back, as if believing {{he would have}} no use for it; but he made certain his knife was loose in its sheath, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> if we had trouble {{it would be at}} close quarters.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{tried to}} resign myself. You've always worshipped strength, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> {{you must think}} Alec MacKenzie very wonderful. I had little enough to offer you when I {{compared}} myself with him. I hoped against hope that you weren't in love with him.' ...|$|R
60|$|Both Silas <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Archie {{was the one}} {{who should}} act as {{commander}} of our small expedition, and we obeyed in silence, the skiff darting ahead once she felt the weight of the wind, as if understanding full well the need of speed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{found this}} {{manuscript}} among my father's writings, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> he got them as plunder, at, or after, the fight at Worcester, {{where he served}} as major of ----'s regiment of horse {{on the side of}} the Parliament. I.K." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Charles Tregellis {{is quite}} within his rights," [...] said Craven, firmly. [...] "He {{undertook}} {{to produce a}} man who should be within the age limits stipulated, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Harrison fulfils all the conditions. You are over five-and-thirty, Harrison?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is my ambition! I once {{spent six}} weeks in London, {{and it was an}} {{absolute}} revelation--the opening of another world. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Maurice Mohun is such a clever man, and that you saw a great deal of his friends.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} when I opened my eyes, aroused {{by the old}} negro's voice, so dark that I could not even {{distinguish}} the outlines of my comrade, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> now was come {{the time for the}} venture of bringing Horry Sims to the cabin.|$|R
2500|$|... "Before {{the start}} of the first war in 1994, when the {{occupation}} began <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> war was inevitable, I came here as a patriot. I'm not even sure I knew how to pray properly then. It's ridiculous to say I'm a Wahhabist or a radical Muslim." ...|$|R
60|$|I crept {{a little}} nearer still, {{and at that}} moment he entered the house, a flood of light pouring out through the open door. All was clear for me now <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> not an instant was to be lost. Bending myself double I ran swiftly forward to the lighted window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hartley's dead, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> his {{daughter}} {{has broken down}} after nursing him. It's doubtful whether her situation can be kept open, {{and it may be}} some time before she's strong enough to look for another." [...] He hesitated. [...] "In a way, I feel responsible for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well..." [...] A frigid half-smile {{came and}} went on Bruce Carmyle's dark face. [...] "My cousin has many {{excellent}} qualities, no doubt--he used to play football well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> he is a capable amateur pugilist--but I should not have supposed him entertaining. We find him a little dull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What would My Lord Richard, Prince of England, of {{his poor}} subject?" [...] And then, more gravely, [...] "My Lord, I {{have been raised}} at court, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a prince does not wed rashly, and so let us forget what passed between Bertrade de Montfort and Norman of Torn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{of which}} means what?" [...] Saul demanded, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the lad's heart was heavy, for {{within the hour}} he had been crowded against the wall, and a red-coated captain of the Foot had shaken him soundly {{because he did not}} give way to the swaggerers who had come into Virginia to teach us manners.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have not}} got me yet," [...] Jacob replied, cheerily, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> his courage had been greatly {{stiffened}} {{since the night}} he crept out from the cave. [...] "There's a big powwow goin' on over at St. Leger's camp, an' no one is on guard hereabouts. This is the time when, if ever, you can escape." ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{looked at}} me in pity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{afterward}} <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> there was good reason for his so doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. They haven't {{lost much}} time through our fault, but the frost has {{interfered}} with other jobs, and I expect there'll be trouble if it lasts. I'm puzzled, because they're not a bad-tempered lot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Wilkinson {{is not a}} favorite. Your throwing him down the bank wouldn't strengthen his influence." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Leven and Melville {{portrait}} of Mary, young and charming, and wearing jewels which are found recorded in her Inventories, has hitherto been overlooked. An admirable photogravure {{is given in}} Mr. J. J. Foster's [...] "True Portraiture of Mary, Queen of Scots" [...] (1905), <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a photograph was done in 1866 for the South Kensington Museum.|$|E
60|$|We are twin souls. She has {{thanked me}} again. She has scolded the parrot. She has smiled upon {{me as she}} retires to her room. It is enough. Nothing is said, but I am a man of {{sensibility}} and discernment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{she will not be}} offended if I seek to renew our friendship on a more suitable occasion.|$|E
60|$|Stripped nearly {{naked in}} order that the murderous wolves might see where to strike without inflicting too serious an injury, he faced them with what was very like {{a smile on his}} face, while the blood was already flowing down his body from tiny gashes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> however much of anguish might come to him, never a cry of pain could be rung from his lips.|$|R
60|$|Darius {{had evidently}} {{considered}} the plan well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> nothing would turn him from it unless {{one of us}} flatly refused to carry it into execution, which, considering all the importance of getting information to the commodore, I {{was not prepared to}} do. At the same time, the idea of going back to Nottingham in no better craft than our canoe, was by no means to my liking.|$|R
30|$|I do {{not know}} what second class degree means here. After I read the two axes <b>and</b> title <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it is {{international}} students.|$|R
