5|$|Blizzard Entertainment's use {{of three}} {{distinct}} races in StarCraft is widely credited with revolutionizing the real-time strategy genre. All units <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> their respective races and while rough comparisons {{can be drawn}} between certain types of units in the technology tree, every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed.|$|E

Subspecies of Great Basin pocket mouse, American pika, yellow-pine chipmunk, and yellow-bellied marmot are found nowhere else.

5|$|The shield is {{the core}} of heraldry, but other {{elements}} are placed above, below, and around the shield, and are usually collectively called external ornaments. The entire composition is called the achievement of arms or the armorial bearings. Some of these accessories <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> Church armory or differ notably from those which normally accompany a shield.|$|E
5|$|Two {{derivatives}} of ergosterol {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies of T.plumbeoviolaceus: tylopiol A (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,9(11),22-triene) and tylopiol B (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,22dien-12-one). These sterols <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> this species. Additionally, the compounds ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, uridine, allitol, ergosterol, ergosterol5α,8α-peroside, ergothioneine, adenosine, and uracil have been identified from the mushrooms.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> that account.|$|E
5|$|Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) {{have a more}} {{advanced}} immune system. They have three specialized organs that <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> Chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ {{within the walls of}} their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheres of {{enclosed}} {{environments in}} which 20 m 2 stands of wheat, potato, and lettuce were grown were characterized and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A large number (in excess of 90) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified in the chambers. Twenty eight VOC's were assumed to be of biogenic origin for these were {{not found in the}} chamber atmosphere when air samples were analyzed in the absence of plants. Some of the compounds found <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> a single crop. For example, only 35 % of the biogenic compounds detected in the wheat atmosphere <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> wheat, while 36 % <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> potato and 26 % <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> lettuce. The number of compounds detected in the wheat (20 compounds) atmosphere was greater than that of potato (11) and lettuce (15) and concentration levels of biogenic and non-biogenic VOC's were similar...|$|R

5|$|Grown {{in liquid}} culture, Crucibulum laeve {{produces}} bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed {{the presence of}} additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus. The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa uses {{a set of}} demonstrative pronouns that {{contains}} terms unique to Ottawa, while other words in the set are shared with other Ojibwe dialects. Taken as a group the Ottawa set is distinctive. The following chart shows the demonstrative pronouns for: (a) Wikwemikong, an Ottawa community; (b) Curve Lake, an Eastern Ojibwe community; and (c) Cape Croker, an Ottawa community that uses a mixed pronoun set. The terms maaba 'this (animate)', gonda 'these (animate)', and nonda 'these (inanimate)' <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> sebum and not produced as final products {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E

Some of these <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, {{so that they may}} be found in one place.|$|E

Many of the artefacts <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the Mary Rose and have provided insights into topics ranging from naval warfare to the history of musical instruments. Since the mid-1980s, while undergoing conservation, the remains of the hull have been on display at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. An extensive collection of well-preserved artefacts is on display at the nearby Mary Rose Museum, built to display the reconstructed ship and its artefacts.|$|E

Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E
