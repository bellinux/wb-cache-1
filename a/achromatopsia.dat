5|$|In {{isolated}} {{areas with}} small populations, tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties {{to contribute to}} the founder's effect as survivors repopulate their place. For example, around 1775, a typhoon hit Pingelap Atoll, and in combination with a subsequent famine, reduced the island's population to a low level. Several generations after the disaster, as many as 10% of Pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called <b>achromatopsia.</b> This is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene, which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.|$|E
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (<b>achromatopsia)</b> on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} of incomplete <b>achromatopsia</b> {{are similar to}} those of complete <b>achromatopsia</b> except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete <b>achromatopsia</b> have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.|$|E
25|$|A fourth genetic cause (ACHM5, OMIM 613093) was {{discovered}} in 2009. It is a mutation of gene PDE6C, located on chromosome locus 10, 10q24. It is estimated that less than 2% of <b>achromatopsias</b> are caused by a mutation in this gene.|$|R
25|$|There is {{generally}} no treatment to cure <b>achromatopsia.</b> However, dark red or plum colored filters are {{very helpful in}} controlling light sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|An April paper {{reported}} that gene therapy addressed <b>achromatopsia</b> (color blindness) in dogs by targeting cone photoreceptors. Cone function and day vision were restored {{for at least}} 33 months in two young specimens. The therapy was less efficient for older dogs.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{complete}} inability to see color, individuals with complete <b>achromatopsia</b> {{have a number}} of other ophthalmologic aberrations. Included among these aberrations are greatly decreased visual acuity (<0.1 or 20/200) in daylight, Hemeralopia, nystagmus, and severe photophobia. The fundus of the eye appears completely normal. Also see Pingelap#Color-blindness.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{there is}} some {{research}} on gene therapy for animals with <b>achromatopsia,</b> with positive results on mice and young dogs, but less effectiveness on older dogs. However, no experiments have been made on humans. There are many challenges to conducting gene therapy on humans. See Gene therapy for color blindness for more details about it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Achromatopsia</b> {{has also}} been called rod monochromacy and total {{congenital}} color blindness. Individuals with the congenital form of this condition show complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography at high light levels. There are at least four genetic causes of congenital ACHM, two of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (ACHM2/ACHM3), a third involves the cone photoreceptor transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|The known {{causes of}} the {{congenital}} forms of <b>achromatopsia</b> are all due to malfunction of the retinal phototransduction pathway. Specifically, this form of ACHM seems to result from the inability of cone cells to properly respond to light input by hyperpolarizing. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) {{as well as the}} cone cell transducin, GNAT2 (ACHM4).|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} The Island of the Colorblind Sacks wrote about an island where {{many people have}} <b>achromatopsia</b> (total colourblindness, very low visual acuity and high photophobia). The second section of this book, {{entitled}} Cycad Island, describes the Chamorro people of Guam, who have {{a high incidence of}} a neurodegenerative disease locally known as Lytico-Bodig disease (a devastating combination of ALS, dementia and parkinsonism). Later, along with Paul Alan Cox, Sacks published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the disease, namely the toxin beta-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA) from the cycad nut accumulating by biomagnification in the flying fox bat.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{activation}} by light, rhodopsin {{causes the}} exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) α-transducing activity polypeptide 2 (GNAT2). This causes {{the release of the}} activated α-subunit from the inhibitory β/γ-subunits. This α-subunit then activates a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3 channels. As this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing {{it is not surprising that}} mutations in GNAT2 lead to <b>achromatopsia.</b> The known mutations in this gene, table 3, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, rhodopsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} {{as to whether}} achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in The Island of the Colorblind by Oliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, {{it may be that}} some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. One common trait is hemeralopia or blindness in full sun. In patients with <b>achromatopsia,</b> the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.|$|E
25|$|While some {{mutations}} in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, see table 1, {{at least one}} mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Others include {{the introduction of a}} sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability. When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability. While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to ACHM, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface. Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce <b>achromatopsia.</b> At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{molecular}} pathomechanism of ACHM is either {{the inability to}} properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP. cGMP is particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release. Native retinal CNGs are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in cone cells. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas {{this is not the}} case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability (Na+ vs. K+ and Ca2+), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward rectification, current flickering, and sensitivity to block by L-cis-diltiazem. Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function (often increased affinity for cGMP) of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell transducin, GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the <b>achromatopsia</b> phenotype.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Achromatopsia</b> is a {{relatively}} uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in 30,000 people (0.0033%). However, in the small Micronesian atoll of Pingelap approximately 5% of the atoll's 3000 inhabitants are afflicted. [...] This {{is the result of}} a population bottleneck caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the 1770s, which killed all but about twenty islanders, including one who was heterozygous for <b>achromatopsia.</b> [...] The people of this region have termed <b>achromatopsia</b> [...] "maskun", which literally means [...] "not see" [...] in Pingelapese. This unusual population drew neurologist Oliver Sacks to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, The Island of the Colorblind.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Achromatopsia</b> (ACHM), {{also known}} as total color blindness, is a medical {{syndrome}} that exhibits symptoms relating to at least five conditions. The term may refer to acquired conditions such as cerebral <b>achromatopsia,</b> {{also known as}} color agnosia, but it typically refers to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision condition, the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels (typically exterior daylight). The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. [...] It is estimated to affect 1 in 40,000 live births worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> {{is a form}} of {{acquired}} color blindness that {{is caused}} by damage to the cerebral cortex of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's retina. [...] It is most frequently caused by physical trauma, hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth.|$|E
2500|$|For {{those with}} certain color deficiencies, a red-tinted [...] "X-Chrom" [...] contact lens may be used. Although such a lens does not restore normal color vision, it allows some color-blind people to {{distinguish}} colors better. Red-filtering contact lenses {{can also be}} an option for extreme light sensitivity in some visual deficiencies such as <b>achromatopsia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cerebral <b>achromatopsia,</b> {{also known}} as Color agnosia, is a category-specific {{semantic}} impairment pertaining to semantic color associations, such that individuals retain perceptual abilities for distinguishing color, demonstrated through color categorization or hue perception tasks; however knowledge of typical color-object relationships is defective. [...] Color agnostics are assessed on performance coloring {{in black and white}} images of common items or identifying abnormally colored objects within a set of images. [...] For example, a color agnostic may not identify a blue banana as being improperly colored.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{converging}} {{evidence suggests}} modularity for color. Beginning with Gowers’ finding [...] that {{damage to the}} fusiform/lingual gyri in occipitotemporal cortex correlates with a loss in color perception (<b>achromatopsia),</b> {{the notion of a}} [...] "color centre" [...] in the primate brain has had growing support. Again, such clinical evidence only implies that this region is critical to color perception, and nothing more. Other evidence, however, including neuroimaging and physiology converges on V4 as necessary to color perception. A recent meta-analysis has also shown a specific lesion common to achromats corresponding to V4. From another direction altogether it has been found that when synaesthetes experience color by a non-visual stimulus, V4 is active. On the basis of this evidence it would seem that color processing is modular. However, as with motion processing it is likely that this conclusion is inaccurate. Other evidence shown in Table 3 implies different areas’ involvement with color. It may thus be more instructive to consider a multistage color processing stream from the retina through to cortical areas including at least V1, V2, V4, PITd and TEO. Consonant with motion perception, {{there appears to be a}} constellation of areas drawn upon for color perception. In addition, V4 may have a special, but not exclusive, role. For example, single cell recording has shown that only V4 cells respond to the color of a stimuli rather than its waveband, whereas other areas involved with color do not.|$|E

5000|$|Cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> is {{a medical}} {{disorder}} characterized by the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity in high light levels. Congenital <b>achromatopsia</b> is characterized the same way, however it is genetic, while Cerebral <b>Achromatopsia</b> {{occurs as a result}} of damage to certain parts of the brain. One part of the brain that is particularly integral to color discrimination is the inferior temporal gyrus. A 1995 study conducted by Heywood et al. was meant to highlight the parts of the brain that are important in <b>achromatopsia</b> in monkeys, however, it obviously sheds light on the areas of the brain related to <b>achromatopsia</b> in humans. In the study, one group of monkeys (group AT) received lesions in the temporal lobe anterior to V4 and the other group (group MOT) received lesions to the occipito-temporal area that corresponds in cranial location to the lesion that produces cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> in humans. The study concluded that group MOT had no impairment of their color vision while the subjects in group AT all had severe impairments to their color vision, consistent with humans diagnosed with cerebral <b>achromatopsia.</b> [...] This study shows that temporal lobe areas anterior to V4, which includes the inferior temporal gyrus, play a large role in patients with Cerebral <b>Achromatopsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} {{where a person}} is unable to see colour, {{but they are still}} able to recognize shape and form. Cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> differs from congenital <b>achromatopsia</b> in that it is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex as opposed to abnormalities in the retinal cells. The search for the colour centre was motivated by the discovery that lesions in the ventral occipital lobe led to colour blindness, as well as the idea that there are area specializations in the cortex. Many studies have shown that lesions in the areas commonly identified as the colour centre, such as V1, V2, and the V4-complex lead to <b>achromatopsia.</b> Cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> occurs after injury to the lingual or fusiform gyrus, the areas associated with hV4. These injuries include physical trauma, stroke, and tumour growth. One of the primary initiatives to locating the colour centre in the visual cortex is to discover the cause and a possible treatment of cerebral <b>achromatopsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} tests perform to {{diagnose}} cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> are the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, the Ishihara plate test, and the color-naming test. Testing and diagnosis for cerebral <b>achromatopsia</b> is often incomplete and misdiagnosed in doctor’s offices.|$|E
