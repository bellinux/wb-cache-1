50|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{for such a}} possible interaction between media coverage and latent anti-Muslim feelings is mounting. One study that analyzed Fox News viewers' anti-Muslim feelings reported, for example, that 60% of Republicans who most trusted Fox News also believe that Muslims were attempting to establish Sharia law in the United States. And <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> earlier, those trusting Fox News the most also {{tend to believe that}} Islamic values are incompatible with American values (68%).

Albeit mortality and renal survival have improved with antihypertensive therapy, progression to end-stage renal disease remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

This is a surgical complication not previously described in the literature {{for this type of}} prosthesis design. Resurfacing humeral head implant has been noted as a useful treatment for glenohumeral arthropathies, also in elderly people, with a very low incidence of complications.

In this case, the total profit for the whole market under cooperation is never lower than under competition, and so the airline and the HSR have incentives to cooperate.|$|E
30|$|We also {{attempted}} to do correction in an experiment with real face data. However, we found that correction actually decreases the verification performance. This can be explained with the error in the data model we use <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> in [31]. The smaller eigenvalues are particularly affected by the modeling error. Since eigenvalue correction will increase these smaller eigenvalues, it can explain why the performance actually decreases.|$|E

30|$|Measurements of the uPA and tPA {{activity}} and antigen in BAL were done using ELISAs (Molecular Innovations, Novi, MI) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Fibrinolytic activity in BAL was analyzed <b>as</b> <b>we</b> previously <b>reported</b> [10]. BAL fluids (0.1  mL) were added over a FITC-fibrin film, which was pre-formed in the 96 -well plate, and supplemented with 100  nM of human Glu-plasminogen. Fibrinolytic activity was monitored by fluorescence emission at 510  nm (excitation 490  nm) with time. Plasminogen activation assays were performed as previously described [10].

30|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> {{previously}} [6], group 1 and 2 metal cations obstruct the adsorption of cesium ions onto charcoal from aqueous solution. Thus, {{the concentrations}} of potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which are detected as major elements among the metals contained in OC or AC, in the liquid phase of the sample suspensions were determined. Although sodium was undetectable by X-ray fluorescence analysis, its concentrations were also measured because ordinary biochar would contain {{a certain amount of}} sodium [7, 8].|$|E
30|$|The {{clinical}} {{impact of}} IF on patient health outcome is not certain, and discussion is open [15], {{but it is}} worth remembering that an incidental finding may, at times, be more significant than the suspected disease that prompted imaging. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported,</b> the majority of {{findings in this study}} were classified as C-RADS E 2 and, as such, were clinically not relevant. However, the structured approach led us to detect C-RADS E 3 and E 4 findings in 16.5  % of the patients.|$|E

30|$|The {{interest}} of endovascular therapies to improve survival rate and functional outcome remains speculative [14, 22, 23]. If the recanalization of thrombosed profound vessels sounds a reasonable goal {{to obtain a}} good outcome [24 – 26] as observed in our study, it is not clearly demonstrated yet. The ongoing randomized clinical trial (TO-ACT) comparing thrombolysis (with or without thrombosuction) + heparin therapy vs. heparin alone will perhaps answer this question [27]. Decompressive craniectomy plus thrombolysis could be associated in the most severe cases, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>report</b> in the case Additional file 4 [28, 29].|$|R

30|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> {{previously}} [13], transformed B-SWCNT cells displayed aberrant p 53 signaling, increased aggressiveness, apoptosis resistance, anchorage-independent growth, angiogenicity, and in vivo xenograft tumor formation {{compared to}} unexposed passage control cells. These findings suggested the potential carcinogenicity of B-SWCNT cells. The present transcriptomic analysis and supporting data also indicate aberrant p 53 signaling, pAkt, Ras, Notch 1, and altered intrinsic mitochondrial pathway signaling as potential mechanisms for SWCNT carcinogenicity. This {{is consistent with}} the previous observations that most human cancers possess p 53 tumor suppressor gene inactivation resulting in dysfunctional signaling contributing to tumorigenesis [43, 44].|$|E

30|$|Other {{proteins}} with {{altered expression}} due to early EAU were calretinin, mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, and malate dehydrogenase; we found decreased levels of calretinin, {{increased levels of}} mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, and decreased levels of malate dehydrogenase when compared to controls. These findings suggest mitochondrial dysfunction during early EAU. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> in an earlier study, damaged or altered mtDNA is a primary target for oxidative damage [7]. mtDNA damage causes amplification of oxidative stress by decreasing the expression of essential proteins for electron transport like malate dehydrogenase, leading to reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysregulation which will eventually cause apoptosis.|$|E
30|$|For {{evaluating}} the coagulation performace of the synthesized products, they were tested {{according to a}} standard protocol which was previously used in other works (Beltrán-Heredia et al. 2011 a, b, c, d, e, f). 100 mL of a sample of a known concentration of each contaminant was introduced in a 0.5 -L beaker. Subsequently, 1.5 mL of the corresponding coagulant was added and the Jar Test apparatus (JLT 4, Velp Scientifica) was programmed to 100 rpm for 2 min, 30 rpm for 60  min. The coagulation process is over after these periods <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> in previous papers (Beltrán-Heredia et al. 2010).|$|E
30|$|During treatment, we also {{observed}} that some small particles and tiny gas bubbles were released from anode to cathode, respectively.

Based on the half reaction potential of related species (Lide 2006), we speculate that hydrogen peroxide was generated by the reduction reaction of the oxygen in the solution. It will be interesting to further characterize these reactions and link the electrochemical reactions products to the killing effects. This is part of our ongoing work.|$|E
