5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day.

As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E

5|$|Albert Payson Terhune was an {{established}} newspaperman and <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> books in various genresincluding histories and thrillerswhen he penned his first canine short story, His Mate. Ray Long, then editor for Red Book Magazine, had jokingly suggested he {{write a story}} about Lad one afternoon, when the reticent dog put his head on Long's knee after having snubbed the familiar visitor for the last year. Having already tried to market the idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years, Terhune readily agreed. The first story featured three rough collies, Lad, Lady, and Knave, and used a similar formula to his previous works: an average male (Lad) protects a beautiful female (Lady) from a larger villain (Knave). Long purchased the work for Red Book for $200 and {{it was published in}} the January 1916 issue. Four magazines requested similar stories, and Terhune complied, finding them easy to write and sell. Additional stories, all featuring Lad and titled Lad Stories, were published in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, Hartford Courant, and the Atlantic Monthly, though Red Book remained his most consistent publisher. By 1918, the stories had grown in popularity and Terhune was paid an average of $1000 each for the tales, with some selling for as much as $2,500,. Though marketed as fiction, even people who were acquainted with the Terhunes and Lad reportedly believed that the stories were real.|$|E

Many of his former students became Methodist ministers who returned to their congregations and annual conferences to work for better treatment of African-Americans, helping the Southern Methodist church to evolve from a mainstay of theological and racial intransigence to an agent for social change and doctrinal reform.|$|E
