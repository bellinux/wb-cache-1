500|$|Much of Janáček's work {{displays}} great originality and individuality. It {{employs a}} vastly expanded view of tonality, uses unorthodox chord spacings and structures, and often, modality: [...] "there is no music without key. Atonality abolishes definite key, and thus tonal modulation....Folksong knows of no atonality." [...] Janáček features accompaniment figures and patterns, with (according to Jim Samson) [...] "the on-going {{movement of his}} music...similarly achieved by unorthodox means; often a discourse of short, 'unfinished' phrases comprising constant repetitions of short motifs which gather momentum in a cumulative manner." [...] Janáček named these motifs [...] "sčasovka" [...] in his theoretical works. [...] "Sčasovka" [...] has no strict English equivalent, but John Tyrrell, <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>specialist</b> on Janáček's music, describes it as [...] "a little flash of time, almost a kind of musical capsule, which Janáček often used in slow music as tiny swift motifs with remarkably characteristic rhythms {{that are supposed to}} pepper the musical flow." [...] Janáček's use of these repeated motifs demonstrates a remote similarity to minimalist composers (Sir Charles Mackerras called Janáček [...] "the first minimalist composer").|$|E

2500|$|The {{degree of}} the {{responsibility}} of the Ottoman government and whether the genocide had a systematic nature {{has been the subject of}} different scholarly opinions. Concerning {{the responsibility of the}} Ottoman government, Hilmar Kaiser wrote that Talaat Pasha ordered the deportations of the Assyrians in the area on 26 October 1914, fearing their collaboration with the advancing Russian troops, but the order was postponed and abandoned three days later due to a lack of forces. When the Assyrians did not collaborate with Russians, any plans to deport them were cancelled. Kaiser wrote that the massacres of Assyrians were apparently not a part of the official Ottoman policy and that the Assyrians were ordered to be treated differently from the Armenians. Taner Akçam, <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>specialist</b> in the Armenian Genocide, cites Ottoman official correspondence in 1919, inquiring the number and conditions of Assyrians deported, to state that the Ottoman government was unaware of the full numerical extent of the deportations of Assyrians. Another Ottoman document orders Assyrians to be detained in their present locations, instead of their deportation, which, according to Akçam, indicates that the Assyrian population could have been treated differently from the Armenians, but that they were often [...] "eliminated" [...] alongside them. Donald Bloxham, a genocide scholar, stated that while Assyrians of western Persia, Hakkari, Bitlis, Van and Diarbekir were massacred along with Armenians, they were [...] "not subject to the same systematic destruction".|$|E
