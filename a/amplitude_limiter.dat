40|$|Adopting {{an exact}} {{solution}} to four-wave mixing (FWM), wherein harmonic evolution {{is described by}} the sum of two Bessel functions, we identify two causes of amplitude to phase noise conversion which impair FWM saturation based amplitude regenerators: self-phase modulation (SPM) and Bessel-order mixing (BOM). By increasing the pump to signal power ratio, we may arbitrarily reduce their impact, realising a phase preserving amplitude regenerator. We demonstrate the technique by applying it to the regeneration of a 10 GBaud QPSK signal, achieving {{a high level of}} amplitude squeezing with minimal amplitude to phase noise conversion.

30|$|With DDST, with {{or without}} symbol level <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter,</b> the {{complexity}} increase compared to traditional TDMT training can be approximated by {{the complexity of the}} SISO decoder used. In the soft feedback loop with DDST, {{with or without}} symbol level <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter,</b> the SISO decoder is dominating the detection complexity. Thus, the average increase in the detection complexity compared to TDMT, is roughly the average number of feedback iterations times the number of blocks decoded in average in each feedback iteration times the average complexity of decoding one block in the SISO decoder.

30|$|Here we {{remind the}} reader, that even without symbol level <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter,</b> {{we have to}} use {{iterative}} detection algorithm for the cyclic mean estimation. Of course, the limiter error estimation is not required. Therefore, in the simulation results presented in Section 7, the throughput results obtained with DDST also include five feedback iterations.|$|E
30|$|As expected, {{based on}} the PP and PAPR analysis, we can reach {{significantly}} lower OBO when using limited DDST with QPSK constellation. With 16 -QAM constellation we can decrease the OBO somewhat with symbol level limiter.

30|$|Now {{we have an}} {{amplitude}} limited symbol sequence whose PP {{is limited}} to the same value as the original data symbol sequence d. The average power decrease, and the remaining PAPR increase, depends on the constellation. This kind of <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter,</b> which keeps the argument difference between input and output as a constant, realizes so-called amplitude-modulation to amplitude-modulation (AM-AM) conversion [10], meaning that |L(s(k))| depends only on |s(k)|.|$|E
30|$|In the {{receiver}} side, {{we have a}} simple feedback loop based on soft symbol estimates, which we use to estimate the missing cyclic mean and the limited amplitudes. In [8], we studied the symbol level PAPR and used an iterative receiver structure without any knowledge of the error generated by the symbol level <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter</b> in the transmitter. In this article we will utilize the scaling information available based on Gaussian modeling of the data-dependent pilot sequence (cyclic mean) in the channel estimator.|$|E
30|$|With the {{proposed}} symbol level <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter</b> we can obtain improved spectral efficiency performance with QPSK modulation in all antenna configurations. With 16 -QAM or 64 -QAM modulations, LDDST and DDST have {{quite the same}} performance. Possibly, one could improve the LDDST performance with higher order modulations by tighter limiting bounds. In addition, by first performing tighter limiting and after that removing the cyclic mean, we could decrease the limiter error effect in the channel estimation and possibly improve the system performance. These topics are left for future studies.|$|E

30|$|In a {{wireless}} channel, a signal propagates {{over a number}} of different paths that give rise to a frequency-selective fading, which produce severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) and degrades the transmission performance [1]. To solve this problem, intensive research effort on frequency domain channel equalization (FDE) is currently ongoing in two directions: (i) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [2], and (ii) single carrier (SC)-FDE [3]. To avoid the performance degradation of OFDM due to high PAPR, the high transmit power amplifier (HPA) must be operated with a large input backoff (IBO). Otherwise, the system performance in terms of the bit error rate (BER), channel capacity, throughput, etc., may be degraded. The performance of OFDM system over a nonlinear channel (e.g., HPA or <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter)</b> has been analyzed in the recent literature [4 – 6].|$|E
30|$|The {{increase}} in the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is a well known but not sufficiently addressed problem with data-dependent superimposed training (DDST) based approaches for channel estimation and synchronization in digital communication links. In this article, we concentrate on the PAPR analysis with DDST and on the spectral regrowth with a nonlinear amplifier. In addition, a novel Gaussian distribution model based on the multinomial distribution for the cyclic mean component is presented. We propose {{the use of a}} symbol level <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter</b> in the transmitter together with a modified channel estimator and iterative data bit estimator in the receiver. We show that this setup efficiently reduces the regrowth with the DDST. In the end, spectral efficiency comparison between time domain multiplexed training and DDST with or without symbol level limiter is provided. The results indicate improved performance for DDST based approaches with relaxed transmitter power amplifier requirements.|$|E

In Section 5, we concentrate on the symbol level PP and PAPR, on the PP and PAPR after the transmit pulse shape filtering, and show that the symbol level limiter can remove the PP increase and effectively reduce the PAPR. In addition, we discuss the spectral re-growth related to different training methods. In the Section 6, we provide improved iterative receiver algorithms taking into consideration the <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter</b> in the transmitter {{and the removal of}} the data dependent pilots.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a broadband energy harvester {{working on the}} principle of contact electrification or triboelectric charging. Design and fabrication of the device have been dis-cussed. The device uses contact and separation mechanism using a cantilever to generate triboelectric charges. This mechanism introduces nonlinearity in the cantilever, which results in broad-band behavior of triboelectric energy harvester. The device uses SU- 8 micropillar arrays to enhance the triboelectric charging. A study is conducted to study the effect of the micropillar sizes on the power output of devices. The devices were tested at different acceleration levels. The peak power output achieved is 0. 91 µW at an acceleration of 1 g. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiter</b> based design of the energy harvester enables broadening of operating bandwidth as the acceleration level increases. A maximum operating bandwidth of 22. 05 Hz was observed at 1. 4 g increasing from an operating bandwidth of 9. 43 Hz at 0. 4 g.
