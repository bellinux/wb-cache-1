50|$|Fundal height, or McDonald's rule, is {{a measure}} of the size of the uterus used to assess fetal growth and {{development}} during pregnancy. It is measured from the top of the mother's uterus to the top of the mother's pubic symphysis. Fundal height, when expressed in centimeters, roughly corresponds to gestational <b>age</b> <b>in</b> <b>weeks</b> between 16 and 36 weeks for a vertex fetus. When a tape measure is unavailable, finger widths are used to estimate centimeter (week) distances from a corresponding anatomical landmark. However, landmark distances from the pubic symphysis are highly variable depending on body type. In clinical practice, recording the actual fundal height measurement from the palpable top of the uterus to the superior edge of the pubic symphysis is standard practice beginning around 20 weeks gestation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Reproductive {{engineering}} techniques, such as {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) and cryopreservation of embryos or spermatozoa, are essential for preservation, reproduction, and transportation of genetically engineered mice. However, {{it has not yet}} been elucidated whether these techniques can be applied for the generation of genome-edited mice using engineered nucleases such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of frozen oocytes fertilized in vitro using frozen sperm for TALEN-mediated genome editing in mice. We examined side-by-side comparisons concerning sperm (fresh vs. frozen), fertilization method (mating vs. IVF), and fertilized oocytes (fresh vs. frozen) for the source of oocytes used for TALEN injection; we found that fertilized oocytes created under all tested conditions were applicable for TALEN-mediated mutagenesis. In addition, we investigated whether the <b>ages</b> <b>in</b> <b>weeks</b> of parental female mice can affect the efficiency of gene modification, by comparing 5 -week-old and 8 – 12 -week-old mice as the source of oocytes used for TALEN injection. The genome editing efficiency of an endogenous gene was consistently 95 – 100 % when either 5 -week-old or 8 – 12 -week-old mice were used with or without freezing the oocytes. Thus, our report describes the availability of freeze-thawed oocytes and oocytes from female mice at various weeks of age for TALEN-mediated genome editing, thus boosting the convenience of such innovative gene targeting strategies...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study includes 100 normal singleton gestations between 10 to 40 weeks of gestation referred to our centre for routine antenatal ultrasound examination. All the women were evaluated by transabdominal ultrasonography. Foetal gestational <b>age</b> <b>in</b> <b>weeks</b> was determined by crown rump length, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femoral length. Placental thickness was measured in millimeters. All the placentae were graded using ultrasonographic grading system.

The aim of this prospective study was to estimate comparatively the renal growth in SGA infants and in infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) during the first 2 years of life. Methods. The study comprised groups of SGA and AGA infants with a gestational age (GA) of 36 – 41 weeks. The SGA group was classified into two subgroups of symmetrical and asymmetrical neonates according to the ponderal index. Serial renal ultra-sonography (US) was performed at the ages of 41 <b>weeks</b> corrected <b>age</b> [GA (<b>in</b> <b>weeks)</b> plus <b>age</b> after birth (<b>in</b> <b>weeks)</b> ] and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of chronological age and kidney length (KL) was related to other anthropometric indices. Results. A total of 312 infants {{participated in the study}} out of which 197 were SGA, and a total number of 802 measurements were performed. The symmetrical SGA infants and, to a lesser degree, the asymmetrical SGA infants had smaller kidneys at birth compared with the AGA infants (P< 0. 0001 and P< 0. 001, respectively). The symmetrical SGA infants had a lower body weight (BW) (P< 0. 001, P< 0. 01) and crown-heel length (CHL) (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) than controls at the ages of 12 and 24 months of chronological age. The asymmetrical SGA infants had a lower BW (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) than controls at the ages of 12 and 24 months of chronological age. On the contrary, the KL in both SGA groups was not {{different from that of the}} AGA infants after the 41 st week of corrected age and up to the 2 nd year of life. Conclusion. SGA term infants had shorter KL at birth compared with AGA infants but a similar length from the 3 rd to the 24 th month of life. Early catch-up kidney growth was observed in both SGA groups and is more prominent in the symmetrical SGA infants.

We assayed recombination across a 40 Kb region of Drosophila pseudoobscura chromosome 2, with one 20 kb interval assayed every 5 Kb and the adjacent 20 kb interval bisected into 10 kb pieces. We found that recombination events across the 40 kb stretch were relatively evenly distributed across each of the 5 kb and 10 kb intervals, rather than concentrated in a single 5 kb region. This, in combination with other recent work, indicates that the recombination landscape of Drosophila may differ from the punctate recombination pattern observed in many mammals and yeast.

On September 14, {{two days after the}} loss to the Jaguars, the Broncos {{acquired}} running back Laurence Maroney in a trade from the New England Patriots (for a 2011 fourth-round selection). <b>In</b> <b>Week</b> 2, the Broncos cruised to a relatively easy 31-14 win against the Seattle Seahawks, in the team's home opener. On September 20, just a day after the win over the Seahawks, tragedy struck the Broncos organization, when wide receiver Kenny McKinley was found dead in his Centennial, Colorado home of an apparent suicide, at the <b>age</b> of 23. <b>In</b> <b>Week</b> 3, the Broncos lost 27-13 at home to the Indianapolis Colts. Kyle Orton threw for a career-high 476 yards, but the Broncos were plagued by red-zone miscues. <b>In</b> <b>Week</b> 4, the Broncos rallied for a 26-20 win at the Tennessee Titans. <b>In</b> <b>Week</b> 5, the Broncos lost 31-17 to the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium, a venue that has been none too kind to the Broncos. <b>In</b> <b>Week</b> 6, the Broncos suffered a heartbreaking 24-20 loss at home to the Jets, aided by a costly pass interference penalty on safety Renaldo Hill that enabled the Jets to rally for the win in the game's final two minutes. <b>In</b> <b>Week</b> 7, the Broncos were annihilated 59-14 at home by the Raiders for their worst loss since 1963. <b>In</b> <b>Week</b> 8, the Broncos lost 24-16 to the 49ers. The game was played at Wembley Stadium in London, as part of the International Series.|$|R
40|$|Animal {{models of}} ischemic stroke often neglect {{comorbidities}} common in patients. This study shows {{the feasibility of}} inducing stroke by 2 [*]h of thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> (56 <b>week</b> old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with both acute (2 weeks) and chronic (36 weeks) diabetes. After modifying the streptozotocin dosing regimen to ensure that old SHRs survived the induction of diabetes, few died after induction of stroke. Induction of stroke is feasible in rats with multiple comorbidities. Inclusion of such comorbid animals may improve translation from the research laboratory to the clinic...|$|R
40|$|A {{microcomputer}} {{program was}} developed to compute the expected data of confinement (EDC) and to record the clinical parameters used in its calculation. In obstetrical care, {{it is important to}} establish the EDC. However, the last menstrual period on which the EDC is usually determined may be unknown, inaccurate or disagree with other clinical estimators of the gestational age. Useful predictions of the EDC can be derived from a number of clinical examinations. The program can be used to maintain a register from which the EDC is calculated by averaging the EDCs estimated from up to 19 parameters. The result is also displayed as the gestation <b>age</b> <b>in</b> number of <b>weeks.</b> The register containing information on a large number of pregnancies can be used to calculate the dispersion of estimated EDCs from the various clinical methods. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
