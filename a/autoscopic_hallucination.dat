40|$|Autoscopic phenomenon, {{a psychic}} illusionary {{duplication}} of one’s own self, {{has been the}} subject of interest in the literature and science for years. It has been reported in various diseases of the central nervous system but with an unknown mechanism. Hallucinations are a common presentation in alcohol dependence syndrome during delirium tremens and as induced disorder. However, <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination</b> has been rarely reported in the cases of alcohol dependence. We present a case of a 40 -year-old man who experienced <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination</b> during the withdrawal state of alcohol. He was successfully treated with detoxification and an antipsychotic medication and was doing well. The case highlights the need for strong suspicion and exploration of the <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination</b> and autoscopic phenomenon in general in cases of alcohol dependence syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} in cognitive neuroscience using virtual reality, robotic technology and brain imaging has linked self-consciousness to the processing {{and integration of}} multisensory bodily signals. This work on bodily self-consciousness has implicated the temporo-parietal, premotor and extrastriate cortex and partly originated in work on neurological patients with different disorders of bodily self-consciousness. One class of such disorders is autoscopic phenomena, which are defined as illusory own-body perceptions, during which patients experience the visual illusory reduplication of their own body in extrapersonal space. Three main forms of autoscopic phenomena have been defined. During autoscopic hallucinations, a second own body is seen without any changes in bodily self-consciousness. During out-of-body experiences, the second own body is seen from an elevated perspective and location associated with disembodiment. During heautoscopy, subjects report strong self-identification with the second own body, often associated {{with the experience of}} existing at and perceiving the world from two places at the same time. Although it has been proposed that each autoscopic phenomenon is associated with different impairments of bodily self-consciousness, past research on neurological patients and the development of experimental paradigms for the study of bodily self-consciousness has focused on out-of-body experiences and the association with temporo-parietal cortex. Here, we performed quantitative lesion analysis in the—to date—largest group of patients with <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination</b> and heautoscopy and compared the location of brain damage with those of control patients suffering from complex visual hallucinations. We found that heautoscopy was associated with lesions to the left posterior insula, and that autoscopic hallucinations were associated with damage to the right occipital cortex. <b>Autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination</b> and heautoscopy were further associated with distinct symptoms and deficits. The present data suggest that the <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination</b> is a visuo-somatosensory deficit implicating extrastriate cortex and is, despite the visual hallucination of the own body, not associated with major deficits in bodily self-consciousness. Based on the symptoms and deficits in patients with heautoscopy and the implication of the left posterior insula, we suggest that abnormal bodily self-consciousness during heautoscopy is caused by a breakdown of self-other discrimination regarding affective somatosensory experience due to a disintegration of visuo-somatosensory signals with emotional (and/or interoceptive) bodily signals. These brain mechanisms are distinct from those described for out-of-body experiences. The present data extend previous models of autoscopic phenomena and provide clinical evidence for the importance of emotional and interoceptive signal processing in the posterior insula in relation to bodily self-consciousnes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Autoscopic {{phenomena}} are psychic illusory visual experiences {{consisting of}} {{the perception of the}} image of one's own body or face within space, either from an internal point of view, as in a mirror or from an external point of view. Descriptions based on phenomenological criteria distinguish six types of autoscopic experiences: <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination,</b> he-autoscopy or heautoscopic proper, feeling of a presence, out of body experience, negative and inner forms of autoscopy. Methods and results We report a case of a patient with he-autoscopic seizures. EEG recordings during the autoscopic experience showed a right parietal epileptic focus. This finding confirms the involvement of the temporo-parietal junction in the abnormal body perception during autoscopic phenomena. We discuss and review previous literature on the topic, as different localization of cortical areas are reported suggesting that out of body experience is generated in the right hemisphere while he-autoscopy involves left hemisphere structures. </p...|$|E
40|$|Autoscopic {{phenomena}} {{are complex}} illusory percep-tions of one's body during which human subjects expe-rience a second own body or double in their environ-ment. Autoscopic phenomena most commonly refer to-visual doubles, although doubles {{may also be}} felt or heard and consist of <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> out-of-body experiences, and heautoscopy. Recently, many neurological reports have focussed on out-of-body experiences.

40|$|Autoscopy is the {{experience}} of seeing an image of one's body in external space. We describe {{the case of a}} patient who reported longstanding <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> following post-eclamptic brain damage. The MR scan demonstrated damage involving the occipital cortex and the basal ganglia bilaterally. We hypothesize that the image was the result of aberrant plasticity mechanisms involving cortical areas that {{play a central role in}} high-order body or representation of oneself...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Self-face {{hallucination}} (<b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination</b> or AH) {{has been}} reported in patients with widespread brain damage or retrospectively after epileptic seizures. The neural basis and the self-processing operations underlying AH remain unknown. Methods: Wereport the results of intracerebral electrical stimulations of the rightmedial occipitoparietal cortex (right precuneus and occipitoparietal sulcus) in 2 patients with epilepsy who underwent a stereo- EEG. Results: Immediately after the onset of the stimulation, the 2 patients reported seeing their current own face, facing themselves, in their left visual field. Conclusions: Our study shows that the medial occipitoparietal junction has a key role in generating AH. This region has been shown to have a central role in various self-processing operations and especially in self-face recognition. Our observations further reveal that this region is involved in a visual representation of our own face, which is generated during the pathologic phenomenon of AH. This visual representation of our own facemay be useful for self-face recognition and social cognition processes involving judgment of self-facial resemblance to others...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBody {{ownership}} and embodiment are two fundamental mechanisms of self-consciousness. The present article reviews neurological data about paroxysmal illusions during which body {{ownership and}} embodiment are affected differentially: autoscopic phenomena (out-of-body experience, heautoscopy, <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination,</b> feeling-of-a-presence) {{and the room}} tilt illusion. We suggest that autoscopic phenomena and room tilt illusion are related to different types of failures to integrate body-related information (vestibular, proprioceptive and tactile cues) {{in addition to a}} mismatch between vestibular and visual references. In these patients, altered body ownership and embodiment has been shown to occur due to pathological activity at the temporoparietal junction and other vestibular-related areas arguing for a key importance of vestibular processing. We also review the possibilities of manipulating body ownership and embodiment in healthy subjects through exposition to weightlessness as welt as caloric and galvanic stimulation of the peripheral, vestibular apparatus. In healthy subjects, disturbed self-processing might be related to interference of vestibular stimulation with vestibular cortex leading to disintegration of bodily information and altered body ownership and embodiment. We finally propose a differential contribution of the vestibular cortical areas to the different forms of altered body ownership and embodiment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|International audienceThis {{review article}} {{summarizes}} neuropsychological descriptions of abnormal body representations in brain-damaged patients and recent neuroscientific investigations of their sensorimotor underpinnings in healthy participants. The {{first part of}} the article describes unilateral disorders of the bodily self, such as asomatognosia, feelings of amputation, supernumerary phantom limbs and somatoparaphrenia, as well as descriptions of non-lateralized disorders of the bodily self, including Alice in Wonderland syndrome and <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Because the sensorimotor mechanisms of these disorders are unclear, we focus on clinical descriptions and insist on the importance of reporting clinical cases to better understand the full range of bodily disorders encountered in neurological diseases. The second part of the article presents the advantages of merging neuroscientific approaches of the bodily self with immersive virtual reality, robotics and neuroprosthetics to foster the understanding of the multisensory, motor and neural mechanisms of bodily representations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Under normal conditions, human {{subjects}} experience the self within the lim-its {{of the physical}} body {{and the limits of}} the present time. This uni¯ed experience of the self in space and time has been challenged by philosophers and physicists. The spatial unity between self and body has also been challenged by a well de¯ned group of experi-ences called phenomena " (AP), during which subjects have the impression of seeing a second own body in extrapersonal space. Yet, with respect to the three main forms of AP | <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination,</b> heautoscopy, and out-of-body experience | previous studies have concentrated on describing the spatial unity between self and body while neglecting to analyze the temporal unity of self and body. Here we describe several AP-cases with an altered experience of age or time for one's own body or self. In some AP-cases the second own body was seen as being younger or older than the subject's actual body. We show that the second own body is experienced as if from another time " although the observing self is experienced in the present time. Other AP-subjects reported a feeling of timelessness of the observing self without any age di®erence between the subjects ' actual and illusory body. We argue that thes...|$|E
40|$|Do babies {{know what}} they look like? Doppelgängers and the {{phenomenology}} of infancy. When an infant imitates a face, {{is it possible that}} he can see the resemblance between his own face and the model’s – that’s to say, see it as a visual image, so he can compare what the two faces look like? To be able to picture oneself in any such literal sense is surely beyond the capacity even of most adults. So the suggestion that a baby might be doing it may seem absurd. Yet extraordinary data, of the kind Andrew Meltzoff has reported over the last twenty five years, invite extraordinary hypotheses. And it’s in this spirit that I want to introduce into the discussion a singular phenomenon: the illusion of the doppelgänger, or <b>autoscopic</b> <b>hallucination,</b> where a person does indeed see his or her own double. The phenomenon, as it occurs in adults, is quite rare. It is sometimes experienced by healthy individuals, but is more common in those with epilepsy, and appears to be linked to right-hemisphere parietal lobe malfunction (Blanke et al., 2002, Krizek, 2000). Graham Reed (1972, p. 54) has described the typical manifestation: Usually the doppelgänger apparition appears without warning and takes the form of...|$|E
