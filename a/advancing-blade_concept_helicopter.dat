40|$|The {{members of}} Team Asylum have {{proposed}} a <b>helicopter</b> design <b>concept,</b> called the S. T. o. R.

However, many critical design areas needed to be investigated as part of the <b>helicopter</b> <b>concept's</b> selection. One of the most significant design factors was the weight of the aircraft. This determined the selection of the propulsion system necessary to get the S. T. o. R. M. off the ground, and maintain flight once airborne. Another significant factor that went hand in hand with the motor selection was the choice of the main rotor. Since the main rotor is the primary source of lift for the helicopter, its proper selection became increasingly important...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} first {{helicopter}} was invented it has never stopped {{to contribute to the}} everyday life around the world. As time has passed technological innovation have made it possible for every ordinary man to own a small helicopter and maneuver it by the help of a remote controller. Where the pilot in a full scale helicopter would make use of a onboard computer to control the movement a person with a RC helicopter would need to rely on his finger skills and vision to make sure the helicopter maintain the desired path via remote control from the ground. This has often shown to bee quite difficult for first time users and may in many cases lead to expensive crashes throughout a long period of training. It would save both money and time if it in some way would be possible to reduce the time spent on training by connecting something to the helicopter and thereby control and stabilize the helicopter for the user. The idea is to investigate the possibility of constructing a stabilizer which reduces this complexity. A desired solution is to let the pilot control one movement in one direction or rotation around one axis while a microcontroller attached to the helicopters body controls the remaining degrees of freedom. An important question is how this should be done and what kind of model this would be based on.
