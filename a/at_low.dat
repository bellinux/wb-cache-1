There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. <b>At</b> <b>low</b> energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated <b>at</b> <b>low</b> energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E

5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived <b>at</b> <b>low</b> temperatures. Strangelets are bound <b>at</b> <b>low</b> energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E
