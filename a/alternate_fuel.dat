40|$|Synthetic and biomass fueling are now {{considered}} to be near-term aviation <b>alternate</b> <b>fueling.</b> The major impediment is a secure sustainable supply of these fuels at reasonable cost. However, biomass fueling raises major concerns related to uses of common food crops and grasses (some also called "weeds") for processing into aviation fuels. These issues are addressed, and then halophytes and algae are shown to be better suited as sources of aerospace fuels and transportation fueling in general. Some of the history related to <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> use is provided as a guideline for current and planned <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> testing (ground and flight) with emphasis on biofuel blends. It is also noted that lessons learned from terrestrial fueling are applicable to space missions.

The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these <b>alternate</b> <b>fuel</b> gases.|$|E

40|$|To enhance energy {{security}} {{and reduce the}} environmental impact of aviation, <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> derived from various nonpetroleum based sources are being developed. Currently <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> are produced to match the properties of existing jet fuels allowing the new fuels to be used in current fleets concurrently with traditional jet <b>fuel.</b> The <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> must, therefore, perform as well as the traditional fuels through the entire operating envelope. This paper provides the results of performance testing in an altitude chamber up to 11, 300 m (35, 000 feet) with a simulated forward speed up to Mach 0. 75. The test engine was an instrumented 1. 15 kN thrust turbojet burning conventional Jet A- 1 as a baseline; a semi-synthetic blend of camelina based hydro processed renewable jet and JP 8; a blend of 50 % Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and 50 % JP 8; and a 100 % Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene. Both steady state and transient performance are presented. The theoretical effect of the <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> for a simple idealized Brayton cycle is also presented.

40|$|Concern {{over the}} future {{availability}} of high quality liquid fuels or use in furnaces and boilers prompted the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to consider <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> as replacements for the high grade liquid fuels used in the 1970 `s and 1980 `s. <b>Alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> were defined to be combinations of {{a large percentage of}} viscous, low volatility fuels resulting from the low end of distillation mixed with a small percentage of relatively low viscosity, high volatility fuels yielded by the high end of distillation. The addition of high volatility fuels was meant to promote desirable characteristics to a fuel that would otherwise be difficult to atomize and burn and whose combustion would yield a high amount of pollutants. Several questions thus needed to be answered before <b>alternate</b> <b>fuels</b> became commercially viable. These questions were related to fuel atomization, evaporation, ignition, combustion and pollutant formation.
