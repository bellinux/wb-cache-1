5|$|The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually {{referred}} to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances <b>at</b> <b>each</b> fielding position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), as voted by the managers and coaches in each league. Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players. Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of the nine positions in each league. In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance <b>at</b> <b>each</b> position. The award was created from a glove made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base. Initially, only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder <b>at</b> <b>each</b> position in the entire major league; however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.|$|E
