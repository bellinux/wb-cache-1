5|$|As {{part of the}} state's {{maintenance}} of M-117, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway.

MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that between 1,392and 1,986vehicles used the highway per day.|$|E
5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description {{in terms of the}} mean and variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of time}} ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including <b>a</b> <b>statistical</b> description, of the climate system.|$|E
50|$|The Manhattan-Junction City Combined Statistical Area, {{as defined}} by the United States Census Bureau, is an area {{consisting}} of three counties in northeastern Kansas, anchored by the city of Manhattan.

5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L.

This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when assessing the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E

Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E

City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, <b>a</b> <b>statistical</b> analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but has refused to set <b>a</b> <b>statistical</b> migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E

5|$|SAS Institute {{started as}} a project at North Carolina State University to create <b>a</b> <b>statistical</b> {{analysis}} system (hence the proper name, Statistical Analysis System) that was originally used primarily by agricultural departments at universities in the late 1960s. It became an independent, private business led by current CEO James Goodnight and three other project leaders from the university in 1976. SAS grew from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. A larger proportion of these revenues are spent {{on research and development}} than at most other software companies, at one point more than double the industry average.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on <b>a</b> <b>statistical</b> analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing <b>a</b> <b>statistical</b> generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
