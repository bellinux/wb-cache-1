25|$|With {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the War Office planned for CRUs to accept only Far East {{prisoners of war}} (FEPOWs), based on the {{assumption}} that the CRUs would not be able to manage the combined number of POWs from Europe and the Far East and that the FEPOWs were more in need of the service. Wilson and Rendel felt that European POWs should not be denied the opportunity to attend, and went to lengths to expand the programme where possible and make space for both groups. Rendel and Wilson were removed from heading the programme as a result. By the end of March 1947, more than 19,000 European POWs and 4,500 FEPOWs had attended <b>a</b> <b>CRU.</b>|$|E
25|$|By the mid-20th century, wine {{production}} in the Barolo zone was dominated by large negociants who purchased grapes and wines from across the zone and blended it into a house style. In the 1960s, individual proprietors began estate bottling and producing single vineyard wines from their holdings. By the 1980s, {{a wide range of}} single vineyard bottlings were available, which led to a discussion among the region's producers about the prospect of developing <b>a</b> <b>Cru</b> classification for the area's vineyards. The cataloging of Barolo's vineyards has a long history dating back to the work of Lorenzo Fantini in the late 19th century and Renato Ratti and Luigi Veronelli in the late 20th century, but as of 2009 there is still no official classification within the region. However, in 1980 the region as a whole was elevated to DOCG status. Along with Barbaresco and Brunello di Montalcino, Barolo {{was one of the first}} Italian wine regions to attain this designation.|$|E
2500|$|Major Adam Curle and Eric Trist {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the efficacy of CRUs. They found that 26% of POWs who attended <b>a</b> <b>CRU</b> demonstrated [...] "unsettlement" [...] compared with 64% of POWs who did not attend <b>a</b> <b>CRU.</b> Curle and Trist found that the [...] "settled" [...] men studied had better social relationships than a civilian control sample. They argued that this demonstrated the CRU's worth as a therapeutic community. However, they {{also noted that the}} results might have been affected by more [...] "settled" [...] men being more likely to attend <b>a</b> <b>CRU</b> in the first place.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the grand <b>cru,</b> <b>a</b> new classification has arisen, that of the premier cru, which designates that the cocoa in a bar is sourced from a specific area, such as a plantation, within a country or region. <b>A</b> premier <b>cru</b> chocolate is typically considered to be of higher quality than <b>a</b> grand <b>cru.</b> This contrasts with the corresponding use of the terms in the wine market, where <b>a</b> grand <b>cru</b> wine is esteemed more highly than <b>a</b> premier <b>cru.</b>|$|R
25|$|In general, {{producers}} are always allowed to declassify their wine in steps to a lower-ranked AOC {{if they wish}} to do so. Thus, a wine from <b>a</b> Grand <b>Cru</b> vineyard may be sold as <b>a</b> Premier <b>Cru</b> from that vineyard's village, <b>a</b> Premier <b>Cru</b> wine may be sold as a Village wine, and so on. This practice will almost invariably mean the declassified wine will have to be sold at a lower price, so this is only practiced when something is to be gained overall in the process. One motive may be to only include vines of a certain age in <b>a</b> Grand <b>Cru</b> wine, to improve its quality and raise its prestige and price, in which case the wine coming from younger vines may be sold as <b>a</b> Premier <b>Cru</b> at <b>a</b> lower price. Overall, such a practice may allow a producer to keep a higher average price for the wine sold.|$|R

Next in line is DU <b>Cru,</b> <b>an</b> M2 red supergiant that varies irregularly between magnitude 7.1 and 7.6. The last of the four is CC <b>Cru,</b> <b>a</b> magnitude 7.83 B2 giant and ellipsoidal variable.|$|R
2500|$|Eating {{potatoes}} for sustenance {{was promoted}} in France by Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, {{but he did}} not mention fried potatoes in particular. Many Americans attribute the dish to France and offer as evidence a notation by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson: [...] "Pommes de terre frites <b>à</b> <b>cru,</b> en petites tranches" [...] ("Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small slices") in a manuscript in Thomas Jefferson's hand (circa 1801–1809) and the recipe almost certainly comes from his French chef, Honoré Julien.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET), {{the best}} {{examples}} of Agiorgitiko tend to have moderate to low acidity, with a deep, ruby color, red fruit aromas and a sweet spicy note. These examples tend to come from vineyards planted in the middle range of the hillside slopes around Nemea with grapes harvested {{near the top of the}} [...] hills being excessively acidic while those harvested from the very warm valley floor often being too [...] "jammy". The variance in quality of Agiorgitiko from the different vineyards around Nemea have led some Greek wine producers to investigate developing <b>a</b> <b>cru</b> classification system.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{vineyards}} {{planted on}} the hills around Sancerre are on south facing slopes at altitudes between 655-1,310 feet (200–400 meters). The soils around the area can be roughly classified into three categories. The far western reaches heading towards Menetou-Salon have [...] "white" [...] soils with clay and limestone. Around the village of Chavignol (considered <b>a</b> <b>cru</b> of Sancerre), the soil also includes some Kimmeridgian marl. Wines from these western reaches {{tend to have more}} body and power in their flavour profile. Heading closer to the city of Sancerre the soil picks up more gravel mixed with the limestone and tends to produce more light bodied wines with delicate perfumes. The third classification of soil is found around the city of Sancerre itself which includes many deposits of flint (also known as silex) that add distinctive mineral components. These wines tend to be heavily perfumed with the longest aging potential of Sancerres.|$|E
