40|$|The {{ambulatory}} physician {{payment system}} in the German Social Health Insurance (SHI) offers incentives to reduce practice activity {{at the end of}} <b>a</b> <b>billing</b> period. Most services within a period are reimbursed at full cost only up to a certain threshold. Furthermore, capitated payments make follow-up treatments within <b>a</b> <b>billing</b> period less profitable. Using claims data from Germany's largest sickness fund with about nine million members, we find a decrease of all services limited by a threshold at the end of <b>a</b> <b>billing</b> period and <b>an</b> immediate increase {{at the beginning of the}} following period. For services that are not limited, we do not find an effect.

5|$|Bills can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.|$|E

He also proposed a successful amendment to the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act that excluded farm implements and machinery from the tariff. An advocate of free silver, he was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison to be a delegate to the International Monetary Conference held in Brussels, Belgium, in 1892.
