40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} <b>a</b> novel {{multi-channel}} <b>network</b> with infrastructure support, called <b>an</b> MC-IS <b>network,</b> {{which has not}} been studied in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study such <b>an</b> MC-IS <b>network.</b> Our MC-IS network is equipped with a number of infrastructure nodes which can communicate with common nodes using a number of channels where a communication between a common node and an infrastructure node is called an infrastructure communication and a communication between two common nodes is called an ad-hoc communication. Our proposed MC-IS <b>network</b> has <b>a</b> number of advantages over three existing conventional <b>networks,</b> namely <b>a</b> single-channel wireless ad hoc <b>network</b> (called <b>an</b> SC-AH <b>network),</b> <b>a</b> multi-channel wireless ad hoc <b>network</b> (called <b>an</b> MC-AH <b>network)</b> and <b>a</b> single-channel <b>network</b> with infrastructure support (called <b>an</b> SC-IS <b>network).</b> In particular, the network capacity of our proposed MC-IS network is √(n n) times higher than that of <b>an</b> SC-AH <b>network</b> and <b>an</b> MC-AH <b>network</b> and {{the same as that of}} <b>an</b> SC-IS <b>network,</b> where n is the number of nodes in the network.

Also, there exists an injective {{function that}} maps <b>a</b> directed <b>network</b> to <b>an</b> undirected <b>network</b> (i. e. <b>an</b> undirected unlabeled <b>network).</b> The edge directionality in the directed network is represented as a topological feature of the undirected network. Through function composition, there exists an injective function that maps <b>a</b> semantic <b>network</b> to <b>an</b> undirected <b>network.</b> Thus, aside from space constraints, the semantic network construct {{does not have any}} modeling functionality that is not possible with either a directed or undirected network representation.
