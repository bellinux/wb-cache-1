5|$|Operation Barbarossa, the German {{invasion}} plan, {{called for}} the capture of Moscow within four months. On 22 June 1941, Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union, destroyed most of the Soviet Air Force on the ground, and advanced deep into Soviet territory using blitzkrieg tactics to destroy entire Soviet armies. The German <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> North moved towards Leningrad, <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> South took control of Ukraine, and <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Center advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Center crossed the Dnieper River, {{on the path to}} Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The German plan {{of attack}} {{required}} that <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B would advance and draw in the Allied First <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> into central Belgium, while <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> A conducted the surprise assault through the Ardennes. Belgium was {{to act as a}} secondary front with regard to importance. <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B was given only limited numbers of armoured and mobile units while {{the vast majority of the}} <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> comprised infantry divisions. After the English Channel was reached, all Panzer division units and most motorised infantry were removed from <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B and given to <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> A, to strengthen the German lines of communication and to prevent an Allied breakout.|$|E
5|$|Although {{suffering}} numerous tactical reverses, operationally the Germans diverted the Allied First <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> {{from the}} lower Ardennes area. In the process his forces, along with the Luftwaffe depleted Prioux' Cavalry Corps. When news of the German breakthrough at Sedan reached Prioux, he withdrew from Gembloux. With the Gembloux gap breached, the German Panzer Corps, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions, were no longer required by <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B and were handed over to <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> A. <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B would continue its own offensive to force {{the collapse of the}} Meuse front. The <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> {{was in a position to}} advance westward to Mons, outflank the BEF and Belgian Army protecting the Dyle–Brussels sector, or turn south to outflank the French 9th Army.|$|E
500|$|The <b>army</b> <b>groups</b> ( [...] , also {{translated}} as <b>group</b> <b>armies)</b> of the National Revolutionary Army were the largest conventional mobile formations {{in the organization}} of the army of the Republic of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The first <b>army</b> <b>groups</b> were established immediately after the Japanese attack at Marco Polo Bridge on 7 July 1937, and new <b>army</b> <b>groups</b> continued to be formed throughout the war.|$|R

5|$|At {{various times}} in 1944, Model {{commanded}} {{each of the}} three major <b>army</b> <b>groups</b> on the Eastern Front, and for a short period {{in the middle of the}} year was commanding both <b>Army</b> <b>Groups</b> Centre and North Ukraine simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|As Germany {{was cut in}} two, Kesselring's command was {{enlarged}} {{to include}} Army Groups Centre, South and South-East on the Eastern Front, and <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> C in Italy, {{as well as his}} own <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> G and <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Upper Rhine. On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in Berlin. On 1 May, Karl Dönitz was designated German President (Reichspräsident) and the Flensburg government was created. One of the new president's first acts was the appointment of Kesselring as Commander-in-Chief of Southern Germany, with plenipotentiary powers.|$|E
5|$|Attacks by the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> North west of Lake Peipus, {{resulting}} {{in a series of}} operations around Narva. In the south, Soviet forces had advanced towards the Baltic coast at the end of Operation Bagration the Belorussian strategic offensive (June–August 1944) against <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Centre. The Soviet Tallinn Offensive was designed {{as a part of the}} Baltic Offensive to eliminate the positions of <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> North along the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{operations}} in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery at first, but SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> and Montgomery's 21st <b>Army</b> <b>Group.</b> Smith {{soon realized that}} he had made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible, and it lacked the necessary communications equipment.|$|E

5|$|On 5 March 1944, Colonel General Ivan Konev, {{commander}} of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, commenced the Uman–Botoşani Offensive operation in the Ukraine. This operation succeeded in separating <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> North's First Panzer Army from <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> South 8th Army by 17 March; by early April Soviet units approached the Romanian border.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{preparations}} {{also included}} increased activity of Soviet partisans, who attacked German communications and supply lines. The attacks were mostly behind <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> North and <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Centre. In June 1943, partisans {{operating in the}} occupied area behind <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Centre destroyed 298 locomotives, 1,222 railway wagons and 44 bridges, and in the Kursk sector there were 1,092 partisan attacks on railways. These attacks delayed the build-up of German supplies and equipment, and required the diversion of German troops to suppress the partisans, delaying their training for the offensive. Central Partisan Headquarters coordinated many of these attacks. In June Soviet Air Forces (VVS) flew over 800 sorties at night to resupply the partisan groups operating behind <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Centre. The VVS also provided communication and sometimes even daylight air-support for major partisan operations.|$|E
5|$|Spurred on by this success, the Red Army {{planned a}} series of {{follow-up}} offensives in January and February 1943 intended to decisively beat the German forces in southern Russia. After {{the destruction of the}} remaining Hungarian and Italian forces during the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, Operation Star and Operation Gallop were launched to recapture Kharkov and Kursk and to cut off all German forces east of Donetsk. Those operations succeeded in breaking through the German lines and threatened the whole southern part of the German front. To deal with this threat, <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Don, <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B, and parts of <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> A were united as <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> South (Heeresgruppe Süd) under Manstein's command in early February.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> {{faced the}} Hungarian 3rd Army across the border, {{and during the}} first few days after the {{commencement}} of the invasion, there were exchanges of fire with Hungarian border guards, but the Yugoslavs faced no direct attacks along the 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> sector. Neither the 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> nor the Hungarians were ready for full-scale fighting, as they were still mobilising and deploying their forces. On 9 April, due to German successes elsewhere in Yugoslavia, the 6th Army on the right flank of the 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> was ordered to withdraw south of the Danube and deploy on a line facing east to defend against an attack from the direction of Sofia, Bulgaria. 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> also received orders to withdraw south of the line of the Drava and Danube. 1st Army began to withdraw, and on the same day elements were approaching the Danube crossing. The headquarters of the 2nd Army issued orders to evacuate Baranja and reinforce the left flank.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} {{plan for}} 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> saw the 1st Army in the Bačka region between the Danube and the Tisza, with formations centred around {{the towns of}} Sombor, Bačka Topola and Senta, with the 3rd Cavalry Division held in depth, south of the Danube in the Fruška Gora region. The 2nd Army deployment plan {{saw it in the}} Baranya and Slavonia regions between Slatina and the Danube, with its formations positioned south of the Drava from just east of Slatina to Valpovo, and around the towns of Osijek and Vinkovci. Of the formations of the 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group,</b> two infantry divisions of the 2nd Army were partly mobilised, while the remaining two infantry divisions, the 3rd Cavalry Division, and the two brigade-strength infantry detachments had only commenced mobilisation. To the right of the 1st <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> was the 6th Army, an independent formation that was responsible for the defence of the Yugoslav Banat region east of the Tisza. The boundary with the 6th Army ran just to the east of the Tisza to the confluence with the Danube, then south across the Sava through Obrenovac. On the left flank of the 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> was the 1st <b>Army</b> <b>Group,</b> which was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia, along the Yugoslav–Hungarian west of Slatina, Yugoslav–Reich and Yugoslav–Italian borders. The <b>army</b> <b>group</b> boundary ran from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka.|$|E

The idea of SS <b>Armies</b> and <b>Army</b> <b>Groups</b> was something few wished to see develop - two SS Armies would eventually be established, (the 6th and the 11th SS Armies). No SS <b>Army</b> <b>Groups</b> were ever created.|$|R

5|$|After the {{fighting}} in Normandy, Model established his headquarters at Oosterbeek, near Arnhem in the Netherlands, where he set about the massive task of rebuilding <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B. On 17 August 1944, Model {{was appointed to the}} temporary command of OB West, upon Kluge's recall to Berlin to answer charges that he had involvement with the failed July 20 plot (Kluge would commit suicide en route). Model retained command of OB West for eighteen days before Hitler appointed Gerd von Rundstedt as permanent replacement for Kluge, allowing Model to return to the command of <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B.|$|E
5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Don, by <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing that the Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|As the German Sixth Army was encircled in Stalingrad, the Red Army {{undertook}} {{a series of}} wider attacks against the rest of <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> South. These culminated on 2 January 1943 when the Red Army launched Operation Star and Operation Gallop, which between January and early February broke German defenses {{and led to the}} Soviet recapture of Kharkov, Belgorod, Kursk, as well as Voroshilovgrad and Izium. The Soviet victories caused participating Soviet units to over-extend themselves. Freed on 2 February by the surrender of the German Sixth Army the Red Army's Central Front turned its attention west and on 25 February expanded its offensive against both <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> South and <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Center. Months of continuous operations, however, had taken a heavy toll on the Soviet forces and some divisions were reduced to 1,000–2,000 combat effective soldiers. On 19 February, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein launched his Kharkov counterstrike, using the fresh II SS Panzer Corps and two panzer armies.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, due to {{the large}} scale of combat, {{multiple}} corps were combined into armies commanded in theory by a general (four stars), but often by a lieutenant general (three stars), and comprising as many as 240,000 troops. Armies are numbered by spelled-out numerals or functional titles, using their nationality in [...] "combined" [...] forces (e.g., Eighth US Army, Third ROK Army, British Army of the Rhine). These were in their turn formed into <b>army</b> <b>groups,</b> these being the largest field organization handled by a single commander in modern warfare. <b>Army</b> <b>groups</b> included between 400,000 and 1,500,000 troops. <b>Army</b> <b>groups</b> received Arabic numeral designations and national designations when combined.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.|$|E
5|$|Bagration {{called for}} the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt {{the plans for the}} Bagration were sound, he worried {{about the possibility of a}} German incursion by <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{considerable}} losses, {{in early}} 1942 Germany {{and its allies}} stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> South into two groups: <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while <b>Army</b> <b>Group</b> B headed towards the Volga River.
