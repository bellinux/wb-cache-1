5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> The cardiac <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> is created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an <b>action</b> <b>potential,</b> traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an <b>action</b> <b>potential,</b> reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

We could occasionally observe repetitive <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> (RAPs) induced by light, burning or pricking stimulation's.

50|$|In {{addition}} to propagating <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> to axonal terminals, the axon {{is able to}} amplify the <b>action</b> <b>potentials,</b> which makes sure a secure propagation of sequential <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> toward the axonal terminal. In terms of molecular mechanisms, voltage-gated sodium channels in the axons possess lower threshold and shorter refractory period in response to short-term pulses.|$|R
5|$|Neurotransmitters are {{chemicals}} that are released at synapses when an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> activates them—neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell, and thereby alter the electrical or chemical {{properties of the}} receptor molecules.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to {{contract}} easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> from the pacemaker cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> at a fixed rate – spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E

5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|The low {{concentration}} of calcium in the cytosol allows calcium ions {{to function as}} a second messenger in calcium signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol. This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride and potassium may also have signaling functions in the cytosol, but these are not well understood.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} dendritic {{protein synthesis}} after a prolonged blockade of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> alone {{and after a}} blockade of both <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> and miniature excitatory synaptic events (minis). Relative to controls, dendrites exposed to a prolonged blockade of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> showed diminished protein synthesis. Dendrites in which both <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> and minis were blocked showed enhanced protein synthesis, suggesting that minis inhibit dendritic translation. When minis were acutely blocked or stimulated, an immediate increase or decrease, respectively, in dendritic translation was observed. Taken together, these results reveal a role for miniature synaptic events in the acute regulation of dendritic protein synthesis in neurons...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP) {{and depression}} (LTD) were investigated at synapses formed by pairs of monosynaptically connected CA 3 pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slice cultures. An N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated {{component of the}} unitary EPSP, elicited at the resting membrane potential in response to single <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> in an individual CA 3 cell, could be isolated pharmacologically. Associative LTP was induced when single presynaptic <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> were repeatedly paired with 240 ms postsynaptic depolarizing pulses that evoked five to twelve <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> or with single postsynaptic <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> evoked near {{the peak of the}} unitary EPSP. LTP induction was prevented by an NMDA receptor antagonist. Associative LTD was induced when single presynaptic <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> were repeatedly elicited with a certain delay after either 240 ms postsynaptic depolarizing pulses or single postsynaptic <b>action</b> <b>potentials.</b> The time window within which presynaptic activity had to occur for LTD induction was dependent on the amount of postsynaptic depolarization. LTD was induced if single pre- and postsynaptic <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> occurred synchronously. Homosynaptic LTD was induced by 3 Hz tetanization of the presynaptic neuron for 3 min and was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist. Depotentiation was produced with stimulation protocols that elicit either homosynaptic or associative LTD. Recurrent excitatory synapses between CA 3 cells display associative potentiation and depression. The sign of the change in synaptic strength {{is a function of the}} relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic <b>action</b> <b>potentials...</b>|$|R
5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate {{even in the absence of}} the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> followed by a refractory period of about 10ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} cells support an <b>action</b> <b>potential,</b> such as plant cells, muscle cells, and the {{specialized}} {{cells of the}} heart (in which occurs the cardiac <b>action</b> <b>potential).</b> However, the main excitable cell is the neuron, which also has the simplest mechanism for the <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E
25|$|In general, if an {{excitatory}} synapse is strong enough, an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> in the presynaptic neuron will trigger an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> in the postsynaptic cell. In {{many cases the}} excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single presynaptic neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} high pass filter for neurons.|$|E
40|$|The {{secretory}} {{cells of}} the salivary glands of the snail, HeUsoma trivolvis, exhibit regenerative, overshooting <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> whose amplitude may exceed 100 mV. The salivary glands consist of paired, tubular, epithelial structures with acinar outpocketings. The secretory cells display extensive electrical coupling which allows <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> to propagate along the glandular epithelium. Salivary glands from nine genera of gastropod molluscs were examined. The genera comprised one opisthobranch, one prosobranch, two terrestrial pulmonate slugs, one terrestrial pulmonate snail, and four aquatic pulmo-nate snails. <b>Action</b> <b>potentials</b> were recorded {{from all of the}} examined glands, suggesting that the production of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> in salivary glands is a general phenomenon among gastropods...|$|R

40|$|<b>Action</b> <b>potentials</b> are the {{fundamental}} signals for relaying information from one region {{to another in}} the nervous system. <b>Action</b> <b>potentials</b> are propagated along axons without decrease of their amplitudes and are conducted with constant velocity depending on axonal diameter and myelin. It is considered that the modulation of fi ring patterns of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> in the neural circuit infl uences the information processing in the brain. We investigated the modulatory eff ects of glial cells on the fi ring pattern and the axonal conduction of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> using rat hippocampal slice preparation. In our previous study, we focused on interneuron / perineuronal glial cell pairs in CA 1 region and reported that perineuronal glial cells could be classifi ed into two groups, one group belong astrocytes （perineuronal astrocytes） and the other group oligodendrocytes （perineuronal oligodendrocytes）, based on their membrane properties and immunohistochemical study. Direct depolarization of perineuronal astrocytes modulated the directly induced fi ring pattern of the interneuron, with initial facilitation and subsequent suppression. We also studied the oligodendrocytes in the alveus and examined their modulatory effects on the conduction of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> along axons of CA 1 pyramidal cells. Direct repetitive depolarization of oligodendrocytes shortened the latencies of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> evoked by antidromic stimulation. These results indicate that glial cells infl uence the firing pattern and axonal conduction of <b>action</b> <b>potentials,</b> and that their effects involve both facilitation and suppression...|$|R
25|$|In physiology, an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> {{occurs when}} the {{membrane}} potential of a specific axon location rapidly rises and falls: this depolarisation then causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarise. In the Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model of Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley, speed of transmission of an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> was undefined and {{it was assumed that}} adjacent areas became depolarised due to released ion interference with neighbouring channels. Measurements of ion diffusion and radii have since shown this to not be possible. Moreover, contradictory measurements of entropy changes and timing disputed the HH as acting alone. More recent work has shown that the HH <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> is not a single entity but is a coupled synchronised oscillating lipid pulse (<b>action</b> <b>potential</b> pulse) powered by entropy from the HH ion exchanges.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{channels}} {{located on}} the surface membrane of the neuron allows for an influx of sodium ions and outward movement of potassium ions during an <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> Selectively blocking these ion channels will decrease the likelihood of an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> to occur. The drug riluzole is a neuroprotective drug that blocks sodium ion channels. Since these channels cannot activate, there is no <b>action</b> <b>potential,</b> and the neuron does not perform any transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals and the signal does not move on. This drug is used as an anesthetic {{as well as a}} sedative.|$|E
25|$|Postsynaptic {{structures}} differ for cochlear {{cells and}} photoreceptor cells. Hair cells {{is capable of}} one <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> propagation for one vesicle release. One vesicle release from the presynaptic hair cell onto the postsynaptic bouton is enough to create an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> in the auditory afferent cells. Photoreceptors allow one vesicle release for many <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> propagation. The rod terminal and cone ribbon synapse of the photoreceptors have horizontal synaptic spines expressing AMPA receptors with additional bipolar dendrites exhibiting the mGluR6 receptors. These structures allow for the binding of multiple molecules of glutamate, allowing for the propagation of many action potentials.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> do not usually produce an {{observable}} field, mainly because the currents associated with <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out. However, action fields have been measured from peripheral nerves.|$|R
5000|$|Voltage {{sensitive}} dyes (VSDs) {{were among}} the earliest method for optically detecting <b>action</b> <b>potentials.</b> VSDs commonly become fluorescent {{in response to a}} neuron's change in voltage, rendering individual <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> detectable.

The physiological phenomena of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> are possible because voltage-gated ion channels allow the resting potential caused by electrochemical gradient on either side of a cell membrane to resolve.|$|R

25|$|Before an <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> occurs, the axonal {{membrane}} is at {{its normal}} resting potential, and Na+ channels are in their deactivated state, blocked on the extracellular side by their activation gates. In response to an electric current (in this case, an <b>action</b> <b>potential),</b> the activation gates open, allowing positively charged Na+ ions to flow into the neuron through the channels, and causing the voltage across the neuronal membrane to increase. Because the voltage across the membrane is initially negative, as its voltage increases to and past zero, {{it is said to}} depolarize. This increase in voltage constitutes the rising phase of an <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cardiac <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> {{differs from}} the {{neuronal}} <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> by having an extended plateau, in which the membrane is held at a high voltage for a few hundred milliseconds prior to being repolarized by the potassium current as usual.

40|$|Intracellular microelectrodes {{were used}} to record the effects of {{extended}} periods (1 - 30 min) of synaptic activation on AH neurons in the myenteric ganglia of the guinea-pig ileum. Low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation {{gave rise to a}} slowly developing, sustained increase in excitability of the neurons associated with depolarization and increased input resistance. The increased excitability lasted for up to 3. 5 h following the stimulus period. Successive stimulus trains (1 - 4 min) elicited successively greater increases in excitability. The neurons went through stages of excitation. Before stimulation, 500 -ms depolarizing pulses evoked up to three <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> (phasic response) and anode break <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> were not observed. As excitability increased, more <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> were evoked by depolarization (the responses became tonic), anode break <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> were observed, prolonged after hyperpolarizing potentials that follow multiple <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> were diminished and, with substantial depolarization of the neurons, invasion by antidromic <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> was suppressed.
