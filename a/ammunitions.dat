5|$|In {{terms of}} war materiel, Massachusetts, {{as a leading}} center of {{industry}} and manufacturing, was poised to become a major producer of <b>ammunitions</b> and supplies. The most important source of armaments in Massachusetts was the Springfield Armory.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand the}} blast radius for <b>ammunitions</b> testing at Fort Custer, MDOT rerouted the {{business}} loop and M-37 to {{run along the}} southern and eastern edges of the airport instead of following roads on the opposite sides. This change was completed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and <b>Ammunitions</b> (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E

50|$|An {{individual}} may not possess <b>ammunition</b> without also holding a valid firearms registration. Until May 2012, registrants {{were limited to}} possessing <b>ammunition</b> of the caliber of their registered weapon only. The <b>ammunition</b> laws in DC were relaxed in May 2012 and valid registration holders may now purchase and transport <b>ammunition</b> of any caliber excepting 50BMG (50 BMG weapons are prohibited in DC) and protective armor penetration <b>ammunition.</b> Interstate sale and shipment of <b>ammunition</b> to valid registration holders is legal. In DC, as in jurisdictions such as Massachusetts, any usable constituent part of <b>ammunition</b> is considered <b>ammunition.</b> E.g. Expended center-fire casings capable of being reloaded are <b>ammunition</b> under current DC police interpretation.|$|R
50|$|Images 2-8 {{show the}} range of <b>ammunition</b> for the RML 12.5 inch gun in 1885. This range {{is typical of the}} <b>ammunition</b> in use with Woolwich-grooved guns of 9 inches or larger after the mid-1880s. These guns no longer fired studded <b>ammunition</b> without gas-checks. Instead there were two sets of <b>ammunition</b> available, namely: older studded <b>ammunition</b> with {{attached}} gas-checks Mk II, and newer studless <b>ammunition</b> with automatic gas-checks. Case <b>ammunition</b> was neither studded nor required gas-checks.|$|R
5|$|At over 80, Mondragón {{was still}} able to mount on horseback, though he had to be helped by two men and could only wear light armour. He first came to {{prominence}} at the Battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, {{and was one of the}} few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces, being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and <b>ammunitions</b> gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E
5|$|At {{the hill}} of Puigpardines, Juigné was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants {{of the local}} somatent–a type of militia–, when the arrival of Sala's, Mas' and Baliart's miquelets {{convinced}} him to withdraw. When they tried to cross back the Fluvià, however, they found the way blocked. Juigné decided then attempting to escape to Olot across the wood of Malatosquera and through the bridge of Sant Roc, but the Catalans anticipated him. Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one, and while Josep Mas de Roda, leading the first one, pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood, he blocked the bridge of Sant Roc ahead the second group. During the running fight under the trees Juigné's force lost 25 men and abandoned part of its <b>ammunitions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, Ho Chi Minh {{played a key}} role in facilitating the {{formation}} of the Nanyang Communist Party—later renamed the Malayan Communist Party (MCP)—and visited Malaya on several occasions, such as presiding over a ceremony to mark the formation of the Malayan Communist Party in Buloh Kasap, Johor, in April 1930. Ho Chi Minh's influence on the MCP paved the way for Lai Teck, who was also of Vietnamese origin, to be appointed as the MCP's Secretary General between 1934 and 1938. Collaboration and communications between the MCP and the Vietnamese Communists increased following Lai Teck's disappearance in the late 1940s; the MCP briefly facilitated the shipping and transport of light <b>ammunitions</b> to the Viet Minh around this time. During World War II, both the Viet Minh and Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) opposed the Japanese invasion of French Indochina and Malaya. Closer ties between communist cadres from Malaya and Vietnam were forged following successful efforts by the Communist victory at Dien Bien Phu in 1954; the Viet Minh provided small-scale logistical and communication support and training to the MCP in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Pashtun {{forces had}} {{successfully}} assaulted the camp in three other locations, and the 24th Punjab Infantry's picket lines were quickly overrun. Pashtun sharpshooters occupying the nearby heights inflicted casualties throughout the night, and the bazaar and surrounding buildings were occupied. Other {{units of the}} 24th, under Lieutenant Climo, retook the area and held it until 10:45pm, but under fire from sharpshooters they were driven back. The Pashtun forces broke through {{in a number of}} other locations. Lieutenant Watling commanding a group of British troops guarding the <b>ammunitions</b> stores at the Quarter Guard was wounded, losing the stores in the process. Meiklejohn led a small group of sappers, members of the 24th and Captain Holland, Climo from the earlier charge, and Lieutenant Manley to recapture the ammunition dump; Holland and the General were wounded, and the group severely depleted as it twice failed to retake the dump, but a third attempt proved successful. However, continuing crossfire from the enveloping Pashtun troops wounded a number of British officers, placing the command of the 24th with Climo. Towards 1:00am on the morning of July 27, Lieutenant Edmund William Costello rescued a wounded havildar while under fire and was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions.|$|E
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even <b>ammunitions</b> were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} {{situation of}} foreign army and our shipboard artillery <b>ammunition</b> demolition {{and the ways}} of waste <b>ammunition</b> destruction are summed up in this paper. The development direction of shipboard artillery <b>ammunition</b> demolition is put forward in this paper. Expenditure and science technology level and produced pollutants {{must be considered in}} the process of destruction. The destruction work of shipboard artillery <b>ammunition</b> should be developed with a more safe and orderly, more cost-effective and more saving direction. The introduction As everyone knows, <b>ammunition</b> has the certain service life. Expired <b>ammunition</b> becomes waste. Because stability and security of expired <b>ammunition</b> becomes poor. Abandoned <b>ammunition</b> is caused due to storage expiration, retirements and inappropriate production and use. They are more dangerous. So, waste <b>ammunition</b> is mainly from three aspects. One is the scrap <b>ammunition</b> of military, such as shipboard artillery <b>ammunition,</b> aerial bombs, land mines, mines, torpedoes, grenades, rocket, missile or other special ammunition[1]. The second is from stock. There are expired <b>ammunition</b> and weapon retired which contains the <b>ammunition.</b> Three is from munitions manufacturer. These manufacturers often have defective products and scraped products i...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ammunition</b> levels The game also {{modelled}} {{the amount}} of <b>ammunition</b> each unit possessed. Troops in a heavy fire-fight would quickly run out of <b>ammunition.</b> Once out of <b>ammunition</b> they would resort to bayonet fighting, or surrender to any enemies that approached them, although they could also scavenge weapons or <b>ammunition</b> from fallen friendly and enemy soldiers. This {{is in contrast to}} most RTS games, where units have unlimited <b>ammunition</b> supplies.|$|R
5000|$|The Divisional <b>Ammunition</b> Column {{collected}} <b>ammunition</b> {{from the}} Army Service Corps Divisional <b>Ammunition</b> Park, as the higher movement and supply of <b>ammunition</b> was coordinated at Corps level. A second scale of <b>ammunition</b> was {{stored in the}} Divisional <b>Ammunition</b> Park whilst a third scale was stored in the Corps <b>Ammunition</b> Park, which received and held replenishment from the Corps Ordnance Depot. Mechanical transport companies of the Army Service Corps carried out <b>ammunition</b> supply for RGA Heavy and Siege Batteries, given one company was included within each Army and Corps. [...] The Brigade <b>Ammunition</b> Columns and Divisional <b>Ammunition</b> Columns thus carried ordinarily seven or eight kinds at least of field, horse, howitzer and heavy gun shrapnel, howitzer and heavy gun lyddite shells, cartridges for the four different guns employed and pom-pom cartridges for the cavalry, in all twelve distinct types and varied small arms and machine gun <b>ammunition.</b> Consequently, the rounds of each kind in charge of each <b>ammunition</b> column must vary {{in accordance with the}} work expected of the combatant unit to which it belongs.|$|R

25|$|Kalimnos {{had fallen}} to the Germans on 7 September, and three days later the {{batteries}} of Leros had started firing on that island. This continuous firing, along with the constant air strikes, wore the guns, and seriously depleted the ammunition reserves; the local command asked for more <b>ammunitions,</b> and the destroyer Artigliere and Velite were sent from Taranto, but most of their cargo of ammunition was unloaded during their stop in Alexandria, so only a minimal part of them was eventually delivered to Leros. In {{the last part of}} October, Italian and British submarines made several supply runs to Leros: HMS Rorqual (three), HMS Severn (three), the Italian submarines Zoea (two), Atropo (one), Filippo Corridoni (one) and Ciro Menotti (one); overall, the submarines brought to Leros 17 men, 225 tons of supplies, twelve 40mm Bofors guns, and one jeep. Aircraft were also used for transport of supplies. Despite all efforts, <b>ammunitions</b> were still scarce, whereas food and medicines would last for many months.|$|E
