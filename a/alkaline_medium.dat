The acting chlorinating agent in this reaction is hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which has to be generated by protonation of hypochlorite, and then reacts in a nucleophilic substitution of the hydroxyl against the amino group. The reaction occurs quickest at around pH8. At higher pH values the concentration of hypochlorous acid is lower, at lower pH values ammonia is protonated to form ammonium ions , which do not react further.|$|E

The bile {{is not simply a}} digestive secretion, like the saliva or the gastric juice; it contains matters destined to mix in, and after a certain amount of change to be passed out of the body with, the faeces; among these substances, of which some portion is doubtless excretory, are compounds containing sulphur-- the bile salts. There is also a colouring matter, bili verdin, which may possibly also be excretory. If the student will compare Sections 10 and 11, he will notice that in those paragraphs no account is taken of the sulphur among the katastases, the account does not balance, and he will at once see that here probably is the missing item on the outgoing side. The bile, through the presence of these salts, is strongly alkaline, and so stops the action of the gastric juice, and prepares for that of the pancreas, which can act only in an <b>alkaline</b> <b>medium.</b> The fermentive action of the bile is trifling; it dissolves fats, to a certain extent, and is antiseptic, that is, it prevents putrefaction to which the chyme might be liable; it also seems to act as a natural purgative.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{chemical}} durability and mechanical properties {{of a kind}} of alkali-proof basalt fiber BF-CMD- 01 and its reinforced F 46 epoxy resin matrix composites are presented. The basalt fiber was boiled in distilled water, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, respectively. Then the mass loss and strength change of the fibers were studied showing that the alkali resistance of the basalt fiber is better than acid resistance. The flexural properties and surface morphologies of the composites were investigated after being immersed in 8 kinds of chemical mediums for 15, 30 and 90 days. Due to the difference of basalt fiber resistance in two kinds of mediums, the composites corrosion behaviors differ greatly in acid and alkaline reactions. In acid mediums, the flexural strength and flexural modulus change in the same way. In <b>alkaline</b> <b>mediums,</b> the flexural modulus keeps close to the original value while the flexural strength declines gradually. Additionally, the mechanical properties of basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) and S- 2 glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) have been tested, and analyzed contrastively. The results show that the interface formed between basalt fiber and epoxy resin is better than that of glass fiber and epoxy resin.

40|$|Chloride {{exchange}} in resealed human erythrocyte ghosts can be irreversibly inhibited with phenylglyoxal, a reagent specific for the modification of arginyl residues in proteins. Phenylglyoxal inhibits anion transport in two distinct ways. At 0 degrees C, inhibition is instantaneous and fully reversible, whereas at higher temperature in an <b>alkaline</b> extracellular <b>medium,</b> covalent binding of phenylglyoxal {{leads to an}} irreversible inhibition of the transport membranes system. Indiscriminate modification of membrane arginyl residues was prevented by reacting the with phenylglyoxal in an <b>alkaline</b> extracellular <b>medium</b> while maintaining intracellular pH near neutrality. The rate of modification of anion transport depends on phenylglyoxal concentration, pH, temperature, {{and the presence of}} anions and reversible inhibitors of the anion transport system in fashions that are fully compatible with the conclusion that phenylglyoxal modifies arginyl residues that are essential for anion binding and translocation. Phenylglyoxal reacts rapidly with the deprotonated form of the reactive groups. It is proposed that the effects of anions and of negatively charged transport inhibitors on the rate of irreversible binding of phenylglyoxal are related to the effects of the anions on a positive interfacial potential. This potential determines the local pH, and thereby the concentration of deprotonated groups, in an exofacial region of the anion transport protein...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} an experimental investigation aimed at establishing whether pH affects the cyclic strength of artificial and natural fine-grained soils. The undrained cyclic behavior of low plasticity (liquid limit less than 30) kaolin and illite-sand mixtures, medium plasticity (liquid limit less than 50) bentonite-sand mixture, and medium plasticity natural soil recovered from the sliding zone of an earthquakeinduced landslide was studied by means of a ring-shear apparatus with a view to understanding the structural changes that occurred at different pH. The data obtained for the low plasticity clay-sand mixtures indicated that changes in pH could slightly affect the soil resistance to liquefaction. For the bentonite-sand mixture of medium plasticity, the results not only revealed the strong influence of pH but they also demonstrated that in acidic and <b>alkaline</b> <b>mediums</b> the cyclic strength of soil significantly decreased. The outcome of tests on the natural soil corroborated the tendency observed for the bentonite-sand mixture, thus emphasizing the importance of pH in the cyclic behavior of medium plasticity clays.

50|$|The most {{significant}} advantage of AAEMFCs is that under alkaline conditions, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode {{are much more}} facile than in PEMFCs, potentially allowing use of inexpensive, non-noble metal catalysts such as silver or iron phthalocyanines for the cathode and nickel for the anode (fuel electrode). An <b>alkaline</b> <b>medium</b> accelerates oxidation of methanol making it an attractive fuel to be used. The large majority of membranes/ionomer {{that have been developed}} are fully hydrocarbon, allowing for much easier catalyst recycling and lower fuel crossover. Methanol has an advantage of easier storage and transportation and has higher volumetric energy density compared to hydrogen. Also, methanol crossover from anode to cathode is reduced in AAEMFCs compared to PEMFCs, due to the opposite direction of ion transport in the membrane, from cathode to anode. In addition, use of higher alcohols such as ethanol and propanol is possible in AAEMFCs, since anode potential in AAEMFCs is sufficient to oxidize C-C bonds present in alcohols.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} non-esterified myristate (C 14 : 0) or dodecyl sulfate was studied on passive {{swelling}} of rat liver mitochondria suspended in hypotonic <b>alkaline</b> KCl <b>medium</b> {{in the absence}} of the potassium ionophore valinomycin. Both compounds rapidly initiated large-amplitude swelling. However, they failed to initiate swelling when the mitochondria were suspended in hypotonic <b>alkaline</b> sucrose <b>medium.</b> In contrast to myristate or dodecyl sulfate, the non-ionic detergent Triton X- 100 initiated swelling of mitochondria in both of the media. The following findings indicate that the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is permeabilized by myristate to K+ and Cl− in a specific manner. (i) Swelling initiated by myristate did not respond to cyclosporin A, (ii) the protonophoric uncoupler FCCP was unable to mimic the myristate effect on swelling, and (iii) myristate-induced Cl−-permeation (measured with KCl medium plus valinomycin) was inhibited by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, quinine or ATP. Myristate- or dodecyl sulfate-initiated swelling was paralleled by the lowering of endogenous Mg 2 + content. Both effects, stimulation of swelling and depletion of endogenous Mg 2 + are correlated with each other. Similar effects have been reported previously for the carboxylic divalent cation ionophore calcimycin (A 23187). The A 23187 -induced swelling has identical inhibiting characteristics on Cl−-permeation with respect to N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, quinine and ATP as the myristate-stimulated swelling. Therefore, we conclude that non-esterified fatty acids increase the permeability of mitochondria to K+ and Cl− at alkaline pH by activating Mg 2 +-dependent ion-conducting pathways in IMM...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} pH on the {{liquefaction}} susceptibility of fine-grained soils were examined by performing undrained cyclic ring-shear tests on artificial mixtures and a natural soil under different pH conditions. Solutions of diluted sulphuric acid H 2 SO 4 and dissolved sodium hydroxide NaOH {{were used to}} create acidic and alkaline environments, respectively, while distilled water {{was used as a}} reference liquid. Low plasticity kaolin and illite-sand mixtures and a medium plasticity bentonite-sand mixture were selected to investigate the influence of plasticity and clay mineralogy on the pH-dependent response of soil to cyclic loading. The results showed that the effects of pH were more pronounced for the medium plasticity mixture, and depended greatly on the mineralogy of clay fraction. For example, in an acidic medium, the kaolin-sand mixture became slightly more resistant to liquefaction while the illite-sand mixture became more susceptible to liquefaction. The bentonite-sand mixture was observed to be the most sensitive to changes in pH environment. While resistant to liquefaction in distilled water, it rapidly liquefied in acidic and <b>alkaline</b> <b>mediums.</b> Cyclic behavior of a medium plasticity soil, which was collected from an earthquake-induced landslide, was also affected by changes in pH.

40|$|The {{demonstration}} by Lobry de Bruyn and van Ekenstein and succeeding {{workers of}} the interconversion of hexoses in alkaline solutions has often caused bacteriologists some apprehension. Just how much interconversion does occur in the mildly <b>alkaline</b> culture <b>mediums</b> containing simple sugars {{that are used in}} study-ing the fermentation reactions of bacteria? This possibility may be minimized because the bacteriological incubation periods are too short to permit much alteration of the sugar and because the chemical studies demonstrating interconversion have usually been carried out in much more alkaline solutions than are suitable for culture mediums.
