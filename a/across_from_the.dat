5|$|The mosque {{was built}} to commemorate {{military}} campaigns against the Maratha king Shivaji Bhonsle, although construction of the mosque exhausted the Mughal treasury and weakened the Mughal state. As {{a symbol of the}} mosque's importance, it was built directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lahore Fort and its Alamgiri Gate, which was concurrently built by Aurangzeb during construction of the mosque.|$|E

5|$|Considered {{by many to}} be {{the most}} {{important}} Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak.

5|$|For ease of {{training}} and fleet conversion, de Havilland designed the Comet's flight deck layout {{with a degree of}} similarity to the Lockheed Constellation, an aircraft that was popular at the time with key customers such as BOAC. The cockpit included full dual-controls for the captain and first officer, while a flight engineer controlled various key systems, including fuel, air conditioning, and electrical systems. The navigator occupied a dedicated station with a table <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flight engineer.|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, a {{monument}} honoring him was installed on Raoul Wallenberg Walk, named in his honor, <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{headquarters of the}} United Nations. The Swedish consulate commissioned the piece, created by Swedish sculptor Gustav Kraitz. The sculpture, Hope, is a replica of Wallenberg’s briefcase, a sphere, five pillars of black granite, and paving stones (setts) which were formerly used {{on the streets of}} the Budapest ghetto. There is also Wallenberg Forest in Riverdale, Bronx, established in 1990 and named Wallenberg Forest in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{all work}} units were {{continuously}} beaten by {{the guards and}} often shot or hanged at the gallows. Only the strongest men were selected from new arrivals daily to obtain the necessary replacements. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E

5|$|Multnomah County {{is named}} for Native Americans {{who lived in the}} area before {{settlement}} by non-indigenous people in the 19thcentury. Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90percent in the lower Columbia basin.|$|E
5|$|Right {{next to the}} Donald L. Tucker Center, the College of Law {{is located}} abetween Jefferson Street and Pensacola Street. The College of Business sits {{in the heart of}} campus near the Oglesby Student Union and <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> new Huge Classroom Building (HCB). The science and {{research}} quad is located in the northwest quadrant of campus. The College of Medicine, King Life Science buildings (biology) as well as the Department of Psychology are located on the west end of campus on Call Street and Stadium Drive.|$|E
5|$|The City of Pasadena has {{recognized}} Robinson in several ways. Brookside Park, situated {{next to the}} Rose Bowl, features a baseball diamond and stadium named Jackie Robinson Field. The city's Human Services Department operates the Jackie Robinson Center, a community outreach center that provides health services. In 1997, a $325,000 bronze sculpture (equal to $ today) by artists Ralph Helmick, Stu Schecter, and John Outterbridge depicting oversized nine-foot busts of Robinson and his brother Mack was erected at Garfield Avenue, <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main entrance of Pasadena City Hall; a granite footprint lists multiple donors to the commission project, which was organized by the Robinson Memorial Foundation and supported {{by members of the}} Robinson family.|$|E

5|$|The Toward 2016 Strategic Plan {{prescribed}} {{a complete}} reconfiguration of the Lincoln Center campus, {{to be completed}} by 2032. The first phase of the project, including renovations of the Lowenstein Building as well as a new Law School building and residence hall designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, were completed in 2014. In 2014, Fordham University had purchased a building at 45 Columbus Avenue and incorporated it in its Lincoln Center campus. The nine-story building is directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> former Law School building. Fordham University at Lincoln Center also shares a parking lot with New York Institute of Technology {{across the street from the}} Lincoln Center campus.|$|E
5|$|The Tuck School {{is located}} on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is {{situated}} in the rural, Upper Valley New England town of Hanover, New Hampshire. The campus of the Tuck School sits in a complex {{on the west side of}} Dartmouth's campus, near the Connecticut River. Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Green at the center of the campus; in 1930, the institution moved into Stell, Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall. Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck's six academic and administrative buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} required its own church building, {{and already}} owned land {{which could be}} used: in 1828 the Catholics had purchased a former hospital and the surrounding land in Gedangan, near the , and established an orphanage there. However, there were insufficient clergy for further development. Mgr. Joseph Lijnen (1815–82), who had become the congregation's pastor in 1858, left the Indies for Heythuysen, Netherlands. There, he convinced several Franciscan nuns {{to join him in}} the Indies and develop the congregation through education and ministry. Upon returning to the Indies, designs were made for a church building <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> orphanage and convent established for the nuns.|$|E

50|$|By 1924 {{three large}} docks (Hafenbecken) were built {{northeast}} of Contienen and northwest of Nasser Garten to alleviate Königsberg's economic difficulties after the Treaty of Versailles and {{the separation of}} East Prussia <b>from</b> Weimar Germany. <b>The</b> Holzhafen (wood harbor) was closest to Contienen, followed by the Industriehafen (industrial harbor) <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Ratshof and <b>the</b> Freihafen (free harbor) <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Kosse. <b>The</b> docks were often used by Seedienst Ostpreußen. Contienen was incorporated into Königsberg in 1927.|$|R
5|$|The newly established, {{strategically}} strong defensive British line {{remained in}} place until mid September 1918 when the advance to Damascus and Aleppo, which ended the war in this theatre, took place. It stretched <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean coast {{in the west to}} north and east of Jerusalem. The line was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern end of the line was secured on the Dead Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Great Western Railway in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, and in 1852 the railway company took over its running. Bath Spa railway station is the {{principal}} railway station in Bath. It was built in 1840 by Brunel. It is in an asymmetrical Tudor style with curving gables, and lies on the north bank of the Avon, with the line swerving elegantly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southern bank to the station and then back again.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Michigan Central Depot, {{from which}} the area took its name, no longer stands, but it was between the northeast {{side of the tracks}} and the west side of River Street, directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> freighthouse, since replaced by a parking lot. The freighthouse, built in 1878, does still stand, and the area immediately around the freighthouse is home to the Depot Town Farmers' Market, one of two farmers' markets in Ypsilanti. Also in the freighthouse courtyard, a caboose sits parallel to Rice Street.|$|E
