As the year ended, KroniK were hired by their former enemies, the Natural Born Thrillers, {{during which they}} helped them at the Starrcade event, by facing Reno and Big Vito in a tag team match, during which Reno turned on Vito and had been revealed {{as the one who}} had paid KroniK to assault Vito in the previous weeks. A month later, at Sin, KroniK turned faces by ending their association with Thrillers, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> on Thrillers leader Mike Sanders by helping Ernest Miller beat Sanders to become the WCW Commissioner. The following month, at SuperBrawl Revenge, KroniK made their final pay-per-view appearance, where they were scheduled to face Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell), in a #1 contender's match for the tag team titles. Clark was injured by Mike Awesome before the match, leaving Adams to face them in a handicap match, which he lost. KroniK remained with WCW until the company was purchased by WWF on March 23, 2001.|$|E

5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadron’s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot down. The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised {{that there was no}} hope of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly when they could not see it. At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about to change. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E
5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, a 19-yard field goal by Oilers kicker Toni Fritsch cut the score 14–3, {{but then the}} Steelers scored 17 points during the last 48 seconds of the second quarter. First, Houston running back Ronnie Coleman lost a fumble, and moments later Pittsburgh wide {{receiver}} Lynn Swann caught a 29-yard touchdown reception. Then Johnnie Dirden fumbled the ensuing kickoff, which led to Steelers wide receiver John Stallworth's 17-yard reception. After the Oilers got the ball back, Coleman fumbled again, and Roy Gerela kicked a field goal to increase Pittsburgh's lead, 31–3. Houston would never pose a threat {{for the rest of}} the game <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> over the ball 4 times in their 6 second-half possessions.|$|E

Knowing of the impending battle with the battleship reinforcements arriving from Russia (the Baltic Fleet), Tōgō chose not to risk his battleships by pursuing his enemy <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> about and headed back into Port Arthur, thus ending naval history's longest-range gunnery duel {{up to that time}} and the first modern clash of steel battleship fleets on the high seas.|$|E
25|$|He didn't {{run again}} until September, when he contested the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster and started as the odds-on favourite. Fordham held {{him up at}} the rear of the field, but had to start riding him before they had turned into the {{finishing}} straight. As the six-runner field entered the final furlong Lord Clifden had almost caught leaders Armagnac and Early Purl. He then overtook them inside the last furlong and won by half a length from Armagnac, with Early Purl a further three lengths back in third place. Two days later Lord Clifden raced in a sweepstakes of £10 each with £100 added. He got off to a bad start, losing several lengths to the rest of the field as Volturno went into the lead. Lord Clifden closed up on the field <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> into the straight. At the one-furlong pole Fordham asked him for an effort and stride by stride he caught Bohemia, who was then leading, and just overtook him at the line to win by a head. Queen Bertha finished third, three lengths behind the front two.|$|E

25|$|On 7 November, 835 Squadron {{claimed a}} Junkers Ju 88 damaged. The long Arctic night with only {{four hours of}} light a day—together with heavy seas and low visibility—hampered any {{operations}} by the Wildcats. In the darkness, the ships could hear the engines of the shadowing German aircraft closing in. Campanias night fighting Fulmar took off at 17:30, but its electrics failed as it was approaching the German aircraft and it was forced {{to return to the}} carrier. The Fulmar landed off centre and crashed into the safety barrier, putting itself and the carrier out of action. On 10 November, a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol reported 30 Junkers Ju88s approaching the convoy. The Wildcats took off to intercept the torpedo bombers and the escorts opened fire on them. The combined fire from the escorts and the Wildcats shot down four Ju88s, two more were claimed as probably shot down by the Wildcats, and another was severely damaged. Those Ju88s that did release their torpedoes failed to hit any of the ships and a number of the torpedoes were seen to detonate in the ships' wakes, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> away from the attack. Two of the Wildcats were also shot down by the barrage from the escorts. The combined losses had reduced the escort's fighter cover to three aircraft, one on Campania and two on Nairana. At 11:30, another group of Ju88 torpedo bombers were discovered approaching. Nairanas Wildcats took off and shot one down. The others, under fire from the escorts, dropped their torpedoes too soon and they all missed.|$|E
500|$|Where {{vehicles}} were landing, {{they found a}} narrow strip of beach with no shelter from enemy fire. Around 08:30, commanders suspended all such landings. This caused a jam of landing craft out to sea. The DUKWs had a particularly hard time {{of it in the}} rough conditions. [...] Take the 13 DUKWs carrying the 111th Field Artillery battalion of the 116th RCT: five were swamped soon after disembarking from the LCT, four were lost as they circled in the rendezvous area waiting to land, and one capsized <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> for the beach. Two were destroyed by enemy fire as they approached the beach and the lone survivor managed to offload its howitzer to a passing craft before it also succumbed to the sea. This one gun eventually landed in the afternoon.|$|E
500|$|In {{the race}} the early pace was slow, and Barrett {{positioned}} Orme {{near the front}} of the field. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> into the finishing straight, Orme was just leading from La Fleche, but Barrett soon picked up the whip and it was clear Orme was beaten. La Fleche went on to win easily by two lengths from Sir Hugo, with Watercress a further three lengths back in third, May Duke in fourth and Orme in fifth. The remainder of the field, led by The Lover, were at least twenty lengths behind Orme. After the race Barrett said: [...] "I never was so disappointed in my life. He never took hold of his bit as he used to do; run as dead as a stone, and wouldn't make an effort." [...] Other jockeys in the race agreed, saying Orme was [...] "sulking" [...] throughout the race. After the race, some suggested that Orme simply did not stay, the St Leger distance being too far for him.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers criticised the {{repetition}} of the game's levels. Francesco Serino (Eurogamer) criticised the variation between levels and said it wasn't too long before he was seeing similar levels because of the game's simplicity. He said that the levels are usually well made but are too often made for certain characters, which adds more gameplay {{because of the time}} it takes to discover the best strategies to complete a level. Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb) liked the overall gameplay of Monaco but disliked some of the later levels <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> into [...] "tedious exercises in trial-and-error". Ben Allan (Gameplanet) said the single-player mode was less fun due to there being fewer variations and less chaos. Anton Bjurvald said that he fell in love with the simplicity of the graphics and liked the majority of the gameplay but said that it seemed like the game's artificial intelligence was made too easy to be fooled.|$|E
500|$|Hood {{continued}} on course until 17:40 when gunfire was spotted {{in the direction}} to which his light cruiser [...] had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes. Chester encountered four light cruisers of Hipper's 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate {{and was able to}} drive the German cruisers away from Chester. At 17:53 Invincible opened fire on [...] and the other two Invincibles followed two minutes later. The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 18:00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> Invincible hit Wiesbaden in the engine room and knocked out her engines while Inflexible hit [...] once. The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser [...] and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half-Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession. They were driven off by Hood's remaining light cruiser [...] and the five destroyers of his escort. In a confused action the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer [...] with gunfire. Having turned due west to close on Beatty's ships, the Invincibles were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes, but Invincible turned north, while Inflexible and Indomitable turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes. All the torpedoes missed, although one passed underneath Inflexible without detonating. As Invincible turned north, her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix the problem, but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west.|$|E
500|$|This new version, {{unveiled}} in early 1997, still used the Warcraft II engine as its base, but with distinct changes. The Terrans and the Protoss were detailed {{to a much}} greater extent than at E3 1996, revealing many of the game's units in forms {{similar to those of}} the final product. Blizzard Entertainment also began the careful task of balancing the game's three races. However, in February 1997, Bob Fitch declared that, despite these efforts, the game engine was simply incapable of delivering features requested by the developers: cloaking, burrowing and many other special effects. The development team therefore embarked upon a two-month overhaul of the graphics engine. This new beta version was far closer to the release version, as the races took on their now-recognisable graphical styles: the brown insectoid design of the Zerg, the sleek yellow armour of the Protoss, and the grey machinery of the Terrans. Most of the unit designs were established at this point, their graphics only undergoing minor changes. Several game features were also added at this stage in the development that never made it into the final release, such as ships banking <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned,</b> transport ships landing on the ground to pick up and drop off passengers, and efficiency ranks, although Terran units would retain ranks as a purely aesthestic feature. The Terran Valkyrie-class missile frigate also appeared in this build of the game, although it was removed before the final release, only to be reintroduced later in the [...] expansion.|$|E

500|$|At around 21:20, the II Scouting Group again {{encountered}} the British battlecruisers. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> away, Pillau briefly {{came under fire}} from the battlecruisers, though to no effect. [...] and [...] both fired salvos at the ship before turning {{their attention to the}} battlecruiser Pillaus official record states that the British shooting was very inaccurate. Pillau and Frankfurt spotted the cruiser [...] and several destroyers shortly before 23:00. They each fired a torpedo at the British cruiser before turning back toward the German line without using their searchlights or guns to avoid drawing the British toward the German battleships. By 04:00 on 1June, the German fleet had evaded the British fleet and reached Horns Reef. At 09:30, Pillau was detached from the fleet to assist the crippled battlecruiser , which was having trouble navigating back to port. Pillau steamed ahead of Seydlitz to guide her back to Wilhelmshaven, but shortly after 10:00, the battlecruiser ran aground off Sylt. After freeing Seydlitz at 10:30, the voyage back resumed, with a division of minesweepers steaming ahead testing the depth to prevent another grounding. Seydlitz continued to take on water and sink lower in the water; she turned around and steamed in reverse in an attempt to improve the situation. Pillau also attempted to tow the battlecruiser, but was unable because the line repeatedly snapped. A pair of pumping steamers arrived in the evening, and slow progress was made through the night, with Pillau still guiding the voyage. The ships reached the outer Jade lightship at 08:30 and anchored twenty minutes later. In the course of the engagement, Pillau had fired 113 rounds of 15cm ammunition and four 8.8cm shells. She also launched one torpedo. Her crew suffered four men killed and twenty-three wounded.|$|E
