40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that fiscal policy will have greater responsibilities for cyclical stabilisation in the EMU, given {{the loss of}} the monetary instrument at national level. At the same time, the EMU’s budgetary framework emphasises the need to rely on automatic fiscal stabilisers, rather than active policies, in cushioning the business cycle. We show that automatic stabilisers are relatively powerful {{in the event of a}} shock to private consumption, but less so as regards shocks to private investment and exports. In respect of supply side shocks, automatic stabilisers are largely ineffective, which may in fact be a good thing to the extent that supply-side disturbances call for structural adjustment rather than cyclical stabilisation. Looking ahead, one of the challenges facing policy-makers will be how to design tax and welfare reforms which, while improving incentives and market functioning, do not stifle – and in fact could strengthen – the impact of automatic stabilisers. cyclical stabilisation; <b>automatic</b> stabilisers; <b>Stability</b> and Growth Pact...|$|R

With the addition of the inlets in the automatic configuration, the phugoid mode was slightly divergent and the height mode was divergent with a time to double amplitude of about 114 seconds.

50|$|After a {{distinguished}} career in astronomy and shortly before becoming Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Samuel Pierpont Langley started a serious investigation into aerodynamics {{at what is}} today the University of Pittsburgh. In 1891 he published Experiments in Aerodynamics detailing his research, {{and then turned to}} building his designs. He hoped to achieve <b>automatic</b> aerodynamic <b>stability,</b> so he gave little consideration to in-flight control. On May 6, 1896, Langley's Aerodrome No. 5 made the first successful sustained flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon, one of 1005 m and a second of 700 m, at a speed of approximately 25 mi/h km/h. On both occasions the Aerodrome No. 5 landed in the water as planned, because in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear. On November 28, 1896, another successful flight was made with the Aerodrome No. 6. This flight, of 1460 m, was witnessed and photographed by Alexander Graham Bell. The Aerodrome No. 6 was actually Aerodrome No. 4 greatly modified. So little remained of the original aircraft that it was given a new designation.|$|R

It was of wood construction with a tailskid landing gear, powered by a 20 hp (15 kW) Advance V-4 air-cooled engine [...] It used a wing with a shape patented by José Weiss which was claimed to provide <b>automatic</b> lateral <b>stability,</b> so there were no ailerons or wing warping mechanisms. Weiss was also responsible {{for the design of}} its tractor propeller. The wings, fuselage and tail surfaces were covered with a blue-grey rubberised fabric, hence the nickname Bluebird. After the aircraft had been displayed at the second Olympia Aero Exhibition, Handley Page successfully made a few straight hops in the Bluebird on 26 May 1910, but crashed at the first attempt to make a turn. Handley Page improved the design to include lateral control via wing warping and fitted a 25 hp (18.6 kW) Alvaston water-cooled flat-twin engine. The rebuilt aircraft was designated Handley Page Type C but it refused to fly. Although work was completed on modifying the aircraft to take a 50 hp (37 kW) Isaacson radial engine it was abandoned in late 1910.

The study involved maximum loadability identification on individual load bus and simultaneous increase at several load buses. This is to identify {{the strength of the}} system when single load increase was performed to the system as compared to multi-load increase. To obtain the optimum load values prior to voltage instability occurrence; Evolutionary Programming (EP) technique is introduced as the optimization technique. Results obtained from the studies revealed that the implementation of EP in identifying the optimal point of single maximum loadability and also for the several load increase are very accurate indicated by FVSI close to 0. 95 as the reference ceiling value. It was also discovered that, the maximum loadability point of a single load is higher as compared to load simultaneous load increase at several load buses. This due to the fact that, the system can sustain higher load if only one load is subjected to loading variation, while considering other load buses maintained at the base case condition.
