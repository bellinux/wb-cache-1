5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
5|$|Impala browse {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{relationships}} between the degree of dietary overlap and food availability, and implications for food selectivity of fish species were evaluated at floodplain lakes on the upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil. The hypothesis tested were: i) species become less selective in lakes with high <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> food resources; and ii) species (interspecific) or individual (intraspecific) present higher food overlap in conditions <b>of</b> high <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> food <b>resources.</b> In general, with the results was observed that species become less selective when the environment provided higher <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> food <b>resources.</b> Interspecific overlap did not show a pattern when evaluating <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> food <b>resources</b> in the lakes. However, intraspecific overlap {{tended to be more}} accentuated in conditions <b>of</b> high <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> food...|$|R

5|$|In 1858, {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} from Keosauqua, Iowa, Leonard John Rose, formed the party after hearing stories from gold miners returning from California. He subsequently financed a well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses and two hundred head of purebred red Durham cattle. He also acquired four large covered wagons and three yoke of oxen {{to pull them}} each wagon. The Rose company left Iowa in early April, and in mid-May {{they were joined by}} the Baley company, led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley. Their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of cattle. John Udell, a 62-year-old Baptist minister kept a daily journal of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites, documenting their progress, and noting the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists. Fractures in their wing bones also {{indicate that they}} were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures {{may have been the}} result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and manoeuvrable in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely vestigial, and may have been used for display behaviour and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E
25|$|Intra- and inter-specific agonistic {{behavior}} is documented, but varies greatly among slug species. Slugs often resort to aggression, attacking both conspecifics and individuals from other species when competing for resources. This aggressiveness is {{also influenced by}} seasonality, because the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> such as shelter and food may be compromised due to climatic conditions. Slugs are prone to attack during the summer, when the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> is reduced. During winter, the aggressive responses are substituted by a gregarious behavior.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The volume <b>of</b> {{information}} <b>resources</b> potentially {{available in}} the globe is massive; hence it becomes necessary to examine available information resources for academics research activity in the academia. This study, therefore, examined the perception <b>of</b> academics on <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> information <b>resources</b> for research productivity in federal universities in Nigeria. Descriptive survey research design was adopted. The Multistage sampling technique was used to select 1, 057 academic staff members from twelve federal universities in the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. The categories of academic staff covered {{in the study were}} from professorial cadre to graduate assistant. The instruments used for data collection were: <b>Availability</b> <b>of</b> Information <b>Resources</b> (r = 0. 69) and Research Productivity of Academics (r= 0. 91). Eight hundred and seventy-three copies of the questionnaire were used for analysis. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient. There was no significant relationship between <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> information <b>resources</b> and academics research productivity. The mean score <b>of</b> information <b>resources</b> <b>availability</b> was adequate in Nigerian federal universities libraries (= 2. 41; SD = 0. 90) which means that information resources were readily available to academics for research productivity. To further sustain academic staff research productivity, librarians should organize continuous awareness program on <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> information <b>resources</b> to increase research productivity of academics...|$|R
25|$|The Industrial Revolution on Continental Europe came {{a little}} later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this {{involved}} the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as iron), the different <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> locally meant that only {{some aspects of the}} British technology were adopted.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} is {{a learning experience}} between a consumer and a social services provider. One dis{{advantage is}} a limited <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> The models {{that can be used}} for it are the social-ecological model, which provides a framework for program design, the logic model, which is a graphical depiction of logical relationships between the resources, activities, outputs and outcomes of a program, the social action model, whose objectives are to recognize the change around a community in order to preserve or improve standards, understand the social action process/model is a conceptualization of how directed change takes place, and understand how the social action model can be implemented as a successful community problem solving tool, and program evaluation, which involves the ongoing systematic assessment of community-based programs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{contributing}} {{factor for the}} lack of decisive action was the necessity to fight for secure resources. Armies were expected to support themselves in the field by imposing contributions (taxing local populations) upon a hostile, or even neutral, territory. Subjecting a particular area to contributions was deemed more important than pursuing a defeated army from the battlefield to destroy it. It was primarily financial concerns and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> that shaped campaigns, as armies struggled to outlast the enemy in a long war of attrition. The only decisive action during the whole war came in Ireland where William III crushed the forces of James II in a campaign for legitimacy and control of Britain and Ireland. But unlike Ireland, Louis XIV's Continental wars were never fought without compromise: the fighting provided a foundation for diplomatic negotiations and did not dictate a solution.|$|E
