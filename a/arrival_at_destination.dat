40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{navigating}} a set of moving agents, e. g. automated guided vehicles, through a transportation network so as to bring each agent to its destination at a specified time. Each pair of agents is required to be separated by a minimal distance, generally agent-dependent, at all times. The speed range, initial position, required destination, and required time of <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> for each agent are assumed provided. The movement of each agent is governed by a controlled differential equation (state equation). The problem consists in choosing for each agent a path and a control strategy so as to meet the constraints and reach the destination at the required time. This problem arises in various fields of transportation, including Air Traffic Management and train coordination, and in robotics. The main contribution of the paper is a model that allows to recast this problem as a decoupled collection of problems in classical optimal control and is easily generalized to the case when inertia cannot be neglected. Some qualitative insight into solution behavior is obtained using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. Sample numerical solutions are computed using a numerical optimal control solver...|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of public transport, all the agents {{involved}} (citizens, operators and authorities) {{agree that it is}} very important to be able to access appropriate information. In the case of public transport users, appropriate information means coherent, useful information that facilitates access to the means of transport in question. These requirements become even more relevant when the transport user is a person with special needs. In this article, we describe a public transport passenger pervasive guidance system that has specifically been conceived for this type of passenger (the blind and the deaf). The system provides passengers with information that ensures that they are oriented throughout their trip, notifying them of any events occurring in the vehicle that could affect their itinerary or that may be of interest (points of specific relevance, <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>destination,</b> unforeseen incidents, etc.). For this reason, the system can be used to help visiting tourists. Currently, three interface types have been developed: one for the blind, one for the deaf and one for tourists. Using these interfaces, vehicle route information is provided by means of audio messages, graphic messages accompanied by terminal vibration or text messages in different languages. The architecture of the system is inspired by a pervasive computer model and its most relevant properties are thus: its distributed nature, its high level of accessibility, scalability and interoperability. Another differentiating property of the system is that it uses local communication infrastructure.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{navigating}} a set (fleet) of aircraft in an aerial route network so as to bring each aircraft to its destination at a specified time and with minimal distance separation assured between all aircraft at all times. The speed range, initial position, required destination, and required time of <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> for each aircraft are assumed provided. Each aircraft’s movement is governed by a controlled differential equation (state equation). The problem consists in choosing for each aircraft a path in the route network and a control strategy so as to meet the constraints and reach the destination at the required time. The main contribution of the paper is a model that allows to recast this problem as a decoupled collec-tion of problems in classical optimal control and is easily generalized to the case when inertia cannot be neglected. Some qualitative insight into solu-tion behavior is obtained using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. Sample numerical solutions are computed using a numerical optimal control solver. The proposed model is first step toward increasing the fidelity of continuous-time control models of air traffic in a terminal airspace. The Pontryagin Maximum Principle implies the polygonal shape of those portions of the state trajectories away from those states in which one or more aircraft pair are at minimal separation. The model also confirms the intuition that, the narrower the allowed speed ranges of the aircraft, the smaller the space o...|$|E
40|$|Migration detours, {{the spatial}} {{deviation}} from the shortest route, are a widespread phenomenon in migratory species, especially if barriers must be crossed. Moving longer distances causes additional efforts in energy and time, and to be adaptive, this should be counterbalanced by favorable condition en route. We compared migration patterns of nightingales that travelled along different flyways from their European breeding sites to the African nonbreeding sites. We tested for deviations from shortest routes and related the observed and expected routes to the habitat availability at ground during autumn and spring migration. All individuals flew detours of varying extent. Detours were largest and seasonally consistent in western flyway birds, whereas birds on the central and eastern flyways showed less detours during autumn migration, but large detours during spring migration (eastern flyway birds). Neither migration durations nor the time of <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> {{were related to the}} lengths of detours. Arrival at the breeding site was nearly synchronous in birds flying different detours. Flying detours increased the potential availability of suitable broad-scale habitats en route only along the western flyway. Habitat availability on observed routes remained similar or even decreased for individuals flying detours on the central or the eastern flyway as compared to shortest routes. Thus, broad-scale habitat distribution may partially explain detour performance, but the weak detour-habitat association along central and eastern flyways suggests that other factors shape detour extent regionally. Prime candidate factors are the distribution of small suitable habitat patches at local scale as well as winds specific for the region and altitude...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Spatial {{cognition}} is {{an essential}} literacy for human beings. It enables people to recognize landmarks, identify spatial pattern, and make spatial decisions. To evaluate spatial cognitive abilities, way-finding has been widely adopted in previous studies. In the process of way-finding, one has to keep destination in memory, keep track of path, decide direction by checking surrounding environment, and head to the destination. However, research involving way-finding test in real-world situation is difficult to conduct, if {{a large amount of}} samples is required. Therefore, this study developed a way-finding test by using Google Maps Street View. Taking advantage of the Google Maps API, participants could navigate in areal-world environment on computer while behavior data were recorded. In this test, sixty five participants in Taipei area were recruited. The participants first read a paper map showing the start point and destination and then started to navigate in Google Maps Street View with a five minute limit. After the way-finding test, the participants continued with two psychological tasks, namely “mental rotation” and “Monkey Ladder”. Monkey Ladder measures the capacity of spatial working memory capacity, while mental rotation requires maintaining and matching information in different perspective. Furthermore, Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (SBSOD), and GeoSpatial Thinking Ability Test (GSTAT) developed by this research team were given. The results of way-finding performances were categorized into <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> (11 / 65), seeking and approaching destination (16 / 65) and fail to arrive (38 / 65).

40|$|The vehicle {{navigation}} problem {{studied in}} Bell (2009) is revisited and a time-dependent reverse Hyperstar algorithm is presented. This minimises the expected time of <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> the <b>destination,</b> and all intermediate nodes, where expectation {{is based on}} a pessimistic (or risk-averse) view of unknown link delays. This may also be regarded as a hyperpath version of the Chabini and Lan (2002) algorithm, which itself is a time-dependent A* algorithm. Links are assigned undelayed travel times and maximum delays, both of which are potentially functions of the time of <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> the respective link. Probabilities for link use are sought that minimise the driver's maximum exposure to delay on the approach to each node, leading to the determination of a pessimistic expected time of <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> the <b>destination</b> and all intermediate nodes. Since the context considered is vehicle navigation, the probability of link use measures link attractiveness, so a link with a zero probability of use is unattractive while a link with a probability of use equal to one will have no attractive alternatives. A solution algorithm is presented and proven to solve the problem provided the node potentials are feasible and a FIFO condition applies to undelayed link travel times. The paper concludes with a numerical example. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
