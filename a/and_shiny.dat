The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species.

5|$|Starting on January 3 {{and lasting}} until January 9, 2011, in the United States, players of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver {{were able to}} visit GameStop stores to {{download}} the special shiny Raikou that was previously given out for Phantom Ruler: Zoroark pre-order ticket holders in Japan. Similar downloads would be available for the shiny Entei (January 17 to 23) <b>and</b> <b>shiny</b> Suicune (January 31 to February 6). All three of these Pokémon still enabled the event for Zoroark in the North American Black and White versions. These three Pokémon were later distributed via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for European, Australian, and North American markets (for a second time) starting February 7 to 13 with Raikou, again, with subsequent staggered releases for Entei and Suicune throughout February.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed <b>and</b> <b>shiny</b> appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles <b>and</b> <b>shiny</b> black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E

50|$|Vitreous {{china is}} an enamel coating that {{is applied to}} ceramics, {{particularly}} porcelain, after they've been fired, though the name can also refer to the finished piece as a whole.

25|$|The gold-painted lacquer pieces {{begin by}} {{cleaning}} {{the surface with}} a mixture of gasoline and manganese and repairing any chips in the wood. A base is applied and then layers of lacquer are applied until the surface is smooth <b>and</b> <b>shiny.</b> The most common base colors are black, dark brown and purple, green and orange. The last step is to add tiny pieces of gold leaf with cotton swabs soaked in oil to highlight portion of the design. Colors are then applied to the body of the design, contrasting with the darker base.|$|E
25|$|Each nest is {{occupied}} by several adult females. When a larva matures in its cell, it lays down a layer of silk threads on the cell walls, then coats it with layers of a smooth <b>and</b> <b>shiny</b> substance, creating a sort of cocoon. The larva then defecates and smears its feces in vertical streaks {{on the inside of}} the cocoon to cover the lower half of the inner wall. This behavior is unique in E. imperialis, but the reason for its behavior is still unknown. Males, after emerging from their cells, leave immediately and have been observed to never re-enter the nest.|$|E
25|$|From 1609 the VOC had {{a trading}} post in Japan (Hirado, Nagasaki), which used local paper {{for its own}} administration. However, the paper was also traded to the VOC's other trading posts and even the Dutch Republic. Many {{impressions}} of the Dutch Golden Age artist Rembrandt's prints were done on Japanese paper. From about 1647 Rembrandt sought increasingly to introduce variation into his prints by using different sorts of paper, and printed most of his plates regularly on Japanese paper. He also used the paper for his drawings. The Japanese paper types – which was actually imported from Japan by the VOC – attracted Rembrandt with its warm, yellowish colour. They are often smooth <b>and</b> <b>shiny,</b> whilst Western paper has a more rough and matt surface. Moreover, the VOC's imported Chinese porcelain wares are often depicted in many Dutch Golden Age genre paintings, especially in Jan Vermeer's paintings.|$|E
