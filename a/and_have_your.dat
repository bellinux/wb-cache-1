25|$|If you {{are doing}} a really convincing job, then {{you should be able}} to put a bent key on the table and comment, ‘Look, it is still bending’, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> spectators really believe that it is. This may sound the height of boldness; however, the effect is astounding – and {{combined}} with suggestion, it does work.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Evans, a Director of Elections Systems and Policy of the AEC, {{wrote in}} 2006 that [...] "It {{is not the}} case, as some people have claimed, {{that it is only}} {{compulsory}} to attend the polling place <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> name marked off and this has been upheld by a number of legal decisions." [...] Yet, practically, it remains the fact that having received a ballot paper, the elector can simply fold it up and put it into the ballot box without formally marking it, if he or she objects, in principle, to casting a vote. However, the consistently low number of informal votes each election indicates that having attended, had his or her name marked off, very few electors then choose not to vote formally.|$|E

2500|$|In 1563 the Amako of Izumo {{province}} won {{a victory}} over the Kikkawa with 33 of their adversaries wounded by tanegashima, as a result, in the year 1567 Takeda Shingen announced that, [...] "Hereafter, the guns {{will be the most}} important arms, therefore decrease the number of spears per unit, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> most capable men carry guns". Oda Nobunaga used tanegashima in the Battle of Anegawa (1570), and again against the powerful Takeda clan in the Battle of Nagashino (1575), 3,000 gunners helped win the battle, firing by volleys of a thousand at a time. They were concealed across a river and used breastworks to effectively stop enemy infantry and cavalry charges while being protected. The defeat of the powerful Takeda clan brought about permanent changes in battle tactics.|$|E
2500|$|Ros-Lehtinen {{has been}} a notable Republican voice in favor of LGBT rights. In a Winter 2013 {{interview}} with the Human Rights Campaign, she stated that her support for same-sex marriage was based on [...] "coming from Cuba, losing my homeland to communism, seeing the state control everything—I’m a person that believes in individual liberties and not having the government control everything.” When asked about her support for her son Rodrigo, a transgender LGBT rights advocate, Ros-Lehtinen commented that: It’s important for families to support their children and to support their children’s choices. It’s important {{to listen to your}} children, accept your children <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> children know that you love them unconditionally. It’s not “I love you, but…”—there’s [...] no “but.” “It’s just “I love you.” … To do otherwise is—you’re hurting yourself, you’re going to shun your child or grandchild. You’re going to say, “No, I have my views and my views are the perfect views and no one can have a different point of view. I’m right and everything else is wrong.” And that’s a lonely way to live. It just means you’ll be out of that person’s life, and who wants to be cut out of their child’s life? ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
