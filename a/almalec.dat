5000|$|Smith {{reported}} {{the theory of}} Charles Fellows that the site of Podalia was at Eskihisar (Turkish for [...] "old town"), near <b>Almalec,</b> where there are remains of ancient Cyclopean town walls and rock tombs; but the Princeton Encyclopedia dismisses that theory, and another that would place Podalia at Armutlu, as lacking evidence. A better theory, it holds, is that the town was situated at a place still called Podalia or Podamia on a hill at {{the northwest corner of}} the Avlan Gölü lake, 16 km south of Elmali. It sees as even more likely, and indeed almost certain, a site at Söğle, where there are remains of a large town for which no other identification is possible, since the only other candidate would be Choma, now positively identified with Hacimusalar, southwest of Elmali.|$|E
