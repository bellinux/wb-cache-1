25|$|Nalbuphine is a semi-synthetic opioid <b>agonist-antagonist</b> <b>analgesic</b> of the {{phenanthrene}} series. It is chemically {{related to}} the widely used opioid antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, and the potent opioid analgesic, oxymorphone. It is available in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride per mL. Both strengths contain 0.94% sodium citrate hydrous, 1.26% citric acid anhydrous, 0.1% sodium metabisulfite, and 0.2% of a 9:1 mixture of methylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives; pH is adjusted, if necessary, with hydrochloric acid. The 10mg/mL strength contains 0.1% sodium chloride.|$|E
40|$|The {{analgesic}} {{efficacy of}} two doses of conorphone (20 and 40 mg), a mixed <b>agonist-antagonist</b> <b>analgesic,</b> {{were compared to}} two doses of codeine for postoperative pain in the oral surgery model. Each subject received 2 of the 4 possible treatment at two separate sessions in an incomplete block, single crossover design. Both doses of conorphone and the 60 mg dose of codeine were superior to 30 mg of codeine for the various indices of analgesic activity. The 40 mg dose of conorphone resulted in {{a high incidence of}} side effects (25 / 30 subjects) such as drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The low dose of conorphone resulted in side effects similar to 60 mg of codeine {{with the exception of a}} greater incidence of drowsiness. These data suggest that while 40 mg of conorphone may not be well tolerated clinically, 20 mg of conorphone may be an alternative to 60 mg of codeine for postoperative pain...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to prolong {{analgesia}} and minimize central depressant effects, {{there has been much}} recent interest in the administration of opioid analgesics by the intrathecal route (Yaksh and Rudy, 1976; Winnie, 1980). Although in terms of "efficacy " this practice has achieved considerable success, a disturbing feature has been the appearance of severe respiratory depression in some patients several hours after administration (Glynn et al., 1979; Davies, Cleaver-Tolhurst and James, 1980 a, b). The precise mechanism is unknown; however, it is likely that this effect could arise from the passage of drug cranially up the spinal canal, redistribution via the systemic circulation (Covino et al., 1980), or a more localized action on sensory motor neurones caused by the physicochemical properties of the agents (Yaksh and Reddy. 1981). The novel opioid <b>agonist-antagonist</b> <b>analgesic,</b> meptazinol, has been used by i. v. and i. m. routes in the treatment of severe pain (Cohen et al., 1983; Paymaster, 1983; Robson, 1983). On this basis, and considering the drug's minimal propensity for the production of respiratory depression (Cohen et al., 1983; Paymaster, 1983; Robson, 1983), {{it has been suggested that}} meptazinol may offer therapeutic advantages if given by the intrathecal route. Thus, as a prelude to any extensive clinical studies, it was considered important to examine the pharmacokinetics of meptazinol within th...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the search}} for opioid analgesics with less abuse {{potential}} than pure mu agonist opioids, a number of semi-synthetic opiates were developed. These substances {{are referred to as}} mixed <b>agonist–antagonists</b> <b>analgesics.</b> Nalbuphine (brand name Nubain, Raltrox) belongs to this group of substances. [...] The mixed agonists-antagonists drug class exerts their analgesic actions by agonistic activity at opioid kappa (“κ”) receptors. While all drugs in this class possess opioid mu (“μ”) receptor antagonistic activity leading to less abuse potential, nalbuphine is the only approved drug in the mixed agonist-antagonist class listed in terms of its pharmacological actions and selectivities on opiate receptors as a full mu antagonist as well as a full kappa agonist. (Gustein et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|The mixed <b>agonist-antagonist</b> <b>analgesics</b> buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, {{pentazocine}} and picenadol {{were compared}} to the prototype mu and kappa agonists morphine and Mr 2033, respectively, in the following tests in rhesus monkeys: overt behavioral effects upon acute administration in drug-naive animals; discriminative stimulus properties in monkeys trained to respond to either etorphine or ethylketazocine; self-administration of the test agent relative to codeine; single dose suppression and precipitation in withdrawn and non-withdrawn morphine-dependent monkeys, respectively; and primary addiction studies in drug-naive animals. Whereas both buprenorphine and nalbuphine precipitate withdrawal in morphine-dependent monkeys, withdrawal following chronic administration of buprenorphine resulted in no observable signs of abstinence, while nalbuphine withdrawal {{was similar to that}} seen in morphine-dependent monkeys. Butorphanol, pentazocine and picenadol all produced mild dependence of the kappa-type; that is, natural withdrawal behavior similar to that seen following chronic Mr 2033 administration...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this review is to {{summarize}} the efforts {{which resulted in the}} discovery of therapeutically useful morphine-like drugs. The search for new analgesics can be divided into three stages: a) search for analgesics with high efficacy and reduced unwanted side-effects; b) understanding of structure-activity relationships; c) studies on the mechanism of pain perception and its alleviation by investigation of the pharmacology of opioids. An immense body of literature has been produced on the syntheses of thousands of new compounds which resulted in the development of detailed structure-activity relationships. The physical and psychologic dependence of opioid analgesics also facilitated investigators {{to solve the problem of}} the separation of strong analgesia from addiction liability. In the past decades more mixed <b>agonist-antagonist</b> <b>analgesics,</b> pure antagonists devoid of agonist action and potent opioids like the 6, 14 -ethenomorphinan derivatives were developed. Naloxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine and Pentazocine are the outstanding representatives which are introduced into clinical therapy...|$|R
50|$|Butorphanol (BC 2627) is a morphinan-type {{synthetic}} <b>agonist-antagonist</b> opioid <b>analgesic</b> {{developed by}} Bristol-Myers. Brand name Stadol was recently discontinued by the manufacturer. It is now only available in its generic formulations, manufactured by Novex, Mylan, Apotex and Ben Venue Laboratories. Butorphanol is most closely structurally related to levorphanol. Butorphanol is available as the tartrate salt in injectable, tablet, and intranasal spray formulations. The tablet form is only used in {{dogs and cats}} due to low bioavailability in humans.|$|R
50|$|Nalmexone (INN) (code names EN-1620A, UM-592), or {{nalmexone}} hydrochloride (USAN), is a semisynthetic, opioid partial agonist {{or mixed}} <b>agonist-antagonist</b> with both <b>analgesic</b> and narcotic antagonist properties {{that was never}} marketed. In clinical studies it {{was found to have}} comparable analgesic efficacy to morphine, though with several-fold reduced potency. In addition, nalmexone's side effects, the most common of which were sleepiness and sweating, were reported to be similar to those of morphine, albeit with a noticeably higher degree of incidence.|$|R

40|$|Nalbuphine {{hydrochloride}} is a semi-synthetic <b>agonist—antagonist</b> opioid <b>analgesic</b> with a {{low potential}} to induce respiratory depression [1, 2]. Its analgesic potency has been reported as 0. 5 - 0. 9 that of morphine [3, 4]; {{it has been used}} with some success in the management of pain after a variety of surgical procedures [3 - 5]. The analgesic effect of nalbuphine in the treatment of pain after hip replacement has not been evaluated fully; we report a comparative study of the analgesic and sedative effects of nalbuphine and morphine in patients undergoing this procedure. METHOD AND RESULTS Following approval by the local Medical Ethics Research Committee and after informed consent, we studied 80 patients (ASA grades I or II) who were not receiving opioid, sedative or antide-pressant therapy. Each patient received either nalbuphine 0. 3 mg kg" 1 or morphine 0. 15 mg kg" 1 by random allocation on a double-blind basis. One hour before operation each patient received premedication with 0. 03 ml kg" 1 of the coded drug by i. m. injection into vastus lateralis. The drug concentrations were 10 mg ml" 1 and 5 mg ml" 1 for nalbuphine and morphine, respectively. Anaesthesia was standardized and consisted of thiopentone, pancuronium and isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Opioids were not given during operation. All patients received Dextran 70 during surgery with additional i. v. fluids and blood products as required. Systemic arteria...|$|R
50|$|Pentazocine is a synthetically-prepared prototypical mixed <b>agonist-antagonist</b> {{narcotic}} (opioid <b>analgesic)</b> drug of the benzomorphan {{class of}} opioids {{used to treat}} moderate to moderately severe pain. Pentazocine is sold under several brand names, such as Fortral, Sosegon, Talwin NX (with the μ-antagonist naloxone, will cause withdrawal in opioid dependent persons on injection), Talwin, Talwin PX (without naloxone), Fortwin (Lactate injectable form) and Talacen (with acetaminophen). This compound may exist as one of two enantiomers, named (+)-pentazocine and (−)-pentazocine. (−)-pentazocine is a κ-opioid receptor agonist, while (+)-pentazocine is not, instead displaying a ten-fold greater affinity for the σ receptor. Usually, in its oral formulations, it is combined with naloxone so as to prevent people from crushing the tablets, dissolving them in a solvent (like water) and injecting them for a high (as naloxone is not orally bioavailable it produces no effect when the formulation is used orally, but it blocks the opioid effects of pentazocine if injected intravenously for a high). Related drugs include phenazocine, dezocine, cyclazocine and several chemicals used in research on the central nervous system.|$|R
