500|$|Jeff Alexander of Television Without Pity {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–". Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the episode the [...] "highlight" [...] of the season. In particular, {{he was pleased}} with the way Pam and Jim's strife was portrayed; he wrote that [...] "tonight the ... drama felt earned in a way it hadn't previous" [...] and that [...] "Jim and Pam were used well". Houx was also {{extremely}} pleased with Odenkirk's performance, writing that, [...] "Even if Odenkirk is doing an impression of Steve Carell's character, not only is it great for the non-comedy comedy, but you can totally see a parallel universe where Odenkirk played Michael Scott and nailed it as well as Carell did." [...] He concluded that, with Odenkirk's presences, [...] "In about twenty seconds this became the best episode of the season." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend gave a moderately positive review, noting that the entry [...] "dealt with some of the ongoing issues among the staff of Dunder Mifflin. With the exception of a pretty great guest appearance by Breaking Bads Bob Odenkirk (Better call Saul!) and some interesting developments in the relationship department for some of the characters, the episode was fairly standard. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> very end, which offered an interesting reveal and a teaser of something big." ...|$|E
