2500|$|In mid-1986 the SPÖ-FPÖ {{coalition}} under Franz Vranitzky collapsed {{when the}} junior coalition partner in government, the Freedom Party of Austria, elected the controversial Jörg Haider as their new [...] party leader. Vranitzky determined that his {{government would not}} stand with Haider as Vice-Chancellor and early elections were called for November 23, 1986. The pressure for the green movement to present a united front for the election increased, with Günther Nenning attempting to bring together the BIP, VGÖ and GRAS parties onto a single candidates list. Meissner-Blau emerged as {{the most popular and}} uniformly acceptable candidate to lead the list, and she once again assumed leadership of the campaign under the banner The Green Alternative - List Freda Meissner-Blau. Meissner-Blau proved to be a popular and unifying figure in the movement, however she and Nenning were ultimately unsuccessful at uniting all the dissident factions. On October 4, GRAS - the largest green movement not yet committed to running under the Meissner-Blau list - voted on whether to join the main list or run separately under another leader. The left-wing dominated GRAS was heavily divided on the prospect of the moderate Meissner-Blau's leadership, and the final ballot saw left-wing historian Andrea Komlosy receive 222 votes to Meissner-Blau's 150. The loss came as a shock and a considerable disappointment to Nenning and Meissner-Blau. Yet in spite of this the majority of the green movement continued to rally behind Meissner-Blau's leadership, and a strong campaign was made which presented {{for the first time a}} professional and viable political alternative to the Austrian public. The 1986 election would prove to be a major upset in traditional Austrian politics with both major parties (the SPÖ and ÖVP) losing seats to the smaller Greens and FPÖ. The Greens polled 4.8% (234,028 votes), taking them over the crucial 4% threshold, and 8 candidates (including Meissner-Blau) were elected to the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b> The alternative green lists run by GRAS and disaffected segments of the VGÖ captured only around 7000 votes, or 0.1%.|$|E

At the same time, Sinowatz also resigned as a MP of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

500|$|Presently, the pan-Germanist wing {{is only a}} minor faction {{within the}} Freedom Party. In 2008, fewer than {{seventeen}} percent of the Freedom Party's voters questioned {{the existence of a}} unique <b>Austrian</b> <b>national</b> identity. German nationalists, including Andreas Mölzer and Martin Graf, now refer to themselves as [...] "cultural Germans" [...] (Kulturdeutsche), and stress the importance of their identity as ethnic Germans, in contrast to the distinct <b>Austrian</b> <b>national</b> identity. In 2006, FPÖ members of parliament reaffirmed the party's root in the pan-Germanist tradition, at least symbolically, by wearing blue cornflowers in their buttonholes, along with ribbons in Austria's national colours (red and white), during the initial meeting of the <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b> This caused controversy, as the media interpreted the flower as a former Nazi symbol.|$|R
50|$|On 27 April 1945 a {{provisional}} Austrian national unity government, again under a State Chancellor Karl Renner, declared the Anschluss null and void. It prepared the elections to the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> held on 25 November. On 20 December 1945, the Austrian Constitution was officially re-enacted, with ÖVP founder Leopold Figl forming the first post-war Federal Government.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Government finally {{purchased}} the building on 30 June 1947, at the intercession of Eleanor Lansing Dulles {{and with the}} consent of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b> The U.S. Mission in Austria held the status of a legation from 1947 until 1951, when it officially became an embassy, with Walter J. Donnelly as the first U.S. ambassador to serve in Vienna since Frederic Courtland Penfield departed in World War I.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 the Krone {{sued the}} Viennese city {{newspaper}} Falter for several million Schillings for allegedly having violated the competition laws {{because of a}} gaming action. The Falter only barely escaped financial ruin. It is suspected that the Krone tried {{to shut down the}} Falter because of its critical reporting of the Krone. In the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> the Green politician Karl Öllinger called the case an attack on press-freedom.|$|E
50|$|The Chancellor is {{appointed}} and {{sworn in}} by the President. In theory, the President can appoint anyone eligible to be elected to the <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> essentially meaning any <b>Austrian</b> <b>national</b> {{over the age of}} 18. In practice, a Chancellor is unable to govern unless he or she commands the confidence of the <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b> For this reason, the Chancellor is usually the leader of the largest party in the <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> or the senior partner in the governing coalition. A notable exception to this occurred after the 1999 election. The Freedom Party won the most seats and went into coalition with the People's Party. While this would have normally made Freedom Party leader Jorg Haider Chancellor, he was deemed too controversial {{to be a member of}} the Cabinet, let alone Chancellor. He thus stepped aside in favour of People's Party leader Wolfgang Schüssel.|$|R

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} Soviet Vienna Offensive and the {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} April 1945, Schärf became acting chairman of the refounded Social Democratic Party of Austria and joined the <b>Austrian</b> <b>national</b> unity government of Chancellor Karl Renner. Together with Renner, the Conservative politician Leopold Figl and the Communist Johann Koplenig he formed the first provisional cabinet of the Second Republic. After the 1945 legislative election Schärf {{became a member of the}} re-established <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> parliament. He served as Vice-Chancellor in the grand coalition governments between the Conservative People's Party and Social Democrats (the Communists were pushed out in 1947) under Chancellor Leopold Figl and his successor Julius Raab until 1957.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler) is {{appointed}} by the Federal President. Although he is head of government, he has no power to direct {{other members of the}} government. Following the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> election of 2008 Social Democratic Party leader Werner Faymann was sworn in as Chancellor by President Heinz Fischer on 2 December 2008. Following Chancellor Faymann's resignation from all his posts on 9 May 2016, Christian Kern took office on 17 May 2016.|$|E
50|$|Upon the 1971 {{legislative}} election, Sinowatz {{became a}} member of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> parliament. On 4 November 1971, he took office as Federal Minister of Education and Arts in the second cabinet of Chancellor Bruno Kreisky. During the ensuing twelve years of his office, Sinowatz substantially reformed the system of education in Austria to allow and increase social mobility. In 1982 he promoted the recognition of Buddhism in Austria as an official religious community.|$|E

50|$|In 1918, {{at the end}} of World War I, {{with the}} breakup of the {{multi-ethnic}} Austro-Hungarian Empire, and with the abolition of the Habsburg monarchy, there were three major political groups competing with one another in the young republic of Austria: the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SDAP), Christian Social Party (CS), and the nationalist Great German Union (Großdeutsche Vereinigung), which became the Greater German People's Party (Großdeutsche Volkspartei, or GVP) in 1920. At the time, smaller parties such as the Communist Party of Austria (Kommunistische Partei Österreichs, or KPÖ) and the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> Socialists (Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei, or DNSAP) were neither present in the Reichsrat (Imperial Council) nor the Nationalrat (<b>National</b> <b>Council).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wrabetz {{attended}} the 2nd federal grammar school in Vienna’s 19th district between 1970 and 1978. He {{grew up in}} the Vienna Döbling district. [...] During his studies at the University of Vienna from 1978 to 1983, Wrabetz became involved in the Social Democratic Party together with Austria’s former Federal Chancellor Werner Faymann. During the <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> elections of 1983, he organised the successful preference vote election campaign of Josef Cap. He served as Federal Chairman of the Socialist Students of Austria from 1983 to 1984. With Wrabetz as their Chairman and top candidate, the Socialist Students achieved their best-ever result at the elections for the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> Union of Students in 1983, when they received 26% of the votes.|$|R
5000|$|When Chancellor Michael Mayr {{resigned}} {{due to an}} intended {{referendum in}} Styria on the affiliation with Germany, the non-partisan Schober, largely considered a safe pair of hands by the Allies, was chosen by the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> parliament to head a coalition government on 21 June 1921, {{with the support of}} the right-wing Christian Social Party (CS) and the Greater German People's Party. His cabinet mainly consisted of government officials, while Schober himself combined his head of government role with that of Foreign Minister of Austria.|$|E
50|$|In 1977 Fux {{was among}} the founders of a citizens' {{initiative}} against commercialization and uglification of Salzburg's historic townscape and became an elected member of the city council. In 1982 he and others established the Austrian United Greens party (Vereinte Grüne Österreichs, VGÖ), which in 1986 merged into the Green Alternative (Grüne Alternative). Fux was elected MP of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> in the 1986 legislative election, he retained his seat until December 1988 and again entered into parliament in November 1989. In November 1990 he retired and later served as culture committee chairman in his hometown Salzburg.|$|E
50|$|The {{elections}} to the <b>Austrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> of 1949 were the second nationwide elections in Austria after World War II. About 500,000 registered Nazis, {{who were not}} allowed to vote in 1945, regained their voting rights. A newly created party, the Electoral Party of Independents (WdU) (a predecessor of the Freedom Party of Austria) specifically targeted this group of voters and immediately won a large share of votes. The Austrian People's Party remained strongest party, although losing their absolute majority of seats. Leopold Figl stayed as Chancellor, leading a coalition with the Socialist Party of Austria as junior partner.|$|E
