5|$|A modern {{repeat of}} the 1858 storm is {{estimated}} to cause damages of {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars. <b>A</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200million dollars in damage. The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E

5|$|After Alois's {{sudden death}} on 3 January 1903, Hitler's {{performance}} at school deteriorated {{and his mother}} allowed him to leave. He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.

A week later, he captured his fifth straight and eighth Malaysia Open title, thus equalling the number of home titles held by Wong Peng Soon who won them between 1940 and 1953.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1940, in {{an episode}} {{known as the}} Mechelen Incident, a German Army Major Hellmuth Reinberger crash-landed in a Messerschmitt Bf 108 near Mechelen-aan-de-Maas. Reinberger was {{carrying}} the first plans for the German invasion of western Europe which, as Gamelin had expected, entailed <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1914 Schlieffen Plan and a German thrust through the Belgium (which was expanded by the Wehrmacht to include the Netherlands) and into France.|$|E
5|$|Rossia was {{originally}} intended to be <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armored cruiser , but the Director of the Naval Ministry wanted the armor to cover more of the ship's side.

One notable change was the deletion of Ruriks sailing rig.|$|E

For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{debate about the}} concept within the USAF, as many groups were {{attempting}} to gain funding for their own pet projects, like nuclear powered bombers. In <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Toronto Star release, in 1955 an extensive article appeared in Look magazine that, among other claims, speculated that current UFO sightings were Soviet-built saucers. The article went on to describe such an aircraft with diagrams that were clearly influenced by the Avro design.|$|E

On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter {{by a vote of}} 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E
5|$|Government policy {{designed}} to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression. Barack Obama, the first African American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act {{in an attempt to}} mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.|$|E

5|$|In Moscow, around 6,000 {{police were}} on duty to prevent <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots a week earlier, but police {{reported}} {{that none of}} the 40,000 visiting fans were arrested, due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being set up for members of the public to watch the game outdoors. In London, violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station, near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground; police arrested 12 people on public order offences, while one man was arrested for grievous bodily harm, drink driving and dangerous driving, after he hit a 31-year-old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway. Five police were also believed to have been injured in the incident.|$|E
