5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{the more}} elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.|$|E
5|$|Franco began 2010 {{by making}} an {{appearance}} on the sitcom 30 Rock where he played himself and carried on a fake romance with Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) in a scheme concocted by their respective agents. After appearing in the commercial successes Date Night, an action comedy, and Eat Pray Love, an adaption of a novel, Franco played poet Allen Ginsberg in the drama Howl, released on September 24. The latter, about his most known poem and the trial <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and earned modest reviews.|$|E
5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as grounded in misconceptions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of nuclear scientists.|$|E

5|$|Ledonne {{had spent}} many years conceptualizing games, but never created one due to his lack of game design and {{programming}} knowledge. He was inspired to create a video game about Columbine by his own experience being bullied and the effect the shooting had on his life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting (in particular the role of video games), as well as parodying video games themselves. Super Columbine Massacre was created with ASCII's game development program RPG Maker 2000 and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an artist's statement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> after his identity was revealed. Super Columbine Massacre was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled {{hundreds of thousands of}} downloads.|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} insight into Sorabji's life {{comes from his}} correspondence with Peter Warlock, which began in 1913. At least {{partly as a result}} of Warlock's influence, Sorabji began to focus on composition and music criticism. In those letters he showed great interest in interacting with the world of musicians—an attitude that changed dramatically in later years. The {{first significant}} instance of such interaction took place in November 1919. Sorabji had sent several of his scores, including that of his First Piano Sonata, to Ernest Newman, who paid them no attention. Sorabji then played the piece to Ferruccio Busoni, who expressed some reservations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> but gave him a letter of recommendation, which helped Sorabji get it published.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear-view mirror as a gift.|$|E

5|$|From there, Wheeler {{was invited}} to direct a Society of Antiquaries {{excavation}} at the Roman settlement of Verulamium, which existed on land recently acquired by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, before leaving a fifth season of excavation {{under the control of}} the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon and the architect A. W. G. Lowther. Wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site, and also liked its proximity to his home in London. He was particularly interested in searching for a pre-Roman Iron Age oppidum at the site, noting that the existence of a nearby Catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence. With Wheeler focusing his attention on potential Iron Age evidence, Tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls; Wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project. After Tessa wrote two interim reports, the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities, jointly written by Wheeler and his wife. The report resulted in the first major published criticism of Wheeler, produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for Antiquity; although stating that there was much to praise <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> he critiqued Wheeler's selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork. Wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both Myres and Myres's employer, Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E

25|$|With funds {{raised by}} a Support Committee that {{included}} Ralea, Viața Românească was eventually revived by Ibrăileanu. Ralea became its foreign correspondent, sending in articles about the intellectual life and philosophical doctrines of the Third Republic, and possibly the first Romanian notices <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Marcel Proust. He traveled extensively, studying first-hand the cultural life of France, Belgium, Italy, and Weimar Germany.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy's {{comprehensive}} treatise {{of mathematical}} astronomy superseded most older texts of Greek astronomy.

25|$|These {{units have}} a role to play outside the country, as much of the FARC's arms {{smuggling}} work is handled by them.

According to the FARC, the capture of Rodrigo Granda in Venezuela in late and the capture of other operatives, such as Simon Trinidad, in Ecuador would allegedly include CIA participation.|$|E
