5000|$|Ditans {{selectively}} bind to the 5-HT1F receptor subtype. A {{number of}} triptans {{have been shown}} to act on this subtype as well, but only after their affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D has been made responsible for their anti-migraine activity. The lack of affinity for these receptors might result in fewer side effects related to vasoconstriction compared to triptans in susceptible patients, such as those with ischemic heart disease, Raynaud's phenomenon or after a myocardial infarction. [...] A 1998 review has found such side effects to rarely occur in most patients taking triptans. The first drug in this class is Eli Lilly's experimental drug lasmiditan. <b>Alniditan</b> is another example.|$|E
5000|$|Benzylamine {{is used in}} the {{industrial}} manufacturer of numerous pharmaceuticals, including <b>alniditan,</b> lacosamide, moxifloxacin, and nebivolol. [...] It is also used to manufacture the military explosive hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW) which is superior to older nitroamine high explosives like HMX and RDX, though it is less stable. The US Navy is testing HNIW for use in rocket propellants, such as for missiles, as it has lower observability characteristics such as less visible smoke. [...] HNIW is prepared by first condensing benzylamine with glyoxal in acetonitrile under acidic and dehydrating conditions. [...] Four of the benzyl groups are removed from hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane by hydrogenolysis catalysed by palladium on carbon and the resulting secondary amine groups are acetylated in acetic anhydride. [...] The resulting dibenzyl-substituted intermediate is then reacted with nitronium tetrafluoroborate and nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate in sulfolane to produce HNIW.|$|E
50|$|The {{sizeable}} {{number of}} serotonergic drugs for treating migraines all incorporate the indole nucleus found in serotonin itself. It isthus {{of interest that}} a compound based on a benzopyran manifests much the same activity.Alkylation of phenol with 2-bromobutyrolactone (2) leads to the ether (3). Oxidation of that product with chromium trioxide then leads to the substituted succinic anhydride (4). Treatment of anhydride with polyphosphoric acid leads tothe acylation of the aromatic ring {{and the formation of}} the benzopyranone ring (5). The ketonyl group is then selectively reduced by any of several methods, as, for example, conversion to a dithiolane followed by Mozingo reduction to 6. The carboxylic acid is next reduced to the corresponding aldehyde (7) by successive conversion to an acid chloride followed by hydrogenation in the presence of thiophene. A second hydrogenation in the presence of benzylamine leads to the reductive amination product (8). Michael addition of the amino group in 8 to acrylonitrile leads to a 1,4-addition and the formation of (9). Reduction of the nitrile affords the diamine (10). Reaction of this last diamine with tetrahydropyrimidine chloride (11), itself formed by treatment of trimethylene urea with phosphorus oxychloride, leads to the displacement of halogen by the terminal, and thus more accessible, amino group in (10). There is thus formed the serotonergic agent <b>alniditan</b> (12).|$|E

The <b>alniditan</b> response {{was blocked by}} the 5 -HT(1 B/D) receptor antagonist, GR 127935 (2 '-methyl- 4 '-(5 -methyl-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazol- 3 -yl) -biphenyl- 4 -carboxylic acid [4 -methoxy- 3 -(4 -methyl-piperazin- 1 -yl) -phenyl]-amide), but not by ketanserin, indicating that the effect is mediated through 5 -HT(1 B/D) receptors. <b>Alniditan</b> did not attenuate substance P-induced inflammation, suggesting that the mediating receptors are located prejunctionally. In vitro <b>alniditan</b> exhibited less vasoconstrictive effects on the rat basilar artery than did sumatriptan, although {{at a very high}} concentration (1 mM), <b>alniditan</b> caused intensive constriction, most likely through a mechanism independent from 5 -HT receptor activatio...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of electrically enhanced transdermal delivery of <b>alniditan,</b> a novel 5 HT 1 D agonist for the treatment of migraine. METHODS: An in vitro study was first performed to optimize the different parameters affecting iontophoresis efficiency. The mechanism of <b>alniditan</b> permeation by iontophoresis was investigated. Finally, a phase I clinical trial was performed to assess systemic delivery of <b>alniditan</b> by iontophoresis. RESULTS: i) In vitro: The optimal conditions were found with a buffer like ethanolamine at a pH of 9. 5, with Ag/AgCl electrodes and a direct current application. <b>Alniditan</b> permeation was enhanced when increasing the current density, the duration of current application and the drug concentration. Iontophoresis slightly increased drug quantities in stratum corneum compared to passive diffusion but it strongly increased <b>alniditan</b> quantities in viable skin. ii) The objective to deliver in vivo 0. 5 mg of <b>alniditan</b> within less than 1 h was reached but an erythema was detected at the anode. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of iontophoretic delivery system for antimigraine compounds...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the transdermal permeation of <b>alniditan</b> by electroporation and to compare with iontophoretic delivery. The influence of the electrical parameters of electroporation was investigated in vitro using a factorial design study. The transdermal flux of <b>alniditan</b> was enhanced by two orders of magnitude by application of high voltage electrical pulses. The electrical parameters of electroporation-i. e. the voltage, the duration and the number of pulses-allowed a control of drug permeation. Both transport during and after pulsing were shown to be important for <b>alniditan</b> transdermal delivery by electroporation. Electroporation was found more efficient in promoting <b>alniditan</b> permeation than an iontophoresis transferring the same amount of charges...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alniditan</b> {{is a new}} migraine-abortive agent. It is a benzopyran {{derivative}} {{and therefore}} structurally unrelated to sumatriptan and other indole-derivatives and to ergoline derivatives. The action of sumatriptan {{is thought to be}} mediated by 5 -hydroxy-tryptamine (5 -HT) (1 D) -type receptors. We investigated the receptor-binding profile in vitro of <b>alniditan</b> compared with sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine for 28 neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, several receptors for peptides and lipid-derived factors, ion channel-binding sites, and monoamine transporters. <b>Alniditan</b> revealed nanomolar affinity for calf substantia nigra 5 -HT 1 D and for cloned h 5 -HT 1 D alpha, h 5 -HT 1 D beta, and h 5 -HT 1 A receptors (K-i = 0. 8, 0. 4, 1. 1, and 3. 8 nM, respectively). <b>Alniditan</b> was more potent than sumatriptan at 5 -HT 1 D-type and 5 -HT 1 A receptors. <b>Alniditan</b> showed moderate-to-low or no affinity for other investigated receptors; sumatriptan showed additional binding to 5 -HT 1 F receptors. Dihydroergotamine had a much broader profile with high affinity for several 5 -HT, adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In signal transduction assays using cells expressing recombinant h 5 -HT 1 D alpha, h 5 -HT 1 D beta, or h 5 -HT 1 A receptors, <b>alniditan</b> (like 5 -HT) was a full agonist for inhibition of stimulated adenylyl cyclase (IC 50 = 1. 1, 1. 3, and 74 nM, respectively, for <b>alniditan).</b> Therefore, in functional assays, the potency of <b>alniditan</b> was much higher at 5 -HT 1 D receptors than at 5 -HT 1 A receptors. We further compared the properties of [H- 3]alniditan, as a new radioligand for 5 -HT 1 D-type receptors, with those of [H- 3] 5 -HT in membrane preparations of calf substantia nigra, C 6 glioma cells expressing h 5 -HT 1 D alpha, and L 929 cells expressing h 5 -HT 1 D beta receptors. [H- 3]Alniditan revealed very rapid association and dissociation binding kinetics and showed slightly higher affinity (K-d = 1 - 2 nM) than [H- 3] 5 -HT. We investigated 25 compounds for inhibition of [H- 3]alniditan and [H- 3] 5 -HT binding in the three membrane preparations; K-i values of the radioligands were largely similar, although some subtle differences appeared. Most compounds did not differentiate between 5 -HT 1 D alpha and 5 -HT 1 D beta receptors, except methysergide, ritanserin, ocaperidone, risperidone, and ketanserin, which showed 10 - 60 -fold higher affinity for the 5 -HT 1 D alpha receptor. The K-i values of the compounds obtained with 5 -HT 1 D receptors in calf substantia nigra indicated that these receptors are of the 5 -HT 1 D alpha-type. We demonstrated that <b>alniditan</b> is a potent agonist at h 5 -HT 1 D alpha and h 5 -HT 1 D beta receptors; its properties probably underlie its cranial vasoconstrictive and antimigraine properties. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alniditan,</b> a novel {{migraine}} abortive agent, is {{a potent}} 5 -HT 1 B/ 5 -HT 1 D receptor agonist of nM affinity. We compared the agonistic properties of <b>alniditan,</b> sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine on the cloned human 5 -HT 1 B receptor expressed at 200 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein (Bmax) in non-induced L 929 sA cells, at 740 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein in HEK[*] 293 and at 2300 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein in mIFNβ-induced L 929 sA cells, and on the human cloned 5 -HT 1 D receptor expressed in C 6 glioma cells (Bmax 780 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein). Sodium butyrate treatment increased the expression level of human (h) 5 -HT 1 B receptors in HEK[*] 293 cells and h 5 -HT 1 D receptors in C 6 glioma cells approximately 3 fold, the binding affinities of [3 H]- 5 -HT and [3 H]-alniditan were unaffected. Agonistic properties were evaluated based on inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in the cells after stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin or isoproterenol. <b>Alniditan,</b> sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine were full agonists at the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor (IC 50 values were 1. 7, 20 and 2 [*]nM, respectively in HEK[*] 293 cells) and h 5 -HT 1 D receptors (IC 50 values of 1. 3, 2. 6 and 2. 2 [*]nM, respectively). At the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor the agonist potency of the compounds slightly increased with higher receptor density. The opposite was seen for antagonists (ocaperidone, risperidone and ritanserin). This comparative study demonstrated that <b>alniditan</b> was 10 times more potent than sumatriptan at the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor, and twice as potent at the h 5 -HT 1 D receptor. Dihydroergotamine was more potent an agonist at the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor when expressed at high and low level in L 929 sA cells (but not in HEK[*] 293 cells), and was less potent at the h 5 -HT 1 D receptor...|$|E
40|$|In 1996, our {{knowledge}} of acute antimigraine therapy expanded in three major areas. First, large surveys have confirmed the remarkable efficacy profile of sumatriptan in clinical practice. No satisfying clinical, pharmacokinetic or genetic explanations were found for its major shortcomings: nonresponders, headache recurrence and noncardiac chest symptoms. Second, the novel 5 -HT 1 B/D agonists zolmitriptan (311 C 90), rizatriptan (MK- 462), eletriptan (UK- 116, 044), avitriptan (BMS- 180048) and <b>alniditan</b> (R 091274) were all proved superior to placebo for attack treatment, but their advantages over sumatriptan are yet to be analysed in more detail. A higher lipophilicity explains (except for <b>alniditan)</b> their greater oral bioavailability and better central nervous system penetration. A central action now proved experimentally in animals and in humans for 5 -HT 1 B/D agonists such as zolmitriptan may be advantageous for the antimigraine efficacy, {{but it could also}} increase sedation. Third, an endothelin (Ro 470203, bosentan) and a neurokinin 1 (RPR 100893) receptor antagonist were found to be ineffective in migraine. Both compounds are potent inhibitors of neurogenic plasma extravasation in rat dura mater, which might suggest that this pharmacological property does not necessarily predict efficacy in aborting migraine attacks.

40|$|Heterologous {{expression}} of cloned receptor subtypes for screening programs {{has become a}} real necessity for a modern pharmaceutical company. As the expression levels obtained so far are often low or unstable, we addressed this problem by using an inducible promoter system, i. e. the interferon-inducible mouse Mxl promoter. Using the gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as a reporter gene, we tested the inducibility of this promoter in the murine cell line L 929. We found that background expression was low and that a distinct interferon-induced expression could be obtained. CAT expression reached its maximum at approximately 15 ng CAT/mg protein after induction for 24 hr with 1000 U/ml murine interferon-beta; the induction ratio was 150 -fold. Next, L 929 cells were transfected with four different human serotonin (5 HT) receptor cDNAs (5 HT 1 A, 5 HT 2 A, 5 HT 1 D beta and 5 HT 1 E) {{under the control of}} the same Mxl promoter fragment. Also in this case well-regulated serotonin receptor-expressing clones were isolated. Bmax values varied from 3100 fmol/mg protein for the 5 HT 2 A receptor, 3300 fmol/mg protein for the 5 HT 1 D beta receptor, 9800 fmol/mg protein for the 5 HT 1 E receptor, and even up to 10, 400 fmol/mg protein for the 5 HT 1 A receptor. Furthermore, the expression levels were shown to remain stable during serial propagation for at least one year, demonstrating the usefulness of this expression system.

40|$|Using subtype-selective 5 -HT 1 {{receptor}} agonists {{and/or the}} 5 -HT 1 receptor antagonist GR 127935, we characterized in vitro the 5 -HT receptor that mediates the contraction {{of human and}} bovine cerebral arteries. Further, we investigated which sumatriptan-sensitive receptors are present in human coronary artery by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR). Agonists with affinity at the 5 -HT 1 B receptor, such as sumatriptan, <b>alniditan</b> and/or IS- 159, elicited dose-dependent contraction in both human and bovine cerebral arteries. They behaved as full agonists at the sumatriptan-sensitive 5 -HT 1 receptors in both species. In contrast, PNU- 109291 and LY 344864, selective agonists at 5 -HT 1 D and 5 -HT 1 F receptors, respectively, were devoid of any significant vasocontractile activity in cerebral arteries, or {{did not affect the}} sumatriptan-induced vasocontraction. The rank order of agonist potency was similar in both species and could be summarized as 5 -HT=alniditan>sumatriptan=IS- 159 >>>PNU- 109291 =LY 344864. In bovine cerebral arteries, the 5 -HT 1 receptor antagonist GR 127935 dose-dependently inhibited the vasoconstrictions elicited by both 5 -HT and sumatriptan, with respective pA 2 values of 8. 0 and 8. 6. RT–PCR studies in human coronary arteries showed a strong signal for the 5 -HT 1 B receptor while message for the 5 -HT 1 F receptor was weak and less frequently detected. Expression of 5 -HT 1 D receptor mRNA was not detected in any sample. The present results demonstrate that the triptan-induced contraction in brain vessels is mediated exclusively by the 5 -HT 1 B receptor, which is also present in a majority of human coronary arteries. These results suggest that selective 5 -HT 1 D and 5 -HT 1 F receptor agonists might represent new antimigraine drugs devoid of cerebro- and cardiovascular effects...|$|E
40|$|Sumatriptan {{is known}} for its stomach {{relaxing}} properties in both humans and cats, but the receptor involved has not been characterized. In a barostat study the intragastric volume was monitored in sedated cats at constant pressure. The maximum intragastric volume increase after subcutaneous or intravenous administration of saline or agonists was registered [mean (n= 4 - 5) ]. Sumatriptan (0. 01 - 1 mg kg(- 1)) induced a dose-dependent intragastric volume increase vs. saline (4 - 15 vs. 5 ml, respectively) that was sometimes accompanied by retching after 8 - 10 min. Pre-treatment with nitric oxide-synthase inhibitors and different 5 -HT(1) receptor antagonists N-[2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl]-N- 2 -pyridinyl-cyclohexanecarboxamide(WAY- 100635), 2 -methyl- 4 -(5 -methyl-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazol- 3 -yl) -biphenyl- 4 -carboxylic-acid[4 -methoxy- 3 -(4 -methyl-piperazin- 1 -yl) -phenyl]amide(GR- 127935), N-acetyl- 5 -hydroxytryptophyl- 5 -hydroxytryptophan-amide(5 -HTP-DP) and 1 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 4 -[4 -(2 -phthalimido) butyl]piperazine-HCl(NAN- 190) did not affect the sumatriptan-induced effect. <b>Alniditan</b> (5 -HT(1 A/ 1 D) receptor agonist) and flesinoxan (5 -HT(1 A) receptor agonist) did not induce significant intragastric volume changes. The 5 -HT(1 F) receptor agonists 5 -hydroxy- 3 -(1 -methylpiperidin- 4 -yl) - 1 H-indole(BRL- 54443) and (R) -(+) -N-(3 -dimethylamino- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 9 H-carbazol- 6 -yl) - 4 -fluorobenzamide(LY- 344864; 0. 003 - 3 mg kg(- 1)) however induced a dose-dependent intragastric volume increase (6 - 36 and 5 - 26 ml, respectively), no retching was seen. Our results suggest that stimulation of 5 -HT(1 F) receptors induces feline stomach relaxation. Whether the sumatriptan-induced gastric relaxation in cats is due to interaction with 5 -HT(1 F) receptors could not be proven absolutely in view of the lack of selective 5 -HT(1 F) receptor antagonists. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin 5 -HT 1 B receptors {{couple to}} G-proteins of the Gi/o family. However, their {{activation}} of specific G-protein subtypes is poorly characterised. Using an innovative antibody capture/guanosine- 5 ′- 0 -(3 -[35 S]thio) -triphosphate ([35 S]GTPγS) binding strategy, we characterised Gαi 3 subunit activation by h 5 -HT 1 B receptors stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The agonists, 5 -HT, <b>alniditan</b> and BMS 181, 101, stimulated Gαi 3, whereas methiothepin and SB 224, 289 behaved as inverse agonists. The selective 5 -HT 1 B receptor ligand, S 18127, modestly stimulated Gαi 3 and reversed {{the actions of}} both 5 -HT and methiothepin. S 18127 (1 μM) also produced parallel, dextral shifts of the 5 -HT and methiothepin isotherms. Isotopic dilution experiments ([35 S]GTPγS versus GTPγS) revealed high-affinity [35 S]GTPγS binding to Gαi 3 subunits {{in the absence of}} receptor ligands indicating constitutive activity. High-affinity [35 S]GTPγS binding was increased 2. 8 -fold by 5 -HT with an increase in the affinity of GTPγS for Gαi 3 subunits. In contrast, methiothepin halved the number of high-affinity binding sites and decreased their affinity. h 5 -HT 1 B receptor-mediated Gαi 3 subunit activation was dependent on the concentration of NaCl. At 300 mM, 5 -HT stimulated [35 S]GTPγS binding, basal Gαi 3 activation was low and methiothepin was inactive. In contrast, at 10 mM NaCl, basal activity was enhanced and the inverse agonist activity of methiothepin was accentuated. Under these conditions, 5 -HT decreased Gαi 3 activation. In conclusion, at h 5 -HT 1 B receptors expressed in CHO cells: (i) inverse agonist induced inhibition of Gαi 3, and its reversal by S 18127, reveals constitutive activation of this Gα subunit; (ii) constitutive Gαi 3 activation can be quantified by isotopic dilution [35 S]GTPγS binding and (iii) decreasing NaCl concentrations enhances Gαi 3 activation and leads to protean agonist properties of 5 -HT: that is a switch to inhibition of Gαi 3...|$|E
