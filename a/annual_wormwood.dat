40|$|<b>Annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> {{interference}} on soybean crop {{growth and}} yield {{may result from}} competition and allelopathy, which are modulated by crop management. Allelochemicals released by <b>annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> (e. g. artemisinin) may affect the crop directly or indirectly through {{the effect on the}} nitrogen fixing symbiont, Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The objectives were (i) to quantify the crop response (i. e. biomass production, nodulation and yield) to weed interference and (ii) to determinate the relative change of competition and allelopathy interferences, when a sublethal dose of herbicide is applied. Two split plot field experiments with three replications were used. The experiment involved a factorial combination of five weed-crop density (soybean/annual wormwood, plantsm- 2) levels: D 1, pure soybean, 40 / 0 plantsm- 2; D 2, 40 / 2 plantsm- 2; D 3, 40 / 4 plantsm- 2 and D 4, 40 / 8 plantsm- 2, and D 5, pure <b>annual</b> <b>wormwood,</b> 0 / 8 plantsm- 2, two activated carbon (allelopathy) levels: C-, with activated carbon (reduced allelopathy) and C+, non activated carbon applied (with allelopathy) and two herbicide levels: H-, untreated and H+, treated with a sub-lethal dose of glyphosate. Activated carbon to adsorb allelochemicals (with and without activated carbon) and glyphosate application (with and no herbicide) were assigned to sub-plots. Increasing weed density did not affect crop biomass at flowering, but changed nodule number and soybean yield with a different pattern depending on carbon and herbicide treatment. Relative crop yield decreased with increasing relative weed biomass. This decrease was particularly drastic when allelopathy was reduced by activated carbon and without herbicide application. The maximum yield losses of 33 % in 2006 and 17 % in 2007 were observed with the highest weed density (8 plantsm- 2). In contrast, without carbon (high allelopathy level), soybean yield remained stable within the explored range of <b>annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> biomass, despite the fact that weed biomass at high densities (D 4) was high enough to generate competition. The lack of response to increasing weed density could be related to the indirect effect of allelochemicals interacting with soil microorganisms (i. e. B. japonicum) that positively affected the nodulation (e. g. larger nodules in 2006 and increased nodules biomass due to higher number of roots in 2007 at high densities). With herbicide application, soybean yield of both carbon treatments remained stable when biomass of <b>annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> increased. This research provided strong evidence in support of the existence of positive effect of allelopathic and competitive interactions between <b>annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> and soybean crop under field conditions that may be overridden under herbicide application. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} insight in processes underlying {{yield and}} concentrations of interesting secondary metabolites in crops is still limited. Yet, this insight {{is essential to}} further improve crops and commercial production of target metabolites. Artemisia annua L. (<b>annual</b> or sweet <b>wormwood,</b> Asteraceae) was used to conceptualize a model to describe the processes determining and limiting the production of target metabolites during crop growth. A. annua is an annual herb producing the antimalarial artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone with an endoperoxide bridge. Artemisinin is predominantly produced in glandular trichomes present on the leaves and inflorescences. Leaves {{are the most important}} organs harvested in commercial production. The accumulation of artemisinin in the crop was analysed as the resultant of the key processes determining leaf dry weight production, accumulation of artemisinin in the leaves and losses after synthesis. A yield formation modelling approach was used to quantify artemisinin yield {{as a function of the}} individual processes and to study which processes limited production. Leaf dry weight production was limited by low total dry matter production of the crop because of poor radiation interception during early canopy expansion, and by a high proportion of dry matter allocated to stems that do not contribute to artemisinin production. Production of the target metabolite in the leaves was limited because the total production of artemisinin precursors per unit leaf dry weight was low and because the conversion of precursors to artemisinin was only partial. Possibilities to increase the values of the different yield components are discussed. A new, simple, model for explaining variation in artemisinin yield based on leaf and trichome production in combination with biosynthesis of artemisinin is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, Artemisia annua L. (<b>annual</b> or sweet <b>wormwood)</b> has {{received}} increasing attention {{due to the}} fact that the plant produces the sesquiterpenoid endoperoxide artemisinin, which today is widely used for treatment of malaria. The plant produces relatively small amounts of artemisinin and a worldwide shortage of the drug has led to intense research in order to increase the yield of artemisinin. In order to improve our understanding of terpene metabolism in the plant and to evaluate the competition for precursors, which may influence the yield of artemisinin, we have used qPCR to estimate the expression of 14 genes of terpene metabolism in different tissues. Results The four genes of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway (amorpha- 4, 11 -diene synthase, amorphadiene- 12 -hydroxylase, artemisinic aldehyde ∆ 11 (13) reductase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1) showed remarkably higher expression (between ~ 40 - to ~ 500 -fold) in flower buds and young leaves compared to other tissues (old leaves, stems, roots, hairy root cultures). Further, dihydroartemisinic aldehyde reductase showed a very high expression only in hairy root cultures. Germacrene A and caryophyllene synthase were mostly expressed in young leaves and flower buds while epi -cedrol synthase was highly expressed in old leaves. 3 -Hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase exhibited lower expression in old leaves compared to other tissues. Farnesyldiphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase showed only modest variation in expression in the different tissues, while expression of 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate synthase was 7 - 8 -fold higher in flower buds and young leaves compared to old leaves. Conclusions Four genes of artemisinin biosynthesis were highly expressed in flower buds and young leaves (tissues showing a high density of glandular trichomes). The expression of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde reductase has been suggested to have a negative effect on artemisinin production through reduction of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde to dihydroartemisinic alcohol. However, our results show that this enzyme is expressed only at low levels in tissues producing artemisinin and consequently its effect on artemisinin production may be limited. Finally, squalene synthase but not other sesquiterpene synthases appears to be a significant competitor for farnesyl diphosphate in artemisinin-producing tissues. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> (AW) (Artemisia annua L.) has anti-malarial, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-tumour, and {{anti-inflammatory}} activities. In {{the present}} study, we evaluated {{the effects of}} <b>annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> leaves (AWL) on adipocyte differentiation in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells and high-fat diet (HFD) -induced obese rats. 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and HFD-induced obese rats were treated with AWL, {{and its effect on}} gene expression was analyzed using RT-PCR and Western blotting experiments. Treatment with AWL effectively prevented triglyceride accumulation during adipogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, AWL suppressed the differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes into adipocytes through the downregulation of dexamethasone, 3 -isobutyl- 1 - methylxanthine, and insulin (DMI) -induced serine/threonine kinase protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activation and the expression of adipogenic genes, including the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and peroximal proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Moreover, the expression of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 4 (aP 2), which is a known PPARγ-target gene, was downregulated by AWL treatment. Oral administration of AWL extracts significantly decreased the body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, adipocyte cell size, serum triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) levels in HFD-induced obese rats. These results provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity effects of AWL that are mediated by the downregulation of the expression of major adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPα and PPARγ and Akt signalling...|$|E

40|$|Abstract To {{elucidate}} the fine-tuned {{temporal and spatial}} modulation of artemisinin production in <b>annual</b> <b>wormwood</b> (Artemisia annua), we conducted enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay-based immunoquantification of three key enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis, amorpha- 4, 11 -diene synthase (ADS), cytochrome P 450 monooxyge-nase (CYP 71 AV 1), and cytochrome P 450 reductase (CPR), in various tissues and under different growth conditions. The field-grown plants accumulate abundant ADS and CYP 71 AV 1 but a trace amount of CPR in all tested tissues. Furthermore, ADS and CYP 71 AV 1 accumulations in leaves are 16 - and eightfold higher than in roots, and ten- and fourfold higher than in stems, respectively, demonstrating a tissue-specific expression pattern. Interestingly, the flower-ing field plants and cold-acclimated cultural plants produce higher levels of ADS and CYP 71 AV 1 than non-flowering field plants or untreated cultural plants, indicating the environmental and developmental induction on ADS and CYP 71 AV 1 genes and providing {{possible explanation for the}} observation that elevation of artemisinin level occurs after flowering.

40|$|Abstract. Artemisia annua L. (<b>annual</b> <b>wormwood)</b> {{contains}} the antimalarial artemisinin. Aqueous preparations of the dried herb {{are included in}} the pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China for treatment of fever and malaria. Fourteen healthy male volunteers received one liter of tea prepared from nine grams of Artemisia annua leaves. Blood samples were taken and artemisinin was detected by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean ± SD maximum plasma concentration of artemisinin was 240 ± 75 ng/mL and the mean ± SD area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 336 ± 71 ng/mL × hr. Artemisinin was absorbed faster from herbal tea preparations than from oral solid dosage forms, but bioavailability was similar. One liter of an aqueous preparation of nine grams of Artemisia annua contained 94. 5 milligrams of artemisinin (approximately 19 % of the usually recommended daily dose). Artemisinin plasma concentrations after intake of this herbal tea are sufficient for clinical effects, but insufficient to recommend such preparations as equivalent substitutes for modern artemisinin drugs in malaria therapy...|$|E
40|$|In plants, sesquiterpenes of {{different}} structural types are biosynthesized from the isoprenoid intermediate farnesyl diphosphate. The initial {{reaction of the}} biosynthesis is catalyzed by sesquiterpene cyclases (synthases). In Artemisia annua L. (<b>annual</b> <b>wormwood),</b> a number of such sesquiterpene cyclases are active. We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding one of these, amorpha- 4, 11 -diene synthase, a putative key enzyme of artemisinin biosynthesis. This clone contains a 1641 -bp open reading frame coding for 546 amino acids (63. 9 kDa), a 12 -bp 5 ′-untranslated end, and a 427 -bp 3 ′-untranslated sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence is 32 to 51 ␒dentical with the sequence of other known sesquiterpene cyclases from angiosperms. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant enzyme catalyzed the formation of both olefinic (97. 5 €and oxygenated (2. 5 €sesquiterpenes from farnesyl diphosphate. GC–MS analysis identified the olefins as (E) [...] farnesene (0. 8 Œ amorpha- 4, 11 -diene (91. 2 Œ amorpha- 4, 7 (11) -diene (3. 7 Œ -humulene (1. 0 Œ -sesquiphellandrene (0. 5 Œ and an unknown olefin (0. 2 €and the oxygenated sesquiterpenes as amorpha- 4 -en- 11 -ol (0. 2 €(tentatively), amorpha- 4 -en- 7 -ol (2. 1 Œ and -bisabolol (0. 3 €(tentatively).
