5|$|Starting the US hard-court {{season with}} the 2010 Farmers Classic, Murray reached the final but lost against Sam Querrey in three sets. This was his first loss to Querrey in five career meetings. In Canada, Murray became the first player since Andre Agassi in 1995 to defend the Canadian Masters. Murray {{defeated}} Nadal and then Federer in straight sets, ending his eight-month title drought. At the Cincinnati Masters, Murray first complained about {{the speed of the}} court, and then in a quarterfinal match with Fish, Murray complained that the organisers refused to put the match on later in the day With temperatures reaching 33°C in the shade, Murray won the first set in a tie-breaker but began to feel ill. The doctor was called on court to actively cool Murray down. Murray said after the match that he had considered retiring. He lost the second set, but forced a final-set tie-breaker, before Fish won. After losing to Stanislas Wawrinka in the third round of the US Open, questions about Murray's conditioning arose, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the trainer out twice during the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} is whether the name should be Leopoldia. In 1819 Herbert had {{proposed}} Leopoldia as a nomen provisorium (provisional name) for the same taxon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Hippeastrum in 1821. Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated (i.e. became the correct name), this was overlooked, and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia {{was used for the}} genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name Leopoldia was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species, allied to Muscari. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both Hippeastrum and Leopoldia, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert's Hippeastrum and Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Hippeastrum Herb. is now a nomen conservandum (conserved name), i.e. the correct name regardless {{of the fact that it}} does not have priority over Leopoldia.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} not to marry is a presumed consequence of Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy. His well-documented relationship with Regine Olsen is a subject of study in existentialism, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> off their engagement despite mutual love. Kierkegaard seems to have loved Regine {{but was unable to}} reconcile the prospect of marriage with his vocation as a writer and his passionate and introspective Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Combining the two {{brought the}} {{operation}} of division into play. This greatly expanded our qualitative understanding of how objects interact in space. Crucially, it also provided the means for quantitatively calculating the spatial consequences of those interactions. The resulting geometric algebra, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> it, eventually realized the long sought goal of creating an algebra that mirrors the movements and projections of objects in 3-dimensional space.|$|E
25|$|From a {{mathematical}} point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked {{long on the}} mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis situs (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any Aleph number (any infinite multitude <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> it) of instants.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{advocated}} by various ancient and medieval authors, although they differed in {{approach to the}} problem of the initial place of their origin. The theory seems to have been popular in medieval Georgia. The prominent Georgian religious writer George the Hagiorite (1009–1065) wrote about the wish of certain Georgian nobles to travel to the Iberian peninsula and visit the local Georgians of the West, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> them.|$|E

25|$|The {{antiseptic}} {{properties of}} phenol {{were used by}} Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wounds {{with a piece of}} rag or lint covered in phenol, or carbolic acid <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> it. The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic (anti-septic, germ-free) techniques in surgery.|$|E

Cox informed Field of the offer, and the call was dismissed as a hoax until an instalment of $5,000 arrived at Cox's home.

25|$|Blackmore ceased writing epics for a {{time after}} Creation. In 1722 he {{continued}} his religious themes with Redemption, an epic on the divinity of Jesus Christ designed to oppose and confute the Arians (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the Unitarians). The next year, he released another long epic, Alfred. The poem was ostensibly about King Alfred the Great, but like his earlier Arthurian epics, this one was political. It was dedicated to Prince Frederick, the eldest son of King George II, but the poem vanished without causing any comment from court or town.|$|E

25|$|Peirce {{agreed with}} Auguste Comte in {{regarding}} mathematics as more basic than philosophy {{and the special}} sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and {{is not just the}} science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Although at {{the time}} of Millikan's oil-drop {{experiments}} it was becoming clear that there exist such things as subatomic particles, not everyone was convinced. Experimenting with cathode rays in 1897, J. J. Thomson had discovered negatively charged 'corpuscles', <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> them, with a charge-to-mass ratio 1840 times that of a hydrogen ion. Similar results had been found by George FitzGerald and Walter Kaufmann. Most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism, however, could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable; {{in much the same way}} that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a regular}} starter with primavera team of Genoa C.F.C. he gained entry {{with the first}} team in September 2013 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> up by the coach Fabio Liverani to {{participate}} in the 5th game week of the 2013–14 Serie A against Udinese on 28 September 2013. In that match Sokoli remained as an unused substitute for the entire match wearing the 44th shirt number and Udinese won 1–0 scoring with Antonio Di Natale in the 79th minute. He managed to participate with the first team also in the next fixture 4 days later against Napoli and two others during the next year 2014 in January and May, but didn't came in to play in any of these matches.|$|E

25|$|When Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany in April 1940, many Norwegian athletes volunteered {{to fight in}} the Norwegian Campaign. Hoff then made his mark <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> on the fighters to lay down their weapons and return to the sports field. For this he was sacked by the Norwegian Athletics Association. However, Germany was able to {{establish}} an occupation of Norway, and soon moved to tighten their grip on Norwegian society. At this point Hoff contacted the Reichskommissariat to propose a Nazi reorganization of sports life in Norway. In September 1940 he was given the position as deputy under-secretary of state in the new Ministry of Labour and Sports, which was headed by Axel Heiberg Stang. He also joined the Nasjonal Samling at that time.|$|E
25|$|Under Emperor Guangwu, Du Shi was {{appointed}} {{as an officer}} in the Censorate and was in charge of monitoring affairs and upholding law and order within the new capital at Luoyang. When the undisciplined troops of the military officer Xiao Guang (d. 26) ran rampant in the capital city and terrorized its inhabitants without any perceivable action on Xiao's part to prevent it, Du Shi had him arrested. Du had Xiao summarily executed without explicit consent from the throne, sending in a report of the event only after the execution. Guangwu was not displeased with this, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> him into court to grant him an insignia which justified his actions. Shortly after this event, the bandit leader Yang Yi (d. 26) caused a major disturbance in Hedong Commandery, which Du Shi was sent to quell. When word of the arrival of Du Shi's forces in the region, Yang Yi planned to flee across the Yellow River. However, Du Shi anticipated this, sending a raiding party to burn the boats Yang Yi intended to use for his escape. After conscripting troops from Hedong Commandery, Du Shi led a surprise ambush with a cavalry unit that dispersed Yang's bandits and annihilated them.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of his career, Pavelić was a lawyer and a {{politician}} of the Croatian Party of Rights in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia known for his nationalist beliefs and support for an independent Croatia. By the end of the 1920s, his political activity became more radical <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> on Croats to revolt against Yugoslavia, and schemed an Italian protectorate of Croatia separate from Yugoslavia. After King Alexander I declared his 6 January Dictatorship in 1929 and banned all political parties, Pavelić went abroad and plotted with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) to undermine the Yugoslav state, which prompted the Yugoslav authorities to try him in absentia and sentence him to death. In the meantime, Pavelić had moved to fascist Italy where he founded the Ustaše, a Croatian nationalist movement with the goal of creating an independent Croatia by any means, including the use of terror. Pavelić incorporated terrorist actions in the Ustaše program, such as train bombings and assassinations, staged a small uprising in Lika in 1932, culminating in the assassination of King Alexander in 1934 in conjunction with the IMRO. Pavelić was once again sentenced to death after being tried in France in absentia and, under international pressure, the Italians imprisoned him for 18 months, and largely obstructed the Ustaše in the following period.|$|E

25|$|In 1910, Rusk led an {{expedition}} to Mount McKinley and when he returned, they moved {{to the area of}} Grants Pass in Oregon where his parents were living. There, he helped his parents, working in their Lucky Spot gold mine. In 1912, he moved back to Washington, to the Yakima Valley. He became the editor of the Benton Independent published in Prosser, a position he held for a year before selling the paper and resuming law practice. He continued his practice until the spring of 1915 when he was appointed to a four-year term as the receiver for the United States Land Office in Yakima. During his time in the Yakima Valley, Rusk became a vocal conservationist. He was an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt and started a local campaign to get Mount Adams set aside as a national park. He felt that it was high time that it got the recognition it deserved and in 1919, he wrote the short booklet Mount Adams–Towering Sentinel of the Lower Columbia Basin, in which he laid out his case for the Yakima National Park <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> it. In 1920, Rusk was {{a founding member of the}} Cascadians mountaineering club and became its first president. Later, he also served as the chairman of the outing committee. Some of his closest friends he met while a member of the club. In 1922, the members of the Cascadians presented Rusk with a Swiss ice-axe as a gift for being an inspiring leader and being the first president of the club.|$|E
