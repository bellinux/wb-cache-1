40|$|Starting {{from recent}} {{determination}} of Fe, O, Na abundance on a restricted sample (N= 67) of halo and thick disk stars, {{a natural and}} well motivated selection criterion is defined for the classification of globular cluster stars. An application is performed to M 13 using a sample (N= 112) for which Fe, O, Na abundance has been recently inferred from observations. A comparison is made between current and earlier M 13 star classification. Both O and Na empirical differential abundance distributions are determined for each class and the whole sample (with the addition of Fe in the last case) and compared with their theoretical counterparts due to cosmic scatter obeying a Gaussian distribution whose parameters are inferred from related subsamples. The procedure is repeated with regard to four additional classes according if oxygen and sodium abundance is above (stage CE) or below (stage AF) a selected threshold. Both O and Na empirical differential abundance distributions, related to the whole sample, exhibit a linear fit for AF and CE stage. Within the errors, the oxygen slope for CE stage is equal and opposite in sign with respect of the sodium slope for <b>AF</b> <b>stage,</b> while the contrary holds {{in dealing with the}} oxygen slope for <b>AF</b> <b>stage</b> with respect to the sodium slope for CE stage. In the light of simple models of chemical evolution applied to M 13, the O-Na anticorrelation and the primordial to current M 13 mass ratio are discussed. The proposed classification of globular cluster stars may be extended in a twofold manner, namely to (i) elements other than Na and Fe and (ii) globular clusters other than M 13.

40|$|Background: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) commonly {{occurs in}} association with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in adverse outcomes. Combining pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) may reduce the recurrence of AF in patients with CKD and hypertension. We considered that RSD could reduce the recurrence of AF in patients with CKD by modulating sympathetic hyperactivity. Our goal was to compare the impact of PVI + RSD with that of PVI alone in patients with concurrent AF and CKD. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, longitudinal, randomized, double-blind study. Forty-five patients with controlled hypertension, symptomatic paroxysmal AF and/or persistent <b>AF,</b> <b>stage</b> 2 or 3 CKD, and a dual-chamber pacemaker were enrolled from January 2014 to January 2015. We assessed the 30 -second recurrence of AF recorded by the pacemaker, 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, echocardiographic parameters, and safety of RSD. Results: No patient developed procedural or other complications. The ambulatory blood pressure measurements did not differ within the PVI + RSD group or between the PVI + RSD and PVI groups throughout the study. Significantly more patients in the PVI + RSD group than in the PVI group were free of AF at the 12 -month follow-up evaluation. The PVI group had an unacceptable response to ablation with respect to changes in echocardiographic parameters, whereas these parameters improved in the PVI + RSD group. Conclusion: PVI + RSD were associated with a lower AF recurrence rate than PVI alone; it also improved renal function and some echocardiographic parameters. These encouraging data will serve as baseline information for further long-term studies on larger patient populations...|$|E

Stretch of the atria is a main contributor to atrial remodelling. In this review, we describe different aspects of structural remodelling as seen in animal models and in patients with AF, including atrial enlargement, cellular hypertrophy, dedifferentiation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and loss of contractile elements. In the second part, we describe downstream signals of mechanical stretch and their contribution to AF and structural remodelling. Ultimately, knowledge of mechanisms underlying structural remodelling may help to identify new pharmacological targets for AF prevention...|$|R

The paper focuses on the calculation of particle production in a relativistic heavy ion collision using the McLerran-Venugopalan model. The main part of the paper summarizes the background of these numerical calculations. First we relate this calculation of the initial <b>stage</b> <b>af</b> a heavy ion collision {{to our understanding of the}} whole collision process. Then we discuss the saturation physics of the small x wavefunction of a hadron or a nucleus. The classical field model of Kovner, McLerran and Weigert is then introduced before moving to discuss the numerical algorithms used to compute gluon and quark pair production in this model. Finally we shortly review the results on gluon and quark-antiquark production obtained in the three articles mentioned above. Comment: 55 pages, 11 figures, introductory part of a PhD thesi...|$|R
40|$|Indigenous {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) communities have been analyzed for three years (2006, 2007 and 2008) during alcoholic (AF) and malolactic (MLF) fermentations of Tempranillo wines in ten wineries of La Rioja. The results showed that analytical composition of wines and physical–chemical conditions of elaboration influenced the LAB populations, the MLF duration {{and the percentage of}} each isolated species and strains. The highest diversity of LAB species was observed during AF in all the wineries. Oenococcus oeni was present in all studied stages of the fermentation process, being the predominant species at final <b>AF</b> <b>stage.</b> The study of 925 isolates of O. oeni by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) allowed the detection of a total of 112 distinct genotypes. Most fermentation stages of both AF and MLF showed mixed O. oeni strain populations, so that there were different genotypes able to share their ecological niche or tank in spontaneous MLF. The frequency of participation of each genotype varied either from year to year or from winery to winery. Otherwise, seven genotypes were detected in the three studied years and in at least three out of the ten studied wineries, being four of them also present in the three studied subzones of this region. These results suggest the existence of an endemic microbiota in this region, the adaptation of indigenous O. oeni strains to the winery conditions every year and the interest of selecting predominant genotypes in order to preserve the biodiversity and peculiarity of these wines.

40|$|Current design {{techniques}} for high-performance crystal radio receivers {{call for the}} use of quality components in the RF, detection and AF sections of these radios, together with overall good antenna-ground systems. Sensitive magnetic or piezoelectric headphones, low-loss audio matching transformers and R-C equalization networks, or “bennies”, are mandatory in <b>AF</b> ends. RF <b>stages</b> require high-Q coils and low-loss fixed or variable capacitors. Interesting to note here is the fact that varactor diodes are finding widespread use as replacements for capacitors of the variable type in a number of short-wave crystal radio designs. Detector diodes, on the other hand, should be high-quality sensitive types, usually germanium devices optimized for radio frequency operation, i. e., having small reverse currents and improved detection efficiency. Very good performance has been reported [1] employing Schottky-barrier diodes in the detection stages, although these require the use of rather expensive large turns-ratio audio-matching transformers for optimum power transfer to the operator’s headphones. A simple feedback technique using only passive circuit components can improve the efficiency of a cheap low-quality germanium detector diode. For this means, a fractio...|$|R
40|$|Hemispatial neglect {{affects the}} ability to explore space on the side {{opposite}} a brain lesion. This deficit is also mirrored in abnormal saccadic eye movement patterns. The present study investigated if the recovery of neglect is also reflected in saccadic eye movements. Patient AF, who displayed strong hemispatial neglect 1 month post-right thalamic stroke, had largely recovered 3 months later when tested on visual exploration tasks of the Behavioural Inattention Test. At this <b>stage,</b> <b>AF</b> was tested on a visual search task while his eye movements (direction, latencies and amplitudes of first saccades) and manual reaction times were recorded. The experimental conditions differed with respect to stimulus number and distracter type and increased in difficulty. AF correctly generated saccades into the neglected field when the target was presented alone. In contrast, a considerable left/right difference was present for all multiple-stimulus search displays. Although recovered from neglect in standardized assessment, AF showed a strong rightward bias resulting in highly asymmetric response times and eye movement behaviour. We conclude that eye movement patterns are far more susceptible to remaining spatial impairments and can thus provide a sensitive means to assess the extent of neglect recovery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the embryonic and larval development of Brycon amazonicus, featuring the main events up to 50 hours after fertilization (AF). The material was provided by the Aquaculture Training, Technology and Production Center, Presidente Figueiredo (AM). The characterization was based on stereomicroscopic examination of the morphology of eggs, embryos and larvae and comparison with the literature. Matrinxã eggs are free, transparent, and spherical, with a perivitelline space of 0. 56 ± 0. 3 mm. The successive divisions give rise to cells with 64 blastomeres during the first hour <b>AF.</b> The gastrula <b>stage,</b> beginning 02 h 40 min AF, was characterized by progressive regression cells and the formation of the embryonic axis, leading to differentiation of the head and tail 05 h 30 min AF. From 06 to 09 h AF the somites, notochord, otic and optic vesicles and otoliths were observed, in addition to heart rate and the release of the tail. The larvae hatched at 10 h 30 min AF (29. 9 °C), with a total length of 3. 56 ± 0. 46 mm. Between 19 and 30 h AF, we observed 1) pigmentation and gut formation, 2) branchial arches, 3) pectoral fins, 4) a mouth opening and 5) teeth. Cannibalism was initiated earlier (34 h AF) which was associated with rapid yolk absorption (more than 90 % until 50 h AF), signaling the need for an exogenous nutritional source. The environmental conditions (especially temperature) influenced the time course of some events throughout the embryonic and larval development, suggesting the need for further studies on this subject...|$|R
40|$|Background-—Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{and chronic}} kidney disease (CKD) are prevalent in the elderly and are independently associated with increased risk of death. We evaluated risk of incident AF with advancing CKD and examined the mortality rate associated with CKD after incident AF in elderly patients. Methods and Results-—This retrospective cohort study used the Medicare 5 % database. Point-prevalent Medicare enrollees on December 31, 2006, without preexistent AF or end-stage renal disease were followed up for incident AF through 2008. CKD and AF were identified from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. Associations between CKD <b>stage</b> and incident <b>AF</b> and subsequent risk of death were examined in a Cox proportional-hazards model. Unadjusted survival after incident AF was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. CKD was present in 55 962 patients (5. 1 % of the cohort). Of these, 4952 (8. 8 %) had CKD stages 1 and 2; 19 795 (35. 3 %), stages 3 to 5; and 31 215 (55. 7 %), unknown stage. The hazard ratio for incident <b>AF</b> in CKD <b>stages</b> 3 to 5 was 1. 13 (95 % confidence interval 1. 09 to 1. 18). Other stages were not independently associated with incident AF. Survival after incident AF decreased progressively as CKD stage increased (P< 0. 0001). The 1 -year mortality rate for CKD stages 3 to 5 with incident AF was 35. 6 %. Adjusted hazard ratios for death after incident AF were 1. 14 (95 % confidence interval 1. 00 to 1. 30) for CKD stages 1 and 2, 1. 27 (95 % confidence interval 1. 20 to 1. 35) for CKD stages 3 to 5, and 1. 29 (95 % confidence interval 1. 23 to 1. 36) for unknown stage.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{lifetime}} of aircraft structural components in coastal environments, the failure process of LY 12 CZ aluminum alloy stringer servicing in the coastal environment of the Fiji Islands was analyzed. The whole lifetime process of structural components was divided into four stages: coating failure, pit nucleation and growth, shortcrack growth, and long-crack expansion. The failure time of coating was assessed by way of formulation and implementation of accelerated environmental spectrum, and a four-stage model was established by analysis of pitting corrosion and derivation of the crack expansion equation. The assessment was virtually consistent with the stringer. Findings showed that pit nucleation and growth and short-crack growth account for approximately 75 % of the entire lifetime. After aircraft structural components have been in service for approximately 14 years, the crack will expand rapidly {{to the extent that}} the components will rip apart.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale prototype mesh bioreactor (MeBR) for the two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) of {{biodegradable municipal waste}} (BMW) was successfully designed and tested. The development involved a number of preliminary stages; creation and characterization of a synthetic BMW (SBMW), exploration of its single-stage AD characteristics under both methanogenic and hydrolytic conditions, and AD trials of a two-stage reactor system where SBMW was fed to a 1 st stage hydraulic flush (HF) reactor and centrifuging {{was used as a}} method to produce liquid effluent which was fed to a 2 nd <b>stage</b> anaerobic filter (<b>AF)</b> reactor. The single stage digestion of SBMW suffered from process instability at very low organic loading rates (OLR) of 2 - 2. 5 gVSl- 1 d- 1 whilst the two-stage HF/AF system was robust up to a maximum OLR of 7. 5 gVS/ld. The HF reactors became methanogenic due to the effect of effluent recycling. After this, two different prototypes designs of MeBR were built and tested in continuous two-stage AD trials (<b>AF</b> 2 nd <b>stage).</b> The aim was to replace the centrifuging of the HF reactors with continuous mesh filtration whilst maintaining the stable and robust digestion process. The first design confirmed the ability to filter SBMW digestate through nylon meshes of pore size 30 - 140 >m at an OLR of 3. 75 gVSl- 1 d- 1. The mesh system operated similarly to the HF/AF system and efficient two-stage AD of the SBMW was shown. Problems with stirring thick digestate limited the OLR on both the mesh and HF systems. To address this limitation on OLR, a 2 nd MeBR was designed which employed a rotating drum for low effort mixing and 100 >m nylon mesh sections on the drum surface for filtration. This reactor system operated stably at an OLR of up to 15 gVSl- 1 d- 1 albeit with reduced specific methane production. Application of this type of system will be dependant on requirements for high plant throughput, system robustness and a compact process to make up for slightly lower methane production and waste stabilisation compared to single stage digestion. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Cell wall {{loosening}} {{and degradation}} are important processes in major stages of plant development including fruit ripening. Three main mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to contribute towards cell wall polysaccharide degradation in vivo: enzymic hydrolysis by endopolygalacturonase (EPG), enzymic elimination by pectate lyase (PL), and non-enzymic scission by hydroxyl radicals (•OH). However, little idea as to which of these three mechanisms predominates in homogalacturonan degradation especially during fruit ripening. This study presents an attempt to discover the respective contribution of those three mechanisms of attack. The strategy used {{to achieve the objective}} {{of this study was to}} identify and measure homogalacturonan molecules that exhibit symptoms of each mechanism of attack. A method that was developed in this study is a fluorescent labelling method mainly to study the •OH attack on pectic polysaccharides. This labelling method is based on the ability of 2 -aminoacridone (2 -AMAC) to reductively aminate oxo groups of sugar moieties followed by exhaustive digestion with Driselase. In a model in-vitro experiment, the developed novel fluorescent labelling method, when applied to homogalacturonan, that had been attacked by •OH (Fenton reagent), produced at least three fluorescent ‘fingerprint’ compounds, separable by high-voltage paper electrophoresis (HVPE) based on their charge/mass properties at pH 6. 5 and also by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C 18 column with a fluorescence detector at λem= 520 nm. These fingerprint compounds include: a monomer, 1 A*; a dimer, 2 A*; and an unidentified compound, X*. In-vivo application with alcoholinsoluble residue (AIR) of seven species of fruit (pear, mango, banana, apple, avocado, strawberry and strawberry tree fruit) at three stages of softening produced at least two fluorescent fingerprint compounds: a monomer, 1 AF and a dimer, 2 AF. XF, an interesting compound found in a few samples in in-vivo experiments, showed electrophoretic mobility similar to X*; however, the retention time of this compound on HPLC did not agree with that of X*. 2 AF was suggested to be exclusive evidence for •OH attack in vivo while 1 AF was suggested to be a useful evidence not only to reveal •OH attack but also to reveal EPG and PL attack on pectic polysaccharides during fruit softening. HVPE and HPLC results showed an increasing pattern of 2 AF in mango, banana, avocado and strawberry tree fruit, which indicated progressive •OH attack on pectic polysaccharides during the softening process. There was no clear evidence of 2 <b>AF</b> at any <b>stage</b> of softening in apple and strawberry, which may suggest that fruit softening in apple and strawberry was not associated with •OH attack. On the other hand, HVPE analysis of 1 AF showed and increasing pattern in pear, mango, banana, avocado and strawberry tree fruit, which may indicate EPG, PL and/or •OH attack during fruit softening. Production of these fluorescent fingerprint compounds provides good evidence for •OH attack on pectic polysaccharides, and has the potential to give useful information for EPG and PL attack in vivo...|$|R
