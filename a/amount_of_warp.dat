40|$|Although planers {{and wood}} {{machining}} {{researchers have been}} around a long time, the interactions between planks and planers have been neglected in basic research. With a solid understanding of the movements of planks during planing, planers and planing strategies can be developed to reduce waste and improve the value yield. Cutting depths, changes in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> and cross-sectional shape were used to analyse the movements of the planks during planing, the alignment between the planks cross-sections and planers cutters and the improvement potential. The feeding roller in the planer intake had most control over the plank motion. Apart from cup reduction, the parts mostly affected by planing were the top and the butt end, where twist-induced misalignment between the cross-sections and the planers cutters resulted in skewed cross-sections and reduced rectangularity. By adjusting the cutting depths and in some cases the sawing oversize, planer misses could have been avoided but improvements in rectangularity would have required changes in the planer setting or planer design. This thesis increases the knowledge on how a 4 -side planer works together with warp to affect 50 × 150 mm planks. For the 20 planks used in this study, the planer removed cup, it decreased the amount of twist and crook but had no effect on bow. The major factor reducing the rectangularity of the planed planks was twist. In the future, knowledge derived from this thesis can be used to create a simulation tool to model the behaviour of warped planks in a planer.

The traditional techniques do not account for such noise and, consequently, cannot provide a robust classification of signals. We apply a recent framework that: (1) uses a distance-based objective function for data alignment and noise reduction, and (2) leads to warping-invariant distances between signals for robust clustering and classification. We use this framework to introduce two distances {{that can be used}} for signal classification: (a) a y-distance, which is the distance between the aligned signals, and (b) an x-distance that measures the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>warping</b> needed to align the signals.

40|$|While the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) - based Nearest-Neighbor Classification {{algorithm}} {{is regarded as}} a strong baseline for time series classification, in recent years there has been a plethora of algorithms that have claimed to be able to improve upon its accuracy in the general case. Many of these proposed ideas sacrifice the simplicity of implementation that DTW-based classifiers offer for rather modest gains. Nevertheless, there are clearly times when even a small improvement could make a large difference in an important medical or financial domain. In this work, we make an unexpected claim; an underappreciated “low hanging fruit” in optimizing DTW’s performance can produce improvements that make it an even stronger baseline, closing most or all the improvement gap of the more sophisticated methods. We show that the method currently used to learn DTW’s only parameter, the maximum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>warping</b> allowed, is likely to give the wrong answer for small training sets.

To this aim a tilted ring model has been used, which is able to explain ail the major features of the H I structure and kinematics. A gas layer with constant thickness can give a reasonable, but not perfect reproduction of the gas structure. Therefore a description is given of the thickness, which is increasing {{as a function of}} radius, expected for a gaslayer being embedded in the potential of a spiral galaxy. Using such a layer in the model calculations produces a satisfactory fit to the observations. It appears that the line of nodes is directed nearly along the line of sight and must be straight to within 20 degrees over most <b>of</b> the <b>warped</b> region. Although there is some difference in surface density between the two sides <b>of</b> the <b>warp,</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>warping</b> is nearly identical, proving the high degree <b>of</b> symmetry.

A precise rotation curve has been determined by matching the model to the observed position-velocity diagram. In the stellar disk region the rotation slightly decreases towards larger radii, then there is the sudden drop at the optical edge, and the rotation is seen to increase slightly beyond this edge. A decomposition of the rotation curve into the individual contributions of disk, bulge, and dark halo reveals that a large core radius of the halo is needed. This immediately forces the bulge and disk to be kinematically dominant in the inner regions...|$|R

If topological transformations {{are involved in}} basic level categorization, then performance in related tasks should also {{be influenced by the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> shape deformation. In particular, the typicality (or representativeness) of category members should be determined by the transformational distance to the category representation. Also, shape similarity should decrease with increasing transformational distance between the objects. These predictions were investigated for 2 D outline shapes of objects from 25 common and familiar object categories. In the typicality task, subjects had to rate the typicality of different category members that were produced with a warping algorithm — i. e. had to judge how well the objects fit with their idea of the category. In the similarity task, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> topological transformation between two objects from the same basic level category was manipulated, and subjects had to rate the similarity of the objects.

Second, perceived similarity decreased in a highly significant way with increasing <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> topological transformation.

Trawl performance data from repetitive towing with <b>warp</b> differentials <b>of</b> 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 20 m were analyzed for their effect on three determinants of flatfish catch efficiency: footrope distance off-bottom, bridle length in contact with the bottom, and area swept by the net. Our results indicated that the distortion of the trawl caused by asymmetry in trawl warp length could have a negative inf luence on flatfish catch efficiency. At a difference of 7 m in warp length, the NOAA 4 % threshold value for the 83112 Eastern survey trawl used in our study, we found no effect on the acous-tic-based measures of door spread, wing spread, and headrope height off-bottom. However, the sensitivity of the trawl to 7 m <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> offset could be seen as footrope distances off-bottom increased slightly (particularly in the center region of the net where flatfish escapement is highest), and as the width of the bridle path responsible for flatfish herding, together with the effective net width, was reduced.

40|$|The {{original}} {{objectives of}} this thesis were {{to use the}} new PolarDARN radars to study the convection patterns at high latitudes and to attempt to explain them in terms of reconnection. Because the IMF is important in reconnection, studies of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) components Bx, By and Bz were done. The study showed that was lower by 21. 5 % than from Jan. 2006 to Dec. 2008, so By was expected {{to play an important role}} in reconnection. The IMF, spiral angle, and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>warping</b> <b>of</b> the solar magnetic field in interplanetary space decreased slightly during this 36 -month period. The decrease in IMF was a more sensitive indicator of the solar minimum than the decrease in the 10. 7 cm solar microwave flux. A solar magnetic sector boundary study from the Jan 1, 2007 – Dec 31, 2008 interval showed the occurrence of four or two sectors in a synodic solar rotation cycle. A sector boundary crossing frequently takes place in less than 3 hours. The transition from four sectors to two sectors is surprisingly smooth, in that no interruption in the 27 -day synodic period occurs. A superposed epoch analysis of solar wind speed near sector boundary crossings showed a speed minimum about half a day before the crossing, and a maximum about two days after the crossing. The standard deviation reached a minimum at about the same time as the velocity. The sector boundary study also showed that, since Dec. 2007, there were six roughly 27 -day synodic solar rotation cycles near spring equinox when “away” field dominated, and that the following seven 27 -day cycles close to the autumnal equinox were dominated by “toward” field. This is consistent with the quasi-sinusoidal annual magnetic sector polarity oscillations that occur for about three years during solar minimum. These oscillations are due to the mainly dipolar magnetic field which is roughly aligned with the Sun’s axis, tilted 7. 25 ° from the normal to the ecliptic plane. The three-year oscillation for the present minimum between Solar Cycles 23 and 24 appeared to begin in Dec. 2007. For the past four solar minima, an El Nino event has occurred during the last of the three oscillations, and the El Nino and sinusoidal magnetic oscillation ended together. The new solar cycle began about 6 months before that. During the past eight years, a new 3 D topological “null-separator” formulation of magnetic reconnection and its effect on convection has been led by Dr. M. Watanabe in ISAS at the University of Saskatchewan. This formulation includes two types of interchange reconnection (Russell and Tanaka) as well as the traditional Dungey reconnection. For conditions when the IMF clock angle was within 30 ° of a Bz+ dominant convection, the new reconnection model shows that the convection can be driven strictly by the two types of interchange reconnection. The model predicts the existence of a “reciprocal cell” on closed field lines and an “interchange merging cell” surrounding an interior lobe cell. The construction of the PolarDARN radars at Rankin Inlet and Inuvik, completed in December, 2007, allowed polar cap convection to be measured for predominantly Bz+ conditions. The existence of the two predicted features was confirmed. This also required that satellite data be analyzed to determine the location of the open-closed-field-line-boundary (OCFLB). Several PolarDARN studies are represented to show convection for different IMF clock angles and seasons...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{concrete}} {{is a poor}} {{insulating material}} but has good thermal mass, while lightweight concrete provides good insulation {{at the price of}} thermal mass. Precast concrete wall systems have not been widely used in residential homes due to poor thermal and acoustic performance, despite being high quality products that are easy to construct. The variable density concrete panel was designed to combine good thermal storage, insulation and high quality precast concrete. It is produced from a single concrete mix which is vibrated to get a lightweight top layer and a normal/heavyweight bottom layer. The lightweight layer is the wall exterior, having low thermal conductivity providing good thermal insulation while the normal/heavyweight layer is the dense wall interior, having high specific heat to provide good thermal mass and sufficient strength for construction handling and to withstand service loads. The intention of this research was to estimate the hardened performance; that is the structural, serviceability and durability performance of the variable density concrete panel. Further developments to the mix design were made where the fresh properties were measured and thermal performance estimated on hardened specimens. Most of the major technical concerns were proved not being as severe as first thought, making the production of variable density concrete panels promising. To ensure that the variable density concrete would stratify, the concrete mix had to have defined fresh properties. Defined rheological ranges gave a good indication of the stratification potential, but the degree of stratification was also found to be dependent on the intensity and time of vibration. Slump flow had to be within a certain range to achieve good stratification but this alone did not guarantee stratification. Variable density concrete was found to have adequate strength capacity both in axial compression and in tension for likely service loads but the strength required to withstand handling loads at early ages was not assessed. The strength of the variable density concrete was found to be affected by several factors such as; degree of stratification, relative strength and thickness of the layers, curing environment and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> defects. As the stratification of the concrete increased the thermal insulation improved whereas the strength decreased. Warping was found not to significantly affect the serviceability of panels despite differential shrinkage within the element. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>warping</b> was mainly related to the degree <b>of</b> stratification. <b>Warping</b> decreased with better stratification as more stress and strain was relieved in the lightweight layer. The lightweight concrete was significantly weaker as well as being less stiff than the structural concrete and therefore creeps to follow the structural concrete. The thermal properties aimed for were generally not reached, but these mixes were not designed to optimise the thermal performance and were tested before the concrete was fully dried. This increased thermal conductivity and therefore reduced the measured R-values. Stratified concrete had good absorption resistance, poor permeability properties and was highly porous. If the concrete was over-vibrated it tended to have a rough surface finish that would require a coating. Delamination of the panels was not assessed in this research but is a likely mode of failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{considerable}} {{progress in}} {{the research and development}} of thin-walled beam structures responds to their growing use in engineering construction and to their increased need for efficiency in strength and cost. The result is a structure that exhibits large shear strains and important non uniform warping under different loadings, such as non uniform torsion, shear bending and distortion. A unified approach is formulated in this thesis for 3 D thin walled beam structures with arbitrary profile geometries, loading cases and boundary conditions. A single warping function, defined by a linear combination of longitudinal displacements at cross sectional nodes (derived from Prokic work), is enhanced and adapted in order to qualitatively and quantitatively reflect and capture the nature of a widest possible range of behaviors. Constraints are prescribed at the kinematics level in order to enable the study of arbitrary cross sections for general loading. This approach, differing from most published theories, has the advantage of enabling the study of arbitrary cross sections (closed/opened or mixed) without any restrictions or distinctions related to the geometry of the profile. It generates automatic data and characteristic computations from a kinematical discretization prescribed by the profile geometry. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> shear bending, torsional and distortional warping and the magnitude of the shear correction factor is computed for arbitrary profile geometries with this single formulation. The proposed formulation is compared to existing theories with respect to the main assumptions and restrictions. The variation of the location of the torsional center, distortional centers and distortional rotational ratio of a profile is discussed in terms of their dependency on the loading cases and on the boundary conditions. A 3 D beam finite element model is developed and validated with several numerical applications. The displacements, rotations, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>warping,</b> normal and shear stresses are compared with reference solutions for general loading cases involving stretching, bending, torsion and/or distortion. Some examples concern the case of beam assemblies with different shaped profiles where the connection type determines the nature <b>of</b> the <b>warping</b> transmission. Other analyses –for which the straightness assumption of Timoshenko theory is relaxed– investigate shear deformation effects on the deflection of short and thin beams by varying the aspect ratio of the beam. Further applications identify the cross sectional distortion and highlight the importance of the distortion on the stresses when compared to bending and torsion even in simple loading cases. Finally, a non linear finite element based on the updated lagrangian formulation is developed by including torsional <b>warping</b> degrees <b>of</b> freedom. An incremental iterative method using the arc length and the Newton-Raphson methods is used to solve the non linear problem. Examples are given to study the flexural, torsional, flexural torsional and lateral torsional buckling problems for which a coupling between the variables describing the flexural and the torsional degrees of freedom occurs. The finite element results are compared to analytical solutions based on different warping functions and commonly used in linear stability for elastic structures having insufficient lateral or torsional stiffnesses that cause an out of plane buckling.

40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> tension on fabric colour for several types of weaves structures, and found a relationship between them. The image analyse technique used to determine the proportion of yarns colour appearance, the advantage of this techniques is the rapidity and reliability. The woven fabric samples are consisting <b>of</b> a polyester <b>warp</b> yarn with continuous filaments and density of 33 end/cm, a polypropylene weft yarn with a density of 24 pick/cm, and the warp tension ranged between 12 - 22 cN/tex. The experimental results demonstrated the effect <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> tension on the colour of fabric, and this effect is related to several factors, where the large proportion <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> appearance leads to larger effect on fabric colour. The difference in the value of colour differences ΔEcmc is larger is in the range 16 to 20 cN/tex <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> tension. Using statistical methods, a mathematical model to calculate the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the colour difference ΔEcmc caused by the change in warp tension had been proposed...|$|R
