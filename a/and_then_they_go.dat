2500|$|Charlie's Angels was {{generally}} formatted {{in the way}} of a procedural drama much like the vast majority of other crime shows of the era. Many of the episodes follow a regular structure whereby a crime is committed, the 'Angels' are given the case details, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> undercover to solve the crime. Inevitably, the final scene takes place back at the Townsend office with Charlie offering his congratulations for a job well done. Most episodes have stand-alone plots and are usually not referenced in future episodes. As such, cast changes notwithstanding, it's possible to view the episodes in any order (the first regular episode filmed, [...] "The Killing Kind," [...] was the sixth to be broadcast).|$|E
2500|$|For {{members of}} all World Class corps {{and the most}} {{competitive}} Open Class corps, the activity is a full-time summer commitment. [...] Members travel from show site to show site, performing in competitions and parades across North America nearly non-stop until the DCI Championships. Corps travel by coach buses in convoy with semi-trailer trucks holding equipment and field kitchens. Once on the road, members generally sleep on the buses as the corps travels at night, and in sleeping bags on school gym floors when their next destination is reached. [...] The corps practice their shows {{for as long as}} the schedule allows during the day, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the stadium for the local competition. [...] After each show is over, the cycle repeats, with only a few breaks in the cycle for laundry days and an occasional free day for relaxation.|$|E
60|$|Diomede and Odysseus {{successfully}} {{achieve their}} adventure {{and return to}} the chiefs, where they talk with Nestor; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to Diomede's hut and drink. The outposts remain, of course, at their stations.|$|E
60|$|Cinderlad {{promised to}} do this, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on farther.|$|R
60|$|So Mr. George {{paid the}} man a small sum of money, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on.|$|R
60|$|Before parting they {{divided the}} relics of the beloved one, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> their way.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are, {{but every}} once in a while they find it {{convenient}} to disappear, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to that place on Lake Cayuga. It's an old homestead that used to belong to Merrick's sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pain {{comes into}} their lives more and more. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go.</b> They {{do not like to}} go, but they have to--out of this world, very reluctantly, {{clutching}} its pain at last in their eagerness to stop...." ...|$|E
60|$|They retain several Popish customs in North Wales, for on Sunday (after morning service) {{the whole}} parish go to {{football}} till the afternoon service begins, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the ale-house and play at {{all manner of}} games (which ale-house is often kept by the parson, for their livings are very small).|$|E
60|$|Isaac {{answered}} not a word. He huddled on his clothes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> downstairs together.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went,</b> {{outwardly}} sober enough, riding their mules {{down the}} stony slopes back to Mentone.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to {{the little}} cafe in the by-street where people sit {{drinking}} coffee, watching the soldiers, meditatively knocking ashes into trays.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay,' {{said the}} young man, bitterly. 'We break the dogs, and we load the guns, {{and we find}} the game, and mark the game,--and then they call {{themselves}} sportsmen; we choose the flies, and we bait the spinning-hooks, and we show them where the fish lie, and then when they've hooked them, they can't get them out without us and the spoonnet; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> home to the ladies and boast of the lot of fish they killed--and who thinks of the keeper?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you know?" [...] {{said the}} artilleryman. I explained. He thought. [...] "Something {{wrong with the}} gun," [...] he said. [...] "But what if there is? They'll get it right again. And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end? It's just men and ants. There's the ants builds their cities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want {{them out of the}} way, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> out of the way. That's what we are now--just ants. Only----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I used {{to notice}} so many couples from the States when {{we lived in}} the city," [...] {{continued}} the hospitable mistress of the house, [...] "but I don't think they often came out to Sillery. In fact, you're the only pair that's come this summer; and so, when you seemed interested about the mission, I thought you wouldn't mind if I spoke to you, and asked you in to see the house. Most of the Americans stay long enough to visit the citadel, and the Plains of Abraham, and the Falls at Montmorenci, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> away. I should think they'd be tired always doing the same things. To be sure, they're always different people." ...|$|E
60|$|Ginger and Peter {{looked at}} 'im and shook their 'eds, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> {{a little way}} off and talked about 'im in whispers.|$|R
60|$|The party {{remained}} at this restaurant, eating their dinner and taking their coffee after it, {{for more than}} an hour; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> away.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> left George still {{contemplating the}} horror- {{stricken}} {{face of the}} nude marble virgin whose eyes appeared to gaze upon the ruins of his picture.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{profess to}} have for a motto 'equal rights to all and special {{privileges}} to none,' <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> off into class legislation. It's easy to talk that principle, but it means business when you stand by it. I haint got the sand to stand by that principle myself. It goes too deep for me, but it's something you young politicians ought to study on. One o' these days that principle will get life into it, {{and when it does}} things will tumble. The Democratic party used to be a party that meant that, and if it ever succeeds again it must head that way. That's the reason I want to get you young fellows into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it all {{happened}} quite naturally," [...] said she. [...] "As we turned {{to go out of}} the woods he was the gentleman nearest to me, and so of course he came with me. Those two girls are sisters, and their name is Dodworth. They introduced Mr. Clyde and the other gentleman, Mr. Raybold, to me. But that was after you had been talking to Mrs. Dodworth, their mother, who is Mr. Raybold's aunt. The other lady, with the shawl on, is Mrs. Henderson, and--would you believe it?--she's grandmother to that girl in the short dress! She doesn't begin to look old enough. The Dodworths don't go into camp at all, but expect to stay here for two weeks longer, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the sea-shore. Mrs. Henderson leaves day after to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{they want}} to do a thing, in {{business}} of course, they must wait till there arises in their brains, somehow, a religious, or ethical, or scientific, or philosophic, concept that the thing is right. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> ahead and do it, unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the human mind is that the wish is parent to the thought. No matter what {{they want to}} do, the sanction always comes. They are superficial casuists. They are Jesuitical. They even see their way to doing wrong that right may come of it. One of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions they have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in wisdom and efficiency. Therefrom comes their sanction to manage the bread and butter of the rest of mankind. They have even resurrected the theory of the divine right of kings--commercial kings in their case.* ...|$|E
60|$|The torches were extinguished, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> {{up to the}} {{platform}} above. They fastened {{one end of the}} rope to the battlement, having first tied knots at short intervals.|$|R
60|$|So the Major {{thanked him}} with gracious dignity and Patsy kissed Danny {{on his right}} cheek, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> away happy <b>and</b> content to find the little rooms up the second flight of the old tenement.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see you," [...] she said, as she half reluctantly {{gave him}} her hand. [...] "But remember, it wasn't me who sent for you. I'd just as lief you stayed away." [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to business.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were times}} when all these things seen, seemed to fall into an entirely {{explicable}} system under Mr. Brumley's exposition, when {{they seemed to be}} giving and most generously giving the clearest indications of what kind of thing the Hostels had to be, and times when this all vanished again and her mind became confused and perplexed. She tried to express just what it was she missed to Mr. Brumley. [...] "One doesn't," [...] she said, [...] "see all of them and what one sees isn't {{what we have to do}} with. I mean we see them dressed up and respectable and busy <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> home and the door shuts. It's the home that we are going to alter and replace--and what is it like?" [...] Mr. Brumley took her for walks in Highbury and the newer parts of Hendon and over to Clapham. [...] "I want to go inside those doors," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, one thing," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "is that we've got a higher class of {{boarders}} {{than we ever}} had before. You'll see, Mr. Westover, if you stay on here till August. There's a class that boards all the year round, and that knows what a hotel is--about as well as Jeff, I guess. You'll find 'em at the big city houses, {{the first of the}} winter, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> down to Floridy or Georgy for February and March; and they get up to Fortress Monroe in April, and work along north about the middle of May to them family hotels in the suburbs around Boston; and they stay there till it's {{time to go to the}} shore. They stay at the shore through July, and then they come here in August, and stay till the leaves turn. They're folks that live on their money, and they're the very highest class, I guess. It's a round of gayety with 'em the whole year through." ...|$|E
6000|$|Commercial morals, especially, are bad. There is no gainsaying that. Greek, Turkish and Armenian morals consist only in {{attending}} church {{regularly on}} the appointed Sabbaths, and in breaking {{the ten commandments}} all {{the balance of the}} week. It comes natural to them to lie and cheat in the first place, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on and improve on nature until they arrive at perfection. In recommending his son to a merchant as a valuable salesman, a father does not say he is a nice, moral, upright boy, and goes to Sunday School and is honest, but he says, [...] "This boy is worth his weight in broad pieces of a hundred--for behold, he will cheat whomsoever hath dealings with him, and from the Euxine to the waters of Marmora there abideth not so gifted a liar!" [...] How is that for a recommendation? The Missionaries tell me that they hear encomiums like that passed upon people every day. They say of a person they admire, [...] "Ah, he is a charming swindler, and a most exquisite liar!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, there's {{nothing like}} hanging of 'em long enough, and {{watching}} of 'em well. It's that vinegar as done it;" [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> seriously to work, {{and there was}} nothing more said of any importance until the eating was nearly over.|$|R
6000|$|... "All O.K.," [...] he {{announced}} presently, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> spinning along as before. But the [...] "edge" [...] {{had been taken}} off the ride, {{and they did not}} seem as free-hearted and full of fun as they had been before the mishap.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I never! Out in {{all this}} storm! It's a wonder the captain would allow it. Why, come in of course, and get thawed out by the fire." [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> in to meet Mr. Laning, and also the two girls.|$|R
60|$|The {{boys are}} bright, lively fellows of to-day, {{with a natural}} taste for a life in the open, and a fondness for a gun and a rod. In the present volume they {{organize}} their little club, and after {{a good deal of}} talk obtain permission to go a number of miles from home and establish a camp {{on the edge of a}} lake. From this spot they are driven away by one who is their enemy, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> elsewhere. They have fun and adventures in plenty, around the camp and while out after both big and little game, and they help to bring to justice two men who are hiding from the officers of the law. To-day hunting in our country is not what it was some years ago. Many of the best hunting localities have become settled, and it is becoming harder and harder to catch a sight of a deer, or a moose, or a bear, or, in fact, any wild animal of size. In the far West the buffalo has been practically wiped out, and in the East the deer and moose would also be gone were it not for the protection of the law, which makes it illegal to shoot down such game during the closed season.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{talk about}} themselves, with {{occasional}} references to each other. I have heard people 'going on' on the hotel piazzas. She's embroidering, or knitting, or tatting, {{or something of}} that kind; and he says she seems quite devoted to needlework, and she says, yes, she has a perfect passion for it, and everybody laughs at her for it; but she can't help it, she always was so from a child, and supposes she always shall be,--with remote and minute particulars. And she ends by saying that perhaps he does not like people to tat, or knit, or embroider, or whatever. And he says, oh, yes, he does; what could make her think such a thing? but for his part he likes boating rather better, or if you're in the woods camping. Then she lets him take up one corner of her work, and perhaps touch her fingers; and that encourages him {{to say that he}} supposes nothing could induce her to drop her work long enough to go down on the rocks, or out among the huckleberry bushes; and she puts her head on one side, and says she doesn't know really. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go,</b> and he lies at her feet on the rocks, or picks huckleberries and drops them in her lap, and they go on talking about themselves, and comparing notes to see how they differ from each other. And----" ...|$|E
60|$|Those, I hold, {{are perhaps}} the deepest words ever written by man. Whole books have been written, and whole books more might be written upon them, and on the words which come after them. 'That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own {{received}} him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of {{the will of the}} flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.' They go down to the mystery of all mysteries,--to the mystery of the unfathomable One God, who dwells alone in the light which none can approach unto, self-sustained and self-sufficing for ever. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on to the other great mystery--how that God comes forth out of himself to give life and light to all things which he has made; and what is the bond between the Abysmal Father in heaven, and us his human children, and {{the world in which we}} live:- even Jesus Christ, God of the substance of his Father, begotten before the worlds, and man of the substance of his mother, born in the world.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> {{to see the}} pheasants. [...] "Now, I'll {{tell you}} what," [...] said the earl. [...] "I advise you to take to shooting. It's the {{amusement}} of a gentleman when a man chances to have the command of game." ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne got Marilla a glassful of her potent currant wine [...] . HOW potent it was Anne, in {{her earlier}} days, had had all too {{good reason to}} know [...] . <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> {{to the door to}} look out on the strange scene.|$|R
60|$|And {{so he went}} on with a lover's {{customary}} eloquence till a late hour in the night. Wilkinson was all patience; {{but about}} one o'clock he began to yawn, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to bed. Early on the following morning, Bertram started for Littlebath.|$|R
