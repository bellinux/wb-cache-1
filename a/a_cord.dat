5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} the hairy ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula {{by the presence of}} a funiculus, <b>a</b> <b>cord</b> of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Tiangong Kaiwu (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature) treatise, written by Song Yingxing in 1637, the ox bladder {{described}} by Jiao Yu is {{replaced with a}} lacquer bag and <b>a</b> <b>cord</b> pulled from a hidden ambusher located on the nearby shore, which would release a flint steel–wheel firing mechanism to ignite the fuse of the naval mine.|$|E

5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of <b>a</b> <b>cord</b> around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by <b>a</b> <b>cord</b> inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by <b>a</b> <b>cord</b> to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E
5000|$|Other non-official {{terms for}} {{firewood}} volume include standing cord, kitchen cord, running cord, face cord, fencing cord, country cord, long cord, and rick, all subject to local variation. These are usually taken {{to mean a}} well-stacked pile of wood in which the logs are shorter or longer than in <b>a</b> legal <b>cord,</b> to accommodate various burners. For example, <b>a</b> face <b>cord</b> commonly consists of wood that is 16 in long. [...] The volume of <b>a</b> face <b>cord</b> therefore is typically 1/3 {{of the volume of}} <b>a</b> full <b>cord</b> even though it is 8 ft long and 4 ft high. <b>A</b> face <b>cord</b> is also called a rick in Midwestern United States.|$|R

5|$|Walsh was on {{the team}} that {{captured}} criminal Arthur Barker, son of gangster Ma Barker, in Chicago in 1935 and was later involved in tracking Public Enemy Number One Al Brady in 1937. On October 12 of that year, {{he was with the}} group of FBI agents who ambushed and killed Brady in a shoot-out at a Bangor, Maine sporting goods store. While waiting for Brady to arrive, he acted as a clerk in the store for several days and arrested Brady Gang member James Dalhover. As the operation leader, Walsh's job was to alert thirteen other agents, as well as over 30 other state and local policemen, of any gang member's arrival by pulling <b>a</b> <b>cord</b> on the window. As they were interrogating Dalhover in the store Clarence Lee Shaffer, Jr., another gang member, entered the building and began firing at the agents. While arresting Dalhover, Walsh took bullets to his hand, shoulder and right chest, but quickly returned to work.|$|E

25|$|Less {{than one}} month after the {{acquittal}} over the rape charges, the nude body of 26-year-old Tracy Habersham was found on September 7, 1997 in Fort Benning.

25|$|Prayers with beads {{like the}} rosary {{may have begun}} as a {{practice}} by the laity to imitate the Christian monasticism of the Liturgy of the Hours, {{during the course of}} which the monks prayed the 150 Psalms daily.

25|$|A {{classic example}} of fictitious force in {{circular}} motion is the experiment of rotating spheres tied by <b>a</b> <b>cord</b> and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain {{the tension in the}} string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>a</b> nuchal <b>cord,</b> where {{the umbilical cord}} is around the neck {{at the point of}} birth is a common occurrence, and checking for, and managing <b>a</b> nuchal <b>cord</b> has become part of routine midwifery practice.
