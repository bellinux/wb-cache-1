40|$|Abstract—Predictable mobile {{networks}} are dynamic {{in terms of}} the mobility and connectivity of the network nodes. However, in contrast to mobile ad-hoc networks, their dynamics are mostly predictable, as the name suggests. Currently, no adequate topology model exists for such networks. Moreover, routing protocols based on either static or mobile <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>topology</b> models do not exploit this predictability and thus are too inefficient for use in some application areas. We present a model that formalizes predictable dynamic topologies as sequences of static snapshots. We use this model to design and prove the correctness of a protocol based on link-state routing, whose performance is superior to its static and ad-hoc counterparts. Our routing protocol accounts for occurrences of additional, unpredictable changes, as well as their interaction with predictable changes. As an application area, we focus on routing in spacecraft networks and explain the suitability of our protocol for this application domain...|$|E

40|$|Increasing onboard {{processing}} capabilities of sensors enable self-organization in {{wireless sensor networks}} to dynamically adapt to <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>topologies</b> and to react to task or network changes.

Asymmetric data flow characteristics is used to govern route selection, and to formulate an organized transmission schedule with risk-free sleeping time.

We consider a network obeying the <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>topology,</b> {{in which the}} nodes sense an amount of data and cooperate with each other, by exchanging information, in order to estimate an unknown, common, parameter vector. The algorithm, to be presented here, follows the set-theoretic estimation rationale; i. e., at each time instant and at each node of the network, a closed convex set is constructed based on the received measurements, and this defines the region in which the solution is searched for. In this paper, these closed convex sets, known as property sets, {{take the form of}} hyperslabs. Moreover, {{in order to reduce the}} number of transmitted coefficients, which is dictated by the dimension of the unknown vector, we seek for possible solutions in a subspace of lower dimension; the technique will be developed around the Krylov subspace rationale. Our goal is to find a point that belongs to the intersection of this infinite number of hyperslabs and the respective Krylov subspaces. This is achieved via a sequence of projections onto the property sets and the Krylov subspaces. The case of highly correlated inputs that degrades the performance of the algorithm is also considered. This is overcome via a transformation whichwhitens the input. The proposed schemes are brought in a decentralized form by adopting the combine-adapt cooperation strategy among the nodes.

40|$|Abstract — In {{geographic}} routing, nodes need {{to maintain}} up-to-date positions of their immediate neighbours for making effective forwarding decisions. Periodic broadcasting of beacon packets that contain the geographic location coordinates of the nodes is a popular method used by most geographic routing protocols to maintain neighbour positions. We contend that periodic beaconing regardless of network mobility and traffic pattern does not make optimal ulilisation of the wireless medium and node energy. For example, if the beacon interval is too small compared to {{the rate at which}} a node changes its current position, periodic beaconing will create many redundant position updates. Similarly, when only a few nodes in a large network are involved in data forwarding, resources spent by all other nodes in maintaining their neighbour positions are greatly wasted. To address these problems, we propose the Adaptive Position Update (APU) strategy for geographic routing. Based on mobility prediction, APU enables nodes to update their position adaptively to the node mobility and traffic pattern. We embed APU into the well known Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing Protocol (GPSR), and compare it with original GPSR in the ns- 2 simulation platform. We conducted several experiments with randomly generated network topologies and mobility patterns. The results confirm that APU significantly reduces beacon overhead without having any noticeable impact on the data throughput of the network. This result is further validated through a trace driven simulation of a practical vehicular <b>ad-hoc</b> network <b>topology</b> that exhibits realistic movement patterns of public transport buses in a metropolitan city.
