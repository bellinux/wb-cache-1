5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with critics praising it {{as a fine}} example in the adventure gaming genre. While most critics <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> game addressed many flaws in The Sleeping Dragon, it has also received some criticism, particularly for its rushed ending and at times poor controls.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} Saturday Night Live clashed with Henson's {{vision for the}} program. Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches. Henson felt {{they were trying to}} write for {{situational}} comedy rather than staying within his intended story. Frank Oz eventually <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> partnership between Henson's team and the show's writers was imperfect, and was thankful they moved on to The Muppet Show.|$|E

5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting {{with a sense of}} urgency, had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E
5|$|After {{embarking on}} a small tour, the band set about {{recording}} Brave New World, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band's regular producer, and record in a different studio {{than the one in}} which they made No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E

5|$|During {{the morning}} of 12 May, King Leopold III, General van Overstraeten, Édouard Daladier, General Alphonse Georges (commander of the First Allied army Group, {{comprising}} the BEF, French 1st, 2nd, 7th and 9th Armies), General Gaston Billotte (coordinator of the Allied Armies) and General Henry Royds Pownall, Gort's chief of staff, met for a military conference near Mons. It was <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> Belgian Army would man the Antwerp–Leuven line, while its allies took up the responsibility of defending the extreme {{north and south of}} the country.|$|E
5|$|From summer 2005, {{the media}} had linked Cissé with a move away from Anfield. Speculation {{intensified}} as the season went on. In early June 2006, {{it was reported that}} a transfer to Olympique de Marseille had been <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> very same day Cissé broke his leg during France's final warm up match against China on 7 June 2006. It was thought that even though a relatively quick recovery was expected, Cissé's transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|Goldstein was {{the host}} of Gone Too Far, a drug {{intervention}} reality show for MTV. He had approached MTV in mid 2008, pitching {{the idea of a}} reality show that focused on his life to Tony DiSanto. DiSanto said that such shows were declining in popularity, and instead suggested a drug intervention show to which Goldstein <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> show was still in pre-production when Goldstein was injured in the plane crash. Following the crash, the show's producer Cheryl Sirulnick said she assumed the show would not go ahead, but Goldstein insisted on continuing. Eight episodes were filmed; three days before his death, Goldstein tweeted that filming had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Hearings into Teapot Dome {{began in}} October 1923, after Harding's death. Fall had left office earlier that year, but he denied {{receiving}} any money from Sinclair or Doheny; Sinclair <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> following month, Walsh learned that Fall had spent lavishly on expanding and improving his New Mexico ranch. Fall reappeared {{and stated that}} the money had come as a loan from Harding's friend and The Washington Post publisher Edward B. McLean, but McLean denied it when he testified. Doheny told the committee that he had given Fall the money in cash as a personal loan out of regard for their past association, but Fall invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was compelled to appear again, rather than answer questions.|$|E
5|$|In 1666 the Great Fire of London gutted the City of London {{but it was}} rebuilt shortly {{afterwards}} {{with many}} significant buildings designed by Sir Christopher Wren. In Parliament two factions had emerged — the Tories and Whigs. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II, some of them, along with the Whigs, during the Revolution of 1688 invited Dutch prince William of Orange to defeat James and ultimately to become William III of England. Some English people, especially in the north, were Jacobites and continued to support James and his sons. After the parliaments of England and Scotland <b>agreed,</b> <b>the</b> two countries joined in political union, to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. To accommodate the union, {{institutions such as the}} law and national churches of each remained separate.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Maine Republicans {{refused to}} pass more anti-alcohol legislation, and Dow quit {{the party to}} join the Prohibitionists; he {{instantly}} became the party's most prominent member. His friend and ally James Black requested that Dow's name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the 1880 convention, to which Dow <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> convention that met in Cleveland that June welcomed delegates from twelve states, but attracted almost no attention from the press. Dow himself did not attend, staying home with his ailing wife (candidates for a party's nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time). He was nominated, heading a ticket with vice-presidential nominee Henry A. Thompson of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, lenders {{warned that}} {{time was running out}} for a deal to be agreed on a new bailout plan. On 17 June, Tsakalotos warned that Greece {{would not be able to}} repay its €1.6bn loan from the IMF at the end of the month unless a new bailout plan was <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> {{deadline}} for the renewal of Greece's bailout package was also looming at the end of June. On 26 June, an emergency cabinet meeting led to the calling of a referendum on the bailout deal proposed by the creditors. Capital controls and a bank holiday were announced on 28 June, with the Eurozone refusing an extension of the bailout plan and Greece defaulting on its loan to the IMF on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm {{on the grounds that it}} violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|In Saxony, a joint {{force of}} Austrians and Brunswickers {{under the command}} of General Kienmayer was far more successful, {{defeating}} a corps {{under the command of}} General Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the capital, Dresden, and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had been <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.|$|E

5|$|In September 2010 Willie Walsh, now CEO of IAG, {{announced}} that the group was considering acquiring other airlines and had drawn up a shortlist of twelve possible acquisitions. In November 2011 IAG announced an agreement in principle to purchase British Midland International from Lufthansa. A contract to purchase the airline was <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> next month, and the sale was completed for £172.5 million on 30 March 2012. The airline established a new subsidiary based at London City Airport operating Airbus A318s.|$|E
5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was <b>agreed.</b> <b>The</b> Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was known}} for his {{conservative}} political views. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they <b>agreed</b> <b>the</b> French and Germans were not to be trusted. Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
