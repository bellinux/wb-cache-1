40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether country (Australia or Japan) and client type (public sector or private sector) impact the auditor's client risk assessments, {{subsequent}} <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions (planned audit hours) and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> responsiveness to client risk assessments. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on previously developed <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> models and uses working paper-sourced data of planned auditor effort and nine client risk assessments. The study samples are taken from public and private sector audit engagements of two major audit firms in Australia and Japan, respectively. Findings – Evidence is found that country and client type do have an impact on the auditor's client risk assessments and planned total audit hours, but they do not moderate <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> responsiveness to client risk assessments. Research limitations/implications – The test variable is confounded by the country and client type characteristics inherent in the study's samples. If the differences are caused by country, this suggests that <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions vary across countries, even when the same auditing standards are adopted. However, if they are caused by client type, this suggests that the same audit approach (i. e. the audit risk model) is applied differently depending on client characteristics. Practical implications – These findings are useful to international standard setters, audit practice quality control and training, and audit research. Originality/value – No prior study has examined the role of country and client type on the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions. Further, no prior study has examined whether the relationship between the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions is moderated by country and client type. <b>Audit</b> <b>planning,</b> Audit risk model, Australia, Client risk assessments, Country and client-type, Japan, Private sector, Public sector...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to increase our understanding of the manner in which auditors integrate information about management tone-at-the-top with other information when making <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions related to extent of substantive testing. <b>Audit</b> <b>planning</b> is an area that requires considerable professional judgment and involves the evaluation and integration of a wide range of information, such as the client’s internal environment including both tone-at-the-top and internal controls, planning phase analytical procedures (PPAP), and characteristics of the client’s business and the industry in which it operates. This research provides evidence that auditors do consider tone-at-the-top during the <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> process and that this information is integrated with other relevant factors in extent-of-substantive-testing judgments. We use a complex task (Bonner 1994; Kennedy, et al. 1997) providing cues across several dimensions, including client tone-at-the-top, results of internal control tests and PPAP, and various client characteristics to study planned extent-of-substantive-testing judgments made by auditors. One goal is to determine whether auditors integrate information about tone-at-the-top during <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> into subsequent extent-of-substantive-testing judgments. In addition, we determine how tone-at-the-top interacts with other relevant factors in <b>audit</b> <b>planning.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically address tone-at-the-top as a planning consideration within the audit risk model and to operationalize this variable within an experiment along with tests of controls. Previous studies operationalized internal control only as results of control tests (Cohen and Kida 1989; Dusenbury, et al. 2000), or only as contro...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{framework}} {{set out in}} {{this paper}} provides guidance for auditing the performance of regulators {{in regard to the}} compliance costs they impose on business and other regulated entities. It complements other frameworks that are used to assess the performance of regulators in regard to their efficiency and effectiveness, and processes for ex ante assessment of the impact of proposed regulations. The framework should be applied within institutional arrangements that establish the authority, resources, and mechanisms to hold regulators to account. For audits to improve regulator performance in this regard they need to: 	develop an <b>audit</b> <b>plan</b> in consultation with business and other stakeholders. This document should set out how the regulator will reduce compliance costs (good practice indicators), and how their achievement of this objective will be assessed (metrics) 	reward good performance and sanction poor performance 	comply with, and report against, the high level principles for good performance 	be public documents, with the <b>audit</b> <b>plans</b> and reports made available on the regulator 2 ̆ 7 s website. In order for the audits to be undertaken in an effective and efficient way they should: 	focus on the principles and particular areas of regulator behaviour that have the greatest effect on the cost of compliance for businesses they regulate — these will differ across regulators 	select good practice indicators that best reflect regulator behaviour that minimises compliance costs while still achieving the objectives of the regulation 	provide metrics at the highest level possible to demonstrate the satisfaction of the principle or indicator, utilising data and information from existing sources where available 	require auditors to 2 ̆ 7 triangulate 2 ̆ 7 information in forming a view of the satisfactory achievement of a principle 	be included as a separate module in external audits that examine broader areas of performance of the regulator and regulation. As part of the broader system that promotes regulation reform and reduces regulatory burden, oversight is needed to: 	ensure that <b>audit</b> <b>plans</b> are prepared and that both <b>plans</b> and <b>audit</b> reports are published 	coordinate the development of <b>audit</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>audits</b> to minimise the costs to business of participating in the process, and prioritise resources to where the potential for improvement is greatest 	facilitate feedback {{on the quality of the}} regulations and need for reform 	publish a report card facilitating comparison of the performance of regulators and lessons on approaches that have worked well in reducing compliance costs...|$|R
