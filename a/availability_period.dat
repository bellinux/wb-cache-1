The cruise commenced on 22 June and was concluded on 6 August at Long Beach. She resumed operations out of her homeport until 13 November when she got underway for another deployment to the western Pacific. Somers {{was assigned to the}} 7th Fleet from December 1970 until 4 May 1971. During that time, she plane guarded the carriers on six occasions, rendered naval gunfire support on three, and once stood watch on the northern search and rescue station. In between line periods, she visited Keelung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; Singapore; and Penang, Malaysia, in addition to putting in periodically at the naval station at Subic Bay.|$|E

On 7 January 1956, Benham entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for another modernization overhaul. She then spent the summer serving as a school ship at Newport, helping to train prospective commanding officers and engineers. In September, the destroyer entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a two-week <b>availability</b> <b>period.</b> Then, given the growing tensions in the Middle East over the Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal, her crew began intensive training exercises out of Newport {{in preparation for a}} possible emergency deployment. On 29 October, Israeli forces attacked Egyptian forces in the Sinai, followed two days later by British and French air strikes on British and French paratroopers dropped on Port Said, the start of a larger operation to seize the entire Suez Canal. The next day, however, the Soviet Union declared its intentions to support Egypt in this conflict.|$|E

The management of the <b>availability</b> <b>periods</b> of shared resources causes a problem because it is achieved by the scheduling systems which assume a local environment where all resources are on the same site. Therefore, distributed scheduling with shared resources is an important research topic in recent years.

We are using a simple example of manufacturing system to illustrate the ability of DSCEP framework to solve the shared resources scheduling problem in complex systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Resource {{leveling}} is {{a variant}} of resource-constrained project scheduling in which a non-regular objective function, the resource availability cost, is to be minimized.

Time-indexed mixed integer programming formulations for similar problems quite often fail already on instances with only 30 jobs, depending on the network complexity and the total freedom of arranging jobs. A reason is the typically very weak linear programming relaxation. In particular for larger instances, our approach gives tighter bounds, enabling us to optimally solve instances with 50 multi-mode jobs. ...|$|R

This situation arises when an optical link is to be maintained between a spacecraft and n ground stations affected by cloud coverage.

Based on a given single-station (un) availability duration distribution, we derive analytically the network (un) availability duration distributions.

40|$|International audienceWe propose in {{this paper}} a new {{algorithm}} for scheduling independent jobs in volunteer computing platforms. In such platforms, the resources are not continuously available over time. Moreover, the beginning and finishing times of the resource <b>availability</b> <b>periods</b> are subject to some uncertainties since the machines are directly administrated by the owners (and thus, there is no global centralized control). The performance of the applications is achieved by a suitable adaptation of the algorithms to the volunteer environments. We propose an efficient method that optimizes the performance and reduces the impact of disturbances by means of stability. Stability gives the guarantee that the disturbed solution does not differ too much from the initial solution. It is obtained {{on the basis of}} a reputation mechanism of the resources that makes the scheduling decisions more adequate. The quality of our algorithm is demonstrated by a campaign of experiments using simulations of actual traces of BOINC where the results are compared to other existing reference algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to examine problems with the Navy's two price aviation depot level repairable (AVDLR) billing and tracking system. These problems include fluctuations in post fiscal year obligation levels and the distortion of flying hour cost reporting due to AVDLR carcass charges and credits received during the expenditure <b>availability</b> <b>periods</b> of the Operations and Maintenance, Navy appropriations used to fund AVDLR purchases. Fluctuations in post fiscal year obligation levels can potentially result in the unintentional over obligation of funds. Distortions in flying hour costs result in inaccurate flying hour program budget requests. This thesis also explored the feasibility of a two price/one bill system of charging for AVDLRs which has often been proposed {{as a solution to}} the problem mentioned above. The conclusion reached is that the problems with the two price system have diminished significantly over time. The two price billing system remains the best means of maintaining systems visibility of AVDLR carcasses and holding down overall AVDLR costs. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
