40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to characterize the fatty acids profiles of goat milk and its fermented products i. e. yogurt <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> yogurt. Fresh milk from Peranakan Etawah goats was collected directly from local goat farmers, and processed into stirred-type fresh yogurt. The yogurt was then further processed into concentrated yogurt using Berge method. A total of 26 fatty acids were detected in milk, yogurt <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> yogurt, comprised of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The oleic acid, stearic acid and palmitic acid were the major fatty acids found in fresh milk, yogurt <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> yogurt. There were changes in the profiles of individual fatty acids during processing of fresh goat milk into yogurt <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> yogurt...|$|R

He also placed fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, and fifth in the 200-meter butterfly. In the preliminary round of the 4×200-meter freestyle, he helped the United States turn in the top qualifying time. The United States later won the event, earning Tarwater a gold medal. After the 2009 season, Tarwater decided to retire from competitive swimming <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> on his academic work at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|During the {{operations}} {{along the south}} coast of New Britain the AIB officers sought to discourage the Japanese from moving west of the Wide Bay area by circulating rumours among the local population that a large Australian base had been established at Jacquinot Bay. In reality no such base existed at this time. The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> on intelligence gathering ahead of the landing of Australian infantry and support units at Jacquinot Bay. The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted by occasional air attacks and naval bombardments conducted by elements of the Allied air forces and navies.|$|E

5|$|Little {{documentary}} {{evidence of the}} games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account {{in the form of}} his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney {{had a great deal}} of respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. Skin color changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> in {{different}} regions of the body. The pigment cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the neural crest. The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the spine and on top of the limbs. The rest of the body is flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides and underneath.|$|E

5|$|With the Indian Division committed, Montgomery {{decided to}} raise the stakes further by {{bringing}} the British 5th Infantry Division from the relatively tranquil XIII Corps front in the high mountains on the left wing of the 8th Army and insert them between the New Zealand and Indian Divisions. This would allow the Indian division to narrow <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> their attack and give Montgomery four divisions to continue the attack between Orsogna and the sea. By 12 December, the British 17th Infantry Brigade—the first of 5th Division's brigades—was in place and under the New Zealand division's command. Once 5th Division headquarters and its other brigades had arrived, these two left hand divisions were to be organised {{under the command of}} XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E
5|$|However, between March 14 and 15, the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment {{was forced}} to turn back from Tam Kỳ {{to deal with an}} attack on Thang Binh, by the Viet Cong 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. In {{southern}} Quảng Ngãi, the Viet Cong 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of National Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) was pinned down trying to deal with Viet Cong attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province. Recognising that he no longer has the manpower to mount a counter-attack, General Nhut ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> his units in Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai instead.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E
5|$|Michèle Mouton {{was born}} 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a {{town on the}} French Riviera known for its perfume industry, close to the {{mountain}} stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents grew roses and jasmine on their large property. After graduating from high school, Mouton began law studies, but would soon drop out <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> on a career in rallying. Although Mouton began driving her father's Citroën 2CV when she was 14 years old, she did not turn her interest to rallying until 1972, when her friend Jean Taibi asked her to practise the Tour de Corse with him. Mouton later co-drove {{for him in the}} 1973 Monte Carlo Rally, the first-ever World Rally Championship (WRC) event. After a few more rallies, Mouton's father suggested a switch to driving if she wanted to continue in rallying, and promised to buy her a car and give her one-year to prove herself. Driving an Alpine-Renault A110, she debuted at the Critérium Féminin Paris-Saint-Raphaël and then tackled the Tour de France Automobile. In the Île de Beauté, a complementary event to the Tour de Corse at the end of 1973, Mouton finished eighth overall.|$|E
