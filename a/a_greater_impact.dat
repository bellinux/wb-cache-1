5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} a break in {{tradition}} when the Echo title-piece appeared reversed out in white on a red background, instead of the more familiar red or black lettering. The new title-piece was designed to give <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> to the colourful front page. It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E
5|$|The house sparrow's main predators are {{cats and}} birds of prey, {{but many other}} animals prey on them, {{including}} corvids, squirrels, and even humans—the house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people {{in many parts of}} the world, and it still is in parts of the Mediterranean. Most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where records are extensive. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are likely to have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> on house sparrow populations. The house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{fighting}} at Tobruk, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} front and placed in reserve. When Japan entered the war, the division was transferred to India. It was considered the most experienced and best trained British formation available in Asia. In India, the division formed a reserve to counter possible Japanese landings while it trained in jungle warfare. It {{also served as a}} police force, protecting railways and being used to suppress civil disobedience caused by the Quit India Movement. While it was requested that the division be sent to the front line in Burma, it was instead transferred to Special Force, commonly known as the Chindits. Such a move was opposed by the highest military commanders in India and Burma, and proved controversial with the troops themselves. Despite their pleas, the division was broken up and officially ceased to exist on 24November 1943. Historian Woodburn Kirby and Lieutenant-General William Slim (who led the British troops in Burma) believed that the division could have had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> against the Japanese had it been retained as a single formation.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors may}} {{determine}} the extent to which circular migration is impactful upon the return of the migrant. First, the size of the returning population is important, as large numbers of migrants may form a critical mass necessary for true change to occur. Second, the duration of the absence of the migrants is influential, as too short of an absence brings little change and too long of an absence leads to difficulties in readjustment. Third, it is important to consider social class, as the elite may have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> than unskilled workers. Fourth, the extent to which the origin and destination areas are different can have an effect, as those who migrate to metropolitan areas will have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> if returning to an urban rather than a rural area. Lastly, the quantity and quality of the skills that the migrant acquires while abroad can determine the impact of migration.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> {{than the}} actual casualties, {{according}} to historian Stephen W.

25|$|A {{number of}} economists, such as Macquarie Bank analyst Rory Robertson, assert that high {{immigration}} and the propensity of new arrivals to cluster {{in the capital}} cities is exacerbating the nation's housing affordability problem.

Self-immolations, on the other hand, result in dramatic images of the protester while burning or afterwards which can be easily transmitted over the internet to news media and supporters. Internet access has reached even remote areas in the parts of China where Tibetans live.|$|E
25|$|The British {{began to}} assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941 and the RAF Air Staff used the German {{experience}} to improve Bomber Command's offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries, because they had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> on production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the Luftwaffe had failed in precision attack and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.|$|E

25|$|Hutchinson and Cederbaum (2011) studied father-daughter {{communication}} {{and found that}} increased father-daughter communication delayed sexual debut and decreased the frequency of engagement in sexual intercourse. They also found that responsible sexual behavior among adolescent females was associated with positive father-daughter communication regarding men, dating, sex, and marriage. On the other hand, fathers who were absent had been linked to higher rates of sexual activity and teen pregnancy among female adolescents. Fathers have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> on daughters than they think, but fail to recognize it because they don’t believe they should be discussing sex with their daughters or simply {{leave it to the}} mothers.|$|E

These changes were widely used to study activity-patterns, but research has shown that processes associated with aging have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> than occupational stresses. It has also been shown that geometric changes to bone structure (described above) and entheseal changes differ in their underlying cause with the latter poorly affected by occupation. Joint changes, including osteoarthritis, have also been used to infer occupations but in general these are also manifestations of the aging process.|$|E

25|$|The {{trend of}} rising income {{inequality}} is also apparent after taxes and transfers. A 2011 {{study by the}} CBO found that the top earning 1 percent of households increased their income by about 275% after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007, compared to a gain of just under 40% for the 60 percent {{in the middle of}} America's income distribution. U.S. federal tax and transfer policies are progressive and therefore substantially reduce income inequality measured after taxes and transfers. They became moderately less progressive between 1979 and 2007 but slightly more progressive measured between 1979 and 2011. Income transfers had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> on reducing inequality than taxes from 1979 to 2011.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{technological}} inventions of the period– {{whether of}} Arab or Chinese origin, or unique European innovations– {{were to have}} great influence on political and social developments, in particular gunpowder, the printing press and the compass. The introduction of gunpowder {{to the field of}} battle affected not only military organisation, but helped advance the nation state. Gutenberg's movable type printing press made possible not only the Reformation, but also a dissemination of knowledge that would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society. The compass, along with other innovations such as the cross-staff, the mariner's astrolabe, and advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the World Oceans, and the early phases of colonialism. Other inventions had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> on everyday life, such as eyeglasses and the weight-driven clock.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the new Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 sounded the death knell for white political power and ushered {{in a new era}} of black majority rule. White emigration peaked between 1980 and 1982 at 53,000 persons, with the breakdown of law and order, an increase in crime in the rural areas, and the provocative attitude of Zimbabwean officials being cited as the main causes. Political conditions typically had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> on the decision to migrate among white than black professionals. Between 1982 and 2000 Zimbabwe registered a net loss of 100,000 whites, or an average of 5,000 departures per year. A second wave of white emigration was sparked by President Robert Mugabe's violent land reform programme after 2000. Popular destinations included South Africa and Australia, which emigrants perceived to be geographically, culturally, or sociopolitically similar to their home country.|$|E
