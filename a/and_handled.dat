40|$|Toe-clipping, {{the removal}} {{of one or more}} toes, is a common method used to {{individually}} mark free-living animals. Whilst this method is widely used in studies of amphibians, the appropriateness of the method, and its potential detrimental effects {{have been the subject of}} debate. Here, we provide for the first time, evidence that toe-clipping is a stressor in a wild amphibian. We measured urinary corticosterone responses of male cane toads (Rhinella marina) to capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, <b>and</b> to toe-clipping under field conditions. Urinary testosterone concentrations and white blood cell proportions were also measured. Urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations increased 6 h after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only <b>and</b> remained high for 24 h; corticosterone returned to baseline levels after 48 h and remained low at 72 h post capture <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Corticosterone concentrations in toads subjected to toe-clipping increased at 6 h to significantly higher concentrations than after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, then decreased more slowly than after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>and</b> were still elevated (approximately double basal level) 72 h after toe-clipping. Testosterone did not change significantly after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, whereas after toe-clipping testosterone decreased at 6 h and remained low at 72 h. There were weak short-term effects of toe-clipping compared with capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only on white blood cell proportions. We have clearly shown that toe-clipping is a distinctly stronger stressor than capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> alone. This indicates that there is an ethical cost of toe-clipping, and this should be considered when planning studies of amphibians. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on an {{occupational}} therapist’s experience of teaching moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> skills {{as part of his}} role of ‘key trainer’ in a primary care NHS trust. Time constraints on the staff involved require effective teaching and communication methods to be used in order to ensure the best possible outcomes in terms of patient and staff safety. Potential obstacles to effective moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> education are investigated and existing learning techniques used are reflected upon. Educational theory is then evaluated and integrated into future teaching sessions, resulting in a proposed framework for moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> education. The term ‘moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> educator’ (as opposed to trainer) is therefore suggested as more accurately reflecting the nature of this role.

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} indicates that in clinical practice diploma student nurses encounter M&H practices that do not always reflect those taught in training and that these influence their own practice.

Data was obtained using semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation. The students moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> practice was subject to a large number of influences of which the most influential were those of service staff and the associated M&H norms of the clinical area. In the face of experienced staff students felt inferior and powerless and in order to 'fit in' failed to confront established moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> norms. Students felt their moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> training unrepresentative of clinical practice and were little influenced by it. The predominant influence was the clinical staff's practice of moving <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Pre- <b>and</b> post-registration moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> training needs to be standardised, integrated and for students should be taught in a way that enables them to apply their learning in the practice setting.
