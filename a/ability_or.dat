This suggested that the <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of P.stypticus into geographically isolated areas.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this <b>ability,</b> <b>or</b> the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue {{take place}} in the region of Kanto. This is one {{distinct}} region shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities, and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> gains a special item. Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon range from caves to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool can only be caught either through fishing or when the player is in a body of water, while Zubat can only be caught in a cave.|$|E

The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages.

5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E
