5|$|The game is set {{during a}} fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, {{in which both}} sides use nuclear <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> against each other.

Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.|$|E

50|$|Throughout history, <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{have been}} used as {{strategic}} weaponry to devastate the enemy in times of war. After the mass destruction created by WWI <b>and</b> WWII, <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> have been considered to be inhumane by most nations, and governments and organizations have undertaken to locate <b>and</b> destroy existing <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> However, not all nations have been willing to cooperate with disclosing or demilitarizing their inventory of <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> Since the start of the worldwide efforts to destroy all existing <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> some nations <b>and</b> terrorist organizations have used and threatened the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> to leverage their position in conflict. Notable examples include the use of such weapons by Iraq’s Saddam Hussein on the Kurdish village Halabja in 1988 and their employment against civilian passengers of the Tokyo subway by Aum Shinrikyo in 1995. The efforts made by the United States <b>and</b> other <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> destruction agencies intend to prevent such use, but this is a difficult and ongoing effort.
