It {{was intended as a}} serious game, and to prove Insomniac's ability to create games other than platformers. Insomniac spent six months on the project, developing several prototypes and a functional demo.

During an interview with the portal IdiVidi, Gočeva explained that the group working on the album consisted of her long-time professional acquaintances, thus rendering the process of working with them easy and pleasant due to the presence of an [...] "excellent atmosphere".

During an interview on the TV show Carpe diem on the TV channel Alsat-M in February 2014, Gočeva called the album her best work she had published yet. The maturity she had gained throughout her career served as an inspiration of [...] "modernizing the traditional"; Gočeva said that the Macedonian folklore is something existing in the blood of the Macedonian people and added that her album was not characterized by typical traditional songs but rather songs drawing inspiration from that kind of music. Through the new tracks, she allowed her musical performance to stand out and leave a certain long-lasting contribution to Macedonian contemporary music. The singer also acknowledged that the music she had recorded for the album was not popular on a worldwide scale, but emphasized that the sound is more authentic for Macedonia as compared to other mainstream popular genres across the world such as hip hop, pop and R.|$|E
