5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E
5|$|In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{expressed}} concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing {{might result in}} the destruction of the endangered least Bell's vireo habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.|$|E

5|$|Nowadays, large {{quantities}} of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{iron ore}} {{is high in}} {{phosphorus}} {{and needs to be}} mixed with purer ores, such as those on the west coast in Cumberland and Lancashire. In the early 1850s this ore was travelling the long way round over the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway to the Barrow-in-Furness area, and Durham coke was returning. Both the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway (SD) and the Eden Valley Railway (EVR) companies were formed on 20 September 1856. Taking advantage of the new railway at Barnard Castle, the SD crossed the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to meet the West Coast Main Line (WCML) at Tebay, on the section then controlled by the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway, and also linked Barnard Castle with West Auckland. The EVR was a branch from Kirkby Stephen to the WCML near Penrith via Appleby. The routes were surveyed by Thomas Bouch and SD received permission on 13 July 1857. The EVR route followed the east bank of the River Eden, a mile longer than <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> route on the west bank, and its Act received royal assent on 21 May 1858.|$|E

25|$|Tube pitch: when {{designing}} the tubes, it is practical {{to ensure that}} the tube pitch (i.e., the centre-centre distance of adjoining tubes) is not less than 1.25 times the tubes' outside diameter.

25|$|During {{the later}} {{half of the}} nineteenth century several colonies funded the {{immigration}} of skilled immigrants from Europe, starting with the assistance of German vintners to South Australia.

25|$|Some historians now {{dispute that}} {{the woman in the}} picture is Catherine. Antonia Fraser has argued that the Toledo {{portrait}} is of Jane Seymour's sister, Elizabeth Seymour, on the basis {{that the woman}} bears a remarkable resemblance to Jane, especially around the chin, and is wearing the clothes of a widow, which Catherine never had occasion to wear. However, black clothes do not necessarily signify mourning, and, because black was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> dye, were often worn to signify wealth and status.|$|E

25|$|These styles {{generally}} have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin (F-5 and A-5), or an oval sound hole (F-4 and A-4 and lower models) {{directly under the}} strings. Much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes, and other variants have become increasingly common. Generally, in the United States, Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass, while the A-style is associated other types of music, although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass. The F-5's more complicated woodwork also translates into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> instrument.|$|E

25|$|Drinking {{water is}} often {{collected}} at springs, extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places {{is thus a}} possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful microbes. Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes. Distillation does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis. Desalination of abundant seawater is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> solution used in coastal arid climates.|$|E

A team that retrieved the artifact and exited the temple with it before time ran out earned the grand prize, {{in addition to the}} other two prizes.

25|$|His best {{performance}} in a match came during the 1994/95 Red Stripe Cup when he was Man of the Match after taking match figures of 13 for 123 against Jamaica. Eight of those wickets came in the first innings, {{at the expense of}} 92 runs and he took the other five when Jamaica followed on. At the time of his last first-class appearance, only Andy Roberts has taken better match and innings bowling analysis for the Leeward Islands than Phillip. It was a good season for Phillip, with his tally of 28 wickets at 15.50 only bettered in 1996/97 when he took 35 wickets, but at <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> average of 29.25.|$|E
