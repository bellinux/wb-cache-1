500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through this day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E
2500|$|While incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, Speck {{was given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "birdman" [...] after the film Birdman of Alcatraz, because he kept a pair of sparrows that had flown into his cell. He {{was described as a}} loner who kept a stamp collection and enjoyed listening to music. His contacts with the warden included requests for new shirts, radio and other mundane items. The warden merely described him as [...] "a big nothing doing time." [...] Speck was not a model prisoner; he was often caught with drugs or distilled moonshine. Punishment for such infractions never stopped him. [...] "How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in trouble? I'm here for 1,200 years!" ...|$|E

5000|$|... “Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jail? Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jail in a bathrobe? What does {{it matter}} {{in the scheme of}} things whether or not you put on your clothes? Are you not making, at best, a futile gesture, at worst, flinging {{yourself}} against something which does not exist? Is freedom more important than justice? Of what does freedom of the human spirit consist, that quality on which I place so much stress?” ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, on February 5, 2005, {{students}} formed a sit-in while reading {{passages from the}} center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard or read of the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating “If we’re sheltered all our lives, what are we going to do when we get to college? If I’m not exposed now, how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> by in life?”. Conder ended the protest at [...] midday by telling the students that he plans to stand with the decision of what a new a curriculum review committee, that will have two representatives from each grade alongside parents. Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's a young pelican," [...] she replied. [...] "I {{found a lot}} of nests on {{the ground}} over there, and this was in one of them.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] I mockingly {{interposed}} at last, [...] "the farthing dip's guttering. And what if it's all true, {{and there}} is such a place, what then? How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there, pray? Would you like to mummy me and shut me up in a box and carry me there, as they used to in Basman? Years and years ago my father told me of the pygmy men and horses--the same size as yours, I suppose--who lived in caves {{on the banks of the}} Nile. But I doubt if I believed in them much, even then. I am not so ignorant as all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having {{observed}} this so strongly, {{the writer}} of these speculations says to himself: [...] "Let me, at all events, try to eliminate any bias, and see the whole thing as should an umpire--one of those pure beings in white coats, purged of all the prejudices, passions, and predilections of mankind. Let me have no temperament for the time being, for I have to set down--not {{what would be the}} effect on me if I were in their place, or {{what would happen to the}} future if I could have my way, but what would happen all the same if I were not alive. Only from an impersonal point of view, if there be such a thing, <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> even approximately at the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Sherlock! The mean luck of it!--that {{he should}} come just when...." [...] He {{dropped into a}} reverie, and {{presently}} said to himself: [...] "But what's the use of being afraid of him? Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it according to instructions.... Now there ain't {{going to be any}} clues this time--so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's ready. If I was to risk putting it off.... No, I won't run any risk like that. Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." [...] Then another trouble presented itself. [...] "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of him? for I've got to be at my cabin a minute or two about eight o'clock." [...] This was an awkward matter, and cost him much thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. [...] "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing. Yes, that's the safest--I'll take him with me." ...|$|E
