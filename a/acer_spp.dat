5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (<b>Acer</b> (genus) <b>spp.,</b> Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: American {{chestnut}} (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) {{was once}} a dominant tree in eastern deciduous for-ests of North America and is now endangered in Canada, {{primarily because of the}} introduction of a fungal pathogen (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr) causing chestnut blight. A recovery plan is being developed, and more accu-rate information on the status of this species in its native range in southern Ontario is needed to assist in the restora-tion and management of this species. We conducted a 2 -year inventory of the distribution and size of trees throughout southern Ontario, and characterized the habitat and incidence of blight. In total, 682 trees were sampled, 601 of which were not planted. Individuals were statistically most likely to occur in deciduous forest habitats with high canopy cover (> 50 %), gentle slopes (0 °– 10 °), and acidic (pH 4 – 6), sandy (> 75 %) soils. Most trees were small (80 % were < 20 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)) and nonreproductive (86 %). Blight cankers were visible on only 25 % of trees. Of six habitat variables measured, canopy cover was positively related to tree size (height, DBH) and incidence of blight. Lit-ter depth was also a good predictor of cankers and virulent cankers in particular, but not healing and (or) healed can-kers. The presence of <b>Acer</b> and Quercus <b>spp.</b> in the canopy was associated with reduced incidence and number of cankers per tree but increased frequencies of healing and (or) healed cankers, while Carya was correlated with in-creased incidence and number of cankers per tree.

40|$|The {{trade in}} plants for {{planting}} {{is a major}} pathway for the introduction and further spread of alien plants, pests and diseases. Information about the structure of plant trade networks is not generally available, but it is valuable for better assessing the potential risks associated with the trade in live plants {{and the development of}} prevention and mitigation measures and policy. The discovery of two larvae of Anoplophora chinensis (citrus longhorn beetle - CLB) in 2009, at a nursery importing Acer palmatum from China in one of the major Dutch tree nursery areas, has resulted {{in the creation of a}} detailed dataset on the intra- European Union trade in its potential hosts. This study describes European imports of the primary host of A. chinensis, <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> into the Netherlands (1998 - 2012) and the effects of the finding in a tree nursery area. In addition, shipments of <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> from 138 producers in the nursery area in 2009 were analysed in a one-offanalysis of intra-EU trade. The volume of <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> imports from Asia was stable early during the studied period, and declined to 5 % of the initial imports after a period of interceptions, illustrating the effect of regulations. The number of notifications of A. chinensis infestations in imported consignments of <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> increased sharply in the years up to 2007, then declined as imports also reduced. Although plants were shipped to destinations throughout Europe, each producer shipped plants only to few destinations in few countries. Most of the plants were shipped to nurseries in EU countries. These patterns could make it easier to target these high risk destinations for control measures. The lack of transaction records makes it difficult to trace the destination of plants. More systematic electronic record keeping by traders and growers and the data being collated in a database that can be made available to regulatory authorities, together with further studies of plant trade data using network approaches, would be beneficial for improving trace-back and trace-forward and provide better safeguards for plant health and quality.

40|$|CASE HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: During April and May 2014 four horses aged between 5 {{months and}} 9 years, {{located in the}} Canterbury, Marlborough and Southland regions, {{presented}} {{with a variety of}} clinical signs including recumbency, stiffness, lethargy, dehydration, depression, and myoglobinuria suggestive of acute muscle damage. Two horses were subjected to euthanasia and two recovered. In all cases seeds of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) or box elder (A. negundo) were present in the area where the horse had been grazing. LABORATORY INVESTIGATION: The samaras (seeds) of some <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> may contain hypoglycin A, that has been associated with cases of atypical myopathy in Europe and North America. To determine if hypoglycin A is present in the samaras of <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> in New Zealand, samples were collected from trees throughout the country that were associated with historical and/or current cases of atypical myopathy, and analysed for hypoglycin A. Serum samples from the four cases and four unaffected horses were analysed for the presence of hypoglycin A, profiles of acylcarnitines (the definitive diagnosis for atypical myopathy) and activities of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase. Markedly elevated serum activities of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase, and increased concentrations of selected acylcarnitines were found in the case horses. Hypoglycin A was detected in the serum of those horses but not in the healthy controls. Hypoglycin A was detected in 10 / 15 samples of samaras from sycamore maple and box elder from throughout New Zealand. DIAGNOSIS: Cases of atypical myopathy were diagnosed on properties where samaras containing hypoglycin A were also found. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Sycamore and box elder trees in New Zealand are a source of hypoglycin A associated with the development of atypical myopathy. If pastured horses present with clinical and biochemical signs of severe muscle damage then the environment should be checked for the presence of these trees. Horses should be prevented from grazing samaras from <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> in the autumn. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Profiles, measured continu-ously during 1 - to 13 -day periods in four to five stands differing in overstorey canopy area index (CAI < 4. 5; including leaves, branches and stems), were well stratified, with highest [CO 2 I just above the forest floor. Canopy ICOjl profiles were influenced by stand structure (CAI, presence of understorey vegetation), and were highly dependent on vegetation type (deciduous and evergreen). A doubling of CAI in <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> and P. tremuloides stands did not show an effect on upper canopy ICO 2], when turbulent mixing was high. However, increasing understorey biomass in <b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> stands {{had a profound effect}} on lower canopy [CO 2 I. In open stands with a vigorous understorey layer, higher soil respiration rates were offset by increased understorey gas exchange, resulting in [CO 2] below those of the convective boundary layer (CBL). Midday depletions up to 20 ppmv below CBL values could be frequently observed in deciduous canopies. In evergreen canopies, [CO 2 J stayed generally above the CBL background values, [CO 2] profiles were more uniform, and gradients were smaller than in deciduous stands with similar CAI.
