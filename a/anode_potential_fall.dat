Changes in water quality, as indicated by changes in cell voltage, are usually measured using an external resistance. The authors are not aware of any rationale for the choice of the magnitude of the resistance used, nor of any evidence that this method of control results in the optimal sensitivity of the sensor. The influence of the magnitude of the external resistance on the sensitivity and recovery time of the MFC-based biosensor was therefore investigated. A low resistance resulted in a large change in signal and a more sensitive sensor, while a high resistance resulted in a shorter recovery time. Furthermore, instead of an external resistor, a potentiostat was used to control <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> or a galvanostat was used to control the electrical current.

40|$|In bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), the <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> {{can be set}} to a {{fixed voltage}} using a potentiostat, {{but there is no}} {{accepted}} method for defining an optimal potential. Microbes can theoretically gain more energy by reducing a terminal electron acceptor with a more positive potential, for example oxygen compared to nitrate. Therefore, more positive <b>anode</b> <b>potentials</b> should allow microbes to gain more energy per electron transferred than a lower potential, but this can only occur if the microbe has metabolic pathways capable of capturing the available energy. Our review of the literature shows that there is a general trend of improved performance using more positive potentials, but there are several notable cases where biofilm growth and current generation improved or only occurred at more negative potentials. This suggests that even with diverse microbial communities, it is primarily the potential of the terminal respiratory proteins used by certain exoelectrogenic bacteria, {{and to a lesser extent}} the <b>anode</b> <b>potential,</b> that determines the optimal growth conditions in the reactor.

Electricity and pure water are essential for modern societies, and technologies to ensure their availability must be developed. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices {{which can be used}} to generate electricity from wastes and wastewaters using microbial metabolism. In this study two different application fields of MFCs were experimented: 1) the degradation of tetrathionate to yield electricity and 2) the optimal MFC start-up strategies when using forest industry wastewaters as substrate. The capabilities of extreme acidophiles Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Ferroplasma acidiphilum to degrade tetrathionate and generate electricity from simulated mining industry wastewater were studied in aerobic batch cultivations and in anaerobic two-chamber MFCs. Tetrathionate was readily degraded in aerobic cultivations by A. ferrooxidans, whereas no degradation by F. acidiphilum was observed. Tetrathionate was not degraded and electricity generation was minimal in MFCs inoculated with {{one or both of the}} cultures, most likely due to insufficient mixing and low biomass in the MFCs. Different MFC start-up strategies were evaluated with air-cathode MFCs using simulated forest industry wastewater as substrate. Four strategies were compared: gradually decreasing external resistance from 5000 Ω to 50 Ω on weekly basis, stable low external resistance (50 Ω), controlled high <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> (0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl), and controlled low <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> (- 450 mV vs. Ag/AgCl). Controlled high <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> started MFC produced the highest maximal and average current densities during the start-up (38 days), 72 A/m 3 and 14 A/m 3, respectively.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses revealed a high diversity in the anodic bacterial community with the presence of both fermentative (Proteiniphilum acetatigenes and Petrimonas sulphurifila) and aerobic (Rhodococcus qingshengii) microorganisms, whereas only two microorganisms (Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus and Methanosarcina mazei), both assignable to methanogens, were observed in the cathodic community...|$|R
40|$|Highly pure {{aluminum}} specimens (99. 99 %) after electropolishing and DC-etching {{were covered}} with SiO 2 films by electrophoretic sol-gel coating and were anodized in neutral boric acid/borate solutions. Time-variations in cell voltage during electrophoretic sol-gel coating and in <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> during anodizing were monitored. Structure and dielectric properties of the anodic oxide films were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It was found that electrophoretic sol-gel coating forms uniform SiO 2 films {{on the surface of}} both electropolished and DC-etched specimens. Anodizing of specimens after electrophoretic coating lead to the formation of anodic oxide films consisting of two layers: an inner alumina layer and an outer Al–Si composite oxide layer. The anodic oxide films formed, thus, had slightly higher capacitances than those formed on aluminum without any coating. Higher heating temperatures after electrophoretic deposition caused the increase in capacitance of anodic oxide films more effectively. Anodizing in a boric acid solution after SiO 2 coating on DC-etched foil allowed the <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> to reach a value higher than 1, 000 V, resulting in 39 % higher capacitances than those on specimens without SiO 2 film...|$|R
40|$|Foam {{graphite}} {{is a novel}} anode {{material and}} its modification is one important way to increase the performance of marine benthic microbial fuel cell. The electrochemical performance of mixed-acid modified foam graphite anode was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were introduced on foam graphite surface after modification. The contact angle of modified anode decreased 24. 5 °, resulting in higher wettability and better attachment for bacteria. Its exchange current density reached 6760. 8 mA/m 2 and the kinetic activity was improved 53. 7 -fold higher than the original one. Additionally, the present study also found that the <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> of modified decreased 100 mV, and its open circuit potential reached 865 mV (plain anode 750 mV). The power density of modified cell reached 358. 1 mW/m 2, 2. 4 -fold higher than unmodified foam. Three months discharge showed that the modified anode and its cell have relatively stable performance. Meanwhile, the paper primarily analyzed the reasons why the <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> was lower and kinetic activity was higher after modification. The results gave some enlightenments to constructing a novel marine benthic microbial fuel cell with higher output voltage and power...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to promote the gradual {{acclimation}} of bioelectroactive microorganisms in BES to concentrated human urine, and to assess different <b>anode</b> <b>potentials</b> and carbon materials in Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MEC). Human urine is highly concentrated in nutrients, representing more than 80 % of the total N load and around 45 % of the total P load in municipal wastewater. Separation of urine from other wastewater streams is an interesting option to keep these valuable nutrients concentrated, in order to develop a suitable nutrient recovery concept. This work is integrated in the Value from Urine (VFU) concept, where phosphate is recovered from source segregated human urine through struvite precipitation and ammonia is recovered in a Bio-electrochemical System (BES). Enrichment of an anaerobic sludge community in urine-degrading-electroactive microorganisms was promoted in an Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) operated with increasing concentrations of real human urine (after phosphorous removal, as struvite). This acclimated electroactive biofilm was used to inoculate the anode of MECs, aiming at H 2 and ammonia production in the cathode compartment. Different carbon modified anodes and defined <b>anode</b> <b>potentials</b> were assessed in terms of performance and microbial diversity of the developed electroactive biofilms...|$|R

40|$|Bioelectrochemical systems, such as {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} (MFCs), are a specialized branch of biotechnology {{which aims to}} use the diversity of microbial metabolism for industrial applications including: the treatment of wastewater coupled with the production of electricity; the production of high value compounds (e. g. hydrogen); and biosensing applications. MFC technologies use exoelectrogenic bacteria such as Geobacter sp. These bacteria possess a particular metabolism {{that allows them to}} exchange electrons with solid surfaces like electrodes. One major parameter that can limit efficient electron transfer from biofilms to the electrode is the metabolic capability and microbial composition of the biofilm. Consequently, a main focus of this research was to determine if it is possible to select and maintain stable electrode biofilm communities that have efficient electron transfer properties and are suitable for specific functions such as biological oxygen demand (BOD) biosensing and electricity production. To achieve this objective, the influence of four parameters including the <b>anode</b> <b>potential,</b> the inoculum source, the substrate and the electrode surface properties, was tested on the selection of exoelectrogenic biofilms. The differences in community structures and electrochemical properties of the different biofilms selected were investigated using population profiling (e. g. SSCP, ARISA, RFLP), cloning and electrochemical analysis (e. g. cyclic voltammetry, power curves). Here, I present evidence that these four parameters altered the dominant community of the selected biofilms, with the <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> and the substrate having the most effects. These results enrich an ongoing controversy in the literature as to whether electrode potential can influence the composition of anode-respiring biofilms or if they physiologically adapt to different potentials. In this study, I proved that the <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> affects the composition of Geobacter-dominated biofilms at a strain level. My results imply {{that it is possible to}} select for high current-producing biofilms using specific <b>anode</b> <b>potentials.</b> In addition to microbial composition, operational stability of anode-respiring biofilm communities is also of importance for electricity production and the development of biosensors. In this study, I explored the use of a biosensor based on an exoelectrogenic biofilm for the real-time monitoring of BOD, as a fast alternative to the conventional 5 -day BOD assay. A Geobacter-dominated biofilm was selected at an <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> of - 0. 36 V vs Ag/AgCl with ethanol as the sole carbon source. The biofilm had a broad metabolic capability and accurately quantified the BOD of complex media, opening the way to a new generation of biosensors. Although MFCs are mainly limited by the efficiency of electron transfer at the anode, processes such as the reduction of oxygen at the cathode can also alter the current output of these systems. In this work, I demonstrated that photosynthetic cathodic biofilms enhance the power output of microbial fuel cells by saturating the catholyte in oxygen under illumination. This project contributes significant knowledge to the parameters affecting the formation of anode- respiring biofilms, especially those dominated by Geobacter sp., the dynamics of their community structures, their operational stability and their potential use as BOD biosensors. It also provides evidence of the utility of photosynthetic biofilms to overcome cathodic limitations caused by low rates of the oxygen reduction reaction. The combination of my key research findings provides substantial opportunities to enhance the reliable use and implementation of MFC technologies for environmental monitoring and energy production applications...|$|R
40|$|Reference {{cells are}} used to {{distinguish}} between polarization losses of the anode electrode and the cathode electrode in an electrochemical system. In {{the case of a}} direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), a reference electrode can either be attached using a salt bridge or be printed directly on the same ionomer as the working electrode. Several effects influence the reference readings in this setup by disturbing the symmetrical potential distribution of the working electrode inside the membrane. Precise alignment of the electrodes, for example, is required to prevent boundary effects. Thus, a new preparation technique for improved alignment by laser ablation of the catalyst layer is introduced. Results of this segmentation method are validated microstructurally by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. It is shown that the relative error in distinguishing anode polarization losses using the reference cell compared to the true value for such a postprocessed membrane electrode assembly is well below 1 %. Various influencing factors that cause deviations in the symmetric potential distribution are studied systematically. A simple 2 D DMFC model is developed to support the experimental conclusion and to study additional effects. Finally, losses of <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> derived from half-cell measurements are compared to losses of <b>anode</b> <b>potential</b> derived from reference readings and the results are discussed...|$|R
