500|$|On {{hearing of}} the Dutch show of force, {{aboriginal}} tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule, either through fear of Dutch military might or hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe. Representatives came from Pangsoia (Pangsoya; modern-day Linbian, Pingtung), 100km to the south, to ally themselves with the VOC. The Dutch decided to hold a landdag (a grand convention) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power. This duly took place on 22 February 1636, with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa. The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position, and Robert Junius wrote that [...] "it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they {{met for the first}} time, to notice how they kissed each other <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> at one another. Such a thing had never before been witnessed in this country, as one tribe was nearly always waging war against another." ...|$|E

40|$|Head <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> {{movements}} are usually highly co-ordinated. Here we demonstrate that {{under certain circumstances}} they can be controlled independently and we investigate the role of anticipatory activity in this process. In experiment 1, subjects tracked, with head and eyes, a sinusoidally moving target. Overall, head <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> trajectories were tightly coupled. From moment to moment, however, the trajectories could be very different and head movements were significantly more variable than gaze movements. Predictive head <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> responses can be elicited by repeated presentation of an intermittently illuminated, constant velocity target. In experiment 2 this protocol elicited a build-up of anticipatory head <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> velocity, in opposing directions, when subjects made head movements {{in the opposite direction}} to target movement whilst maintaining gaze on target. In experiment 3, head <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> movements were completely uncoupled. Subjects followed, with head <b>and</b> <b>gaze,</b> respectively, two targets moving at different, harmonically unrelated frequencies. This was possible when both targets were visual, <b>and</b> also when <b>gaze</b> followed a visual target at one frequency whilst the head was oscillated in time with an auditory tone modulated at the second frequency. We conclude that these results provide evidence of a visuomotor predictive mechanism that continuously samples visual feedback information and stores it such that it can be accessed by either the eye or the head to generate anticipatory movements. This overcomes time delays in visuomotor processing and facilitates time-sharing of motor activities, making possible the performance of two tasks simultaneously...|$|R

500|$|The {{derivation}} of the Latin narcissus (...) is unknown. It {{may be a}} loanword {{from another}} language, for instance {{it is said to}} be related to the Sanskrit word nark, meaning 'hell'. It is frequently linked to the Greek myth of Narcissus described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, who became so obsessed with his own reflection that as he knelt <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> into a pool of water, he fell into the water and drowned. In some variations, he died of starvation and thirst. In both versions, the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. Although Ovid appeared to describe the plant we now know as Narcissus there is no evidence for this popular derivation, and the person's name may have come from the flower's name. The Poet's Narcissus (N. poeticus), which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating. Again, this explanation lacks any real proof and is largely discredited. Pliny wrote that the plant ‘narce narcissum dictum, non a fabuloso puero’ (named narcissus from narce, not from the legendary youth), i.e. that it was named for its narcotic properties ( [...] narkao, [...] "I grow numb" [...] in Greek), not from the legend. Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing, such as in the legend of Persephone, long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture). It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams evoked the image of the youth admiring his own reflection in the water.|$|E

2500|$|According to legend {{it was so}} {{magnificent}} and impressive, Napoleon {{who stood}} {{on the threshold of}} this synagogue in 1812 <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> at the interior was speechless with admiration. The synagogue had a number of entrances. One, at street level, consisted of a pair of iron gates that had been donated by a tailors' society in 1640. The other entrance on the western side, added in 1800, was a bit more imposing: it had an elevated two-tiered wooden gable with a portal and wrought iron posts. There was a heavy iron door with an original Hebrew inscription indicating it was a gift of a [...] "society of Psalm reciters" [...] in 1642. At the time of its building, ecclesiastical regulations all through Europe specified that a synagogue could not be built higher than a church. To obey the law, and yet create the necessary interior height, it was customary to dig a foundation deep enough for the synagogue’s floor level to be well below that of the street. Outside, the synagogue looked to be about three stories tall, but inside it soared to over five stories. Another entrance with a vestibule and the [...] "pillory" [...] was located on the northern side of the building.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon the Just was so {{skeptical of}} the reasons for which nazirites might have {{interrupted}} their status that he found only one that he really trusted. He said that only once in his life had he eaten of the trespass-offering brought by a defiled tear in connection with an interrupted nazirite vow. On that occasion a nazirite came from the South country, and Simeon the Just saw that he had beautiful eyes, was of handsome appearance, and with thick locks of hair symmetrically arranged. Simeon the Just asked him what reason the nazirite had seen to destroy this beautiful hair by shaving it for the nazirite vow. The nazirite replied that he was a shepherd for his father and once he went to draw water from a well <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> upon his reflection in the water, and his evil desires rushed upon him and sought to drive him from the world through sin. But the shepherd swore that day that he would shave his beautiful hair off for the sake of Heaven. Simeon the Just immediately arose and kissed the nazirite's head, praying that there would be many nazirites such as him in Israel. And Simeon the Just said that it was of this nazirite that [...] says, [...] "When either {{a man or a woman}} shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord ..." [...] Rabbi Mani inquired why Simeon the Just did not eat of the guilt-offering of a nazirite. If it was because the nazirite was a sinner because he tormented himself, depriving himself of wine, that would be inconsistent with ever eating of the sin-offering (for example) for tasting forbidden fat or of the sin-offering for tasting blood. Simeon the Just thought that people made the nazirite vow in a fit of temper, and since they vowed in a fit of temper they would ultimately come to regret it. And once they regretted it, their sacrifices become like those of people who slaughtered unconsecrated animals in the Temple court (which would be disrespectful and forbidden). This nazirite, however, vowed after due mental deliberation and his mouth and heart were in agreement.|$|E

40|$|To build smart human interfaces, it is {{necessary}} for a system to know a user’s intention and point of at-tention. Since the motion of a person’s head pose <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> direction are deeply related with his/her inten-tion and attention, detection of such information can be utilized to build natural and intuitive interfaces. In this paper, we describe our real-time stereo face tracking <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> detection system to measure head pose <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> direction simultaneously. The key as-pect of our system is the use of real-time stereo vision together with a simple algorithm which is suitable for real-time processing. Since the 3 D coordinates of the features on a face can be directly measured in our sys-tem, we can signicantly simplify the algorithm for 3 D model tting to obtain the full 3 D pose of the head compared with conventional systems that use monoc-ular camera. Consequently we achieved a non-contact, passive, real-time, robust, accurate and compact mea-surement system for head pose <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> direction...|$|R
