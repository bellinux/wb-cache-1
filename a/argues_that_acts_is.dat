5000|$|Some {{published}} {{empirical studies}} in clinical psychology have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>is</b> not {{different from other}} interventions. A meta-analysis by Öst in 2008 concluded <b>that</b> <b>ACT</b> did not yet qualify as an [...] "empirically supported treatment," [...] that the research methodology for <b>ACT</b> <b>was</b> less stringent than cognitive behavioral therapy, and that the mean effect size was moderate. Supporters of ACT have challenged those conclusions by showing that the quality difference in Öst's review was {{accounted for by the}} larger number of funded trials in the CBT comparison group.|$|R
50|$|Nationwide News <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> infringed {{the implied}} freedom of {{political}} communications, while the Commonwealth <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> valid under section 51(xxxv) (conciliation and arbitration power), {{as well as}} section 51(xxxix) (express incidental power).|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} United States v. Reynard, {{the circuit court}} upheld the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000. Pregerson wrote a dissent, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> <b>was</b> an unconstitutional {{exercise}} of federal power.|$|R
5000|$|Van Manen's 1865 {{doctoral}} thesis in Utrecht about {{the authenticity of}} 1 Thessalonians concluded {{that this was a}} genuine letter by Paul of Tarsus. But in 1889 he wrote a review where he agreed with a study by Rudolf Steck and with A.D. Loman, that all Pauline epistles were pseudepigraphs. Van Manen's main work [...] "Paulus" [...] was published 1890-1896. The first volume treated Acts, and a theory of the development of Christianity in the 1st centuries. He <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>was</b> dependent on Flavius Josephus and other works, and assigned it to the second quarter of the 2nd century. The other two volumes were about Romans and about 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians.|$|R

50|$|Edward J. Erler of California State University, San Bernardino, and Brook Thomas of the University of California at Irvine, have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> an {{explicit}} rejection of birth-right citizenship {{as the ground}} for American citizenship, basing that argument on the debate that surrounded the passage of this act.|$|R
50|$|Consumer activist Ralph Nader <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> {{an example}} of {{corporate}} welfare spawned by political corruption, because it gave away to incumbent broadcasters valuable licenses for broadcasting digital signals on the public airwaves. There was a requirement in the <b>Act</b> <b>that</b> the FCC not auction off the public spectrum which the FCC itself valued at $11-$70 billion.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendant}} company <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the State <b>act</b> <b>was</b> invalid {{by virtue}} of inconsistency with the Commonwealth regulations, which is dealt with in s 109 of the Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|CUPE <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> should <b>be</b> read so that {{replacement}} [...] "with {{any other}} employee" [...] {{applied only to}} permanent arrangements, and that temporary replacements were forbidden entirely even by non-employees.|$|R
50|$|Abahlali baseMjondolo <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{province}} was mandated {{to deal with}} housing rather than land tenure and <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> dealt with evictions and slum eradication rather than the provision of housing. They also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> <b>was</b> vague and gave too much power to the provincial government that was in conflict with section 26 of the constitution that deals with housing and eviction rights.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Walter, not a Hutterite, {{wished to}} sell his land {{to a group of}} Hutterites and was {{prevented}} from doing so by the Communal Properties Act.The plaintiffs <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> [...] "colourable" [...] legislation (i.e. law that had a hidden purpose), and that its true purpose concerned freedom of religion, which is a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government.|$|R
5000|$|Prime Minister Sidney Holland {{denounced the}} bombing, calling it an [...] "infamous act of terrorism". Holland {{announced}} an investigation, but {{the identities of}} the perpetrators were never discovered. However, it has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> <b>was</b> one of sabotage, rather than terrorism. The probable target was property and the intention was the disruption of supplies, rather than achieving a political aim through terror.|$|R
5000|$|The Liquor Corporation <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> should <b>be</b> {{interpreted}} as only preventing {{the replacement of}} employees [...] "with any other employee". Under the Act, the definition of [...] "employee" [...] excluded managers, and their <b>acts</b> <b>were</b> therefore justified.|$|R

5000|$|In addition, ASPA {{contained}} {{provisions prohibiting}} U.S. co-operation with the Court, and permitting the President to authorize {{military force to}} free any U.S. military personnel held by the court, leading opponents to dub it [...] "The Hague Invasion Act". The <b>act</b> <b>was</b> later modified to permit U.S. cooperation with the ICC when dealing with U.S. enemies. It has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> <b>was</b> a measure created to protect Americans from ICC jurisdiction or prosecution.|$|R

The research is focused on links between Focus E 15 Mothers Group in London, the #protestiram movement in Macedonia and #direnkahkaha (resist laughter) in Turkey. I will analyse these protest movements’ performative <b>acts</b> and <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> these <b>acts</b> <b>are</b> strategically used {{to draw attention to}} the inequality faced by women...|$|R
50|$|The first actor {{refers to}} the Benitez case, where an {{unmarried}} lesbian sued a fertility clinic under California's Civil Rights Act for declining to artificially inseminate her. The clinic's doctors <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional insofar as it required them to perform procedures in violation of their religious beliefs. The California Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act did not violate the free exercise clauses of the United States Constitution or the California Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|Robert L. Schulz {{and several}} hundred other gun-rights activists pursued a legal {{challenge}} against the NY SAFE Act in New York state court, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional <b>that</b> Governor Cuomo's {{use of a}} [...] "message of necessity" [...] to waive the usual three-day waiting period violated the New York State Constitution. Judge Thomas J. McNamara of the New York Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' request for an injunction and later dismissed the challenge, finding no constitutional violation.|$|R
5000|$|Swift <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Queensland <b>Acts</b> <b>were</b> invalid {{because they}} were {{inconsistent}} with a Commonwealth Act legislating the same matter. Specifically, the Court had to ascertain whether the Commonwealth Act intended to [...] "cover the field", and include the regulation of all meat exporters.|$|R
5000|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> {{passed to}} win the support of Charles Stewart Parnell. Salisbury knew that his {{government}} would not last long as the Liberal Party had an overall majority. Salisbury realised that he would need Irish Party support to maintain power. Therefore, the Ashbourne <b>act</b> <b>was</b> a way to win over Parnell while keeping William Ewart Gladstone on the backbenches. This failed, as Gladstone came into government soon after and introduced the Government of Ireland Bill 1886; which however also failed.|$|R
50|$|After Nixon's resignation, {{the federal}} {{government}} took control of all of his presidential records, including the tapes, in the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974. From the time that {{the federal government}} seized his records until his death, Nixon was locked in frequent legal battles over control of the tapes; Nixon <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional in <b>that</b> it violated the constitutional principles of separation of powers and executive privilege, and infringed on his personal privacy rights and First Amendment right of association.|$|R
40|$|This paper critiques the {{branding}} and {{labeling of}} the physical public domain {{with the names of}} corporations, commercial products, and individuals. It suggests that under-recognized public policy conflicts exist between the naming policies and practices of political subdivisions, trademark law, and right of publicity doctrines. It further <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> naming <b>acts</b> <b>are</b> often undemocratic and unfair, illegitimately appropriate public assets for private use, and constitute a limited form of compelled speech. It concludes by considering alternative mechanisms by which the names of public facilities could be chosen...|$|R
50|$|In their reply brief, the State further <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> not {{otherwise}} unconstitutional. It does not violate article VIII, section 1(a) of the Illinois Constitution, {{which states that}} any public funds must be used only for public purposes. The public purpose put forth by the State is the attempt to maintain the viability of horse racing in Illinois. Horse racing not only provides revenue for the State and a legal outlet for gamblers, {{but it is also}} creates many jobs to keep Illinoisans employed.|$|R
5000|$|Section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act allows law {{enforcement}} agents to obtain court orders for cell site information without a warrant. Privacy advocates <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional because it violated callers' reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The {{court held that}} cell site information is a [...] "business record" [...] that callers voluntarily convey to their phone service providers. Since information voluntarily conveyed to third parties receives weaker protection under the Fourth Amendment, {{the court held that}} section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> not per se unconstitutional.|$|R

[...] After the bill received Royal Assent as the [...] "Australian Airlines <b>Act</b> (1945)", it <b>was</b> immediately challenged by ANA in the High Court in its [...] "original jurisdiction" [...] as arbiter of Constitutional Law.

40|$|The 1971 Immigration Act {{constitutes}} {{the most important}} piece of legislation for the regulation of immigration to Britain.

Based on original archival material, I <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> established {{in reaction to the}} dilemma the government faced as a result of joining the European Economic Community and the free movement of workers against Commonwealth migrants. The Act represents the final dismantling of universal Commonwealth citizenship and, in this sense, a definitive acceptance {{of the end of the}} Empire...|$|R
50|$|As is {{the case}} with all the Gospels, it is unknown exactly when the Gospel of Luke was written. Scholars have {{proposed}} a range of dates from as early as 60 AD to as late as 90 AD. Donald Guthrie <b>argues,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>was</b> written in the early 60s AD (since the book ends before the death of Paul, which most probably occurred during the Persecution of the Christians under Nero between AD 64 and AD 68), and therefore the Gospel of Luke would have to have been written prior to that, around AD 60.|$|R
50|$|Judge Glickstein concurs {{with the}} majority, but expresses {{some concern about}} the {{suggestion}} in varied sentences according {{to the kind of}} wrongdoer.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Louisiana {{legislature}} {{passed a law}} titled the [...] "Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act". The act did not require teaching either evolution or creationism as such, but did require that when evolutionary science was taught, creation science had to be taught as well. Creationists had lobbied aggressively for the law, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the <b>act</b> <b>was</b> about academic freedom for teachers, an argument adopted by the state {{in support of the}} act.

This was intended to counter the growing number and influence of African voters, especially in the Eastern Cape where Sprigg's home constituency <b>was.</b> The <b>act</b> <b>was</b> justifiably controversial and faced fierce opposition in parliament.
