Where <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E

500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> crash into some walls? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go into a kitchen?

The Buffy Season Eight comics attracted media attention when the title character has a one night stand with another girl who {{had fallen in love}} with her. The encounter was repeated, but both the character and the creators denied that this made Buffy gay, with Joss Whedon saying: [...] "We're not going to make her gay, nor <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take the next 50 issues explaining that she's not.

In the final five games (in which Tech went 1–4), the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32.8points, 446.7total yards and 229.4rushing yards per game. This led to doubts about Tech's ability to stop the Falcons' top-ranked rushing attack.

500|$|Movement by {{the astronauts}} was {{detected}} by the spacecraft's inertial measurement unit and the astronaut's biomedical sensors, and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow, and sounds from Grissom's stuck-open microphone. There was no evidence to identify the movement, {{or whether it was}} related to the fire. [...] The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" [...] The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem.

500|$|Matthews {{said that}} they did not have any {{particular}} influences in their music. However, she said that her family had always been singing along to BBC Radio 2. She held the ambition to have the band appear on Radio 2, as due to poor levels of radio reception in Wales they had been unable to listen to other stations. She attributed the style of Welsh music as never attempting to be cool as they wouldn't have been aware of what was in fashion at the time. Catatonia frequently used metaphors in their songwriting, such as [...] "Road Rage" [...] which references emotional anger. The line [...] "If it turns to blue, what <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?"

[...] Bono shared this opinion, stating, [...] "We went so far out on the Sufi singing and the sort of ecstatic-music front, that we had to ground it and find a counterpoint." [...] Eno commented that many of [...] "the more contemplative and sonically adventurous songs" [...] had been dropped, attributing the lack of African-inspired music to its sounding [...] "synthetic" [...] and unconvincing when paired with other songs.|$|E
