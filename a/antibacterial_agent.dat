40|$|Bacterial {{infection}} is frequently seen {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis, and {{the most common type}} of bacterial {{infection is}} spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). In clinical practice, <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> are widely used in the treatment of SBP. In addition, <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> can reduce rebleeding and mortality rates in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, in order to avoid bacterial resistance, the appropriate use of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> is very important.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{inhibitory}} effects between paired combinations of four <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> {{that have been}} investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. Methods: The <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. Two organisms each belonging to Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. A checkerboard microtitration method {{was used to determine}} the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) and ∑FIC index of the paired combinations of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> against the six species of bacteria. Appropriate controls were included. The ∑FIC index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> and the test organisms. Results: The data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. Using ∑FIC values for synergy as ≤ 0. 5 and antagonism as > 4. 0 as recommended by The American Society for Microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> when tested against selected organisms. However, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. Nonetheless, no combination of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> appeared to be superior to any other. Conclusions: According to these in vitro results, {{there appears to be no}} beneficial effect of combining the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. However, it may be beneficial to use combined <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|<b>Antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> {{are very}} {{important}} in the textile industry, water disinfection, medicine, and food packaging. Organic compounds used for disinfection have some disadvantages, including toxicity to the human body, therefore, the interest in inorganic disinfectants such as metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) is increasing. This review focuses on the properties and applications of inorganic nanostructured materials and their surface modifications, with good antimicrobial activity. Such improved <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> locally destroy bacteria, without being toxic to the surrounding tissue.

5|$|Metallic silver, like copper, is an <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agent,</b> {{which was}} known to the ancients and first scientifically {{investigated}} and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.|$|E
30|$|Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae is {{a causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} blight {{which is one}} of the most widespread and devastating bacterial diseases of rice plants in China and many other rice-growing countries (González et al. 2012). The research showed that the bacterial blight can wither the rice leaf, interfere with the photosynthesis, increase the false grain, decrease the grain quality and ruin grain’s taste (Mew et al. 1993; Wu et al. 2013). Currently, the disease is managed by the use of resistant cultivars and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents.</b> However, the sensitivities of X. oryzae pv. Oryzae to the resistant cultivars and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> have been found to decline, and resistant populations of X. oryzae pv. Oryzae have increased probably because of the wide use of the resistant cultivars and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents,</b> prompting a worldwide effort to develop new alternative <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents,</b> especially with novel mechanisms of action (Davies 2011; Zhu et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|<b>Anti{{bacterial}}</b> <b>agents</b> {{act against}} bacterial infection either by killing the bacterium or by arresting its growth. They {{do this by}} targeting bacterial DNA and its associated processes, attacking bacterial metabolic processes including protein synthesis, or interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis and function. <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>Agents</b> is an essential guide to this important class of chemotherapeutic drugs. Compounds are organised according to their target, which helps the reader understand the mechanism of action of these drugs and how resistance can arise. The book uses an integrated "lab-to-clinic" approach which covers drug discovery, source or synthesis, mode of action, mechanisms of resistance, clinical aspects (including links to current guidelines, significant drug interactions, cautions and contraindications), prodrugs and future improvements. Agents covered include: *agents targeting DNA - quinolone, rifamycin, and nitroimidazole <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> *agents targeting metabolic processes - sulfonamide <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> and trimethoprim *agents targeting protein synthesis - aminoglycoside, macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics, chloramphenicol, and oxazolidinones *agents targeting cell wall synthesis - beta-Lactam and glycopeptide antibiotics, cycloserine, isonaizid, and daptomycin <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>Agents</b> will find {{a place on the}} bookshelves of students of pharmacy, pharmacology, pharmaceutical sciences, drug design/discovery, and medicinal chemistry, and as a bench reference for pharmacists and pharmaceutical researchers in academia and industry...|$|R

40|$|Ingestion of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, {{naturally}} occurring plant toxins, causes illness {{and death in}} a number of animal species. Senecio jacobaea pyrrolizidine alkaloids cause significant economic losses due to livestock poisoning, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Some sheep are resistant to pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning, because ovine ruminal biotransformation detoxifies free pyrrolizidine alkaloids in digesta. <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> modify ruminal fermentation. Pretreatment with <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> may account for some animal variability in resistance to pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicosis, and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> can also be used for characterizing ruminal pyrrolizidine alkaloid-biotransforming microflora. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> on biotransformation of a predominant S. jacobaea pyrrolizidine alkaloid, jacobine, in ovine ruminal contents. Ovine ruminal jacobine biotransformation was tested in vitro with 20 independent <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents.</b> Low amounts of rifampin and erythromycin prevented jacobine biotransformation. Chlortetracycline, lasalocid, monensin, penicillin G, and tetracycline were slightly less effective at inhibiting jacobine biotransformation. Bacitracin, crystal violet, kanamycin, and neomycin were moderately inhibitory against jacobine biotransformation. Brilliant green, chloramphenicol, gramicidin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin B SO 4, sodium azide, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and vancomycin had little to no effect on jacobine biotransformation. The antibiotics that were most effective at inhibiting biotransformation were those that are active against gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, gram-positive bacteria are most likely critical members of the jacobine-biotransforming consortia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antibacterial</b> <b>agents,</b> such as triclosan, {{are common}} {{ingredients}} in many everyday household and personal care products. There {{is a growing}} concern about the emergence of these chemicals in the environment. The SCBWMI Emerging Contaminants Workgroup reviewed the state of knowledge regarding triclosan, the most common of these <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents.</b> The Workgroup recommends the adoption of strategies to minimize the occurrence of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> and their breakdown products in surface water. Proposed next steps, messages and audiences are presented in Section 5. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the SCBWMI Emerging Contaminants Workgroup draws the following conclusions: • The American Medical Association has not endorsed the necessity or efficacy of triclosan and other <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> in personal care products (Section 1) • <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>agents</b> and their degradation products are found in many tested U. S. surface waters, including San Francisco Bay (Section 2) • One such agent, triclosan is acutely and chronically toxic to aquatic organisms (Section 3) • Triclosan bioaccumulates in fish and human tissue (Section 3) • Triclosan may degrade into other toxic compounds (Section 3) • Triclosan may encourage antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. (Section 3). • Physicians indicate that the best germ fighting measure continues to be the actual act of hand washing with regular soap, or for extra assurance, alcohol or peroxide-based hand sanitizer...|$|R

25|$|A major use of {{formic acid}} is as a {{preservative}} and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agent</b> in livestock feed. In Europe, it is applied on silage (including fresh hay) {{to promote the}} fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of butyric acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss of nutritional value. Formic acid arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer, {{and so it is}} widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle. In the poultry industry, it is sometimes added to feed to kill E. coli bacteria. Use as preservative for silage and (other) animal feed constituted 30% of the global consumption in 2009.|$|E
25|$|This {{technology}} {{entails the}} joining of DNA from different species {{and the subsequent}} insertion of the hybrid DNA into a host cell. One of the first individuals to develop recombinant DNA technology was a biochemist at Stanford {{by the name of}} Paul Berg. In his experimental design in 1974, he cleaved (cut into fragments) the monkey virus SV40. He then cleaved the double helix of another virus; an <b>antibacterial</b> <b>agent</b> known as bacteriophage lambda. In the third step, he fastened DNA from the SV40 to DNA from the bacteriophage lambda. The final step involved placing the mutant genetic material into a laboratory strain of the E. coli bacterium. This last step, however, was not completed in the original experiment.|$|E
