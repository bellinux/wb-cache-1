30|$|Figure 4 (a) {{shows the}} {{measured}} effective data rate. When the packet generation interval {{is less than}} 0.1 [*]s, as the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> increases, the effective data rate first grows and then decreases. The reason for this phenomenon is that as the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> increases, more packets are sent {{in the same time}} and traffic load increases; but overly-heavy traffic load leads to higher possibility of collision which causes the decrease of the effective data rate. On the other hand, when the interval is larger than 0.1 [*]s, although the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> increases, the traffic load is still very low. This is the reason why the effective data rate always keeps increasing as the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> increases.|$|R
30|$|Figure 6 (a) {{shows the}} {{measured}} effective data rate. We can observe {{that for the}} same <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters,</b> the effective data rate grows slowly as MinBE increases. Figure 6 (b) shows the measured packet loss rate, which decreases {{with the increase of}} MinBE and the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters.</b> The reason for this may be that larger MinBE values imply larger backoff time, which cause the possibility of detecting an idle channel to increase. As a result, with the increase of MinBE, the effective data rate increases and the packet loss rate decrease for the same <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters.</b> Figure 6 (c) shows the measured end-to-end delay. At the same <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters,</b> the end-to-end delay grows with the increase of MinBE.|$|R

30|$|Figure 5 (a) {{shows the}} {{measured}} effective data rate, which grows for less (e.g., 4) transmitters as {{the value of}} MaxNB increase. However, when the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> reaches a certain threshold, the situation becomes opposite, {{as shown in the}} figure. In Figure 5 (b), for the same <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters,</b> contrary to the effective date rate in Figure 5 (a), the packet loss rate decreases for less transmitters with the increase of MaxNB. But when the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> reaches a certain threshold, the situation becomes opposite.|$|R
30|$|To design {{reliable}} VLC systems {{installed in}} various indoor environments, {{it is necessary}} to investigate the communication performance according to the space dimensions, <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters,</b> optical parameters in receivers, etc. For example, the effect of the <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> on RMSDS is as follows. With large <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters,</b> the maximum RMSDS is decreased and the minimum RMSDS is increased. For reliable communications in a room, the minimum available DR over the entire receiving plane is also important. The maximum RMSDS of the single transmitter case is significantly affected by room dimension. On the contrary, the effect of room dimension on the maximum RMSDS becomes weak in the case of four-transmitter. The large <b>number</b> of <b>transmitters</b> relaxes the conditions for reliable communication with the room dimension change.|$|R

30|$|Technology and {{business}} systems should be specified {{in terms of}} the scheme design, rather than imposing constraints on it. Technologies are required for charging, payment and enforcement. The principal technologies are <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> plate recognition, dedicated short range communications and global navigation satellite systems. The last of these, in particular, is experiencing rapid development and should in due course enable a wider range of pricing systems, including distance-based charging. However, <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> plate recognition remains the principal tool for enforcement [29, 49]. Protection of privacy should be feasible with all technology options.|$|R
50|$|On Feb. 18, 1981 {{an audio}} change for long {{distance}} calls was implemented.

Company general manager Ardyth Williams said {{the move to}} the <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> identification system was necessary {{to keep up with}} the areas around the North Norwich system. It also resulted in some pay back for the independent company because it received money from Bell Canada for each long distance call completed in this manner.|$|R
