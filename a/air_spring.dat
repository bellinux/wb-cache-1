2500|$|A {{precursor}} {{of the engine}} was designed by the German scientist Otto von Guericke who, in 1650, designed and built the world's first vacuum pump and created the world's first ever vacuum known as the Magdeburg hemispheres experiment.

Shortly thereafter, Irish physicist and chemist Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke, built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation for a gas: PV = k, where P is pressure, V is volume and k is a constant: this relationship is known as Boyle's Law.

Suddenly the shade was dense, the sunlight white and glaring, the odour of lilacs heavy in the <b>air,</b> <b>spring</b> in all its fulness had come,--spring and Nancy. Just so subtly, yet with the same seeming suddenness had budded and come to leaf and flower a perfect understanding, which nevertheless remained undefined. This, I had no doubt, was my fault, and due to the incomprehensible shyness her presence continued to inspire. Although we did not altogether abandon our secret trysts, we began to meet in more natural ways; there were garden parties and picnics where we strayed together through the woods and fields, pausing to tear off, one by one, the petals of a daisy, [...] "She loves me, she loves me not." [...] I never ventured to kiss her; I always thought afterwards I might have done so, she had seemed so willing, her eyes had shone so expectantly as I sat {{beside her on the}} grass; nor can I tell why I desired to kiss her save that this was the traditional thing to do to the lady one loved. To be sure, the very touch of her hand was galvanic. Paradoxically, I saw the human side of her, the yielding gentleness that always amazed me, yet I never overcame my awe of the divine; she was a being sacrosanct. Whether this idealism were innate or the result of such romances as I had read I cannot say.... I got, indeed, an avowal of a sort. The weekly dancing classes having begun again, on one occasion when she had waltzed twice with Gene Hollister I protested.|$|E

5000|$|Air {{suspension}} is also {{a common}} suspension upgrade for those who tow or haul heavy loads with their pick-up truck, SUV, van or car. <b>Air</b> <b>springs,</b> also called [...] "air helper springs," [...] are placed on existing suspension components on the rear or front of the vehicle {{in order to increase}} the load capacity.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} air {{suspension}} {{is to provide}} a smooth, constant ride quality, but in some cases is used for sports suspension.

50|$|The {{installation}} and configuration {{of these systems}} varies for different makes and models but the underlying principle remains the same. The metal spring (coil or leaf) is removed, and an air bag, {{also referred to as}} an <b>air</b> <b>spring,</b> is inserted or fabricated to fit in the place of the factory spring. When air pressure is supplied to the air bag, the suspension can be adjusted either up or down (lifted or lowered).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Interlinked air suspension, which {{formed by}} {{interconnecting}} {{two or more}} <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> of traditional <b>air</b> suspension using switchable pneumatic pipe connections, can further improve vehicleâ€™s riding comfort and driving stability. The structure and working principle of this suspension is introduced, the model of interlinked air suspension is developed and validated via experiments. Simulation results indicate that, the larger the diameter of connecting pipe, the smaller the stiffness of <b>air</b> <b>springs,</b> and interlinked <b>air</b> suspension can effectively reduce vehicleâ€™s roll angle and vertical vibration under its first natural frequency, which greatly affects vehicleâ€™s riding comfort...|$|R
