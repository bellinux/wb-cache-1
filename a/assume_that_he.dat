5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} among modern scholars {{on whether}} David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands {{which had been}} granted {{to him as a}} reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros, or if it had been the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II. As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship, it would be more reasonable to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed Narrator is a {{traveling}} automobile recall specialist {{who suffers from}} insomnia. When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting {{a support group for}} testicular cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.|$|E

25|$|Satirical {{pamphlets}} {{directed against}} royalty were a {{common form of}} literature and the chronicles left by courtiers were influenced by rivalries or prejudice, so {{he may not have}} looked so bad. Based on collaborating evidence from other sources, however, it is probably safe to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was tall, and not plump.|$|E
25|$|Since Pessoa didn't {{determine}} {{the death of}} Reis, one can <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> survived his author who died in 1935. In The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis (1984), Portuguese nobel prize José Saramago rebuilds, in his own personal outlook, the literary world of this heteronym after 1935, creating a dialog between Ricardo Reis and the ghost of his author.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the team - Komov leaves the ship to scout the {{surroundings}} of the base. However, Piere Semyonov soon comes to the base himself. Apparently, he tries {{to communicate with the}} humans, they do not understand him and he leaves again. The behavior of the Kid (the official nickname given to Piere, hence the Russian title of the novel) is rather strange. This leads the humans to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was raised by the local alien race.|$|E

25|$|Hephaestion’s {{exact age}} is not known. No concise {{biography}} {{has ever been}} written about him, likely stemming {{from the fact that}} he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion’s age as being similar to Alexander’s so it is fair to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born about 356BC. He is said to have become a page in 343BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon. As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} eight years Liszt {{continued}} to tour Europe, spending holidays with the countess and their children on the island of Nonnenwerth on the Rhine in summers 1841 and 1843. In spring 1844 the couple finally separated. This was Liszt's most brilliant period as a concert pianist. Honours were showered on him and he met with adulation wherever he went. Franz wrote his Three Concert Études between 1845 and 1849. Since he often appeared {{three or four times a}} week in concert, it could be safe to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> appeared in public well over a thousand times during this eight-year period. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} case {{investigated by the}} after the war, the KBZPNP commission requested the prosecution of the commanders of the 10th and 17th Divisions, which {{took part in a}} mass murder of several dozen Poles in the village of Włyń near Łódź. All cases of the murder of Polish civilians in that village were turned down by the German prosecutors' office on 22 April 1974. The German authorities argued, that it is not impossible that all the civilians trying to escape from the German forces were in fact partisans. This was the reasoning in the case of certain Ochecki who was shot to death while trying to rescue his cattle from a barn set in flames by the German soldiers. The German authorities argued that it was fair to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was trying to escape from the German soldiers. The same reasoning was given {{in the case of a}} mentally sick person shot the same day. In the case of Wawrzyn Piecyk, who was killed while being wounded and unconscious, it was argued that he might have been pretending to be unconscious in order to escape from the German soldiers, while the case of Józef Jawor, a man who did not stop when requested to and instead hid in his house, where he was shot through the doors, was explained as a killing done during a fight. The case of Maria Konieczna, a deaf woman who was shot after not responding to a German soldier, was considered a common crime, while the killing of Józef Gałka was explained as legitimate, since a picture of his brother in Polish military uniform found in Gałka's wallet was a proof that he might have been a partisan himself. In the same decision, the German authorities declared that the patients of the mental institution in the town of Warta, killed by the soldiers of the 17th Division in the hospital and dressed in hospital pyjamas, were victims of a common crime rather than a war crime or a murder.|$|E

500|$|Wyke {{observes that}} Waugh's novels reprise and fictionalise the {{principal}} events of his life, although {{in an early}} essay Waugh wrote: [...] "Nothing is more insulting to a novelist than to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is incapable of anything but the mere transcription of what he observes". The reader should not assume that the author agreed with the opinions expressed by his fictional characters. Nevertheless, in the Introduction to the Complete Short Stories, Ann Pasternak Slater said that the [...] "delineation of social prejudices and the language {{in which they are}} expressed is part of Waugh's meticulous observation of his contemporary world".|$|E

But I have always assumed, and I now <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is loyal to the United States.

500|$|During the tour, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) argues with Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{about what}} he claims is the northernmost battle of the Civil War: the Battle of Schrute Farms. Dwight {{maintains}} that its absence from the history books {{is an example of}} re-writing history, whereas Oscar maintains that the battle is a fictitious creation. After tracking down a historian, Dwight and Oscar learn that the Battle of Schrute Farms did in fact take place. However, the [...] "battle" [...] was really a code term. During the Civil War, Schrute Farms was a safe haven for artists and poets (and, as heavily implied, homosexuals). Oscar finds this fascinating, whereas Dwight leaves in disgust. Meanwhile, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) is sidetracked by another tour group who <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is an Abraham Lincoln impersonator. He acquiesces and delivers an improvised but applauded performance.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} shows children resting {{safely in}} their beds, {{oblivious to the}} perils of this world, as their parents look on. Their mother tucks them in while their father holds a newspaper describing {{the horrors of the}} ongoing conflict. However, his attention is fully on his children and not on the alarming headlines. According to another view, the children are already asleep, and their parents are checking on them in their shared narrow bed before they themselves turn in for the night. The father appears as the [...] "classic Rockwell onlooker" [...] who serves as a viewer within the painting. Since he is holding his glasses, we <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has finished reading the Bennington Banner in his hand. The newspaper's headline reads [...] "Bombings Ki... Horror Hit", referencing the Blitz. In the background is a lit hallway and a stairway leading to the first floor.|$|E
500|$|As {{he disliked}} both Arabs and Christians, some scholars, such as Bowersock, have taken Zosimus' {{silence on the}} matter as strong {{evidence}} against Philip's alleged Christianity. Others, like historian Warwick Ball, view Zosimus' evident distaste for Philip as noteworthy, and suggest that Zosimus' anti-Christian polemic is indirect in his writing on the emperor. Shahîd construes Zosimus' silence as an argument for Philip's Christianity. Zosimus, he argues, would never have shown such distaste for a pagan. Septimius Severus was a [...] "barbarian", an African born at Leptis Magna whose mother tongue was Phoenician and whose wife, Julia Domna, was a provincial from Emesa. But Severus gets a good press from Zosimus (1.8). Nor would Philip's assistance in the execution of Gordian be enough: the 3rd century was hardly a stranger to such bloodshed and treachery. Zosimus' hostility begins to makes sense, Shahîd contends, once we <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was aware of the}} tradition that viewed Philip as the first Christian emperor (and perhaps even accepted it). And it becomes perfectly clear once we understand the importance Zosimus attributes to the Secular Games, and the schematic incongruity he would behold when a Christian emperor was presiding over them.|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E

He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'?

2500|$|After {{his return}} to politics, Gyurcsány was at first tight-lipped on his {{religious}} affiliation, leading many to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is an atheist. In an interview aired on TV2 during the 2006 parliamentary election campaign, Gyurcsány said that as a teenager, he [...] "took part in confirmation for about two years" [...] and even considered becoming a priest. Since confirmation can only be taken once, some regarded this claim as a giveaway {{that he was not}} telling the truth, while others such as Catholic bishop Endre Gyulay supposed he meant he took part in preparations for a confirmation.|$|E

Lee stated in court papers that: [...] "The media description of this change of name, as well as comments made to me and my wife, confirmed what was obvious—that Spike TV referred to Spike Lee." ...|$|E
