5000|$|David Gilmour used a slide guitar {{for certain}} sound {{effects on the}} studio {{recording}} and for the introduction in live performances from 1971 to 1975. A throbbing wind-like sound was created by Roger Waters vibrating the strings of his bass guitar with a steel slide and feeding the signal through an Echorec. The high-pitched electronic [...] "screams", resembling a distorted seagull song, were discovered by Gilmour when the cables were accidentally reversed to his wah pedal. After observing the song being created, Nick Mason noted: [...] "The guitar sound in the middle section of 'Echoes' was created inadvertently by David plugging in a wah-wah pedal back to front. Sometimes great effects are {{the results of this}} kind of pure serendipity, and we were always prepared to see if something might work on a track. The grounding we'd received from Ron Geesin in going beyond the manual had left its mark." [...] Harmonic [...] "whistles" [...] can be heard produced by Richard Wright pulling certain drawbars in and out on the Hammond organ. Rooks were added to the music from a tape <b>archive</b> <b>recording</b> (as had been done for some of the band's earlier songs, including [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"). The second half of the song, where Gilmour plays muted notes on the guitar over Wright's slowly building Farfisa organ solo, was inspired by the Beach Boys song [...] "Good Vibrations".|$|E

40|$|Metrics (quantitative {{estimates}} of product and project properties) can, if defined from sound engineering principles, be a precious tool for both project management and software development. We have recently developed an extensive set of metrics facilities for the EiffelStudio development environment. We will describe the principles {{on which it}} is based, the facilities it provides, {{and how to use}} them. The metrics workbench is closely integrated {{with the rest of the}} environment. Among other capabilities, it allows users to: apply predefined metrics to components of a system at various levels (feature, class, cluster, entire system); define new metrics, through mathematical formulae or boolean selection, and apply them to projects; store measurement results, as well as metric definitions, into an XML archive that can be stored locally or made available on the Web for future reference; compare the measurements on a system to those on record locally or on a Web site. Eiffel Software has released on its own site an <b>archive</b> <b>recording</b> the metric properties of its basic libraries, available to any other project for comparison...|$|E
