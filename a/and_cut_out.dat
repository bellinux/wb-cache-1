5|$|The Spanish party {{retreated from}} the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were {{surrounded}} by about 2,000 Itza warriors who attempted to disarm them; the Itzas managed to seize another Spaniard and immediately struck off his head. At this point about 10,000 Itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate. A Christian Maya musketeer and six other Indians fled {{at the start of}} the battle and took news to García that the entire expedition had been slaughtered; Zubiaur and the survivors of his expedition marched back into the base camp at Chuntuki two days later. Ursúa later reported that the Spanish prisoners were taken back to Nojpetén where they were all killed; this was also confirmed by AjChan at a later date. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the final assault on Nojpetén in 1697; AjK'in Kan Ek', the Itza high priest, later reported that he had bound San Buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> their hearts.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} combat the short-passing threat, the championship-winning Preston North End side of 1888 devised a more {{defensive}} 2–3–5 formation (two defenders, three mid-fielders and five attackers), which would become the standard formation for many teams for {{the best part of}} the next 40 years. One of the half-backs was brought back into defence, which sat deeper than before, making the two defenders full-backs as opposed to three-quarter-backs. Their main job was to mark the opposition's inside forwards <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> the short passes in mid-field. Furthermore, two forwards were brought back into midfield as half-backs to mark the opposition wingers and negate the pace threat. The remaining half-back became a centre-half, who would patrol the field, drifting from defence to attack as he saw fit. This left two wingers up front (outside-right and outside-left), along with two inside-forwards (inside-right and inside-left) and a centre-forward.|$|E

500|$|Years later, showrunner D. B. Weiss {{commented that}} the {{explicit}} style of the execution scene was selected in part {{to make it clear}} to the viewers that Eddard Stark, despite being the arguable protagonist of season one, actually was dead: [...] "It’s that rule: 'If you don't see the body then they’re not really dead.' [...] Like when we cut Ned’s head off, we didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but we needed to see the blade enter his neck <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> on the frame where the blade was mid-neck. [...] we needed Ned's death to be totally unambiguous." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} poem, Busirane had tortured <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> {{the heart of}} the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition. However, he had an aversion to [...] "the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in", and disliked the depiction of gratuitous violence. Consequently, in Etty's work Amoret is depicted as physically unharmed by her ordeal, although his composition implies [...] "sadistic torture and occult sexual sorcery".|$|E
500|$|Later, at a {{feast for}} Daenerys and Khal Drogo, a drunken Viserys draws his sword on his sister, {{threatening}} {{that if the}} Khal does not give him an army {{to take back the}} Seven Kingdoms, he will take back Daenerys <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> her child.

Drogo melts his belt in a stewpot, and Viserys realises to his horror that the [...] "golden crown" [...] is actually molten gold, which Drogo pours on his head. Daenerys watches her brother's painful death calmly, and coldly observes: [...] "He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon." ...|$|E

500|$|The vocals on {{the album}} were always live after rehearsing each song five or six times, {{according}} to saxophonist and flautist [...] "Boots" [...] Houston, who further commented that when Morrison and the band went into the studio: [...] "we would then just play a whole set straight through without repeating anything. [...] We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> the songs he didn't want. The only time we'd go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns." [...] Ted Templeman remarked {{that he had to}} go through three engineers during the recording of the album, due to Morrison's [...] "ability as a musician, arranger and producer": [...] "When he's got something together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing ... I've had to change engineers who couldn't keep up with him." ...|$|E
500|$|After having {{completed}} the 24-reel cut of Greed, von Stroheim told Goldwyn executives {{that he could}} not cut another frame. Goldwyn producers thought that this version was still too long and told him to cut it to a more manageable length. Von Stroheim then sent the film to his friend, director Rex Ingram, who turned it over to his editor, Grant Whytock. Whytock had worked with von Stroheim on The Devil's Pass Key and was familiar with the director's style and tastes. Whytock initially proposed that it be split in two, with one 8-reel film ending with the wedding and a second 7-reel film ending at Death Valley. Whytock eventually cut the film down to 18 reels. His only major cut was the entire subplot of Zerkow and Maria, which he thought was [...] "very distasteful". Otherwise he simply cut down scenes <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> [...] of quick [...] "flash" [...] shots that only lasted a few frames. However, Whytock's version of Greed retained the prologue and other subplots, as well as much of the humor that was later cut out of it.|$|E

It was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for paid digital downloads {{of more than one}} million copies in the United States in July 2009. Although Cudi was grateful for the opportunity to make a video for [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] and enjoyed the overall concept for it, he was disappointed that a majority of his ideas were ignored <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> of the video. When he saw the video for the first time, he claims he provided feedback for it, but was ignored. The rapper than decided to make another video for the track, which was directed by French artist and director So Me.|$|E

2500|$|Warren {{intended}} Johnson {{to become}} involved in trading with American Indians, but Johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north, {{on the opposite side of}} the river from Warrensburgh. Acting on his own initiative, in 1739 Johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river, where he built a store and a sawmill. From this location, which he called [...] "Mount Johnson", Johnson was able to cut into Albany's Indian trade. He supplied traders with goods who were going to Fort Oswego, and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver. He dealt directly with New York City merchants <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> the previous middlemen at Albany.
