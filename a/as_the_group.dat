5|$|The Eccrinales and Amoebidiales are opisthokont protists, {{previously}} {{thought to be}} zygomycete fungi. Other groups now in Opisthokonta (e.g., Corallochytrium, Ichthyosporea) were also at given time classified as fungi. The genus Blastocystis, now in Stramenopiles, was originally classified as a yeast. Ellobiopsis, now in Alveolata, was considered a chytrid. The bacteria were also included in fungi in some classifications, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> Schizomycetes.|$|E

In 1983, the band's Christopher Franke asked Mellotronics if they could produce a digital model, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> migrated towards using samplers.|$|E
5|$|Transfusion is {{the second}} EP by the Australian rock group Powderfinger. It was {{released}} on 27 September 1993 by Polydor.

5|$|Apatosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of {{gigantic}} sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including Diplodocus, Supersaurus, and Barosaurus. Apatosaurus is sometimes classified in the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which may also include Suuwassea, Supersaurus, and Brontosaurus. Othniel Charles Marsh described Apatosaurus as allied to Atlantosaurus within the now-defunct group Atlantosauridae. In 1878 Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including Apatosaurus, Atlantosaurus, Morosaurus (=Camarasaurus) and Diplodocus. He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903 Elmer S. Riggs said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped Apatosaurus within Opisthocoelia. Sauropoda is still used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> name. In 2011, John Whitlock published a study that placed Apatosaurus a more basal diplodocid, sometimes less basal than Supersaurus.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, General Henry Abbot {{arrived at}} President Street with a {{battalion}} of 99 to 114 engineers. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where {{they were to be}} quartered, they were met by a crowd of 500. Jeers from the crowd turned to missiles until one soldier, Private Corcoran, was struck in the head and wounded. Abbot gave orders that his men were to halt and fix bayonets, at which point the crowd scattered.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> left Plateros at 22:30 to trek {{back towards}} American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{travels to}} Kuldahar, they meet a drow (dark elf) named Nym, who tells {{them that the}} pass to Kuldahar is guarded by the Legion of the Chimera, and that an {{alternate}} path through the Underdark exists. Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn the group to not interfere. The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender.|$|E

5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) {{report the}} death and {{reanimation}} of Randall to the others, but also that he turned without being bit. Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) begs Daryl {{to go out and}} search for Rick and Shane. However, they too soon see the walker horde and start arming themselves. While Rick's group is ready to abandon the farm, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) intends to protect his land with his own life, if needed. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> starts to dispatch walkers, Rick and Carl are able to lure a number into the barn, and set it ablaze. Jimmy (James Allen McCune) drives the RV near the barn and allows Rick and Carl to safely escape the burning barn, but he is killed when the walkers overrun the RV.|$|E
5|$|For the game's halftime show, the Orange Bowl hosted American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Goo Goo Dolls. Reviews criticized the performance for awkward staging and brevity, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> performed only two songs. Middle {{school and high}} school dance squads also participated in the halftime show, performaing on the field while the Goo Goo Dolls played. Pregame media coverage erroneously reported that Stanford's marching band, which had been scheduled to perform, was banned from the field. The band had never been scheduled to perform at halftime; each team's marching band was allotted a six-minute pregame performance.|$|E

5|$|In Iceland, the {{influence}} of pre-Christian belief systems still pervaded the country's cultural heritage into the 20th century. There, farmer Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson founded the Heathen group Ásatrúarfélagið in 1972, which initially had 12 members. Beinteinsson served as Allsherjargodi (chief priest) {{until his death in}} 1993, when he was succeeded by Jormundur Ingi Hansen. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> expanded in size, Hansen's leadership caused schisms, and to retain the unity of the movement, he stepped down and was replaced by Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson in 2003, by which time Ásatrúarfélagið had accumulated 777 members and played a visible role in Icelandic society. In England, the British Committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite was established by John Yeowell in 1972. In 1992, Mark Mirabello published Odin Brotherhood, which claimed the existence of a secret society of Odinists; most British Heathens doubt its existence.|$|E
5|$|In {{pursuing}} the Clinton administration's energy objectives through {{construction of the}} $4.5 billion Afghanistan Oil Pipeline, Raphel created ill will with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, then {{under the command of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to the longstanding civil war with Taliban forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating with the Taliban to advance American commercial interests even <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E
5|$|Influenced from {{an early}} age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained {{international}} recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. He was a member of CIAM (Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne) in the 1950s. He did not join the group of younger CIAM architects known as Team X, though his 1960 Tokyo Bay plan was influential for Team 10 in the 1960s, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> that became Metabolism.|$|E

He does this through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> turns against him he leaves.|$|E
