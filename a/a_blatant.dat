5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, {{such as the}} shooting of ten well-known residents of Trøndelag and its environs in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton {{to see what}} can be done to stem the losses. In <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 1824, the Senate {{voted to}} repeal the law that had {{established}} the Court of Appeals and {{to establish a new}} Court of Appeals with four justices. The measure came to the House floor on December 23. During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support the measure, <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> violation of the rules of the House. The next day the measure passed in the House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T. Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, CP+B and Burger King {{became the}} target of lawyers of the band Slipknot, who alleged the mask-wearing rooster rockers were <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> copy of the band's style. The band claimed that CP+B had {{approached}} Slipknot's record company, Roadrunner Records, with an offer to appear in another commercial for Burger King. The band declined {{on the grounds that}} they did not want to be associated with a burger chain and they felt that the Coq Roq advertisements were deliberately co-opting the band's signature look and style in order to influence its fans to purchase the chain's products. The band issued a cease and desist letter to CP+B and BK requesting the advertisements be pulled. When the two parties declined, the band sued for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{went into}} the first leg in Glasgow as massive underdogs, and the match {{seemed to be going}} as {{expected}} when 17 year old Michael Owen put the English side ahead on 6 minutes. Celtic continued to struggle during the opening 20 minutes, but began to find form as the first half progressed. The start of the second half saw Celtic pushing forward more and they equalised on 53 minutes. Jackie McNamara raced down the right wing, played a one-two with Craig Burley, then volleyed a powerful shot past David James. Simon Donnelly hit the post on 62 minutes, then a minute later the referee ignored what appeared to be <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> foul on him in the penalty box. Celtic continued to press forward, and on 73 minutes were awarded a penalty when Larsson fell on being challenged by David James in the penalty box. Donnelly converted the resultant spot kick to put Celtic ahead. With full-time approaching, Steve McManaman picked the ball from inside his own half, dribbled 70 yards {{to the edge of the}} Celtic penalty box and curled a shot in to level the match at 22. The return match at Anfield produced fewer chances and no goals, seeing Liverpool knock out Celtic on away goals.|$|E

5|$|Ran won several {{awards in}} Japan, {{but was not}} quite as honored there {{as many of the}} director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the {{selection}} of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 57th Academy Awards. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Best Directing that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa). Rans costume designer, Emi Wada, won the movie's only Oscar.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} 1950 s, {{when i was}} an {{undergraduate}} at a certain midwestern university, one of the favorite pasttimes of my fellow students and me was the making of names. But we weren 2 ̆ 7 t content to stop there; we had to convince each other, and the authorities, that these names identified real persons. <b>As</b> <b>blatant</b> as this sounds, we would go to considerable lengths to enroll our creations in classes, student clubs and athletic teams, and we even offered them as prom queen (and king) candidates and nominated them for honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa. We submitted lists of these made up names to city newspapers and described how their bearers had excelled in athletic or scholarly activities on campus. The media lapped it up, so anxious were they in those days to report anything of interest happening on campus...|$|R

However, even according to the lenient opinion, <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> error with no source in any scribal tradition invalidates a Torah scroll.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} al-Qaeda as a network inspiring {{terrorism}} {{around the world}} and training operatives {{can be traced to the}} Soviet War in Afghanistan (December 1979 – February 1989). The US viewed the conflict in Afghanistan, with the Afghan Marxists and allied Soviet troops on one side and the native Afghan mujahideen, some of whom were radical Islamic militants, on the other, as <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> case of Soviet expansionism and aggression.|$|E
25|$|Josephine Butler, already {{experienced}} in prostitution issues, a charismatic leader, and a seasoned campaigner, {{emerged as the}} natural leader of what became the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1869. Her work demonstrated the potential power of an organized lobby group. The association successfully argued that the Acts not only demeaned prostitutes, but all women and men by promoting <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> sexual double standard. Butler's activities resulted in the radicalization of many moderate women. The Acts were repealed in 1886.|$|E

5000|$|What Drury's Washington novels {{badly needed}} was a blue pencil, <b>a</b> less <b>blatant</b> ideology, and greater {{attention}} to characterization. In Anna Hastings he delivers all three. This is his most convincing Washington novel since Advise and Consent in 1959. Moreover, he has freed himself of the incubus of his crippling cast of carry-ver fossilized pols from earlier books. Anna Hastings is both a fresh face and a fresh start in Drury fiction.|$|R
25|$|When Onegin finally arrives, Zaretsky is {{supposed}} to ask him a final time if {{he would like to}} apologise. Instead, Zaretsky is surprised by the apparent absence of Onegin's second. Onegin, against all rules, appoints his servant Guillot as his second which was the last action to take from a noble man (chapter 6, stanza XXVII), <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> insult for the nobleman Zaretsky. Zaretsky angrily accepts Guillot as Onegin's second. By his actions, Zaretsky does not act as a nobleman should; in the end Onegin wins the duel.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of Double Indemnity, imitators of the film's plot and style were rampant. In 1945, Producers Releasing Corporation, one of the B movie studios of Hollywood’s Poverty Row, was set to release <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> rip-off titled Single Indemnity {{starring}} Ann Savage and Hugh Beaumont. Paramount quickly slapped an injunction on the cut-rate potboiler that remains in force to this day. PRC eventually edited its film down to 67 minutes, re-titled it Apology for Murder, and sold it to television in the early 1950s {{as part of a}} syndicated half-hour mystery show.|$|E

At that time, Colombo deemed it as <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> show of support for the Tamil Tigers. The total supply air dropped by India during the operation amounted to little over 25 tons, and this was clearly not sufficient to sustain a besieged city.|$|E

50|$|Alexander I treated {{his wife}} indifferently, he was polite toward her in public ceremonies {{and made an}} effort to have his meals in her company. Elizabeth was too soft and placid to keep a hold on a restless and soul {{tortured}} man such as her husband. In 1803, Alexander began a love affair that would continue for more than fifteen years with the Polish Princess Maria Czetwertynska, wife of Prince Dmitri Naryshkin. Princess Maria Naryshkina flaunted her liaison at Court in <b>a</b> tasteless, <b>blatant</b> fashion.|$|R
25|$|The EMS {{division}} was rocked by leadership scandals in 2004 and 2005. In August 2004, D.C. {{emergency medical services}} officials breached confidential patient records by taking them home, <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> violation of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. EMS Medical Director Dr. Fernando Daniels III was terminated, and city investigators said that many {{or most of the}} EMS division's 35 managers could be fired. Daniels' successor, Dr. Clifford H. Turen, resigned on March 1, 2005, after it was learned that he had not yet received a license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia and his speciality was not in emergency medicine.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a second}} {{category}} of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record {{a player in the}} scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct. These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. Repeated incidents can result in disqualification. <b>A</b> <b>blatant</b> foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA). In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.|$|E
25|$|The reigning Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, {{declared}} a state of emergency on 25 June 1975 due to internal political disturbances. Accordingly, all fundamental rights enjoyed in the Indian Constitution were suspended. Political dissidents, newspaper reporters, opposition leaders who opposed the emergency were jailed. George Fernandes, along with like-minded leaders, opposed what he saw as <b>a</b> <b>blatant</b> misuse of power. A warrant was issued in Fernandes' name and subsequently he went underground to escape arrest and prosecution. When the police failed to capture him, they arrested and tortured his brother, Lawrence Fernandes, to reveal his brother's whereabouts.
