40|$|The Mep/Amt {{proteins}} {{constitute a}} new family of transport proteins that are ubiquitous in nature. Members from bacteria, yeast and plants have been identified experimentally as high-affinity ammonium transporters. We have determined the topology of AmtB, a Mep/Amt protein from Escherichia coli, as a representative protein for the complete family. This was established using a minimal set of AmtB±PhoA fusion proteins with a complementary set of AmtB± LacZ fusions. These data, accompanied by an in silico analysis, indicate {{that the majority of}} the Mep/ Amt proteins contain 11 membrane-spanning helices, with the N-terminus on the exterior face of the membrane and the C-terminus on the interior. A small subset, including E. coli AmtB, probably have an <b>additional</b> <b>twelfth</b> membrane-spanning region at the N-terminus. Addition of PhoA or LacZ a-peptide to the C-terminus of E. coli AmtB resulted in complete loss of transport activity, as judged by measurements of [14 C]-methylammonium uptake. This C-terminal region, along with four membrane-spanning helices, contains multiple residues that are conserved within the Mep/Amt protein family. Structural modelling of the E. coli AmtB protein suggests a number of secondary structural features that might contribute to function, including a putative ammonium binding site on the periplasmic face of the membrane at residue Asp- 182. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the structure and function of the related human Rhesus proteins...|$|E

However, when the novel was republished in 1987-1989, <b>additional</b> eleventh and <b>twelfth</b> volumes were also written to supplement more of the story around 1945, the end of World War II. When the novel was republished in 1995, volumes 11 and 12 were inserted in the chronologically appropriate spot between volumes 5 and 6.|$|R

Management {{of energy}} {{resources}} {{will be a}} major challenge because rapid growth will require a significant expansion in domestic energy supplies and also a much greater focus on energy efficiency. The viability of the power sector as a whole depends critically upon the financial viability of the distribution system. The total losses of the distribution system, if properly accounted, are probably as high as Rs 70,000 crores. If the States could cover these losses by subsidies, the system would not be at risk. However, state budgets cannot provide subsidies on this scale and the losses are effectively being funded by the banking system. AT&C losses shall be reduced to 15% {{by the end of the}} Twelfth Plan. The electricity tariffs have to be adjusted in line with costs. There is an urgent need to implement a package of distribution reforms combined with tariff increases, which will make the distribution companies viable for all <b>additional</b> sales. The <b>Twelfth</b> Plan version of the Accelerated Power Development Reform Programme should be tailored to provide resources to States taking credible steps along these lines. New energy efficient building standards should be made mandatory.|$|R
