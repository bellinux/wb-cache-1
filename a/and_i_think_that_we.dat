2500|$|Another {{incident}} in July 2012 {{dealt with the}} vandalism of the synagogue of Noisy-le-Grand of the Seine-Saint-Denis district in Paris. The synagogue was vandalized {{three times in a}} ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L’Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, [...] "Despite the measures taken, things persist, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were bound}} {{to get to the}} bottom of it all, if we could; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have,--at last. Perhaps, as you say, we ought to have done it sooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{doctor has}} {{returned}} from his business rounds sooner than was expected, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better join the party," [...] I remarked, and made a bee line for the stoep, Marnham following me.|$|E
2500|$|That's all gonna be deconstructed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that's {{why this}} {{regulatory}} thing is so important." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{comes from}} them being easy to wear,” said Glamour Magazine’s Anne Christensen. “I know that {{simplifies}} it, but it’s like shapes {{that are easy}} to wear and colors that are fun to wear… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> what her shows always have is a real sense of optimism <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what we all need today <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> came through in the bright patterns <b>and</b> colors <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> something that she does so well.” ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think on}} this tack," [...] the skipper said, {{as he stood}} by the compass after she had gone round, [...] "we shall make the point, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall make it ahead of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] {{answered}} Umslopogaas, [...] "these and war, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall {{find enough}} of all three. Only I hope that war will come the first, lest the Spirits {{and the dead}} should bewitch me and take away my skill and courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is another}} matter I {{want to speak to}} you about. Of course, we should not dare to return to Seringapatam, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better settle to go to Bangalore. Could you forward our packs, with the merchandise, to someone in that town?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Farrell, {{who is a}} Christian, {{believes}} that marriage is {{between a man and}} a woman but has said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is a civil rights issue. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right thing to do is let the voters decide." ...|$|R
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues <b>that</b> were personal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> made him much more secretive <b>and</b> reclusive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had many}} friends amongst the schoolboys, whom <b>I</b> loved dearly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> my {{disposition}} was then very affectionate.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} a good many, I can tell you, youngster. Still, I hope we shall go up; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall do so, for {{it will be the}} Captain's report that will help the {{authorities}} to decide whether to appoint a Resident there or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can see none, Baas, {{except for}} the birds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better stop talking and make ready, for the priests are still behind us. If you will watch on the neck here so {{that we are not}} surprised, I will seek stones to carry us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,' murmured Venetia to herself, 'I {{scarcely}} comprehend {{now what}} to-morrow means.' And then again addressing him, {{and with more}} liveliness, she said, 'We have only one friend in the world now, George, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought to be very grateful that he is our neighbour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I call it human <b>and</b> reasonable; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is {{compatible}} with duty and affection. Have you consulted her wishes?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> heard <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> another heard also, {{at least}} once more the stony smile shone {{in the eyes of}} the Shaman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I know he {{was very}} sick about his brother looking too closely into his concerns. He has a little affair on just now {{that he wants to}} keep to himself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that is the reason he went off so quietly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fortunately {{the night}} is very dark <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall succeed. Say nothing about it, Egbert, and tell the men to keep silent. The good people of Paris shall know nothing of the matter until they see the flames dancing round the towers which they hold in so much dread." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will do our best, Colonel, in any {{direction}} you may point out; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could defend a breach against any reasonable force brought against it. I may say that I have been ordered, if the worst comes to the worst, to endeavour to make {{my way out of}} the town before it surrenders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somewhere {{about seven}} {{millions}} of francs," [...] Sogrange declared. [...] "There are few men in Paris more extravagant than I, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> Frenchmen know what extravagance means. But I cannot spend my income. Do {{you think that}} it is for the sake of gain that I have come across the Channel to add the Clenarvon diamonds to our coffers?" ...|$|E
50|$|Problem solution: My girlfriend {{wants to}} make up with me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> better {{for both of us}} (thinking about the other's {{intended}} actions).|$|R
6000|$|... "His comrades {{called him}} Jim, as <b>I</b> have said; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he once {{referred}} {{to himself as}} Jim Cuttance, or something like that." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{should be}} an Afghanistan where every Afghan finds himself or herself happy. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> can only be assured by {{democracy}} based on consensus".|$|R
6000|$|... "If he has half of it," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, [...] "he {{ought to}} be {{satisfied}} with that, and not keep us here on pins and needles until he gets the rest. Of course, I do not want to say anything that would pain you, Edna, and I won't do it, but people can't help thinking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have waited as long as our consciences have any right to ask us to wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Ronald; my {{idea is that}} we turn {{west and}} ride to Le Mans, then take a wide detour and enter Tours from the south side. It will take us a day longer, but that is of little consequence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall in that way entirely outwit them. The only {{precaution}} we shall have to take is to cross the main road on our right at some point remote from any town or village." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} your feeling, Mrs. Renshaw, {{and it is}} quite natural. I do think that everyone who can carry a musket ought to join in this expedition, and I flatter myself that Wilfrid's rifle and mine are allies not to be despised. Anyhow, Mrs. Renshaw, I promise you {{that we will not}} do what are called rash things. We won't try to capture Te Kooti single-handed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can be much more useful covering an attack than leading an assault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An iron will is an {{integral}} part of such a temperament. How else could he be a leader? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you are mistaken in--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{it may be}} <b>that</b> you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{upon the}} whole they may be worn with advantage. What does the country say to that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{answered}} her husband, [...] "you have often {{told me that}} you were sure no harm would come to Rachel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Duchess," [...] he said slowly, [...] "you are laboring {{under some}} {{extraordinary}} mistake. Anne and I {{were very good}} friends <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should have made a reasonably contented couple. That, however, was naturally broken off at once owing to my misfortune. Anne's visit to Paris, her sudden flight from London, had nothing whatever to do with me. I met her here entirely by accident. No word has passed between us which would suggest for a single moment that she looked upon this matter any differently!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{best course}} {{will be to}} travel through Saint Poelten and Ips, cross the river at once, and go over the {{mountains}} by the road through Freystadt to Budweis. It {{is by far the}} most level road from here, though a good deal longer than the one through Horn. But there is snow in the air, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall have a heavy downfall, and you may well find the defiles by the Horn road blocked by snow; whereas by Freystadt you are not likely to find any difficulty, and most of the road is perfectly flat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Kingdom fidgeted, {{but before}} she could think of a {{satisfactory}} reply Bella came to the door and asked to speak to her for a moment. Profiting by her absence, Mr. Hardy leaned towards Miss Nugent, and in a low voice expressed his sorrow at the mishap to her father and his firm conviction that everything that could be thought of for that unfortunate mariner's comfort would be done. [...] "Our fathers will probably come back good friends," [...] he concluded. [...] "There is nothing would give me more pleasure than that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better begin and set them a good example." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{that big}} guy--that big {{man with the}} rimless {{spectacles}} looks like {{he might be a}} good civil engineer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> lady opposite him--" ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{should be}} an Afghanistan where every Afghan finds himself or herself happy. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> can only be assured by {{democracy}} based on consensus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not, sir," [...] the {{policeman}} admitted. [...] "Keep by my side, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing will happen}} to you before we reach Holborn." ...|$|R
