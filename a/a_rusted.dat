5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of {{nothing more than}} a scouring pad, <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar. The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that he is doing the same to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E
5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being <b>a</b> <b>rusted,</b> L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E
25|$|The Malibu {{location}} is today known as Malibu Creek State Park. Formerly called the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the 1980s, the site today {{is returning to}} a natural state, and is marked by <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> Jeep and an ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was occasionally used for television commercial production.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} on the foreshore {{on the western side}} of the Cape, below the Battery Observation Post (BOP), of a concrete and rock pathway leading from the road down to the water, where 1940s photographs show a rock jetty in this position. <b>A</b> <b>rusted</b> gearbox lying beside this pathway may be that used in the winch. Above the road is the cutting (somewhat overgrown) where a rail line was laid to winch equipment and supplies from the road and the beach to the Battery Observation Post high on the hill. At the top of the cutting, {{to the side of the}} BOP, is a concrete slab which may have been associated with the rail wagon and winch area.|$|E
500|$|Triton {{departed}} New London on 16 February 1960 {{for what}} was announced as her shakedown cruise (pictured). [...] Triton set course to the south-east (134 degrees true). At dawn on 17 February, Triton performed her first morning star-sighting using the built-in sextant in her No. 1 periscope during the nightly ventilation of the shipboard atmosphere. The inboard induction valve was closed after the removal of <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> flashlight that had prevented its closure.|$|E
500|$|Residents of the company-owned {{houses were}} given the option to buy the {{structures}} at bargain prices, provided they move them out of town. For many, it took a great chunk of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after it became official that Elcor's fate was sealed, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were now being sold {{for as much as}} $500. Most of the remaining families moved a mile west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. <b>A</b> <b>rusted</b> fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through {{what was left of the}} town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of what was once a thriving community.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards Eirik Bloodaxe was crowned co-king, and as Thorolf {{headed home}} to Iceland, the king {{gave him a}} gold-inlaid axe {{as a gift to}} Skallagrim. Skallagrim abused the axe (named [...] "King's Gift" [...] or konungsnautr) and {{shattered}} it, reciting an insulting poem about it to Thorolf and handing back {{what was left of the}} axe, a sooty handle with <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> blade. Thorolf flung the axe overboard, but reported to King Eirik that his father was grateful for the axe, presenting a bolt of longship sail cloth pretended to be from Skallagrim. In this way Thorolf managed to somewhat keep the peace between Skallagrim and King Eirik Bloodaxe.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{became known}} for his menacing home run power; in the on-deck circle, he {{routinely}} swung <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> piece of rebar that he reportedly found during a renovation project in Old Comiskey Park. In his first full season, Thomas {{established himself as a}} multi-talented hitter, combining power with hitting for average, drawing walks, and driving in runs. In , Thomas finished third in MVP voting with a [...]318 batting average, 32 home runs and 109 runs batted in, as well as walking 138 times. He won the first of four Silver Slugger Awards, and led the league in on-base percentage, something he would accomplish four times during his career.|$|E

60|$|There was a small, heavily-grated, {{unglazed}} window {{high in the}} wall, with a stone screen before it, so {{that the}} sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed.

60|$|Had Julian been {{inclined}} for mirth, as was {{far from}} being the case, he must have smiled at the incongruity of the clerk's apparel, who had belted over his black buckram suit a buff baldric, sustaining a broadsword, and a pair of huge horse-pistols; and, instead of the low flat hat, which, coming in place of the city cap, completed the dress of a scrivener, had placed on his greasy locks <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> steel-cap, which had seen Marston-Moor; across which projected his well-used quill, {{in the guise of a}} plume--the shape of the morion not admitting of its being stuck, as usual, behind his ear.|$|E
60|$|BEOWULF. The old epic poem, {{called after}} its hero Beowulf, {{is more than}} myth or legend, more even than history; it {{is a picture of}} a life and a world that once had real existence. Of that {{vanished}} life, that world of ancient Englishmen, only a few material fragments remain: a bit of linked armor, <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> sword with runic inscriptions, the oaken ribs of a war galley buried with the Viking who had sailed it on stormy seas, and who was entombed in it because he loved it. All these are silent witnesses; they have no speech or language. But this old poem is a living voice, speaking with truth and sincerity of the daily habit of the fathers of modern England, of their adventures by sea or land, their stern courage and grave courtesy, their ideals of manly honor, their thoughts of life and death.|$|E

60|$|The {{figure of}} the rider was thin, tall, and slender, but remarkably athletic, bony, and sinewy; like one who had all his life {{followed}} those violent exercises which prevent the human form from increasing in bulk, while they harden and confirm by habit its muscular powers. His face, sharp-featured, sun-burnt, and freckled, had a sinister expression of violence, impudence, and cunning, each of which seemed alternately to predominate over the others. Sandy-coloured hair, and reddish eyebrows, from under which looked forth his sharp grey eyes, completed the inauspicious outline of the horseman's physiognomy. He had pistols in his holsters, and another pair peeped from his belt, though he had taken some pains to conceal them by buttoning his doublet. He wore <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> steel head piece; a buff jacket of rather an antique cast; gloves, of which that for the right hand was covered with small scales of iron, like an ancient gauntlet; and a long broadsword completed his equipage.|$|E

Coyotes and buzzards had performed the last sad rites for pretty much all else. Two skulls were visible and in order to investigate this somewhat unusual redundancy one of the younger men had the hardihood to spring into the grave and hand them up to another before Mrs. Porfer could indicate her marked disapproval of so shocking an act, which, nevertheless, she did with considerable feeling and in very choice words. Pursuing his search among the dismal debris {{at the bottom of the}} grave the young man next handed up <b>a</b> <b>rusted</b> coffin plate, with a rudely cut inscription, which with difficulty Mr. Porfer deciphered and read aloud with an earnest and not altogether unsuccessful attempt at the dramatic effect which he deemed befitting to the occasion and his rhetorical abilities: ...|$|E

Will he insist that the rust is not rust, or that it is a rust sui generis, intentionally formed on the steel for some mysterious virtue in it, and that the staff and astrolabe of a shepherd-astronomer are identical with, or equivalent to, the quadrant and telescope of Newton or Herschel?
