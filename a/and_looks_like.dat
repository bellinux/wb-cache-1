25|$|Small-cell ovarian {{carcinoma}} is {{rare and}} aggressive, with two main subtypes: hypercalcemic and pulmonary. It is typically fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Hypercalcemic small cell ovarian carcinoma overwhelmingly affects {{those in their}} 20s, causes high blood calcium levels, and affects one ovary. Pulmonary small cell ovarian cancer usually affects both ovaries of older women <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> oat-cell carcinoma of the lung.|$|E
25|$|Pheromone {{communication}} {{can be used}} {{to recruit}} workers to a food source, a new nesting site, or a place where work is required. The pheromone is released from the abdomen of the wasp, {{at the base of the}} fifth sternite. It is excreted by Richard's glands. The pheromone has a strong leather-like odor, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> brownish wax. Because of the strong odor, workers can easily follow a pheromone trail left by other colony members. The pheromone is produced slowly and continuously throughout life, so it can be used up if used too often or too quickly. Another species that exhibits this behavior is Synoeca surinama.|$|E
25|$|The A6 {{crosses the}} River Great Ouse twice more, and is crossed by the John Bunyan Trail, near a GSJ for Clapham and Oakley. There is another GSJ for Highfield Parc Industrial Estate. At {{the end of}} the bypass, the road {{suddenly}} loses the broad expanse of tarmac <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a minor B road and becomes Bedford Road; there are speed cameras here. It passes through Milton Ernest, passing the Queen's Head pub and the exit for the notorious Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre. It then carries on for around three miles, passing the Falcon pub near Bletsoe then passes Sharnbrook at a Roundabout. Around a mile later it crosses the border into Northamptonshire and enters the district of East Northamptonshire. It passes through the village of Wymington, and passes the exit to the well known Santa Pod Raceway, bypasses the towns of Rushden and Higham Ferrers, arriving at the Chown's Mill roundabout with the A45. From here the road bridges the River Nene and the Nene Way before bypassing Irthlingborough. The A6 then passes through the village of Finedon and intersects the A510 at a roundabout. Leaving Finedon, the road then passes the Burton Wold Wind Farm and bypasses the town of Burton Latimer, finally arriving at Junction 10 of the A14 at Barton Seagrave.|$|E

Povey, who performs with the stage name Intensi T, said it was the highlight of his career. Roberts also performed the song on British chat-shows Daybreak and Paul O'Grady Live.|$|E
500|$|Generally {{considered}} Döblin's masterpiece, Berlin Alexanderplatz {{has become}} an iconic text of the Weimar Republic. Published in 1929, its innovative use of literary montage {{as well as its}} panoramic portrayal of a modern metropolis have earned it a place among the key works of literary modernism. Berlin Alexanderplatz tells the story of Franz Biberkopf, who as the novel opens has just been released from prison for killing his lover. Although he seeks to become respectable, he is quickly drawn into a struggle [...] "with something that comes from without, that is unpredictable <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a destiny." [...] Biberkopf suffers a series of setbacks and catastrophes, including the murder of his lover and the loss of an arm. The novel earned Döblin global recognition and literary celebrity, and was translated into English in 1931 by Eugene Jolas, a friend of James Joyce. It has been filmed twice, once in the 1931 Berlin-Alexanderplatz, directed by Phil Jutzi and starring Heinrich George as Biberkopf, and then again in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1980 14-part television film. In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers from around the world, Berlin Alexanderplatz was named among the top 100 books of all time.|$|E

500|$|The {{highest point}} of the temple (kalasa) has {{the shape of a}} water pot and stands on top of the tower. This portion of the vimana is often lost due to age and has been {{replaced}} with a metallic pinnacle. Below the kalasa is a large, highly- sculptured structure resembling a dome which is made from large stones <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a helmet. [...] It may be 2m by 2m in size and follows the shape of the shrine. Below this structure are domed roofs in a square plan, all of them much smaller and crowned with small kalasas. They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the sukanasi has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower (Foekema calls it the [...] "nose"). One decorated roof tier runs on top of the wall of a closed mantapa above the heavy eaves of an open mantapa and above the porches.|$|E

Kelli Kennedy writing for the Associated Press noted that Beyoncé [...] "slays at tour opening" [...] and further commented [...] "her commanding performance of [...] "Freedom" [...] served as reminder to the world that she 'breaks chains all by myself. I'm gonna keep running because a runner don't quit on herself'". Becky Randel of Billboard felt that emotion guided the mood for the evening and stated that [...] "Bey was overcome when the audience knew all the lyrics to her new song, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and she often stopped to smile or nod at her exuberant BeyHive. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kat Bein said Beyoncé was [...] "a prime example of entertainment and a vision of an artist at her apex" [...] and later commented [...] "the show was a visual feast as well as an emotional tour de force, packed with fireworks, confetti, rearranging stage designs and aerial dancers".|$|E
500|$|Hip-hop {{dance is}} a broad {{category}} that includes a variety of styles. The older dance styles that were created in the 1970s include uprock, breaking, and the funk styles. Breaking was created in The Bronx, New York, incorporating dances that were popular in the 1960s and early 1970s in African-American and Latino communities. In its earliest form, it began as [...] on James Brown's [...] "Good Foot" [...] dance which came out in 1972. Breaking at this period was not primarily floor-oriented as seen today; {{it started out as}} toprock which dancers perform while standing up. An influence on toprock was uprock which was created in Brooklyn, New York. Uprock looks similar to toprock, but it is more aggressive <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a fight. Uprock is also performed with partners, but in toprock—and in breaking in general—each person takes turns dancing. In 1973, DJ Kool Herc invented the break beat. A break beat is a rhythmic, musical interlude of a song that has been looped over and over again to extend that instrumental solo. Kool Herc did this to provide a means for dancers who attended his parties to demonstrate their skills. B-boy and b-girl stands for [...] "break-boy" [...] and [...] "break-girl"; b-boys and b-girls dance to the break of a record. Further influenced by martial arts and gymnastics, breaking went from being a purely upright dance style—toprock only—to becoming more floor-oriented.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Rap-Up called the video [...] "electrifying" [...] and complimented the [...] "slickly-choreographed routines" [...] performed by Brown. Andrew Martin of Prefix magazine praised Brown's [...] "killer dance moves". Katie Hasty of HitFix gave the video a positive review, writing [...] "there {{is a serious}} series of sweeping dance shots that may impress the hating-est of haters". Jacob Moore of Complex magazine noted that the dance party scenes is what [...] "you'd expect from a Breezy video". Meena Rupani of DesiHits felt that the video took her [...] "into a whole different world" [...] that {{reminded her of the}} films Eyes Wide Shut (1999) and Men in Black (1997). Rupani also described it as [...] "extremely futuristic <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> it belongs in the year 2030". Jocelyn Vena of MTV News called it an [...] "eye-popping video" [...] and noted that there were several outfits Brown wore that paid homage to Michael Jackson. A reviewer for Capital FM praised Brown's [...] "impressive dance routines" [...] and noted that it was [...] "similar to that of a Michael Jackson show". This was echoed by Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush who wrote that Brown's dance routines were [...] "quite reminiscent of Michael Jackson and his classic, dance-driven videos". Joey of WXRK found the video to [...] "be a hybrid between Michael Jackson's 'Smooth Criminal', a party that Ke$ha would be at, and that scene from Fame when everyone is dancing in the streets on top of cabs and cars". The video earned Brown and Taberez a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards. It won Best Male Video and Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. On September 19, 2012, the video received a nomination at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards for Best Dance Performance.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{only hours}} after the Virginia Tech {{shooting}} (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter-Strike. According to Thompson, the game [...] "drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [...] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower." [...] He says that Seung-Hui [...] "was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality." [...] Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four {{years prior to the}} shooting, Thompson asserts that [...] "you don't drop it when you go to college, typically." [...] Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that [...] "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people." [...] Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the [...] "flat effect on [...] face" [...] and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that [...] "this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the Terminator, he's a video gamer." [...] Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, [...] "Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that {{used to be in the}} Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." [...] However, Microsoft did not create Counter-Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game. The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui [...] "played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog," [...] and that [...] "none of the video games [...] were war games or had violent themes." ...|$|E
