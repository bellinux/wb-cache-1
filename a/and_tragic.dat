5|$|Keynsham rugby {{football}} club play at Crown Field. The club's most notable <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> event occurred on 24 December 1992, {{when there was}} a fatal road accident outside the club's ground. A Ford Fiesta car ploughed into 11 people leaving the annual festive disco. One woman, 21-year-old Sarah Monnelle, died at the scene. A second person, 24-year-old rugby player Richard Barnett, died in hospital two days later from his injuries. Clive Sutton was later found guilty on a double charge of causing death by dangerous driving and sentenced to four years in prison at Bristol Crown Court.|$|E
5|$|This {{magnificent}} <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> satire {{criticizes the}} prototype of the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places {{at the beginning of}} the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{ends with}} the narrator turning towards his own fate, {{accepting}} his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates a narrator who is contemplating his position in a transient world that is mysterious <b>and</b> <b>tragic.</b> Although the comparison between obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political ramifications for Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious <b>and</b> <b>tragic.</b> Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> heroine of the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse that turns humans into fiends. Believing {{that there is no}} cure for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja and one of the DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E

5|$|The theatre, {{along with}} the {{neighbouring}} Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered {{a prime example of}} Georgian architecture. The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five bay building, with a basement, has a hipped roof with a part-balustraded parapet. Above the door is a bust of David Garrick, which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by George Dance the Younger, is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> muses. The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries. The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with red and gilt decoration, and a trompe-l'œil ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars.|$|E

25|$|Clamp writer Nanase Ohkawa first created Subaru as a mascot for a dōjinshi about onmyōji. Writing Subaru brought Clamp {{difficulties}} due to {{the authors}} not being used to kindhearted characters. Critical reception to the character has been mostly positive. Publications for manga and anime focused on Subaru's romantical <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> relationship with Seishirō and praised his role in both Tokyo Babylon and X.|$|E
25|$|Beside {{these three}} famous Norns, {{there are many}} others who appear at a person's birth in order to {{determine}} his or her future. In the pre-Christian Norse societies, Norns were thought to have visited newborn children.

25|$|These various romantic strands came {{together}} in the Death of Sardanapalus (1827–28). Delacroix's painting {{of the death of}} the Assyrian king Sardanapalus shows an emotionally stirring scene alive with beautiful colours, exotic costumes <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> events. The Death of Sardanapalus depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants, concubines and animals. The literary source is a play by Byron, although the play does not specifically mention any massacre of concubines.|$|E
25|$|Between 1992 and 1994 Tokyo Babylon {{was adapted}} into a two-part {{original}} video animation series by the studio Madhouse. PDS also produced a live-action feature film sequel, Tokyo Babylon 1999, which {{was released on}} August 21, 1993. The series has been well received for its focus on occultism and social themes, the latter which were reflected most notably in Subaru's character development. The manga is also notorious for its open <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> ending which is followed in Clamp's manga X.|$|E
25|$|Another {{key feature}} is that mudang and baksu, {{who in the}} most recent history of Korea are {{regarded}} as belonging to the lowest class (cheonmin 천민), are instead explained as having a forgotten princely origin in myths, often a lineage that can be traced to kingly founders of civilisations. Further features are symbols of divine presence such as the cosmic mountain and the holy tree, <b>and</b> <b>tragic</b> or painful experiences. The bear is a significant symbol in Korean myth, Ainu myths and also found in Siberian myths.|$|E
