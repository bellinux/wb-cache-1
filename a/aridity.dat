5|$|During the Late Permian, {{increasing}} <b>aridity</b> and the {{diversification of}} reptiles contributed into {{a decline in}} terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles, although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group. These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The volcano is {{currently}} unglaciated despite its height, {{due to the}} <b>aridity</b> of the climate. The Quebrada de Chaigüire valley originates {{at the foot of}} Aucanquilcha. The Rio Loa river drains the western and northwestern sides of the volcano; the eastern side drains into the Salar de Ollagüe salt pan, the northeastern into the Salar de Laguani, and the southeastern into the Salar de Carcote. Most valleys only intermittently transport water, if at all.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased <b>aridity</b> of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an <b>aridity</b> index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and <b>aridity</b> means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the desiccation and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led to very fruitful archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the <b>aridity</b> of the region was ameliorated. Preservation in these two regions are alternately superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, as though they represent divergent cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The <b>aridity</b> and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
5|$|The park's 36 reptile species include desert tortoises, diamondback rattlesnakes (one of {{the more}} {{commonly}} seen snakes), coral snakes, Gila monsters, short-horned lizards, spiny lizards, and zebra-tailed lizards. Despite the <b>aridity,</b> three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, the lowland leopard frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The Arizona Game and Fish Department lists the lowland leopard frog as a species of special concern.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe has a {{tropical}} climate with many local variations. The southern areas {{are known for}} their heat and <b>aridity,</b> parts of the central plateau receive frost in winter, the Zambezi valley is also known for its extreme heat and the Eastern Highlands usually experience cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country. The country's rainy season generally runs from late October to March and the hot climate is moderated by increasing altitude. Zimbabwe is faced with recurring droughts, the latest one commencing early in 2015 and ongoing into 2016. Severe storms are rare.|$|E
5|$|Ian Rowley {{proposed}} that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north, which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early Pliocene epoch around 4 million years ago. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens {{in the east and}} Australian raven in the west, this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early Pleistocene. As the climate became cooler and drier, the <b>aridity</b> of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western birds spread eastwards and almost outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia. Rowley noted that the western subspecies of the Australian raven had features intermediate between the eastern subspecies of Australian and little ravens.|$|E
5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its <b>aridity</b> and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologist Richard Schodde has {{proposed}} {{the ancestors of}} the two subspecies were separated during the last glacial period in the Pleistocene around 12,000years ago. <b>Aridity</b> had pushed the grasslands preferred by the wren to the north, and with subsequent wetter warmer conditions it once again spread southwards and met the eastern form in northern Queensland and intermediate forms arose. The distribution of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors lived across New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. Populations became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the red-backed and white-shouldered fairywrens diverged from each other around 3 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 5 million years ago from a lineage {{that gave rise to}} the white-winged fairywren.|$|E
25|$|The gradual group {{includes}} sea level change, increasing anoxia, and increasing <b>aridity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Marfa {{experiences}} a semiarid climate with hot summers and cool winters. Due to its altitude and <b>aridity,</b> the diurnal temperature variation is substantial.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor is}} the {{increased}} <b>aridity</b> occurring with glacial maxima, which reduces the precipitation available to maintain glaciation. The glacial retreat induced by {{this or any other}} process can be amplified by similar inverse positive feedbacks as for glacial advances.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} local surface low {{pressure}} are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block {{any form of}} air ascent. Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by his geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme <b>aridity</b> of the Sahara can not be only explained by the subtropical high pressure. The Atlas Mountains, found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the <b>aridity</b> of {{the northern part of}} the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.|$|E
25|$|Kidneys {{of various}} animals show {{evidence}} of evolutionary adaptation and {{have long been}} studied in ecophysiology and comparative physiology. Kidney morphology, often indexed as the relative medullary thickness, is associated with habitat <b>aridity</b> among species of mammals, and diet (e.g., carnivores have only long loops of Henle).|$|E
25|$|During the Pliocene, the {{detachment}} of Baja California, {{the development of}} the Gulf of California and the Subartic California current drastically reduced moisture coming into Sonora leading to severe regional <b>aridity</b> in both this state and neighboring Baja California. This created xeric communities and the development of species endemic only to this region.|$|E
25|$|The Antandroy consume less rice {{than the}} average Malagasy because of the extreme <b>aridity</b> of Toliara province. They have rather subsisted on a {{traditional}} diet of maize, sweet potato, manioc, and zebu milk and curd. Other staples include yams, taro root, and millet, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.|$|E
25|$|In some mountainous areas, higher {{elevations}} above the condensation line or on equator-facing and leeward slopes {{can result in}} low rainfall and increased exposure to solar radiation. This dries out the soil, resulting in a localized arid environment unsuitable for trees. Many south-facing ridges of the mountains of the Western U.S. have a lower treeline than the northern faces because of increased sun exposure and <b>aridity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ghaggar-Hakra {{system was}} rain-fed, and water-supply {{depended}} on the monsoons. The Indus Valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about 1800 BCE, linked to a general weakening of the monsoon at that time. The Indian monsoon declined and <b>aridity</b> increased, with the Ghaggar-Hakra retracting its reach towards {{the foothills of the}} Himalaya, leading to erratic and less extensive floods that made inundation agriculture less sustainable.|$|E
25|$|Phodopus species {{display a}} variety of morphological, {{physiological}} and behavioral adaptations to seasonal temperature extremes and <b>aridity.</b> To survive the exceptional cold of winter, they have evolved spherical, compact bodies with excellent insulation, including both fur and fat. Water is scarce in both summer and winter, and these hamsters have developed an excellent ability to conserve water by maintaining low evaporative water loss rates and concentrating urine.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Central Asia {{concerns}} {{the history of}} the various peoples that have inhabited Central Asia. The lifestyle of such people has been determined primarily by the area's climate and geography. The <b>aridity</b> of the region makes agriculture difficult and distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region. Nomadic horse peoples of the steppe dominated the area for millennia.|$|E
25|$|Israel has a Mediterranean climate with long, hot, rainless {{summers and}} {{relatively}} short, cool, rainy winters (Köppen climate classification Csa). The climate is as such due to Israel's location between the subtropical <b>aridity</b> of the Sahara and the Arabian deserts, and the subtropical humidity of the Levant and Eastern Mediterranean. The climate conditions are highly variable {{within the state}} and modified locally by altitude, latitude, and the proximity to the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, C4 {{metabolism}} was well established on the plains. In {{place of the}} prehistoric C3 grasslands (which are no longer extant) was the savanna, today's subtropical mixture of grasses and sedges. The deciding factors in this turn of evolution were a documented increase in temperature and <b>aridity</b> over the period. Faced with scant nutrition from browsing, the smaller Rhinocerotidae and Equidae declined in diversity, the gate in that direction, so to speak, now being closed.|$|E
25|$|Aeolian {{deposits}} can {{be quite}} striking. The depositional environment of the Touchet Formation, located in the Northwestern United States, had intervening periods of <b>aridity</b> {{which resulted in a}} series of rhythmite layers. Erosional cracks were later infilled with layers of soil material, especially from aeolian processes. The infilled sections formed vertical inclusions in the horizontally deposited layers of the Touchet Formation, and thus provided evidence of the events that intervened over time among the forty-one layers that were deposited.|$|E
25|$|Upon unifying, Italy had a {{predominantly}} agrarian society as 60% {{of the active}} population worked in agriculture. Advances in technology, the sale of vast Church estates, foreign competition along with export opportunities rapidly transformed the agricultural sector in Italy shortly after unification. However, these developments did not benefit all of Italy in this period, as southern Italy's agriculture suffered from hot summers and <b>aridity</b> damaged crops while the presence of malaria prevented cultivation of low-lying areas along Italy's Adriatic Sea coast.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that magma, {{in the form of}} flood basalt, poured onto the surface in what is now called the Siberian Traps, for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased <b>aridity</b> probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|Australia's tropical/subtropical {{location}} and cold waters off the western coast make most of Western Australia a hot desert with <b>aridity</b> a marked feature {{of a greater}} part of the continent. These cold waters produce precious little moisture needed on the mainland. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia.|$|E
25|$|Climate varies {{throughout}} the Great Basin by elevation, latitude, and other factors. Higher elevations {{tend to be}} cooler and receive more precipitation. The western areas of the basin tend to be drier than the eastern areas because of the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada. Most of the basin experiences a semi-arid or arid climate with warm summers and cold winters. However, some of the mountainous areas in the basin are high enough in elevation to experience an Alpine climate. Due to the region's altitude and <b>aridity,</b> most areas in the Great Basin experience a substantial Diurnal temperature variation.|$|E
25|$|During seed based {{restoration}} projects, it {{is generally}} recommended to source from local populations, to minimize the effects of maladaptation. One of the many challenges of restoration is that every species is different and requires different sourcing guidelines. Rather than putting strict distance recommendations, other guidelines recommend sourcing seeds to match similar environmental conditions. For example, sourcing for Castilleja levisecta found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations. Restoration guidelines vary drastically between states and agency. For example, Minnesota is broken up into 9 seed sourcing zones, where its neighbor Iowa, is broken into three latitudinal zones. US Forest Service recently developed provisional seed zones based {{on a combination of}} minimum winter temperature zones, <b>aridity,</b> and the Level III ecoregions.|$|E
25|$|Moral <b>aridity,</b> the {{hypocrisy}} of contemporary life and the inability of people to find happiness in traditional ways such as love and marriage are the regnant themes {{in the works of}} Alberto Moravia. Usually, these conditions are pathologically typical of middle-class life; marriage is the target of works such as Disobedience and L'amore coniugale (Conjugal Love, 1949). Alienation is the theme in works such as Il disprezzo (Contempt or A Ghost at Noon. 1954) and La noia (The Empty Canvas) from the 1950s, despite observation from a rational-realistic perspective. Political themes are often present: an example is La Romana (The Woman of Rome, 1947), the story of a prostitute entangled with the Fascist regime and with a network of conspirators. The extreme sexual realism in La noia (The Empty Canvas, 1960) introduced the psychologically experimental works of the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The nest {{consists}} of large chambers and tunnels {{in the soil}} possibly with an earthen mound and can be 0.10–1.2 m deep. Nests are deeper in Dinoponera australis and Dinoponera quadriceps than in Dinoponera gigantea, Monnin et al. (2003) suggests that deeper nests are a possible adaptation to seasons and <b>aridity.</b> Dinoponera gigantea nests may have up to eight entrances and can be weakly polydomous, whereas 1–30 openings {{with an average of}} 11 were recorded for Dinoponera longipes. Nesting density and spatial distribution varies depending on habitat. Density ranges from 15–40 nests per ha−1 to 80 nests per ha−1. Morgan (1993) measured a spacing between nests for Dinoponera longipes with a median of 35 m (n=22, range 14–69.5 m). Dinoponera australis and Dinoponera gigantea usually nest at the base of trees. Observations of Dinoponera quadriceps nests show that in more arid Caatinga and Cerrado habitats, nests are predominantly constructed under trees, whereas in Atlantic forest 60% of nests were 3 m away from any tree.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{recharge}} water enters the aquifer is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits {{the amount of water}} able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the <b>aridity</b> increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.|$|E
25|$|Western Utah {{is mostly}} arid desert with a basin and range topography. Small {{mountain}} ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape. The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being comparatively {{flat as a}} result of once forming the bed of ancient Lake Bonneville. Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake, which once covered most of the eastern Great Basin. West of the Great Salt Lake, stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid Great Salt Lake Desert. One exception to this <b>aridity</b> is Snake Valley, which is (relatively) lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from groundwater derived from snow melt in the Snake Range, Deep Creek Range, and other tall mountains to the west of Snake Valley. Great Basin National Park is just over the Nevada state line in the southern Snake Range. One of western Utah's most impressive, but least visited attractions is Notch Peak, the tallest limestone cliff in North America, located west of Delta.|$|E
25|$|P. canadensis coexisted with ankylosaurids Anodontosaurus lambei, Edmontonia longiceps, Euoplocephalus tutus, the maniraptorans Atrociraptor marshalli, Epichirostenotes curriei, Richardoestesia gilmorei, Richardoestesia isosceles, the troodontid Paronychodon lacustris and {{an unnamed}} species of Troodon, the alvarezsaurid {{theropod}} Albertonykus borealis, the ornithomimids Dromiceiomimus brevitertius, Ornithomimus edmontonicus, and an unnamed species of Struthiomimus, the bone-head pachycephalosaurids Stegoceras, and Sphaerotholus edmontonensis, the ornithopod Parksosaurus warreni, the hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus regalis, Hypacrosaurus altispinus, and Saurolophus osborni, the ceratopsians Anchiceratops ornatus, Arrhinoceratops brachyops, Eotriceratops xerinsularis, Montanoceratops cerorhynchus, and the tyrannosaurids Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, {{which were the}} apex predators of this paleoenvironment. Of these, the hadrosaurs dominated in terms of sheer number and made up half of all dinosaurs who lived in this region. Vertebrates present in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation {{at the time of}} Pachyrhinosaurus included reptiles, and amphibians. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Belonostomus made up the fish fauna. Reptiles such as turtles and crocodilians are rare in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and this was thought to reflect the relatively cool climate which prevailed at the time. A study by Quinney et al. (2013) however, showed that the decline in turtle diversity, which was previously attributed to climate, coincided instead with changes in soil drainage conditions, and was limited by <b>aridity,</b> landscape instability, and migratory barriers. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus was present and freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Evidence has shown that multituberculates and the early marsupial Didelphodon coyi were present. Vertebrate trace fossils from this region included the tracks of theropods, ceratopsians and ornithopods, which provide evidence that these animals were also present. Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included both marine and terrestrial invertebrates.|$|E
