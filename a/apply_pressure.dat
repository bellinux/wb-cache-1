5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Gabi Ben Harosh, {{partner of}} the Abergil brothers, was arrested in Los Angeles. After two years of house arrest, he signed a plea bargain for minor offenses, {{connected}} to bringing in foreign currency without a permit, {{and was sentenced to}} community service and judicial supervision for three years. In view of the Abergil brothers extradition to the US, {{he and his wife were}} arrested for violating immigration laws. It is believed that American authorities tried to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> to Ben Harosh to incriminate the Abergil brothers but failed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of axial force on the surface {{appearance}} and mechanical properties of 6061 aluminum alloy welded joints prepared by friction stir welding. The <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> varies from 1. 44 to 10. 07 MPa. The <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> was calculated from the axial force which exerted by a spring loaded cell designed for this purpose. Defect free joints obtained at an <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> of 3. 62 MPa. The mechanical properties of the welded joints were evaluated through microhardness and tensile tests at room temperature. From this investigation, {{it was found that}} the joint produced with an <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> of 5. 76 MPa exhibits superior tensile strength compared to other welded joints. The fracture of this joint happened at the base material...|$|R
40|$|Endotracheal tube (ETT) suction is {{the most}} {{frequently}} performed invasive procedure in ventilated newborn infants and is associated with adverse effects related to negative tracheal pressure. We aimed to measure suction catheter gas flow and intratracheal pressure during ETT suction of a test lung and develop a mathematical model to predict tracheal pressure from catheter and ETT dimensions and <b>applied</b> <b>pressure.</b> Tracheal pressure and catheter flow were recorded during suction of ETT sizes 2. 5 - 4. 0 mm connected to a test lung with catheters 5 - 8 French Gauge and <b>applied</b> <b>pressures</b> of 80 - 200 mm Hg. The fraction of <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> transmitted to the trachea was calculated for each combination, and data fitted to three nonlinear models for analysis. Tracheal pressure was directly proportional to <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> (r 2 = 0. 82 - 0. 99), and catheter flow fitted a turbulent flow model (R 2 = 0. 85 - 0. 96). With each ETT, increasing catheter size resulted in greater catheter flow (p < 0. 0001) and thus lower intratracheal pressure (p < 0. 0001). The fraction of <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> transmitted to the trachea was accurately modeled using ETT and catheter dimensions (R 2 = 0. 98 - 0. 99). Negative tracheal pressure during in vitro ETT suction is directly proportional to <b>applied</b> <b>pressure.</b> This relationship is determined by ETT and catheter dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hydrostatic}} pressure and different heating/cooling rates on physical properties and microstructure of NiTi {{shape memory alloy}} has been investigated. The transformation temperatures and physical properties of the alloy have changed with <b>applied</b> <b>pressure.</b> It has been clearly seen from Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) that {{with the increase of}} <b>applied</b> <b>pressure,</b> while As and Af, and Mf transformation temperatures decrease, Ms value increase. Moreover, based on the increase of the <b>pressure</b> amount <b>applied</b> on the sample, there was an average increase of 48 % for Gibbs free energy and 18 % for elastic strain energy. Entropy of the alloys decreases depending on the increase in the amount of <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> for all heating rates. Depending on the amount of <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> on the sample, an interior strain of 0. 177 % at most was observed. With the increase of <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> on the sample, it was determined that activation energy increased. Additionally, the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the samples show that the grain sizes of the unpressured sample and the samples on which <b>pressure</b> is <b>applied</b> are between 40 and 120 μm, which was determined by Image Analysis Method...|$|R
5|$|In the Adler {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White {{has moved}} f2–f4, the e3-pawn becomes a backward pawn {{on an open}} file. Black can then <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> on the e-file in general, against the e3-pawn and the e4-square in particular. Typical moves in this plan would include the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f6, followed by putting the heavy pieces on the e-file with Rf8–e8 and Qd8–e7 (see diagram at right). The Bc5 is already well placed to pressure the e3-pawn. Depending on circumstances, the Bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5, in both cases to assert control over the central e4-square.|$|E
5|$|Lemaire {{has since}} re-entered retirement, and was {{replaced}} by former Florida head coach Peter DeBoer on July 19, 2011. The team showed greater offensive prowess during the 2011–12 season, employing a more aggressive forecheck centered on Ilya Kovalchuk. Under DeBoer's system, according to Lamoriello, the Devils' defenseman were often sent into the offensive zone to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> on the opposing team's defense. After DeBoer's dismissal, Adam Oates had a similar approach improving the Devils' offense, investing on the versatility of the forwards.|$|E
5|$|When Cristiano Ronaldo was fouled on {{the right}} wing 40yards from goal in the 13th minute, Ryan Giggs was {{presented}} with the first chance of the match; although intended as a cross, Giggs' free-kick hit {{the outside of the}} post. Another foul on Ronaldo gave Giggs another chance to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> with a crossed free-kick shortly after, but Ruud van Nistelrooy was only able to loop the ball over the goal with his head with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann beaten. Arsenal's attacking play lacked their usual ambition, with their best opportunity coming in the 75th minute, when a deft touch from Dennis Bergkamp almost played Patrick Vieira into the penalty area.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and band structure of rhombohedral BiFeO 3 nanostructures were studied using density functional theory for different pressures {{in the range}} from 0 to 50 GPa. The elastic constant of BiFeO 3 nanoceramics was determined and different moduli were calculated for various <b>applied</b> <b>pressures.</b> The bulk (B) and shear (G) modulus show an increasing trend on <b>applied</b> high <b>pressure.</b> The findings of the present work also confirm that the hardness of BiFeO 3 increases with the <b>applied</b> <b>pressure.</b> The ductility of BiFeO 3 nanostructure increases upon increasing the pressure, which is confirmed from Poisson’s ratio and B/G ratio. The band structure studies were also carried out under high pressure and showed that the band gap decreases upon increase in the <b>applied</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the week}} that {{followed}} the brigade undertook defensive duties as the Germans attempted to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> on the beachhead by infiltrating the defensive positions on the eastern flank. On 12 June, the airborne troops launched {{an attack on the}} village of Breville from where German artillery had been shelling them during the preceding week. Although successful, British casualties were high. Having been subjected to an intense artillery barrage, No. 6 Commando suffered 16 casualties. The barrage also wounded the brigade commander, Lord Lovat, to the extent that No. 6 Commando's commanding officer, Mills-Roberts, although wounded himself, was asked to take over from him. Major Anthony Lewis, formerly of the Dorset Regiment, stepped up to take over as commanding officer temporarily, before being confirmed in the role on 24 June and receiving a promotion to acting-lieutenant colonel. He remained in command until 8 August 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Charles Courtney-Coade of the South Staffordshire Regiment took over, and Lewis reverted to the role of second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{had begun}} to alter his policy of {{indirect}} rule in Brittany and started to exert more direct control. In 1164 Henry intervened to seize lands along the border of Brittany and Normandy, and in 1166 invaded Brittany to punish the local barons. Henry then forced Conan to abdicate as duke and to give Brittany to his daughter Constance; Constance was handed over and betrothed to Henry's son Geoffrey. This arrangement was quite unusual in terms of medieval law, as Conan might have had sons who could have legitimately inherited the duchy. Elsewhere in France, Henry attempted to seize the Auvergne, much to the anger of the French king. Further south Henry continued to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> on Raymond of Toulouse: the King campaigned there personally in 1161, sent the Archbishop of Bordeaux against Raymond in 1164 and encouraged Alfonso II of Aragon in his attacks. In 1165 Raymond divorced Louis's sister and attempted to ally himself with Henry instead.|$|E
5|$|San Martín was {{not well}} {{received}} in Buenos Aires. Pueyrredón initially declined to give further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos {{and the organization of}} a huge royalist army in Cádiz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not Buenos Aires. San Martín discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza with his wife and daughter and received a letter from Pueyrredón, who said that Buenos Aires could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the resources needed. San Martín resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> to his backers. The government of Buenos Aires still considered San Martín vital to the national defense, so Pueyrredón agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Martín to withdraw his resignation.|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on an Al- 6061 alloy to evaluate the separate effects of the <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> and the torsional straining in processing by high-pressure torsion (HPT). The values of the Vickers microhardness were measured after processing and plotted both linearly across the diameters of the disks and as three-dimensional representations. The measurements show that the <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> increases the hardness {{in the absence of}} torsional straining. In the presence of a pressure and torsional straining, the hardness values are high {{at the edges of the}} disk but lower in the central region. There is a gradual evolution toward a hardness homogeneity with increasing numbers of HPT revolutions. The hardness values at the edges of the disks are reasonably independent of the <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> but the extent of this region of high hardness depends upon both the <b>applied</b> <b>pressure</b> and the numbers of turns in the HPT processing...|$|R

5|$|Washington countered Trotter's attacks with {{a variety}} of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, {{including}} at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others. Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice. As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1965, the United States Government {{launched}} Operation Rolling Thunder, a major bombing campaign, {{with several}} objectives. Firstly, {{the operation was}} supposed to retaliate against North Vietnam for their military activities inside South Vietnam, thereby raising {{the morale of the}} South Vietnamese people, especially the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Secondly, it aimed to impede North Vietnam’s ability to wage war by reducing, if not stopping, the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Thirdly, the overall objective was to persuade the North Vietnamese Government to find a compromise through negotiations. Originally the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a list of 94 targets to be hit over a period of 16 days, but U.S. President Lyndon Johnson decided to include military targets in order to gradually <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> on the North Vietnamese Government, so the list of targets grew to 427 {{by the end of the}} campaign. In the first phase of the operation, which lasted from spring to summer of 1965, American airpower mainly targeted the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi and its limited industrial base.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the live}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Buck Quartermaine defeated The Brooklyn Brawler {{in a dark}} match. In the first televised match, Razor Ramon defended his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jeff Jarrett, who was accompanied by The Roadie. Ramon used his strength to dominate {{the opening of the}} match. Jarrett gained the momentum with a series of dropkicks and then choked Ramon with a sleeper hold. Ramon ran at Jarrett but was thrown over the top rope. He hit his knee when he landed, and The Roadie then hit Ramon from behind in the knee. Ramon was unable to return to the ring, so Jarrett was awarded the match via countout. Because the championship cannot change hands on a countout, Jarrett challenged Ramon to continue the match. Ramon agreed and nearly pinned Jarrett twice. Jarrett applied the figure four leglock to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> to Ramon's injured knee. Ramon escaped the hold and attempted to perform the Razor's Edge. He collapsed under Jarrett's weight, however, and Jarrett pinned him to win the title.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the proposed site mounted, even after the Ancient Monuments Board's approval, and the YAYAS continued to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure,</b> calling another public meeting—which it scheduled for 3 May 1923—forcing the war memorial committee to reconsider. The committee revisited a site on Leeman Road, outside the city walls, which had originally been proposed in 1921. Lutyens sent his assistant Albert J Thomas (an architect in his own right) to examine the site on 8 August 1923 and all parties agreed to it. By coincidence, the site was owned by the NER, which donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between {{the company and the}} city, the NER having recently been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway. Lutyens submitted a revised design to account for the new location—a War Cross and a Stone of Remembrance—which would have cost almost £2,500. The scheme was scaled back to just the cross and the council undertook to conduct the work using its own staff in order to keep within the £1,100 that had been raised by public subscription.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWF Championship, as Bret Hart defended the title against Razor Ramon. Ramon got the early {{advantage}} by punching Hart repeatedly but accidentally hit his knee against a turnbuckle while running at Hart. Hart applied a figure-four leglock to <b>apply</b> <b>pressure</b> to Ramon's knee. Ramon escaped the hold and threw Hart against a ring post; he capitalized on this advantage by attacking Hart's back. Ramon threw Hart with a fallaway slam and applied a bear hug. Hart escaped the hold by biting Ramon. He threw Ramon {{out of the ring}} and performed several of his signature moves, including a Russian legsweep and an elbow drop from the second rope. Hart applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, but Ramon grabbed the ropes, which forced the referee to instruct Hart to break the hold. Hart threw Ramon with a belly-to-back suplex, but Ramon responded by attempting to perform the Razor's Edge, his signature move. Hart reversed this into an unsuccessful pin attempt. With both men exhausted, Hart applied the Sharpshooter and won the match by forcing Ramon to submit.|$|E
