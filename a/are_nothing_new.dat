2500|$|Born to Run {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics. In a rave review for Rolling Stone magazine, Greil Marcus wrote that Springsteen enhances romanticized American themes with his majestic sound, ideal style {{of rock and}} roll, evocative lyrics, and an impassioned delivery that defines what is a [...] "magnificent" [...] album: [...] "It is the drama that counts; the stories Springsteen is telling <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>new,</b> though {{no one has ever}} told them better or made them matter more." [...] John Rockwell, writing in The New York Times, said that the [...] "solidly rock 'n' roll" [...] album is more diverse than Springsteen's previous albums, while his detailed lyrics retain a universal quality that transcends the sources and myths he drew upon. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that he condenses a significant amount of American myth into songs, mostly centered on taking a lover for a joyride, and often succeeds in spite of his tendency for histrionics and [...] "pseudotragic beautiful loser fatalism": [...] "Springsteen may well turn {{out to be one of}} those rare self-conscious primitives who get away with it." [...] Langdon Winner was less enthusiastic in his review for The Real Paper and argued that, because Springsteen consciously adheres to traditions and standards extolled in rock criticism, Born to Run is [...] "the complete monument to rock and roll orthodoxy".|$|E
