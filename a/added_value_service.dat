Consumers’ tendency to value losses higher than gains works against electric vehicles when comparing them to traditional solutions.

In {{the frame of the}} Green eMotion FP 7 project, <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>services</b> will be proposed and their implementation in backend systems studied, in order to permit a widespread and sustainable {{deployment of}} EVs. Services and functionalities are delimited by business models defining the overall stakeholder relationship framework. Therefore, the latter will have direct influence, not only at economical level but also in technical aspects of the implementation of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>services.</b> EV services are classified in two main groups: those provided by the EVs to the network and those provided by service providers to end-users. EVs characteristics make them especially suitable for service oriented business, while ICT solutions appear as key enablers of new sustainable mobility concepts. It is very important to decide which services and how these services need to be implemented to allow a wide range of business models to be applied. Interoperability is another essential aspect when dealing with EVs, since all systems involved in service provision should be able to communicate with each other. This will allow EV users to have transparent and efficient driving experiences, together with lower cost solutions. New advances in communication standards definition and in interoperability assessment (COTEVOS FP 7 EU project) are currently going on and will tackle this challenge. EC FP...|$|R

Service Markets, to be practically realized require an enabling infrastructure that supports business-to-business (B 2 B) relationships among business stakehoders, resulting in value chains. B 2 B workflow interoperation across Virtual Organisations (VOs) brings about novel business scenarios. In these scenarios, parts of workflows corresponding to different partners can be aggregated in a producer-consumer manner, leading to hierarchical structures of <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> <b>Service</b> Level Agreements (SLAs), which are contracts between service providers and service con- sumers, guarantee the expected quality of service (QoS) to different stakehold-holders at various levels along this hierarchy.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{entitled}} “Decision Support Systems for Participatory Flood Risk and Disaster Management” {{purports to}} critically review the existing knowledge {{and to identify}} and propose innovative solutions towards improving situational awareness for better supporting decisions for flood risk and disaster management. The thesis is consisted of two theoretical and two empirical studies. The first theoretical study (chapter 2) includes a literature review on multi-layered water safety and a theoretical systematization of this integrated flood risk management approach in a thorough, multidisciplinary and collaborative methodology for complex problems solving inspired by geodesign towards improving situational awareness, cooperation and decision making. The second theoretical study (chapter 4) through an extensive literature survey across disciplines explores the contribution of a common operational picture in improving situational awareness for emergency response operations. The first empirical study (chapter 3) investigates the information potential of virtual 3 D city models and it exploits their capabilities by developing a virtual 3 D city model for Heerhugowaard case study area in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it conceptualizes a 3 D information system based on virtual 3 D city models and extended by open international data standards towards defining a system framework capable to support situational awareness for effective flood risk management and emergency preparedness. Finally, the second empirical study (chapter 5) organizes a field exercise with realistic flood scenarios and the participation of professionals for measuring the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>service</b> of network centric support tools in achieving shared situational awareness based on a common operational picture for flood emergency response...|$|E

This knowledge sharing of other people’s experience is perceived as more neutral and trustworthy and help to reduce tourist’s perceived risk. However, the deployment of tourist knowledge sharing through the Internet {{has yet to be}} measured. This paper presents the result of a study conducted to determine whether the perception of trust, risk and sharing {{have an effect on the}} sharing of information at the tourism website. The study was conducted, using the tourism website, www. virtualtour. com which has 400, 000 members.

A survey was then conducted by sending questionnaires via personal e-mails to 1131 members and a total 262 completed questionnaires were returned and used in the analysis. The result yield preliminary evidence that perception of trust and perceived sharing resulted in positive behavioural intention of sharing. In addition, this research also produced preliminary evidence that perceived risk resulted in a negative behavioural intention of sharing. This research also contributed to the much needed measurement of users acceptance of knowledge management systems in e-commerce applications.

In this paper we will focus on a typical service system inside of which, in every moment, management struggles in order to reach that balance, because of the extremely dynamic behavior of the entire system: a Call Center. Our aim is to show that an efficient management of the customers abandonment and the quality of service offered to customers, can positively impact on a correct resource leveling in the system, which may otherwise be found by means of typical Operations Research or Queuing Theory methods. In particular, we want to show that this can be more easily inferred and understood by resorting to simulation. After introducing some preliminary aspects by means of Queuing Theory (Erlang’s formula), we’ll first study the problem of customer abandonment (balking and reneging) by simulating a Call Center simple model by means of a process-oriented discrete-time simulation tool (Arena), and then explore a more complex model taking into account customer satisfaction an the quality of the service offered approaching the modelling process of the system by means of System Dynamics. Results show that the level of resources can be further reduced, and that the customer (often thought as an entity external to the system) plays instead an important role on the performance of the whole system, both operationally and economicall...|$|E
40|$|Aims: This {{project is}} looking at the {{development}} and application of the novel tool (International–Medicines-Use-Review-Health-Technology-Assessment; International-MUR HTA) in community practice {{that for the first time}} is able to meet better asthma control and secure <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>service</b> in asthma management. More specifically it allows to: evaluate the quality of care delivered in terms of economic impact (for patient-provider-society), health outcomes and patient benefits; collect real-world evidence and evaluate longterm effect of care; provide different stakeholders with evidence-based information that would help formulate health policies in community practice that are safe, effective, patient-focused and cost-effective, balancing access to innovation and cost containment. Crucially, the tool can also support the delivery of a cost-effective and cost-saving intervention for asthma patients based on the success of the Italian-Medicines-Use-Review (I-MUR) trial [1]. Methods: Evidence from the Italian-Medicine-Use-Review (I-MUR) trial showed that the I-MUR intervention provided by the community pharmacists in asthma is effective, cost-saving and cost-effective. 1 The trial allowed to model a novel framework (International-MUR-HTA) that would enable to routinely deliver the intervention, but also collect and analyse patient relevant data on its clinical-effectiveness, quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness. I-MUR-HTA was discussed within three expert-panel discussions including policy-makers, commissioners, academics, healthcare-professionals and patientrepresentatives in Italy, 2 UK 3 and Brussels/Europe. 4 The current plan includes testing the use of the tool in RW environment across European regions. Results: Evidence collected from the expert discussions confirmed that International-MUR-HTA information is relevant to meet current NICE target for cost-effective service delivery and this is what is needed to support the evaluation of innovative effective and cost-effective health policies and promote their implementation across nations. Its implementation is underway and real-world pilots are planned to take place in different European regions. Conclusion: the International-MUR-HTA appears to be an innovative tool to promote active patient involvement into policy-decision-making and community service implementation...|$|E
40|$|V zadnjem desetletju se je televizijski trg v Španiji bistveno spremenil, vendar pa je televizija ostala najbolj priljubljen medij med oglaševalci, saj dosega skoraj 98 odstotkov gospodinjstev. Kot kažejo podatki za ZDA, se z dostopom do interaktivne digitalne televizije uporaba televizijskega medija šepovečuje. Vendar pa je v Španiji v letu 2001 od 18 odstotkov oglaševalskega denarja, namenjenega televizijskemu mediju, digitalna televizija prejela manj kot 1, 7 odstotka. Kaj je razlog, da se interes oglaševalcev za digitalno televizijo ni povečeval skladno s povečevanjem števila gledalcev? Prihod večkanalne digitalne televizije leta 1997 zahteva vnovični premislek o oglaševanju v mediju, kjer uporabnik plačuje dostop do vsebin: oglaševanje mora postati storitev z dodano vrednostjo za gledalca. Članek proučuje odgovore oglaševalcev in drugih medijskih akterjev na prihod digitalne televizije, razloge za njihovo zadržanost in ovire za večjo prisotnost oglaševanja v digitalni televiziji. Over {{the last}} decade, the Spanish {{television}} market has radically changed, buttelevision has never ceased being a favourite medium for advertisers, {{not only because}} of its potential to communicate emotions with a unique touch but above all because it reaches 98 per cent of Spanish households. In recent years, consumption of television has increased in Spain, now on the digital threshold, and there is already evidence from the US that households with access to fully interactive digital television increase their overall consumption of the medium. And yet, Infoadex data on advertising spend in Spain during 2001 indicates that out of the 18 % of the total media investment received by television, less than 1. 7 % of that was spent on digital television. This raises an important question: why does advertiser interest indigital television not grow at the same pace as audience acceptance of the new technology? The arrival of digital multichannel television in 1997 means we must reconsider the concept of advertising in a medium in which the user pays for access to content. Advertising must now focus on becoming an <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>service</b> for the viewer, augmenting programme content.
