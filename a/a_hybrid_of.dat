5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, {{a cross between}} a male donkey and a female horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is {{a cross between a}} male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican folk music is <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> African and European elements. The quadrille is an {{important}} symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied {{by a kind of}} ensemble called a jing ping band. In addition, Dominica's folk tradition includes folk songs called bélé, traditional storytelling called kont, masquerade, children's and work songs, and Carnival music.|$|E
5|$|Metalcore, <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> extreme {{metal and}} {{hardcore}} punk, {{emerged as a}} commercial force in the mid-2000s decade. Through the 1980s and 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon; pioneering bands include Earth Crisis, other prominent bands include Converge, Hatebreed and Shai Hulud. By 2004, melodic metalcore—influenced as well by melodic death metal—was popular enough that Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache and Shadows Fall's The War Within debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the Billboard album chart.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (<b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov's {{economic}} reform plan was <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> Leonid Abalkin's and one created by himself {{in conjunction with}} the Maslyukov chaired State Planning Committee along with several other government institutions. On 5 July 1989 the State Commission of the Council of Ministers on Economic Reforms was established, which replaced Maslyukov's reform commission. The new commission was chaired by Abalkin, who had also been appointed Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.|$|E
5|$|Sandown Castle was a Device Fort {{built at}} Sandown on the Isle of Wight by Henry VIII in 1545 {{to protect against}} the threat of French attack. Constructed from stone with angular bastions, its design was <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> Italian {{military}} architectural thinking with traditional English military design. The site was raided by a French force that summer while the fortification was still being constructed. The site suffered from coastal erosion and the castle was demolished in 1631.|$|E

5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} {{for the first}} time in five years for the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). Berg notes that it worked as <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's {{spinster}} persona, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. The shows were positively received.|$|E
5|$|A popular snack in Kalimpong is the momo, steamed dumplings {{made up of}} pork, beef or {{vegetable}} cooked in a wrapping of flour and served with watery soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged Nepalese snack made of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from yak's or chauri's (<b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> yak and cattle) milk, is sometimes chewed. A form of noodle called Thukpa, served in soup form is popular in Kalimpong. There are {{a large number of}} restaurants which offer a wide variety of cuisines, ranging from Indian to continental, to cater to the tourists. Tea is the most popular beverage in Kalimpong, procured from the famed Darjeeling tea gardens. Kalimpong has a golf course besides Kalimpong Circuit House.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron. In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence went on {{to build}} a series of ever larger and more {{expensive}} cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition {{to the use of}} the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which came to be called Y-12. The process was inefficient, but it worked.|$|E
