5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic <b>actuator</b> reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E

Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release <b>actuator</b> was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown, and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E

40|$|Polypyrrole/gold (PPy/Au) bilayer <b>actuators</b> {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications, from microrobotics to drug delivery. In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} that the operation efficiency of PPy/Au bilayer <b>actuators</b> is influenced by the actuators' geometry. During actuation, the outer edges of the <b>actuators</b> detached first and the subsequent release progressed toward the center of the <b>actuators.</b> Rectangular-, circular-, and trapezoidal-shaped <b>actuators</b> were fabricated, and for a given area, <b>actuators</b> with a larger perimeter exhibited faster release than <b>actuators</b> with a smaller perimeter.

40|$|Three {{types of}} <b>actuators,</b> i. e., {{oscillating}} walls, Lorentz force <b>actuators</b> and DBD plasma <b>actuators,</b> {{were used to}} actively control turbulent boundary layer for the turbulent skin-friction drag reduction with Direct Numerical Simulations. The main object is to understand drag reduction mechanism in simple spanwise wall oscillation case (Jung et al., 1992), then implement the control using more practical Lorentz force <b>actuators</b> and plasma <b>actuators.</b> A large amount of 40 ± 2 %, 30 ± 2 % and 20 ± 2 % drag reduction was observed at Rer = 200 turbulent channel for oscillating walls, Lorentz force <b>actuators</b> and plasma <b>actuators,</b> respectively. Different configurations for Lorentz force and plasma <b>actuators</b> were intensively studied, with a new configuration proposed for DBD plasma <b>actuators.</b> The present study suggests a good prospective of skin-friction drag reduction by using Lorentz force <b>actuators</b> for ocean transportation, and DBD plasma <b>actuators</b> for land and air transportation. However, no net energy saving was obtained for both <b>actuators</b> considering the fluid power required for flow control, and this situation was even worse if the electric efficiency of the <b>actuators</b> was accounted for. For all three types of <b>actuators,</b> {{the interaction between the}} <b>actuators</b> and the near wall turbulent structure is presented using ensemble averaged method. DNS control cases were also performed at moderate Reynolds numbers, i. e, Rer = 800 and 1600, to understand the role of recently discovered very large scale motions (VLSMs). The result suggests that the control of the VLSMs in the outer region is necessary for maximising drag reduction at high Reynolds number turbulent flow...|$|R
5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, {{a booster}} propelled the missile {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target.

5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an <b>actuator</b> only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an <b>actuator</b> that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E

25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the <b>actuator.</b> If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the <b>actuator,</b> then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the <b>actuator</b> regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E
