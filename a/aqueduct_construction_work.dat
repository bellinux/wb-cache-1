5000|$|While the arches of the {{aqueduct}} {{are often}} confused as being {{those of an}} ancient Roman <b>aqueduct,</b> <b>construction</b> of the <b>aqueduct</b> was begun in 1823 by the architect Lorenzo Nottolini, {{under the rule of}} Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca, and continued until 1851. In the slopes of Monte di Vorno, a number of springs were conveyed through rocky channels to a domed circular stone temple-cistern (...) located near San Quirico in the frazione of Guamo.|$|R
5000|$|These early {{problems}} with the <b>aqueduct's</b> <b>construction,</b> were portents of future problems. Sometime during 1533, the work done by Lourenço Domingues (the receiver for the public works in Elvas, Campo Maior and Olivença) must have been unsatisfactory, for he was discharged on 9 September. Following various diversions of water, the post of Visitador do Cano (Seer of Pipe) was established in 1542. A year later, Diogo Mendes {{was responsible for the}} maintenance of the aqueduct, receiving 6000 reais, paid by the town. But, by 1547, the construction was suspended {{due to a lack of}} funds, but were re-initiated in 1571. But, on 20 March 1558, Queen D. Catherine recommended that the town work on the aqueduct. King D. Sebastian later authorized the application of a levy on the residents of Elvas, considered equivalent to each's income. Later that year, on 23 August, Sebastian personally inspected the aqueduct and finding the works incomplete, he ordered the Senate (on 29 May 1573) to correct the remaining sections, along with Afonso Álvares. The King's successor would have similar {{problems with}} this project; in 1579, Cardinal King Henrique solicited the bishops of Elvas to participate monetarily in the <b>aqueduct's</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|R

(Initially the system provided water to the city from the Little Falls Branch in Maryland, until the <b>aqueduct</b> <b>construction</b> was completed.) Regular water service from the Potomac River source through the aqueduct commenced in 1864.|$|R

25|$|That he {{must have}} been well practised in {{surveying}} is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or chorobates, which he compares favourably with the groma, a device using plumb lines.

He also developed one of the first odometers, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.|$|R
