5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Jeuxvideo.com had high {{praise for the}} level design, graphics, and animations.

5|$|She was {{eventually}} revealed as a hoax. A young man, his advances rebuffed by a woman, {{had started the}} story {{as a means of}} revenge.

50|$|To spite is to {{intentionally}} <b>annoy,</b> hurt, or upset. Spiteful {{words or}} actions are delivered {{in such a}} way that it is clear that the person is delivering them just to <b>annoy,</b> hurt, or upset. When the intent to <b>annoy,</b> hurt, or upset is shown subtly, behavior is considered catty.|$|R

5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} the <b>annoying</b> bishop check on b4, the also <b>annoying</b> knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to {{undermine}} Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? {{to be the best}} answer, one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the other lines, can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E

5|$|Elements of {{the game}} were criticized. Sullivan found some side {{missions}} repetitive, and Sliwinski was disappointed {{with some of the}} boss battles. Miller wrote that some Shadow of Mordor features are too complex and inaccessible for new players or those unwilling to use strategy. Critics disagreed about the Nemesis system. Miller wrote that the system fell flat in the game's final hours; according to VanOrd, the system was unappealing until the game's second half. Carter found the unskippable cutscenes after a player died <b>annoying.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. We won't {{interfere}} with you. But {{you can tell}} me later," [...] she said, rather hastily, and then started off in the direction of Russell Square.

6000|$|CRAVEN. This is most infernally perplexing. I can't {{believe that}} you insulted Julia, Charteris. I've no doubt you <b>annoyed</b> her--you'd <b>annoy</b> anybody; upon my soul you would--but insult!--now {{what do you mean}} by that? ...|$|R

5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be <b>annoying</b> and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E
5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be <b>annoying</b> and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E

5|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito.

While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, they found the leveling system <b>annoying,</b> the combat controls difficult and frustrating, and the story trite.|$|E
